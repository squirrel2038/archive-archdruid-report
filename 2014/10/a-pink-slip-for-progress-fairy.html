<div class=MsoNormal>
If you’ve ever wondered just how powerfully collective thinking grips most members of our species—including, by and large, those who most forcefully insist on the originality of their thinking—I have an experiment to recommend: go out in public and advocate an idea about the future that isn’t part of the conventional wisdom, and see what kind of reaction you field. If your experience is anything like mine, you’ll get some anger, some argument, and some blank stares, but the most telling reaction will come from people who try to force what you’re saying into the Procrustean bed of the conventional wisdom, no matter how thoroughly they have to stretch and chop what you’ve said to make it fit. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course the project of this blog is guaranteed to field such reactions, since the ideas explored here don’t just ignore the conventional wisdom, they fling it to the floor and dance on the crumpled remains. When I mention that I expect the decline and fall of industrial civilization to take centuries, accordingly, people take this to mean that I expect a smooth, untroubled descent. When I mention that I expect crisis before this decade is finished, in turn, people take this to mean that I expect industrial civilization to crash into ruin in the next few years. Some people, for that matter, slam back and forth from one of these presuppositions to another, as though they can’t fit the concepts of prolonged decline and imminent crisis into their heads at the same moment. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That sort of response has become more common than usual in recent months, and part of the reason may be that it’s been a while since I’ve sketched out the overall shape of the future as I see it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some of my readers may have lost track of the broader picture, and more recent readers of this blog may not have encountered that picture at all. For that reason among others, I’m going to spend this week’s post summarizing the the decline and fall of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>industrial civilization. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yes, I’m aware that many people believe that such a thing can’t happen:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>that science, technology, or some other factor has made progress irreversible. I’m also aware that many people insist that progress may not be irreversible yet but will be if we all just do that little bit more. These are—well, let’s be charitable and call them faith-based claims. Generalizing from a sample size of one when the experiment hasn’t yet run its course is poor scientific procedure; insisting that just this once, the law of diminishing returns will be suspended for our benefit is the antithesis of science. It amounts to treating progress as some sort of beneficent fairy who can be counted on to tap us with her magic wand and give us a wonderful future, just because we happen to want one. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The overfamiliar cry of “but it’s different this time!” is popular, it’s comforting, but it’s also irrelevant. Of course it’s different this time; it was different every other time, too. Neolithic civilizations limited to one river valley and continental empires with complex technologies have all declined and fallen in much the same way and for much the same reasons. It may appeal to our sense of entitlement to see ourselves as destiny’s darlings, to insist that the Progress Fairy has promised us a glorious future out there among the stars, or even to claim that it’s humanity’s mission to populate the galaxy, but these are another set of faith-based claims; it’s a little startling, in fact, to watch so many people who claim to have outgrown theology clinging to such overtly religious concepts as humanity’s mission and destiny. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the real world, when civilizations exhaust their resource bases and wreck the ecological cycles that support them, they fall. It takes between one and three centuries on average for the fall to happen—and no, big complex civilizations don’t fall noticeably faster or slower than smaller and simpler ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nor is it a linear decline—the end of a civilization is a fractal process composed of crises on many different scales of space and time, with equally uneven consequences. An effective response can win a breathing space; in the wake of a less effective one, part of what used to be normal goes away for good. Sooner or later, one crisis too many overwhelms the last defenses, and the civilization falls, leaving scattered remnants of itself that struggle and gleam for a while until the long night closes in. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The historian Arnold Toynbee, whose study of the rise and fall of civilizations is the most detailed and cogent for our purpose, has traced a recurring rhythm in this process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Falling civilizations oscillate between periods of intense crisis and periods of relative calm, each such period lasting anywhere from a few decades to a century or more—the pace is set by the speed of the underlying decline, which varies somewhat from case to case. Most civilizations, he found, go through three and a half cycles of crisis and stabilization—the half being, of course, the final crisis from which there is no recovery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s basically the model that I’m applying to our future. One wrinkle many people miss is that we’re not waiting for the first of the three and a half rounds of crisis and recovery to hit; we’re waiting for the second. The first began in 1914 and ended around 1954, driven by the downfall of the British Empire and the collapse of European domination of the globe. During the forty years between Sarajevo and Dien Bien Phu, the industrial world was hammered by the First World War, the Spanish Flu pandemic, the Great Depression, millions of political murders by the Nazi and Soviet governments, the Second World War, and the overthrow of European colonial empires around the planet. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was the first era of crisis in the decline and fall of industrial civilization. The period from 1945 to the present was the first interval of stability and recovery, made more prosperous and expansive than most examples of the species by the breakneck exploitation of petroleum and other fossil fuels, and a corresponding boom in technology. At this point, as fossil fuel reserves deplete, the planet’s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants runs up against hard limits, and a galaxy of other measures of impending crisis move toward the red line, it’s likely that the next round of crisis is not far off. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What will actually trigger that next round, though, is anyone’s guess. In the years leading up to 1914, plenty of people sensed that an explosion was coming, some guessed that a general European war would set it off, but nobody knew that the trigger would be the assassination of an Austrian archduke on the streets of Sarajevo. The Russian Revolution, the March on Rome, the crash of ‘29, Stalin, Hitler, Pearl Harbor, Auschwitz, Hiroshima? No one saw those coming, and only a few people even guessed that something resembling one or another of these things might be in the offing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus trying to foresee the future of industrial society in detail is an impossible task. Sketching out the sort of future that we could get is considerably less challenging. History has plenty to say about the things that happen when a civilization begins its long descent into chaos and barbarism, and it’s not too difficult to generalize from that evidence. I don’t claim that the events outlined below are what will happen, but I expect things like them to happen; further than that, the lessons of history will not go. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With those cautions, here’s a narrative sketch of the kind of future that waits for us. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
*************************</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second wave of crisis began with the Ebola pandemic, which emerged in West Africa early in 2014. Efforts to control the outbreak in its early phases were ineffective and hopelessly underfunded. By the early months of 2015, the first cases appeared in India, Egypt, and the Caribbean, and from there the pandemic spread to much of the world. In August 2015 a vaccine passed its clinical trials, but scaling up production and distribution of the vaccine to get in front of a fast-spreading pandemic took time, and it was early 2018 before the pandemic was finally under control everywhere in the world. By then 1.6 billion people had died of the disease, and another 210 million had died as a result of the collapse of food distribution and health care across large areas of the Third World. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The struggle against Ebola was complicated by the global economic depression that got under way in 2015 as the “fracking” boom imploded and travel and tourist industries collapsed in the face of the pandemic. Financial markets were stabilized by vast infusions of government debt, as they had been in the wake of the 2008 crash, but the real economy of goods and services was not so easily manipulated; joblessness soared, tax revenues plunged, and a dozen nations defaulted on their debts. Politicians insisted, as they had done for the past decade, that giving more handouts to the rich would restore prosperity; their failure to take any constructive action set the stage for the next act in the tragedy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first neofascist parties were founded in Europe before the end of the pandemic, and grew rapidly in the depression years. In 2020 and 2021, neofascists took power in three European nations on anti-immigration, anti-EU and anti-banking industry platforms; their success emboldened similar efforts elsewhere. Even so, the emergence of the neofascist American Peoples Party as a major force in the 2024 US elections stunned most observers. Four years later the APP swept the elections, and forced through laws that turned Congress into an advisory body and enabled rule by presidential decree. Meanwhile, as more European nations embraced neofascism, Europe split into hostile blocs, leading to the dissolution of the European Union in 2032 and the European War of 2035-2041. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By the time war broke out in Europe, the popularity of the APP had fallen drastically due to ongoing economic troubles, and insurgencies against the new regime had emerged in the South and mountain West.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Counterinsurgency efforts proved no more effective than they had in Iraq or Afghanistan, and over the next decade much of the US sank into failed-state conditions. In 2046, after the regime used tactical nuclear weapons on three rebel-held cities, a dissident faction of the US military launched a nuclear strike on Washington DC, terminating the APP regime. Attempts to establish a new federal government failed over the next two years, and the former United States broke into seven nations. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Outside Europe and North America, changes were less dramatic, with the Iranian civil war of 2027-2034 and the Sino-Japanese war of 2033-2035 among the major incidents. Most of the Third World was prostrate in the wake of the Ebola pandemic, and world population continued to decline gradually as the economic crisis took its toll and the long-term effects of the pandemic played out. By 2048 roughly fifteen per cent of the world’s people lived in areas no longer governed by a nation-state. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The years from 2048 to 2089 were an era of relative peace under Chinese global hegemony. The chaos of the crisis years eliminated a great many wasteful habits, such as private automobiles and widespread air travel, and renewable resources padded out with what was left of the world’s fossil fuel production were able to meet the reduced needs of a smaller and less extravagant global population. Sea levels had begun rising steadily during the crisis years; ironically, the need to relocate ports and coastal cities minimized unemployment in the 2050s and 2060s, bringing relative prosperity to the laboring classes. High and rising energy prices spurred deautomation of many industries, with similar effects.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The pace of climate change accelerated, however, as carbon dioxide from the reckless fossil fuel use of the crisis years had its inevitable effect, pushing the polar ice sheets toward collapse and making harvests unpredictable around the globe. Drought gripped the American Southwest, forcing most of the region’s population to move and turning the region into a de facto stateless zone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The same process destabilized much of the Middle East and south Asia, laying the groundwork for renewed crisis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Population levels stabilized in the 2050s and 2060s and began to contract again thereafter. The primary culprit was once again disease, this time from a gamut of pathogens. The expansion of tropical diseases into formerly temperate regions, the spread of antibiotic resistance to effectively all bacterial pathogens, and the immense damage to public health infrastructure during the crisis years all played a part in that shift. The first migrations of climate refugees also helped spread disease and disruption. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The last decade before 2089 was a time of renewed troubles, with political tensions pitting China and its primary allies, Australia and Canada, against the rising power of the South American Union (formed by 2067’s Treaty of Montevideo between Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay), and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>insurgencies in eastern Europe that set the stage for the Second European War. Economic troubles driven by repeated crop failures in North America and China added to the strains, and kept anyone but scientists from noticing what was happening to the Greenland ice sheet until it was too late. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The collapse of the Greenland ice sheet, which began in earnest in the summer of 2089, delivered a body blow to an already fraying civilization. Meltwater pouring into the North Atlantic shut down the thermohaline circulation, the main driver of the world’s ocean currents, unleashing drastic swings in weather across most of the world’s climate zones, while sea levels jolted upwards. As these trends worsened, climate refugees fled drought, flood, or famine in any direction that promised survival—a promise that in most cases would not be kept. Those nations that opened their borders collapsed under the influx of millions of starving migrants; those who tried to close their borders found themselves at war with entire peoples on the move, in many cases armed with the weapons of pre-crisis armies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The full impact of the Greenland disaster took time to build, but the initial shock to weather patterns was enough to help trigger the Second European War of 2091-2111. The Twenty Years War, as it was called, pitted most of the nations of Europe against each other in what began as a struggle for mastery and devolved into a struggle for survival. As the fighting dragged on, mercenaries from the Middle East and Africa made up an ever larger fraction of the combatants. The final defeat of the Franco-Swedish alliance in 2111, though it ended the war, left Europe a shattered wreck unable to stem the human tide from the devastated regions further south and east. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Elsewhere, migration and catastrophic climate change brought down most of the nations of North America, while China dissolved in civil war. Australia and the South American Union both unexpectedly benefited as rainfall increased over their territory; both nations survived the first wave of troubles more or less intact, only to face repeated invasions by armed migrants in the following decades. Neither quite succumbed, but most of their resources went into the fight for survival. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Historians attempting to trace the course of events in most of the world are hampered by sparse and fragmentary records, as not only nation-states and their institutions but even basic literacy evaporated in many regions. As long as the migrations continued, settled life was impossible anywhere close to the major corridors of population movement; elsewhere, locals and migrants worked or fought their way to a modus vivendi, or failing that, exterminated one another. Violence, famine and disease added their toll and drove the population of the planet below two billion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By the 2160s, though, the mass migrations were mostly at an end, and relative stability returned to many parts of the planet. In the aftermath, the South American Union became the world’s dominant power, though its international reach was limited to a modest blue-water navy patrolling the sea lanes and a network of alliances with the dozen or so functioning nation-states that still existed. Critical shortages of nonrenewable resources made salvage one of the few growth industries of the era; an enterprising salvage merchant who knew how to barter with the villagers and nomads of the stateless zones for scrap technology from abandoned cities could become rich in a single voyage. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Important as they were, these salvaged technologies were only accessible to the few.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Union and a few other nation-states still kept some aging military aircraft operational, but maritime traffic once again was carried by tall ships, and horse-drawn wagons became a standard mode of transport on land away from the railroads. Radio communication had long since taken over from the last fitful fragments of the internet, and electric grids were found only in cities. As for the high-end technologies of a century and a half before, few people even remembered that they had ever existed at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the end, though, the era of Union supremacy was little more than a breathing space, made possible only by the collapse of collective life in the stateless zones. As these began to recover from the era of migrations, and control over salvage passed into the hands of local warlords, the frail economies of the nation-states suffered. Rivalry over access to salvage sites still available for exploitation led to rising tensions between the Union and Australia, and thus to the last act of the tragedy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This was set in motion by the Pacific War between the Union and Australia, which broke out in 2238 and shredded the economies of both nations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After the disastrous Battle of Tahiti in 2241, the Union navy’s power to keep sea lanes open and free of piracy was a thing of the past. Maritime trade collapsed, throwing each region onto its own limited resources and destabilizing those parts of the stateless zones that had become dependent on the salvage industry. Even those nations that retained the social forms of the industrial era transformed themselves into agrarian societies where all economics was local and all technology handmade. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The negotiated peace of 2244 brought only the briefest respite: a fatally weakened Australia was overrun by Malik Ibrahim’s armies after the Battle of Darwin in 2251, and the Union fragmented in the wake of the coup of 2268 and the civil war that followed. Both nations had become too dependent on the salvaged technologies of an earlier day; the future belonged to newborn successor cultures in various corners of the world, whose blacksmiths learned how to hammer the scrap metal of ruined cities into firearms, wind turbines, fuel-alcohol stills, and engines to power handbuilt ultralight aircraft. The Earth’s first global civilization had given way to its first global dark age, and nearly four centuries would pass before new societies would be stable enough to support the amenities of civilization. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
*************************</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I probably need to repeat that this is the kind of future I expect, not the specific future I foresee; the details are illustrative, not predictive. Whether the Ebola epidemic spins out of control or not, whether the United States undergoes a fascist takeover or runs headlong into some other disaster, whether China or some other nation becomes the stabilizing hegemon in the next period of relative peace—all these are anyone’s guess. All I’m suggesting is that events like the ones I’ve outlined are likely to occur as industrial civilization stumbles down the curve of decline and fall. </div>
<br> In the real world, in the course of ordinary history, these things happen. So does the decline and fall of civilizations that deplete their resource bases and wreck the ecological cycles that support them. As I noted above, I’m aware that true believers in progress insist that this can’t happen to us, but a growing number of people have noticed that the Progress Fairy got her pink slip some time ago, and ordinary history has taken her place as the arbiter of human affairs. That being the case, getting used to what ordinary history brings may be a highly useful habit to cultivate just now. </div>

Four days ago he seemed fine, two days ago he was sick, now he's gone.

I find JMG's predictions completely, terrifyingly plausible- just ordinary history, just as all critters eventually return to the earth. But when you put a date on the beginnings of things- tracing the Ebola epidemic changing into a pandemic as soon as January 2015, and on from there- it seems impossibly close. I want to say, nah, someday, but not yet, not now. Though of course the first round has already happened, just as poor Fred probably had something brewing inside when I bought his Friskies last week.

It is indeed difficult to break the mental shackles that want to insist on an either-or instead of both-and (to use Robert A. Wilson’s favorite way of expressing it). I was one of those who asked the pointed question about timelines in last week’s comments and looking back on our exchange I see the rather simple process you propose escaped my notice yet again.<br><br>My short term, fight or flight circuits seems to insist on asking what is going to happen NOW and when that is dark and dangerous the sirens wail and the lights go off and everything else gets masticated into simple categories of black and white.

Your narratives are most welcome. I look forward to <i>Twilight’s Last Gleaming</i> with relish. From this understanding of my own contemplations strengths and weaknesses I take hope.

Two weeks ago I gave a talk to about 140 process safety professionals. These are people in the chemical and energy industries who develop and manage programs that minimize the chance of a major safety or environmental event. My theme was “Process Safety in an Age of Limits”.<br><br>Like you, I used historical analogies to support my forecasts as to what changes may happen to the process industries in coming years. One of my themes that the concept of “Safety as a Value” is actually quite recent (one aspect of your Faith in Progress); it is, in my opinion, a cultural artifact that developed in the early 19th century at a time when society was generating a surplus of industrial products and could afford to pay attention to all kinds of new activities, including worker safety.<br><br>As you might expect, I expected the reaction of the audience to be either indifference or hostility. After all, these are people who have an immense confidence in the ability of new technology to solve problems. That’s their job, and they’re good at it. To my surprise the response was quite positive; the discussion that followed was good-natured and practical, mostly on the lines of, “Where do we go from here?”<br><br>I know you maintain that the issues we face are predicaments, not problems.

It is helpful to illustrate exactly you anticipate when you contrast the doomers and the cornucopians. (For what it's worth, I think this scenario would get you tagged as a "doomer" in most contexts. Granted, there are some doomers who forecast immediate and complete systems failure with complete confidence. These people are fools, if only because predicting the future with certainty is a fool's errand. But I have met many self-identified doomers who do not expect to live to see the worst consequences of our current foolishness, but who are nevertheless struggling with how to live with what they know. I am in that camp myself, and I'm only 42.)<br><br>Are you familiar with the word "groaf"? Perhaps not, since as far as I know it was coined earlier this year. Groaf is simply economic growth which has a negative net cost to society. Whether you believe that all growth is groaf, or that non-groaf growth is possible but uncommon (and unpopular, since it requires investments with long timeframes), it's a useful term to introduce to discussions with the optimistically deluded. I also find that it helps bridge the gaps that tend to appear among different degrees of doomer (which as you have experienced, are often the most vociferous of all disagreements) and focus people on the central issue: the inability of most people to distinguish growth from groaf (which itself is a direct consequence of faith in the religion of progress).<br><br><a href=#c1877695759608384017 title="comment permalink">10/22/14, 5:00 PM</a><br><br>

I kept looking for the bit where the united permaculture guilds restored the whole earth to peace and bounty. Isn't that supposed to happen somewhere along the line? Just kidding. <br><br>But it was interesting to sketch out an illustrative story, and helpful too. I agree about this being the second crisis of the industrial age, and that we have actually just lived through an age of relative calm. As a kid I heard many family stories of misery and chaos from the 1914- 1945 years (and even before 1914 there was plenty of conflict and chaos in Europe: war, depressions, injustice, famines and migrations). But somehow I grew up with a sense that my generation, my time, was going to be different - that the grown-ups had finally figured it all out and that we would surely all live peace and prosperity. <br><br>Where did that sense come from? The optimism of the 60s? The natural optimism of a young adult? Consumer and political marketing? A generation's typical belief that they would avoid the mistakes of their parents? Some of each probably and various other things too. <br><br>But it's interesting to see how quickly and deeply this belief in progress took hold, because the stability of the post WWII years was only relative, with plenty of problems to deal with: the 50s had numerous crises; the 60s had Vietnam and social upheaval; the 70s had oil crises, terrorism and political upheavals. And the cold war ran through it all. There was only a very small number of years, during the 80s and 90s perhaps, when the industrial world really did seem stable. And that meant nothing if you lived in Yugoslavia or Russia or South Africa or Argentina or many other places across the globe. <br><br>Clearly the industrial world has been able to persuade itself that peace, prosperity and progress are the natural order of things. And that belief has gone deep. But it's surprising how deep it has gone, given so much evidence to the contrary even during the golden years of progress.<br><br><a href=#c7036587855775849659 title="comment permalink">10/22/14, 6:28 PM</a><br><br>

Those are the latest and most advanced Russian fighter designs, and according to many aviation experts, outclass the F-35’s that the US and its allies are saddling themselves with by a considerable margin.

What's stopping you?<br><br>One of the things I've come to find fascinating in discussions here and elsewhere about a harsh future, is this idea that if the future's going to be worse than the present, then what's the point of trying to do good?<br><br>What's odd to me about this is the implicit assumption that if you can't fix the world as a whole, you can't do good.<br><br>It's a near-lock certainty that not you, not me, not anyone here is going to do a single thing that will impact the entirety of the world's population. Or a majority of it. Or even a few million people.<br><br>But you, and me, and our esteemed host, and every other reader and commenter is perfectly capable of engaging in actions right at this moment, and throughout the rest of their life, that can make the world a touch better. Similarly, we can engage in actions that will make it worse. And a heck of a lot of the time, we won't be able to accurately figure out ahead of time which way an action is going to affect things.<br><br>But we can absolutely attempt to make the world fairer, and better, and to improve the lives of a very small number of people. People in our lives. Friends and family members and neighbors and so on.<br><br>None of us are going to fix the world. It's going to rumble along it's course, and there's a pretty excellent chance that the immediate future is going to be worse than the present and immediate past. So it goes. But that hardly keeps us from making it a touch less worse, and that work is worthwhile. What the heck else are we going to do?<br><br><em>Our own actions are all we control</em>. So the <em>only</em> response we have is our own response, our own particular actions. So, tomorrow, get to work making the world fairer if that's what you want to see happen. That's all you can do--and that's a beauty, not a condemnation. Embrace it.<br><br><a href=#c1030696786761763035 title="comment permalink">10/22/14, 10:03 PM</a><br><br>

Bendable iPhones (the Sapphire fronts must have failed them, so they went with Gorilla Glass and tried to use U2 to distract the masses) and iPads with shorter battery life (thinner is not always better) may be a blip, or – as I fear with the F-35 – the beginning of the terminal decline of the brand.<br><br>And finally, I'm still recovering from the impossibly rapid decline of four blue jeans I recently bought from Target (two tore in front, three had tears in their back pocket, a third tore on the side after a couple of months, and the remaining one's fraying on the upper leg).

As for the sudden slap of the Cold Wet Mackerel of Reality across the face, yes, it's much the same -- think of what it would have been like for people in the summer of 1914, going from ordinary peacetime to the Great War in 37 days with no warning. <br><br>Tom, it might make an interesting novel; we'll see if anybody offers me an adequate advance. <br><br>Ecologist, yes, it's difficult to break out of the conventional wisdom! The only thing I know of that makes it easier is plenty of history books, which bit by bit communicate the way things actually happen. <br><br>ChemEng, that's excellent news. The more people with their hands actually on the levers of systems start to grasp the shape of the future, the better off we're all likely to be. <br><br>Paul, of course there's a point in trying to make things fairer, so long as you don't delude yourself into thinking that you can achieve Utopia. There are plenty of moments in history when a given society can become more just or less so, more compassionate or less so, more tolerant or less so, and it's usually small groups of committed people who are willing to take action at those moments that decide things one way or the other. What history tells us is that there's no inherent trend toward betterment -- not that we can't make things better if we're willing to put ourselves on the line for that purpose. <br><br>Violet, if you grasp just how harsh things are likely to be, and still see it as a grand adventure, you're well prepared for the future. <br><br>Kutamun, quite a few SF authors have Australia as a Chinese possession in the future -- I'm remembering Cordwainer Smith especially, who imagined Australia in the 25th century or so as Aojou Nambien, one vast Chinese city covering the whole Australian continent...<br><br>Mister R., I expect to see drug legalization and mass pardons as we proceed, for the reason you've indicated -- lack of funds to maintain the prison system. Still, most incarcerated people get out after a few years anyway, you know. <br><br>GreenEngineer, no, I hadn't heard of "groaf." I assume you mean a negative net <i>benefit</i> to society -- a negative net cost would amount to a gain, for the same reason that -(-1) equals 1. <br><br>Kaitain, the American elite classes have always had a huge inferiority complex when it comes to European aristocracy. It would come as no surprise at all to me if they were all saying, "We can <i>too</i> be just as decadent, useless, and self-defeating as the Ancien Regime, so there!" <br><br>Dfr, a comment based on <i>Dune</i> is always welcome here.

I see in the comments some attempts to add a little clarity with terms like groaf and illth, but it's still not nailed down.<br><br>Of course, there are plenty of legitimate doomers out there who really think we're on the cusp of total extinction or a Mad Max world in the next three minutes or so, but I think a fair number of people categorized this way would actually agree with your model quite a bit. What you mean by "collapse" and what they mean by "collapse" can be two very different things, due to the fuzziness of the term. The world financial system falling apart, the death of the dollar, rolling over the downward slope after the peak of total liquids production, the end of growth, pandemics, war and government default are all things that are easily lumped into the category of "collapse."<br><br>Not a big insight, I know, but I just don't want us all to be talking past each other from language limitations. There's a crash, a recession, a depression, hyper/de-flation, and perhaps even an apocalyptic catastrophe on the horizon, all of which might be considered the "collapse" line to others. So perhaps some more precision is in order. <br><br>For instance, we could say that the start of <b>"decline"</b> is the point where US or world economic production trends inexorably downward (perhaps on a per capita basis), in which case we are probably already in decline. <b>"Collapse"</b> could be the point where, for the majority of the US (or world, for world collapse, etc.) can no longer depend on the infrastructure systems that we've become accustomed to. A world where you don't get a "job" because there's no longer such a thing as hiring, but merely getting by on your own; a world where a tornado rips half your town apart, and nobody comes from anywhere to help you, nor do we even expect the govt to; a world where exchanging dollars for euros is the process by which you pick your favorite toilet paper; and so on. The <b>"crash"</b> could be when all the silly games of passing around bits and paper to generate "wealth" (which is so abstracted from reality as to be meaningless) falls apart, and the bubbles pop, and you can make a living only by doing something that actually has value.<br><br>These are just suggestions, but I honestly think some set of definitions offered up by you would be of great benefit. The situation currently reminds me of the ancient Romans attempting to discuss Greek philosophy in Latin - their disciplined, practical language was hopelessly unfit for parsing the various schools of Hellenistic thought. So they stole a chunk of the Greek language outright and added two new declensions. <br><br>I don't know of any Greek we can steal from for this topic, but we need something.<br><br><a href=#c7027288990614219008 title="comment permalink">10/22/14, 10:49 PM</a><br><br>

The fantasy of "everything's all right" is deeply rooted these days, but it's very recent. A glance back over history is a good corrective. <br><br>Ryan, industrial revolutions require adequate energy and other resources. We're running out of those. It's very comforting for people like Rifkin to insist that progress can just keep chugging on, via yet another industrial revolution, but the facts don't bear him out. If you're interested in a more detailed discussion, I suggest my book <i>The Long Descent</i>. <br><br>Jonathan, I think a lot of people know that the excrement is on its way toward the rotary impeller. The rich are simply in a position to do something about it -- though I suspect they won't last long in those island hangouts. Once the rule of law collapses, what's to keep their armed guards from arranging for a few weapons-related accidents and taking everything for themselves? Historically speaking, that's usually how such schemes end up. <br><br>Roy, thanks for the link! If that's true, the chances of a vaccine that will apply to more than a limited number of Ebola strains are not good. Ouch. <br><br>Tuxedo, I think we're going to watch one of the all-time classic examples of elite senility and its usual consequences. Thing is, it's not just a lack of subtlety; they seem to be ignoring every option that might defuse the situation or buy them a little time. Thanks for the reminder about illth -- I need to reread Ruskin, anyway. <br><br>Tom, good.

That, this, and my other future histories are all within the same set of error bars, though. <br><br>Wiseman, how many catastrophic events took place in the 20th century?

Mind you, I've known for decades that such a moment was going to arrive, and so was as ready for it as I could be, but it's still one of those moments where you take a deep breath, steady yourself, and go forward.<br><br><a href=#c7948153115602477784 title="comment permalink">10/22/14, 11:26 PM</a><br><br>

Lifting weight gives strength not only for fighting, but also for physical work or carrying load. And of course learning to fight in case of need. Since there is no defence against multiple opponents, getting some street wisdom is useful for avoiding such situations in the first place: http://www.nononsenseselfdefense.com is a good start, lessons from areas where security has always been scarce. Violence in reality differs vastly from movies, and finding that out the hard way may prove.. unpleasant.<br><br><br>@ Paul: Assuming you are a US citizen, the US consume around 25% of the global ressources with just 5% of the global population. Fight for global equality would imply to drop the average US consumption (that means: also yours!) by 80%. In case you were Western European, the drop still would make 60%. Alternatively, having 80% (resp. 60%) of the global population die would render equality possible. Since neither is exactly popular in the West, global equality stays a lip service as long as the global deindustrialisation is still in the future. And then, it will be equality towards poverty.<br><br><br>@ Mister Robuto: Guess where the warlords will get their armies from.. partly from prisons, partly from ex-soldiers who found that their loyalty oath to the US was rather one-sided (means: the government cheated them as usually).<br><br><br>@ Jonathan: The rich will be quite surprised what happens when they need this refuge. In such a scenario, the cut-off will not only spare them the nasty aspects, but also the flood of goods they are used to. Getting that rich is only possible through the work of others, and if these others can't reach them because they retreated, they will find that they will have to actually work for a living instead of manipulating a complex financial system. A horse without rider is still a horse, but a rider without horse isn't a rider anymore.<br><br>Not to mention that those who are supposed to locally defend them might find out that they actually would do better without them - a lesson from the warlords of Ancient Rome.<br><br><a href=#c7432727738575705682 title="comment permalink">10/22/14, 11:39 PM</a><br><br>

There are no moderating outside forces/civilizations that could dampen or slow our current downward trajectory.<br><br>In addition, during all the previous downfalls of complex civilizations, the mechanization of agriculture was nowhere near as pervasive and progressed. <br><br>From these observations follow three major aspects of the ongoing decline that your perspective does not, in my humble opinion, include to their full extent.<br><br>1. The sheer scale of globalization and interdependence has made global finance extremely important in maintaining the ever crucial supply chains. A very likely breakdown of one major bank can easily put global trade on hold. Letters of Credit will not be issued anymore, halting the transport of goods and foodstuff in particular in virtually a couple of weeks. No country on earth, except maybe Russia and a couple of sub-saharan African countries, has a sufficient level of autarchy to sustain a level of functioning for more than a couple of months. Certainly not the US, Europe and a large part of Asia.<br><br>2. The mechanization of agriculture has led to a severe atrophy of manual skills on how to plant, maintain, harvest and store crops. This is compounded by future shortages of fertilizers, pesticides and replacement parts. Í cannot perceive how governments or farmers will be able to soften the shortfalls if just one crucial aspect in this increasingly vulnerable supply chain breaks down. This is an unprecedented development of our time that cannot be compared to previous collapses of civilizations.<br><br>3. Negative feedback loops are much more pronounced and immediate in their effects on a global and and interdependent civilization such as ours. Whereas the collapse of Rome had only a moderate effect on agricultural output, and the US could take over from the British Empire, this is not the case with our crumbling global financial system or our diminishing return on oil. All major and most minor economies are part of the financial system, and all are affected if one major center crumbles under its weight. The effects are immediate and will likely affect all of them.<br><br>Given these reservations I find it much more likely that anything that resembles our current civilizational setup or the current nation-states will not be in existence anymore in about 30 years time. I expect the devolution of our civilization to occur over a much shorter time frame this time around. <br><br><br><a href=#c6009679838770926336 title="comment permalink">10/23/14, 3:47 AM</a><br><br>

Destroying oil refineries is a pretty simple thing, a couple of missiles will do the trick - even something as simple as strafing fire using tracer will put the refinery out of business and set the distilled fuels on fire. The same goes for oil fields, inland and at sea. No jet fuel and the aircraft can't fly - that's the main thing that put the Luftwaffe out of action and sealed Germany's fate - even though they put a coal-to-liquids program in place in a hurry, it still wasn't good enough.<br><br>Over and above energy, there's food - and most importantly, water.

First of all thanks for another insightful post. The first thing I do every Thursday morning (Greece time) is to read your blog. I really enjoyed reading The Ecotechnic Future, and so far have found the Green Wizardry to be one of the most valuable guides for the practical handling of our difficult future. After Oil waits patiently on top of my reading list. I have translated in Greek and posted on my blog the “An Elegy for the Age of Space”, which is one of my favorites. (http://katarrefsi.blogspot.com/2013/12/20elegiagiaepochidiastimatos.html)<br>I mostly made my blog for warning my friends about the troubles of our falling civilization and I can say that they understand that things will not be rosy. Many more translations will follow from your latest series on the future of industrial civilization, with your permission.<br>I was always afraid of a pandemic as it is one of the troubles of a falling civilization that an individual can do little about it, especially if his/her family has small children. That said I hope that we would be lucky and Ebola will stay an epidemic and not a pandemic.<br>I found your posts on climate change greatly insightful. Do you have any book recommendation about paleoclimatology of South Europe, so I can find similar historical data about my location?<br>Also, as I bought a copy of Spengler’s Decline of the West, I can say that it is not what I expected. I expected a history book from the eyes of a historian who endorses the rise and fall of civilizations cycle, but so far I have found a treatise on history science which is difficult to read even if it is translated to my native language. Furthermore, this book presupposes that you know history from other sources. I will still finish reading it but I would like to have some history books that my child can learn history through the viewpoint of Toynbee and Spengler but not restricted to some highlights of civilizations’ histories that enhance the specific viewpoint. So, could you (as a history buff) propose me some history books that are analytical and earthly and unbiased? I know that an answer to that may include a great many books, but maybe it is an idea for a future post of yours about various history books for every civilization. From a answer to a commenter to a previous post I put on my book wish list Michael Grant’s The History of Rome and Bryan Ward-Perkins' The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization.<br>Thank you again for your devotion to informing us about the perils of our future. I always believed that only the informed can be prepared for the future.<br><br><a href=#c4536556335301072105 title="comment permalink">10/23/14, 4:32 AM</a><br><br>

These stories left me with a permanent distrust of any sort of permanent stability. If you hear enough stories of financial collapse, currency reforms, leaving for the train station with nothing more than a backpack because the Russians were coming in the other side of town, it's hard to take seriously the idea that the stockmarket will provide you with a comfortable retirement. <br>Anyone who takes your history of the future seriously not in the particulars but in the broad outline of disruption and uncertainty is already a step ahead of anyone who expects perpetual progress. Mental preparation is a valuable resource because when collapse or an invading army comes to your town, you won't be wasting time or energy saying, oh, no, this can't be happening. <br>Learning to farm and garden are useful skills, but only in a stable political environment that will recognize and defend your ownership of your plot of land. Ownership of arable land is a good hedge against economic collapse but becomes an emotional boat anchor that keeps you stuck in place when hostile armies advance. <br>Learning some foreign languages may be helpful. Learn the language of whoever you think is most likely to invade your neck of the woods.<br>In any case, an uncertain future is most likely unstable and your best hedge against that is to stay flexible and mobile.<br><br><a href=#c5324768412398264681 title="comment permalink">10/23/14, 7:26 AM</a><br><br>

Cultural anthropology has a lot to say about how people organize themselves in spaces that fall outside of direct state control - whether that's a jungle, desert or a slum.

I hope there’ll be more. I think I first I really grasped what history looks and feels like on the ground when as a teenager I asked my grandmother about her life. I asked what it was like to live through the Great Depression and World War II against a backdrop of people and events that had slipped into legend. Her answer was that for her it was nothing special, she was just working. Pressed for details, her recollections were striking in their ordinariness: being warned to stay away from Hooverville at night, mixing sugar and hot water because she couldn’t afford tea or hot chocolate, singing at the cinema to get in free, sneaking to the harbor as a teenager to flirt with the navy men in uniform. Even people for those who were in the middle of the action: veterans, holocaust survivors, etc. those memories have a dreamlike quality, like details in someone else’s life that just can’t be reconciled with the normality of life on the other side. I can imagine being a teenager during the reign of Theodosius II, prying my grandparents for details of life during the death of Julian, the gothic wars, the splitting of the empire, the ban on the pagan cults and getting the same thing, vague dreamlike recollection against vivid memories of the flavor of the times. If I live through these crises to be Old Man Eric telling stories about my life to neighborhood children it’ll be much the same. Everyday life takes front and center. The rest is left for historians of a distant age, poring through fragments of ancient texts by the light of saltwater lamps in the Mormon Monasteries of Zion who farm camel crickets and water vegetables descended from dandelions with moisture vaporators.<br><br><a href=#c3570851338582941755 title="comment permalink">10/23/14, 8:10 AM</a><br><br>

You will need to force down daily, for 5-6 days straight, 1.3 gallons of water with a heavy dose of salt and sugar mixed in. As if the nausea and vomiting are not enough, your mouth and throat will be filled with sores.

He seems to find the cause of decline in the inexorable working out of the inherent life cycle of the civilization, never mind whether there are resources around or not. Only in some of his late works does the idea of resource exhaustion kind of creep shamefacedly in, from the side. But enough about that.<br><br>I would be interested to read your thoughts on one of the most famous earlier examples of the type of story you told in this post. I know a number of these came out during the 1970s and 80s, but I am particularly thinking of the near-future chapters of Olaf Stapledon's "Last and First Men". How does Stapledon's vision of the fall of the 'first men' differ, in general theme, from your own? If I remember right he did lay heavy emphasis on the exhaustion of fossil energy as a cause of decline, and he represented human society as being so consumed with its own fantasies as to ignore the crisis in the room, all of which appears to follow your own thinking but which must have been ground-breaking ideas in 1930. <br><br>Your blog remains one of my most anticipated weekly reads and always provides much to think on.<br><br><a href=#c7975785367063892386 title="comment permalink">10/23/14, 9:35 AM</a><br><br>

Although your timelines are based on the history of previous civilizations, they seem rather too long to me. A significantly more abbreviated timeline would be more plausible given our 21st century society reliance on the rapidity of transportation and communications, the corporate supply of goods and services, the fragilities of high technology, the limited supplies of non-renewable resources (especially fossil fuels), and the destructive potential of modern warfare with its weapons of mass destruction. Furthermore, the hubris and ignorance of the controlling elite ensure that poor political, economic, and environmental decisions will continue to be made. And the elite will maintain power for much too long because of the active support, or the blind faith, or the apathy of the “sheep” majority. <br><br>Nevertheless, despite almost insurmountable odds, I remain hopeful that awareness of our predicament will dawn on most of us, that we will realize that a massive transformation is urgently required, and that we will demonstrate an unprecedented level of local, national, and international co-operation and generosity to embrace a sustainable lifestyle, save our planet from environmental catastrophe, and preserve the best of our current civilization.

It is a refreshing and insightful experience. We see in the use of blogs a place where the like minded, but powerless can gather their opinions and insights, sharing their outlook on those that pretend to govern and rule. In the history of humanity the small tribal units of the hunter gatherers could not assemble a group of show offs, flimflam operators or con artists and these characters could not achieve critical mass. They could only be that one weird person who was out of place in the tribe. Once humanity started the civilization project, rarely occurring unique individuals could travel, accumulate and gather in a larger setting to compare notes and as the Brain said to Pinky: “Try to take over the world.” If you look at a random sampling of people you will find very few incredible leaders, wild dreamers, poisonous schemers, and real messiahs, etc. These individuals need a vast sea of people (a nation or a culture) in order to materialize, congregate and start their shenanigans. Once the course of history takes a sudden turn to the bottom, some unique individuals will come to the fore, if they survive, but if the bottom falls out and we all end up in little bands, the rare one percent of people will not have a gathering place or a large enough organization to accomplish their conspiracies. There wouldn't be a world to take over anyway. Right now we have a gathering of well tailored, like minded people in Washington D.C. and other places where there is a daily dance of power grabbing and ego stroking. When America or its replacement cannot maintain that huge crowd of migrant, power mad egos in our far flung capitols, they will probably fall to the violence of the emerging war bands. Their only real grip on power being illusionary. Maintaining the huge apparatus of government we have today will be impossible with our steadily diminishing resources. Humankind has always relied on the variation among personalities to track new courses through evolving history. Right now it seems the power mad bureaucrats have had their day. Soon it will be a vast sea of serfs and a seasoning of roving war bands. A little like Seven Samurai, but without the seven saviors.<br><br><a href=#c1741309795095400753 title="comment permalink">10/23/14, 11:43 AM</a><br><br>

As for landing craft, did you see me mention them? Neither did I. The Pacific War was an old-fashioned naval war fought between sail-powered ironclads with steam auxiliary engines. If I do turn this into a book, you may be surprised by the technology -- yes, and the logistics. <br><br>Kassandra, thanks for your comment! I'll consider your suggestion for a post on history reading -- yes, Spengler takes some getting used to. I don't happen to have any recommendations for southern European paleoecology -- maybe one of my readers can help out here. <br><br>Matt, sure. Look up the fraction of the Earth's land area that was directly ruled either from a European capital or from the capital of one of the first wave of European colonies (basically, the New World) in 1914. Now compare that to the equivalent fraction now. That's a solid marker of decline. <br><br>Leo, sieges are a normal part of warfare -- consider Stalingrad!

Hydrogen is not a practical option.<br><br>It's not widely know, but helium is a by-product of the natural gas industry.

Not sure I'll get around to do that, but thanks for the offer I am interested though it is (fortunately) not pressing.<br><br>The point about poison was also not so much intended as a effective way to handle such a situation - more to avoid it in the first place. If it became customary for a woman to be armed (similar to a bee's sting), you could reduce the number of easy targets for serious crimes - that could make much of it nonviable. Also, I don't expect to get away without suffering if I draw a knife and the other party still insists on a fight. The additional point with poison is that they'd have a strong incentive to keep you alive, once they are convinced they actually got the poison in their system - after all you may have (or know someone who has) an antidote. Calling an ambulance may not be their first choice. <br>Re gun: People are very sensitive to guns spreading, and walking around armed, here.

Wider and wider segments of the Earth's surface are abandoned by civilization with each phase. Even by the end of this century it seems as though a vast protion of the rougher terrain on Earth will be sparsely populated and semi deserted.<br><br>Minutes before loading up this post I finished my third reading of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. It is interesting how the apocalypse that the story follows has the same shape. The earliest phase remember in the lore of the peoples was known simply as the seven days of fire, which in due time was followed by the rise of a subsequent technological society, the Kingdom of Efrit. It build many wonders, before it fell. There were three events, each with devastated the dominant empires of the era between the seven days of fire and the time of the story. It is in the after math of a civilization which went much further down the road of technological development than our civilization is likely to reach, and the global devastation is proportionately much greater; the majority of the planets land surface is too toxic for humans to survive without protective gear. <br><br>Linking these threads of though are your military ultra light aircraft. It takes some ticklish imagining to see a dark dark age where the chieftain of a proud tribe still maintains independence from a more powerful neighbor by grace of a preserved ultra light still kept sky worthy. Cannons, a single machine gun <br>(used only in critical moments in battle), some ultra light aircraft, and ancient ballistic armor for the most prestigious warriors back up a main force fighting with muskets, lances, and swords.<br><br>Honestly this post didn't strike me as too down, much of the repeated body blows don't land until well after my likely tenure on the Earth. The devastation that could hit soon, its an endurance race not a sprint.

Maybe it's just me, but I had a harder time coming to terms with the eventual extinction of our species than I did with the idea that our future would be made up of ordinary history. <br><br>Wolfgang, exactly -- you live in a part of the world that's had to deal with ordinary history in the recent past. One of the things that makes Americans clueless is that it's been too long since we've had war, plague, famine, etc. on our own soil. <br><br>Rhisiart, diolch yn fawr!<br><br>RPC, oh, no question, the US has actually been in decline since around 1974. It's simply the beginning of the crisis stage of decline and fall that I put in 2014. <br><br>Tuxedo, the interesting thing to me is that television is losing its capacity to keep people entranced by the same narrative. Instead we've got an assortment of contending narratives, many of them fostered by radio or the internet, and no reason to think we've seen as many of them as we'll get. <br><br>Donalfagan, the Straight Path is closed. We're here, and have to deal with Middle-earth as it is. <br><br>Shane, I don't recall dismissing the idea of a unipolar hegemony further down the line -- quite the contrary, the idea that someone else will take over when the US lands on its nose has been a theme of these posts all along. My guess is that Chinese hegemony will be less intrusive than ours, just as ours was less intrusive than the British Empire's conquest of a quarter of the world's land surface. <br><br>Richard, yes, but that's because I've been living with these ideas for decades. It takes practice. <br><br>Andrew, of course. Most of the new ventures that matter will be going on inside the stateless zones, and post-migration communities that happen to preserve useful skills may become the seeds of great nations a thousand years down the road. That's also ordinary history. <br><br>Eric, storytelling is probably the oldest and certainly one of the most powerful technologies our species has come up with. We'll see about continuations or expansions of this particular story. <br><br>Joe, did you think the peak of a civilization was a moral peak -- or, let's say, a peak of niceness? Most civilizations at their peak are busy conquering and enslaving other nations, you know, and western industrial civilization was just another example. It's often on the way down that people start having second thoughts about such habits; as Hegel noted, the owl of Minerva flies at dusk. <br><br>Dmitry, you're quite correct that this brief impressionistic sketch didn't happen to mention Russia by name. It also didn't mention by name India, Brazil, Malaysia, Ecuador, or Andorra, for that matter. It was meant as a rough outline, and -- ahem -- my world view is a little less Russocentric than yours seems to have become of late.<br><br><a href=#c7171162510796458063 title="comment permalink">10/23/14, 5:10 PM</a><br><br>

What's going on in China right now is fairly common for a rising power. <br><br>Magicalthyme, thanks for the latest. The info on rehydration chimes with what I've seen, too. <br><br>Shark, I use Toynbee as a source for the morphology of collapse, but you're right that his theories of causation leave quite a bit to be desired. That's why I also use Spengler, Vico, Catton, and a great many others. As for Stapleton, it's been a very long time since I read <i>Last and First Men</i> -- will have to remedy that before I can respond in any useful sense. <br><br>Steve, certainly societies with a lot less wealth to hand will find other ways to deal with crime than locking up huge numbers of people on the government nickel. <br><br>Joe, I need to read that one of these days. <br><br>Theotokosbooks, a short impressionistic sketch of the sort I offered doesn't have room for everything! Malik Ibrahim, by the way, was (will be?) a Muslim Filipino warlord, the Attila the Hun of the 23rd century southwest Pacific, not a religious figure at all -- he briefly united Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and large chunks of Southeast Asia under his rule, though it all fell apart again after his death. <br><br>Pyrrhus, the difference is that the US is not industrial civilization, it's just one temporary hegemon. Nobody managed the Roman feat of uniting the whole industrial world under a single government, so we get a succession of hegemons, each of which collapses in turn, rather than a universal state that keeps on being propped up by one ruling elite after another. <br><br>Bob, glad you enjoyed the book! As for your two alternatives, I don't think either one is at all likely; the internal proletariat in America, no matter how bad things are here, recognizes that the implosion of American empire and the end of the arrangements that let us batten on a quarter of the world's wealth will make things much, much worse -- so nobody really wants to rock the boat. <br><br>Glenn, blimps served in two world wars as antisubmarine crafts with very few accidents and a great deal of success; what you've shown is that rigid airships are very vulnerable, which is certainly true. I suspect our descendants will find a place for some sort of airship, but as I noted in my scenario, my money would be on handbuilt ultralight airplanes powered by alcohol engines as the most likely aircraft for the next millennium, mostly because of their military value as reconnaissance craft. <br><br>Robert, yes, I'm familiar with those arguments; obviously I disagree, for reasons I've outlined in detail in my first two peak oil books, <i>The Long Descent</i> and <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i>. The contrast between sudden doom and the unprecedented awakening in which you put your hopes sounds rather too much like religious myth for my tastes. <br><br>Doom, oh, there will be the samurai, too. Those or the close equivalent always show up in dark ages. <br><br>Lens, oddly enough, I've been thinking of those old quarrels as well. It's always the same thing -- the myth of perpetual progress or the myth of imminent apocalypse -- dolled up in this or that set of ideological drag.<br><br><a href=#c2000570667404667351 title="comment permalink">10/23/14, 5:37 PM</a><br><br>

It's when we wake up to the fact that life is a process of ripening toward death, that death is not the opposite of life but its fulfillment, that actual maturity finally arrives. That's how I see it, at least. <br><br>Latefall, let's do it! Pictures of the Progress Fairy and the Decline Fairy are now on topic. <br><br>Lewis, sounds like a good plan to me. <br><br>Heather, that sounds like an utterly sensible way to approach this. <br><br>Mike, no, I haven't gotten much into the prospects for deindustrial aircraft, lighter-than-air or otherwise. The thought of an army of the new dark ages, mostly rifle-carrying infantry, with some cavalry for scouting and skirmishing, some crude rocket launchers for artillery, and a couple of ultralights buzzing overhead for long-range scouting, just stuck in my head!<br><br>Ray, I'm not thinking of ultralight aircraft as something preserved from the past, but something that smiths of the new dark ages could craft for themselves: a simple alcohol-fueled engine, fabric wings, wood or bamboo structural members, and a certain amount of cordage and metal fittings, and you're in the air. It's actually far from rare for technologies from an earlier civilization to remain viable in stripped down form for military use through the dark age that follows, and this one would be both easy and useful to dark age warlords. <br><br>Ed-M, you're most welcome. <br><br>MizBean, maybe so, but my omnivore readers may decide to change the phrasing a bit, you know. <br><br>Imaginosophy, I've commented at some length about how I see the nuclear issue working out in <a href=../../2014/08/dark-age-america-bitter-legacy.html rel=nofollow>an earlier post</a>. The short form is that yes, that's likely to be one of many nasty legacies our society is leaving to the future, and it will account for a share of deaths, but in the near to middle future it's not going to cause collapse all by itself -- you'll notice that the wilder claims made about the Fukushima disaster have turned out to be handwaving.

I often hike in the Cascade mountains downwind from Seattle, and it has long been a dreary part of many trips to find dead mylar balloons, their helium gone, presumably up through the atmosphere and on out into the blackness of space, never to be seen by humanity again. And for what? Nothing more than a few moments of selfish amusement watching a bagful of it floating away. Just one of the innumerable ways people waste the natural treasures of our fair planet.<br><br>There was a show on "Nova," I believe, a few years back, taking a new look at the Hindenburg disaster. If I remember correctly, the verdict seemed to be that it was the flammable fabric doping agents, applied to the outer shell I think to decrease gas permeability, that burned so fiercely, not the hydrogen.<br><br>I believe I have read that hydrogen burns cool, and has a rather low energy density overall, making it not that good of a fuel. There seem to be at least some knowledgeable people who believe its flammability to be quite manageable. Airships of course face other problems, and don't mix well with violent weather, as attested by the string of disasters listed by a previous commenter. But even so, they do "float on air," and it may be too soon to rule out a comeback of sorts for them, even filled with hydrogen.<br><br>Regarding the possibility of climate change making far northern latitudes more habitable and productive, I would not bet on it. The Arctic will still be the Arctic. Winter nights will still be very long. Even if "average" temperatures go up quite a bit, it is the extreme temperatures that will still dictate what can and cannot grow there.<br><br>Average, or mean, really means rather little in this context. Perhaps there will be more nice days on Ellesmere Island than at present, but I fear it will get just as cold then as it does now, maybe not as often, but it only has to happen once to destroy whatever it is that one may be growing and hoping to eat.<br><br>Talk of northern Russia or the Canadian Arctic becoming significantly more hospitable seems premature. The average can stay the same or go up while the highs get higher and the lows get lower. I worry that those lows may get lower, even at lower latitudes, with unfortunate consequences for agriculture. The term "global warming" is an unfortunate choice of words, and some have suggested it should really be called global "weirding."<br><br>As for China becoming the world's pre-eminent power, we'll see on that one, too. Previous commenters have reminded us how Japan looked to be on the verge of buying almost the whole world in the late 80's, and we know how that turned out.<br><br>Certainly China is resuming its position as a great power, but it is also beset with serious problems, like a huge population on a relatively small amount of productive arable land. Much of that land is threatened by desertification, or being ruined by runaway "development" and pollution. The fact that just about anyone there with the means to get a foreign passport does so has to mean something as regards their confidence in the country's future. <br><br>But they are a hard working, energetic people. I wouldn't bet on the U.S. keeping its position of power much longer, based as it is to a large extent on conjuring trillions of dollars into existence. We probably still have far more good land per capita than most places, despite our own energetic efforts to ruin it. As ever, we'll see.<br><br><a href=#c4854630162651430723 title="comment permalink">10/23/14, 6:12 PM</a><br><br>

I love the way JMG comes up with possibilities I had never thought of before. It is a great pity that we are caught in the "procrustean bed of conventional wisdom" so much of the time. The idea of the US degenerating into a nuclear civil war within 30 years is disconcertingly reasonable but I had not seriously considered it.<br><br>I think of the first crisis of modernity (1914-1954) as an instability of the exponential growth phase of our civilization--new possibilities of warfare and mass communication developed faster than the social norms needed to manage them. It could be that a piece of the next instability will be directly caused by growth as much as by resource constraints. (i.e. internet communication and drone warfare might be equal initiators with resource constraints in the next crisis). <br><br>In the background here is an observation that humans don't learn much from the past. Our knowledge of our history is much much more complete than any civilization before us, and in theory we easily could avoid the worst of the coming crises. This time could be different. But JMG is almost certainly right that we won't. The irrational currents of human social and political movements seem to be much much stronger than the rational currents.<br><br><a href=#c6895099421044375412 title="comment permalink">10/23/14, 6:31 PM</a><br><br>

I wish I had put this to TAR community earlier, some of the info that has come out would've been really useful.<br><br>@ Tom - I think NZers would be more willing to integrate with Australia over China. For all practical purposes NZ is a colony of Australia's anyway.<br><br>@latefall - yes from what I understand the basic problem is (relatively fast) leakage. I hadn't thought of fuel-ethanol or wood gas (there's so much common knowledge that you won't find in the obvious places anymore). There's research in trapping hydrides in metals like magnesium but I don't know how efficient that will be. Any attempt to create the level of fuel we have now will run into hard resource limits.<br><br>@JMG: a summer holiday project seems like a good idea indeed!<br><br>@Mike - the biggest problem is definitely the fact that Helium, the safest gas, isn't easily available without natural gas infrastructure. I'm wondering to what extent Helium was extracted prior to that industry existing. The Hindenburg design had inner cells that were supposed to be filled with Hydrogen, sealed off from outer cells that were to be filled with Helium. Hydrogen was supposed to be valved instead of Helium when necessary. I'm not sure if there's any established methods of making hydrogen gas less reactive (I read that there was NASA research on that), but if there is a lower energy way of doing it, it could make hydrogen airships viable.<br><br>@jim: The paper was done in a mundane way where I simply had to 'apply' the different analysis concepts, additionally I have to deal with non-Peak-oil acquainted academia, so I really had to tone down the harshness of reality (even with a page of background on Peak-Oil) and only focus on the immediate future. At the end the running theme was 'it all depends on the amount of available energy'.<br>I didn't think of graphene because from what I learnt in materials science last year, it's a heavy energy consuming modern piece of technology. Even though the first film of graphene was made with graphite and sellotape, I haven't heard of any research that produces graphene with minimial complexity of process and little embodied energy. <br><br><br><a href=#c7425262608685496541 title="comment permalink">10/24/14, 1:06 AM</a><br><br>

That's how I see it, at least."<br><br>Are you exploring this path of thinking in your other writings, or can you recommend other writers having same philosophical worldview? During this storm, that thinking is very comforting, at least for me.<br><br>I have been reading this blog for a while now. It was one of the first sites I found after my own waking up to the reality of peak energy and environmental depletion, manifesting themselves currently through economy in contraction. One curious side note I have made during this time is that American readership tends to reframe everything into morality play. There must be justice and moral lesson hidden in the story, or story doesn't make sense at all, seems to be the main narrative.<br><br>After travelling extensively through areas what Timothy Snyder calls collectively as "bloodlands" that attitude makes no sense. Heck, I am born and living in the same geographical area, albeit in much luckier part of it, in the northern extension of this geopolitical fault line. This almost Manichean attitude of Americans (black/white, darkness/light) is probably biggest cultural barrier I have ever met. It seems that amoral (not immoral, mind you) assessment of situation is next to impossible for most of your readership. Timothy Snyder seems to be one of very few Americans who really "get it", history and it's consequences.<br><br>I dare to claim that anyone born to the landscape over which fire storms of holodorom/pogroms/holocaust/blitzkrieg war fronts raged repeatedly and having even tiniest amount of historical perspective has SOME inner sense about liquid nature of morality and about need to defend your own tribal contingent no matter what. They also know how to do small-scale gardening, fishing and hunting. ALL of them, including my own family, maybe counting out very small urban upper-middle class of mentioned nations. <br><br>For many demagogues painting hellfire images about doings of this or that tribal federation, same actions would be absolutely allright if it was THEIR gang in position to execute them. I believe this is basic truth about biological nature of human race everywhere, but some cultures try more desperately deny it. Longer the timeline when no war has ravaged one's own land and wealthier that peacetime has been, more easy it is to fool oneself. <br><br>This difference of worldviews going to the very foundations ensures that US dealings with resurrecting crisis in said geographical area, in Bloodlands, shall not go well for your state. You are going to stumble around the dark room with wrong mental map in your mind.<br><br>I am not so interested about long view. Any brotherhood with its descentants must survive through current problems and those looming immediately after them, and if it doesn't...long view doesn't matter to them anymore. Most logical way to react to situation is with amoral attitude towards strangers (not immoral, there is difference between them), at the same time strengthening bonds and firepower of your own kin. <br><br>Why to bother anymore about abstract wrongdoings against, let's say residents in Ferguson, if they are just bunch of strangers for you? It's not like they would be helping you in bad spot either. So why waste your time, energy and resources to have moral outrage about things that does not affect your own, and doesn't involve your allies? It seems so absurd, like some theological argument over how many angels can dance on the pin of the needle. Let the strangers fight it over between themselves, don't risk yourselves in that process irrelevant for you.<br><br><a href=#c2692414314388234758 title="comment permalink">10/24/14, 1:16 AM</a><br><br>

There are benefits to being an island with a massive desert. Did you know that the centre of the continent isn't technically a desert, but more of an arid land. It has always supported people, although not in the densities that we are used to.<br><br>Interestingly too, I've often thought that higher and warmer oceans may paradoxically lead to more rainfall here through greater evaporation and increased energy to the storm bands which circle the equator.<br><br>Incidentally too, a big chunk of the desert/arid lands which is to the north west of here is actually below present sea level, so you never quite know what the future brings? In wet years the area fills up to slowly drain away into the Great Artesian bore. The area fills with life during those events and the extra moisture brings rain to my part of the world.<br><br>Did you note that an Ebola case has been reported in New York of all places? I noted that the government here has refused to send any assistance other than AU$18m to the affected regions. Oh yeah, customs has been going hard on the 700 or so people that have been in that area too and returned to Australia.<br><br>It is strange that we can find the resources to send military assistance to Iraq (military advisers, whatever that means - didn't they use that language in previous wars?), but not Africa.

It sure starts off will a bang: 25% with humanity dead three years from now. The rise of the anti-immigrant American Peoples Party would make a lot of sense after such an epidemic brought here by foreigners. If they were to sweep the 2028 elections, I’m not sure why they would need to give the president the power to rule by decree. But then again perhaps such a devastating epidemic would cause people to give up on democracy. The rise of a Southern and Mt West counterinsurgency against the AIP was a bit of a headshaker though, because those areas are currently the most anti-immigrant.<br>I hadn't yet thought that the current Ebola epidemic could increase overall anti-immigrant sentiment. But now it seems obvious, and I wonder if it won’t be the biggest issue in the 2016 election. If the crisis worsens, a candidate who is the most anti-immigrant (probably a Republican) could emerge and this person could become part of the nucleus of the AIP should he or she go down to defeat in 2016. In any case we could see the end of unregulated mass immigration under the banner of health, safety, and survival. International travel too could come under some serious restrictions. You've certainly given us some issues to think through here.<br><br><a href=#c6915527859288604162 title="comment permalink">10/24/14, 4:48 AM</a><br><br>

I'll post a link in ADR comments when it's up.<br><br>Re the airship technology debate: it's a fascinating mental puzzle. On the one hand, airships <i>considered from a systems perspective</i> are superbly energy efficient and resilient (yes, efficiency and resilience are opposed principles in general, but this is an unusual case) compared to the heavier-than-air transport we use now. In fact, given the comparatively trivial infrastructure requirements of airships, they are much more sustainable than railroads in a deindustrial time.<br><br>On the other hand, airships have been shown to be, as Glenn Murray documented, fragile in bad weather; and bad weather is one of the things we are pretty much guaranteed over the next few centuries.<br><br>There is one point that I haven't seen raised yet: <i>airship technology has never been developed very well.</i> In the petroleum-rich 20th century, heavier than air flight simply made overwhelmingly better economic sense. Airships were abandoned, not because the technology ran up against intractable inherent limits, but because airplanes had a much better ROI. JMG pointed out that the naval recon blimps had a good safety record, which suggests that the primary concerns of airship viability are addressable, and that as-yet-untried design improvements would probably pay off.<br><br>Our descendants will be denied a lot of the scientific and engineering accomplishments that we still take for granted. However, they are unlikely to be any less inventive and thoughtful than we are. I'm betting that dismissing future viability of airships based on what we've done so far is like arguing that clippers and windjammers couldn't be practical based on the known limitations of medieval cogs.<br><br>Show me a fundamental thermodynamic, economic, or engineering limitation that forecloses the possibility of airships (ahem, before the 28th century), and I will dolefully concede Glenn Murray's point that "The notion of the airship itself is flawed", at least for present purposes<br><br>Until then, I think the question remains fascinatingly open. In the absence of such a fundamental liability, the appearance - or not - of airships in the next few centuries will depend on historical, rather than inherent, factors.<br><br><a href=#c8482234718048089672 title="comment permalink">10/24/14, 7:09 AM</a><br><br>

Oil and Gas stocks rallied this week despite continued decline and stagnation in global oil prices. Meanwhile, in order to keep with what’s happening, the American fracking industry is getting ready to try out technologies that at best will deplete wells even faster than conventional fracking, and at worst may render wells useless before they even get a chance to produce yields (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-22/oil-producers-cramming-wells-in-risky-push-to-extend-boom.html). The American fracking industry is showing its weaknesses and people are starting to see the boom for what it is (http://www.businessinsider.com/shale-basin-breakeven-prices-2014-10). It feels like there’s been a shift these last two months and no matter how much oil prices recover, even some of the most fervent supporters of fracking are starting to realize that calling the technology a road to prosperity is like finishing a rack of ribs, cracking open the bones to suck on the marrow and saying the meal is just beginning. Once wells start shutting down in earnest I’ll be interested in seeing the way the economics of energy change. It may be that as we transition to the next phase of scarcity industrialism, a fracking boom will be a sign of economic weakness that most countries will be afraid to show.<br><br><a href=#c6050821979707452073 title="comment permalink">10/24/14, 8:02 AM</a><br><br>

That's how I see it, at least."”<br><br>Juhana: “Are you exploring this path of thinking in your other writings, or can you recommend other writers having same philosophical worldview? During this storm, that thinking is very comforting, at least for me.”<br><br>A recent book that's had a huge impact on me as far as working towards a perspective on death of dying that puts death in context as a fulfillment of life to be celebrated and embraced, that takes a very personal and practical approach towards the process from a Druid perspective has been Kristoffer Hughes' new book "Journey Into Spirit," which was released just recently. There are many others of course both ancient and modern but that was the latest one that really grabbed me. I definitely think it’s a topic we need to be thinking a lot about, since we’re facing a time where both the lengths of our lives and the manner of our deaths will be a lot different than has been the norm for the last few decades and that can be a challenging thing to get used to. Working on our attitudes towards death is a good starting point, the biggest challenge I’m facing right now is trying to figure out how to die well even if I wind up dying violently, or of a contagious disease that prevents me from being able to have loved ones pleasant. I want to learn how to die now so that I can be ready for it when it comes, and we are a civilization that really has forgotten how to do it. A lot of people I know think that’s a morbid thought for someone in their late 20s to have… but I’m thinking learning how to die is right up there with learning how to garden in a time like this.<br><br><br><a href=#c5908612243128659782 title="comment permalink">10/24/14, 8:27 AM</a><br><br>

I assume that that insurgency would come from remnants of the Tea Party/Don't Tread on Me faction. My question is this, since the South is the most diverse area outside of California, with the highest percentage of African-Americans and the fastest growing Latino population, wouldn't this focus any white Tea Party based insurgency inward in ethnic infighting, rather than outward? And wouldn't the DC government intervene to make sure that internal opposition to any insurgency was well funded? To me, the diversity of the South is a strong barrier to overcome for any white Tea Party based insurgency to overcome.<br>I'm surprise you didn't get any comments from Canadians loudly proclaiming that, under no circumstances could Canada survive a US collapse to become a close ally of China, and loudly proclaiming that their border is intrinsically indefensible. :)<br><br><a href=#c1350457261958264559 title="comment permalink">10/24/14, 10:39 AM</a><br><br>

They may be helpful, but in many cases they are just waiting for you to drop your watch. Buildings for e.g. fuel cell research are often designed in a specific way to vent the explosion and keep the rest of the compound somewhat intact. You need to seriously consider something _will_ go wrong. <br>That is in my opinion also what the next generation of airships need to include at the early design stage. Bail out systems (can have relatively large volume) come to mind. I tend to believe that they'll come back to be used for a number of things in the next couple of decades. Materials got a lot better (performance wise and to a dregree availability) not the least because we started to understand them. And if you need to ship semiconductor products or intermediary products around the world I'd put it in a submarine or an airship. I am pretty certain they'll go "poof" once in a while - but so does everything in a dark(er) age.

Hummer method with acids and furnace is another step up but significantly more sophisticated at the moment (for high quality - the process is pretty old). Then there's CVD growth which is highest quality but small yield at the moment. The reactor is a airtight quarz tube at some 500-800 C with some (ideally well known) carbon containing gases going in. People haven't really started to optimize the process for cost (or sustainable footprint) as it is pretty finicky and only moderately well understood as it is. Most of the time people will grow stuff like that on Si-wafers <br>just to keep conditions easier to control and compare. There may be much cheaper, self stabilizing recipies to do it out there. Or not. <br><br>On H2 storage: Well either you keep it cool (eats energy, adds complexity and some volume) or you keep it compressed (adds lots of weight, cost, and volume). And hydrogen is small so it can seep through many materials fairly easily (sometimes degrading them in the process). Graphene would stop that (or significantly reduce it in case of a incomplete layer, e.g. flakes the hydrogen would have to side step). <br><br>On ultralights: They were diddling around with them before the combustion engine already. Knowing some of their potential will surely keep them attractive, and from being forgotten altogether. Airdropping troops onto fortresses with one-way gliders was fairly successful at times. Also Germany used human powered flight a lot to train their Luftwaffe pilots back then (weren't allowed engines). There's a bunch of boxes with some 4000-5000 articles regarding that sitting at the library of congress. If one of the library buffs here could help me and point out how to get my hands on (copies of) them in some way, I'd be happy to give it a shot and try to archive these long lost relatives in a second location.

I had assumed that the usual, knee-jerk assumption of reducing fevers might mean giving Tylenol which is hard on the liver. Then, too, the body creates the fever in part to kill microbes. NSAIDS would increase the likelihood of bleeding. Yet I recently read that fever reducers are part of supportive care, possibly in Africa rather than the U.S. Perhaps an herb like feverfew could be used - but even there, I am unsure whether or when it is a good idea to reduce a fever. <br><br>Meanwhile, I got this from someone in the herbal business:<br><br>Anything that will boost one's glutathione levels should help with protection against any viral disease. The 'cytokine storm' you refer to is caused by an imbalance in the TH1/TH2 immune cells which happens when glutathione levels are low.

It is still not very friendly (especially to aquatic beings) but you'll smell it before it kills ya. Conversion is not without losses (and some added weight) though. Some losses can be recouped with smart design - others not. You end up with a bit below half the energy density of diesel, which is not thrilling but not much worse than other alternatives. The tank is MUCH simpler.

Fertilizer, plastics (bakelite or acrylonitrile -&gt; PAN -&gt; Carbon Fiber*), cleaning agent, disinfectant, and of course, explosive.

In the past few years I've become involved in Steampunk subculture, mostly because it's fun, partly because it supports my custom fashion design profession. <br><br>Those intrigued by "Steampunk" should google it as I can't do it justice in a few words and it is a supremely visual phenomenon anyway. The shortest form is that it is a historical reenactment movement inspired by Victorian/ Edwardian society and Victorian science fiction (HG Wells, J. Verne)and a vast and growing body of modern fiction in the same style, although the social movement far transcends it's literary roots.<br><br>The common trope is that the interest in Steampunk is fueled by a disaffection with "magic plastic boxes" and a romantic longing for technology that was tactile and understandable and a society that was gracious, stylish, and "real." (Steampunk rarely acknowledges it's upper class focus and prejudice)<br><br>The idea that our civilization went into significant decline in 1914, pretty much the later date of the Steampunk era, adds another layer of significance for this growing social affectation ...a completely unconscious longing for the last glory days of Western Civilization.<br><br>While the end of Civilization may be one raison d'etre for Steampunk. Steampunk, as a rapidly growing pop cultural idiom, would seem to be a social acknowledgement that, if only subconsciously, we all know that was the beginning of the end.<br><br><a href=#c8732946745439192057 title="comment permalink">10/24/14, 4:27 PM</a><br><br>

North Korea has completely closed its borders to tourists or foreign visitors of any kind because of concerns that they might have Ebola. (North Korea has tourists, you snark? Well, not any more. Heh.) The journalist writing this up-- I think it was in the NY Post-- expressed some puzzlement as to why NK would quarantine itself despite the fact that no Ebola-infected people have traveled there yet, so far as anyone knows. But that of course is the whole <i>point</i> of quarantine-- to be effective, it has to be enacted <i>before</i> the sick people get in, and enforced ruthlessly. I thought everyone knew that? But evidently not. I guess they really don't teach anything in journalism school.<br><br>But anyway, it's possible that at least one pocket of humanity will ride out the plague relatively unscathed, due to their being at least one world leader with a vestigial shred of common sense.

So I'm more optimistic about the future today than I was yesterday.<br><br>Imagine a future where 70% of the world's population is wiped out by the first wave of Ebola, and then when it mutates into a new strain, 70% of the original survivors are wiped out because their antibodies don't recognize the next year's mutant strain. And then again with the next strain. But North Korea remains unaffected by the rest of the world's decision to commit mass suicide for the sake of political correctness. And when Ebola finally burns itself out due to running out of victims, the North Koreans spread out and repopulate the globe, remembering and worshiping Kim Jong Un as the savior of humanity. Perhaps centuries from now, religious scholars will gather in the world's largest and most prosperous city, Pyongyang, to formally debate whether stories that The Holy Un could communicate telepathically with dolphins or hit holes-in-one consistently when golfing are literally true or if they are divinely inspired allegories for the moral edification and enlightenment of humanity.<br><br>Wouldn't that be something? That would certainly be something. Good setting for a space bats story.<br><br><a href=#c248455772203919696 title="comment permalink">10/24/14, 4:39 PM</a><br><br>

Joel too.<br><br>What prompted my post was not this blog entry in particular, but the general thrust of things here. In particular, your treatment of Marxism.<br><br>My experience of Socialists and Communists (community and society are the same thing, no?) comes from direct involvement in various causes. Generally they come from the libertarian side of things, and have nothing in common with the Authoritarian crap of Stalin and Mao. They're not utopians. They're just trying to make sure we dont end up deeper in the mire than we need to, whether the general trajectory is up or down. As Kurt Vonnegut wrote, <br><br>" I of course understand that the widespread revulsion inspired even now, and perhaps forever, by the word Communism is a sane response to the cruelties and stupidities of the dictators of the USSR, who called themselves, hey presto, Communists, just as Hitler called himself, hey presto, a Christian. To children of the Great Depression, however, it still seems a mild shame to outlaw from polite thought, because of the crimes of tyrants, a word that in the beginning described for us nothing more than a possibly reasonable alternative to the Wall Street crapshoot."<br><br>There is nothing utopian the writing of Socialist like Vonnegut or Zinn. The Noble Worker is nowhere to be seen.<br><br>They. We. I. are just trying to get somewhere towards the Golden Rule. <br><br>When I read your posts about how society is about various interest groups striving to extract what they can from a limited pot, I think of pressure groups such as AVAAZ, and it fits perfectly. I have Socialist friends who are steadfastly in favour of Fracking because it fits their ethos of ordinary working people doing useful productive work to benefit society. To them, environmentalism seems like middle class pollyanna stuff.<br><br>To assume that the party could continue if it weren't for the greed of the 1% is as mindlessly dualist as the business as usual ethos dispensed by the elite, but it's a popular idea. Yet despite the increased reach of protest groups through social media etc, it seems to me pretty obvious that the world is becoming a) more polarised and b) more right wing. <br><br>The first seems inevitable in times of crisis (and the crisis has hardly touched us yet) The second is not inevitable, although it is probably the path of least resistance. This is a cause of deep concern.<br><br>It seems to me that the great social advances of the last couple of centuries - the abolition of slavery, universal suffrage, and all the rest, were made possible as much by the surplus energy of fossil fuels as it was by any mass moral upwelling. Peak oil may also mean peak liberality.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c3397726337307613129 title="comment permalink">10/24/14, 7:19 PM</a><br><br>

The reason we don't "currently" discuss security and military skills is for two simple reasons.<br><br>First, JMG asked us not to.<br><br>As the one sort of leading the whole Green Wizard movement I defer to our "patron saint".<br><br>Secondly, his point was there are plenty of informative sites on the Internet that talk about such things that Green Wizards don't need to repeat the discussion. He also pointed out that such discussions often are very emotionally charged.<br><br>People have strong opinions on the subject.<br><br>And I've seen this myself. Young boards that don't yet have a sense of "community" like we have at the moment, can crash under the anonymity of charged discussion like those about firearms and personal security. It only takes a few trolls to ruin a community.<br><br>We want the Green Wizard's site to be a place where even rabid right wingnuts and left leaning ecofreaks can come and share. I don't care your political leanings as long as you can politely discuss the best compost to use for tomatoes.<br><br>If we can moderate the discussion for a while, as people learn that the people who are sharing are "people", then when down the line you disagree with something they say, you won't start a "flame war" over it.<br><br>Now for me its a simple matter of evolution and growth to avoid a few subjects in the beginnings of growing Green Wizards.<br><br>Personally I consider nutrition a key skill as the world descends. If you are not eating well then things like disease and stress will work against you. Your bottom line survivability drops when you eat poorly.<br><br>Unfortunately at the moment, there is a big push back by government licensing boards on what they see as "amateurs" giving food advice. I eat "primaly" and have seen where the "powers that be" go after those they consider not giving them their due with licenses and such.<br><br>So at the moment we are not discussing "nutrition" on the Green Wizard forum.<br><br>Nor alternate medicine I'm afraid.<br><br>The truth is as long as JMG "owns" the name Green Wizards, he is a target for any loonie that wants to sue him, since we all know he's a rich author, should they follow some internet advice on our forum.<br><br>In the next year we will be creating a Green Wizards non-profit. Once we do the we will have more freedom to discuss the subject like nutrition, homeopathic and herbal medicine and yes, security and protection.<br><br>Til then, I ask you bear with us and by all means, visit the forums, get registered and contribute.<br><br>We've been a bit lax on the GreenWizardsDotInfo site with update but thats about to change. The Summer was crazy for me but we have a few guest writers with some amazing articles to post this month. And I'm going to do a series as I winterize my home that should help teach people to conserve.<br><br>Hopefully we can get the ball rolling before JMG's prediction of a Ebola pandemic turns the lights out.<br><br><a href=#c4232682230075345989 title="comment permalink">10/24/14, 7:26 PM</a><br><br>

But my (intense) dislike of Communism isn't on account of Stalin's crimes. It's because the system is inherently evil.<br><br>Given that, in at least the standard Communist model, the government takes control of the means of production, and distributes goods to the people, it is inherently totalitarian. Since it seeks to eventually abolish any form of monetary exchange, any step toward that which is not strictly voluntary (which then only ever takes place in small communities) is universal slavery. As its aim is an eventual one-world system, it is inherently imperialistic. Since the whole purpose of this planet-wide social engineering experiment is a classless society of equality, harmony, and peaceful anarchy, it is inherently utopian. And given that it sees history through the entirely secular lens of Marxist class struggle, and Communism as the inevitable outcome of history, it holds to an "ends-justify-the-means" philosophy, the justification of every evil governing power in every age.<br><br>I might also add, as a personal note, that I believe in Original Sin and concupiscence, which means that there is no possible conceivable system of earthly governance where greed, wrath, envy and pride will no longer be a problem. This means a state apparatus will always be necessary to some degree, which means the end-state of Communism is completely impossible to achieve. Others may differ on their particular religious beliefs, but a fair number of secular people, and those of other religious views, also believe in free will. This, too, renders mankind essentially uncontrollable, such that no set of cultural programming can undo the free choice of some people to do evil things.<br><br>The actions of Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot and all the rest are not an unfortunate coincidence for Communism. They are its inevitable outcome if executed outside of a fully voluntary commune. The state takes control of the means of production and distributes scarce goods, which puts it in the position of choosing who gets to die. The inevitable thrust of history toward Communism is for the greater good, so those who act against Communist interests are enemies of mankind, and thus treated less than kindly. The dictatorship of the proletariat - the traditional approach to Communism's second stage - concentrates unimaginable power into the hands of a few Communist zealots. If they pursue the aims of Communism, they will commit atrocities. If they shun the aims of Communism and pursue self-interest, they will commit atrocities.

The notion that Communism is a great idea that's never been properly tried is a vile myth. Those who say that it's simply not practical are closer to being right, but still assume that we ought to do it if it were possible. We shouldn't. It's evil.<br><br>I am a traditional conservative (which nowadays has nothing to do with the GOP). Progressives, the other side of that coin, tend to think that human society can be shaped or molded into new forms successfully, and that therefore social experimentation can be greatly beneficial. They may recognize the risks and try to minimize them, but large-scale social experimentation (justs like any form of experimentation) requires a good deal of centralized control. There has to be directors, a shared vision, and the means of attaining it (which in this case is all the nasty powers that are a part of the state apparatus).<br><br>A traditional conservative doesn't agree with this. It believes that humans have a relatively fixed nature that, while adaptable, can never be undone. There has never in history been a society where murder was extolled as a virtue, disrespect of your superiors was praised, and lying to your mother was rewarded, to give a few examples. Even societies that engaged in cannibalism did it to honor their ancestors or to dehumanize an enemy, impulses found in our civilization as well as all others. So the idea of social experimentation is quite simply bad. It has little to no upsides and plenty of downsides. Centralizing power and trying to remake mankind have led to more atrocities than any man can name. If it also will never lead to a utopia, or even a fundamental change in human society, why bother?<br><br>In this sense at least, the main thrust of this entire blog is unabashedly conservative. We are not different. It is never different this time, in the ways that matter at least. We will see our civilization decline just as all human civilization declines. No new state model, technology, ideology, or space alien will come along to fix our problems and undo the inevitable result of human nature. Civilizations grow, become dysfunctional, and decline, and that's all there is to it. We can understand that process, perhaps even make it more bearable, but we will not escape it.<br><br>Communism is a utopian fantasy built upon the dream of worldwide enslavement and reprogramming of all mankind. It deserves its place next to Nazism on the shelf of "worst ideas from the 20th century."<br><br><a href=#c4241674030711746844 title="comment permalink">10/24/14, 10:49 PM</a><br><br>

Nobody has thought of building airships in a simpler way rather than putting more complex gizmos and making them hybrids and stuff (apart from this guy: http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/02/gipsy-zeppelin-baseship.html). The reason airships haven't been invested in is because the relative cost of fuel makes investment in improving aircraft easier and more worthwhile. Give it another 20 years and I can definitely see government thinking about investing in airships (the US and Royal Navies already have, for example) due to the vastly increased costs of moving material through the air.<br><br>As for airships being unviable in an energy-constrained society, I'm not too sure whether they will be or not. There are definitely methods of making small and low-fuel airships. Also the cost of building an airship route can be cheaper than building a rail line, since you don't need tracks - and both technologies require metals on a similar scale. If a future society can support rail I reckon it could support airships. In the interim canal barges and tall sail ships will rule. In this case the major 'if' will be the lifting gas. Perhaps future societies will risk using Hydrogen until they find a more suitable gas or way of getting Helium. After all, pioneer pilots took the same sort of risks crossing the Atlantic.<br><br><a href=#c2643441272963414926 title="comment permalink">10/25/14, 4:49 PM</a><br><br>

I think it's obvious that Nazism and other forms of Fascism naturally tend toward the kind of atrocities committed in their name as well.<br><br>Moreover, the sort of communistic systems you describe are quite different than state-level Communism, which is what I was warning against. It's not a straw man argument because it is, in fact, what Marxist-Leninist Communism (and its close cousins) actually believe.<br><br>Now, as I said, a communistic system that is totally voluntary, and which has no strong ideological underpinnings, is a very different sort of gig. But it's practically a different system altogether, such that the two deserve totally different names. State-level, Marxist-based Communism has a utopian dream it seeks to fulfill by dominating the world. That is its stated aim, and it MUST be their aim, given what they believe. A stateless, classless society is impossible so long as other states exist; their very existence requires a standing army by the Communists, and therefore a state apparatus, such that a transition to the final Communist society is impossible.<br><br>But this doesn't apply to some group of people who have decided to place control of their production in the hands of some trusted authority and form a community around it. Heck, that's practically identical to the most common forms of monasticism. And a small group of people (a tribe, a town, whatever) that chooses for themselves to follow that model aren't seeking to impose anything on anyone; they do not carry the ideological baggage. I say leave those people be. They're fine, even if I wouldn't want to be a part of their group.<br><br>But when we're talking about the future of the West, and Communism on a scale any larger than that, the ideological stuff must accompany it. You will never find a populace that will, to a man, willingly give up their control over the means of production. You can only remove the natural law of private property by force. This requires revolution, or at the very least long-term indoctrination (the Fabian or Gramsci approach).<br><br>A group of people who advocate seizing private property by force and imposing via revolution a re-engineering of human society to create a utopia are exactly the kind of scary people I was talking about.<br><br>I wish there were better terms for some of this, but I find the ordinary labels insufficient. I guess you can follow the distinction between Marxist/Engels Communism and non-Marxist communism, with Marxist Communism being the worrisome kind (or any of its children: Trotskyism, Leninism, Maoism, etc.). <br><br>Again, it's not about taking away a community's right to live how they wish, even if it is as communists. It's about stopping the people who want to prevent me and others from living how we choose.<br><br><a href=#c8100624378536828108 title="comment permalink">10/25/14, 6:57 PM</a><br><br>

Join us. We have pie.<br><br>It is certainly true that progressivism and social experimentation are the products of the human mind. But they are a manifestation of an innate human drive - the desire for a better, fairer, more just, more kind world - combined with a particularly strange, modern cultural delusion. We believe, for reasons utterly beyond me, that we are in total control of creation itself.<br><br>Moreover, the tendencies toward utopia and apocalypse that JMG often notes is another quirk of human nature. Regardless of your religious persuasion, the idea of these two contraries manifests itself in all religion, even if it is only as a part of a cycle. It's the consequence of our moral tendencies combined with our need for agency. If our actions really do have a moral dimension (and they do), and we really are able to shape our world (which we can, albeit in a very limited fashion), then we will eventually bring the world to a state of happiness or a state of destruction. This works fine in the spiritual sphere, but in a secular framework it becomes the religion of progress.<br><br>And it just so happens that this particular set of secularized beliefs which were once part of religious frameworks is horrendously destructive. It is destructive in the capitalist form, promoting egoism, hedonism and short-sightedness. It is destructive in the Marxist-communist form, which abandons moral guidelines altogether and imposes its totalitarian doctrine from the top down.<br><br>Of course, as JMG would likely point out, these are not the only two options. It is a false dichotomy. We can take other paths.

I prefaced my last comment by saying I'm no Communist, so for this one I'll say that I'm no Burkean conservative. One flaw in your argument as I see it is in your mistaken idea that social arrangements are "voluntary." The idea that I voluntarily take part in a cash economy based on private property and individually-based "natural" rights is simply not true - or at least understates the difficulties of not taking part. <br><br>This probably isn't the place to argue world-views, but I would like to clarify that "conservatism" doesn't have to come from a narrow view of what human nature is or what humans are capable of.<br><br>The great adaptation of the human animal is the capacity for culture, which hugely expanded the diversity of human arrangements (though not infinitely of course). <br><br>Humans strive (to varying degrees) in whatever cultural system they find themselves in. For deeply motivating reasons, they strive to be liked and respected by the people they want to be liked and respected by; they strive for some degree of material security or success; they strive for the benefit of whatever group they identify with (self, family, tribe, nation). The details of that are more various than admitted by most conservatives – or most members of any culture (who tend to consider their way of doing things the natural, sensible way)<br><br>I agree with conservatives to the point that grandiose social experiments that try to tear people from their culture are doomed to fail. Small scale ones end up trying to replace culture with psychological dependencies (charismatic leaders) and state-scaled one with institutions of oppression. So, again, I agree with conservatives that incremental changes are much more likely to make sense and stick – I just bridle when conservatives invoke “human nature” to limit things to their preferred scope. Yes humans are selfish, but they are also altruistic; they abuse each other, but also have an innate sense of justice; they perceive what’s going on around them and have also the tools to delude themselves and others.<br><br>The collapse of culture (as JMG describes) tears away culture – it destroys some of the things we’ve built our identity on – nation, tribe, family, even self; it destroys the avenues by which we pursued public regard and success. It simplifies things down to a narrower set of options - to homesteads and warbands and the demands of physical survival for example. These are more basic, but to think of it as an underlying “nature” is like thinking of baskets and goat bladders as nature, just because we sometimes forget how to make proper pottery. <br><br>(Please don't take any of this as a personal attack - I'm trying to clarify my difference of opinion in a way that explains why a "progressive" like myself pretty much agrees with most of what JMG has to say here.)<br><br><br><a href=#c5934267219016791267 title="comment permalink">10/26/14, 5:27 AM</a><br><br>

It's about recognizing that in times of crisis, skills and habits are the one thing that can't be taken away from you as long as you're alive. No matter how strong the communities you build now may be, they may not be the communities you have 30 years from now if you're still alive.<br><br>If you're in the suburbs, people may foreclose on properties when they can't afford to pay bills and move closer to their jobs, if you're in the city new people will move in and the landscape will change drastically, if you're in the country people will pour out in search of work and you'll be swept up in a tide of "Okies" searching for this or that promised lands. You may lose jobs and wind up in urban hovels and shanty towns, your town may become the staging ground for a decisive historical battle in some future war and you may have to pick up and move away until it's over only to discover that there's a crater where your house was from a stray missile. You might have to do odd jobs around town, or you may find yourself on the wrong side of whatever government comes into play and decide your chances are better with the insurgents. And if you make it through everything you may finally get your happy ending and have a home, a trade, and a community to carry you through your old age. A community with a mix of languages, customs, and religions that may not be yours.<br><br>There's a lot of on the job training through all that, but it'll be a lot easier if you start building a reportoi of skills and habits that'll make it easier to get accepted into those new communities and get hired into those odd jobs. You can't learn everything so you've got to pick the things that suit you and the future your home town is likely to have. And yes, community building can be one of those skills. The difference between Green Wizardry and Transition is that for Green Wizards the skill of building strong, resilient communities rather than the communities themselves is the thing that's valued and is one skill among many. Is the difference between insulating and weather stripping the house you live in now because you want a strong, resilient house and learning how to weather strip and insulate starting with the house you live in now because you know that's a good thing to know how to do. Yes your house benefits in both cases, but in the latter case you've gained something valuable even if your house gets taken away from you.<br><br><a href=#c3291136454480088616 title="comment permalink">10/26/14, 7:22 AM</a><br><br>

It's going to get VERY interesting in North America as we finally have to come to terms w/limits in short order, and our idealism/optimism finally comes crashing down. I live in the black sheep region of the US, the American South, which has consistently foiled the idealism of the elite regions/coasts by being impoverished, unequal, "backward", etc., at least until recently. We've always been the sore thumb that refused to succumb to the progressive idealism of the rich, elite regions that represent the American norm.<br><br><a href=#c2086123218161020751 title="comment permalink">10/26/14, 7:39 AM</a><br><br>

The Virginia company was explicitly a commercial venture, while the Puritans were a fundamentalist protestant sect that nevertheless became as commercial as the Virginia company (for God and profit was the Puritans' motto) The Puritans became the dominant faction, while the Virginians (southerners) became the minority faction, which is why Americans celebrate that landing at Plymouth rock as thanksgiving rather than the founding of Jamestown (Virginia).

The North side of downtown Lexington has been the ghetto/"bad part of town" for as long as I can remember, yet it's seeing an influx of young people with degrees, many of whom are in to homesteading. It's where I've been hanging out and learning. Much has been made of "gentrification", but I'm not sure that that's what's at work. Most of these people moving in and homesteading aren't sinking a lot of money into the properties, if they drive, they drive older cars. A lot of them rent. They buy secondhand at thrift stores. What I'm thinking is happening is the downward shove JMG has mentioned, that people who, 20 years ago wouldn't have considered these neighborhoods are reconsidering. It also helps that they're pedestrian friendly. It's really poignant for me because these are the same working class neighborhoods where my grandfather grew up poor in the early 20th century. Our prosperity really was a blip in time. ..<br><br><a href=#c1746713640809660056 title="comment permalink">10/26/14, 9:44 AM</a><br><br>

Rainfall patterns matter too. But even more so, good soil will take more than a couple of centuries to build.<br><br>Regarding lighter than air flying machines. I keep wondering why peak-oilers are enamored of them. Perhaps it comes from the Hollywood-created myth that it is strong engines that keep airplanes in the air, and as soon as the engine sputters an airplane dives straight down. Look at a glider (sailplane, not so much hang glider) flying without an engine, and see how efficient long wings and steamlining can be. And staying up is not enough - need to get somewhere! A sailplane can maintain altitude while moving a mile a minute with just a 5 horsepower engine. Airships displace a lot of air as they move, thus require large, multi-hundred horsepower engines to move relatively slowly. As for hot air balloons, they use more fuel per hour, just to keep the air in the balloon hot, while floating at the wind's whim, than a small airplane uses while flying where the pilot pleases at 90 mph.<br><br>If the "floating in air" part is the important part, for freight (rather than reconnaissance), floating on water is far easier. Doesn't work inland (except where canals are feasible), but railroads are the next best thing.<br><br>And yes it is tragic how we throw helium away on frivolous nonsense, and emblematic of how as a species we are no smarter than yeast.

They both fly some of the time but that's about it. I don't really know where to start talking about how all of that affects their performance in different roles. Sailplanes (as well as LTA) have some rather hard to push limits (have a look/listen at the design of the Concordia). Without propulsion a sailplane isn't really such a reliable recon asset that you'd drag it along, just so you can start doing some fair weather recon after a hearty breakfast (once the thermals get going). With a motor it really ain't much of a sailplane anymore. If you land in the field - how do you get it up again? I think it could still serve certain niches in select regions, but there'll be a lot of other things/issues competing for time and resources. <br>I agree pretty much with all of the rest of your post. Though there's a few things: Because floating on water is so easy, it is also easy to rob you on water. Certainly an airship is far from invincible - but if you do the worst stretches at night it isn't so easy/attractive to shoot it down for the random barbarian. And you can outrun many of the other known threats. The last point is that airships don't need a lot of infrastructure maintained - they can go extremely long distances. Resulting in a relatively low maintenance bill. Something very attractive once population has gone down.<br><br>A little mind game on the safety front - what are your guesses for fatalities per billion (1E9 km) a person travels. How would you say they vary between modes of transport (factor of 3 or factors of 3000)? Have a look here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport#Safety. How does this compare with dying through some sickness or smoking? And in a dark age?

Surprisingly I hadn't seen that before. I have put a couple dozen man hours into research of a concept around a hydrogren balloon/blimp/cable based (hopefully) sustainable logging concept. You are supposed to carry compostable matter and equipment to selectively cut trees in a line path along a temporary cable line. I pitched the concept to someone working in development/empowerment in sub-saharan Africa and he hated it. He said people would instantly "weed out" all the valuable old growth and it is very doubtful you'd get (non-competing) compostable waste and not something else (e.g. salt water) as ballast... So I put it on hold until I could think of a way to make that scenario less likely. It is somewhat similar to the aeromodeller as I want low tech or cheap mass products to go into it. It should be transportable by train or horse cart. Non-explosive defects should be good natured and repairable in a few days (with some spares) in the field. Explosion should be survivable with a, say 80% chance that will see you have you only lightly injured. I don't think a higher survival rate, but with a large chance of heavy injury is necessarily better. When it is irreparably damaged it should should be easy to break it down into useful elements (up- or downcycling, e.g. survival blankets, reflectors).<br>I envision making it out of elements (e.g. 1:2:4 shape) that have approx 90 kg equivalent of lift (makes them versatile and possible to handle with weighed down individual - though really I'd have to check empirically what size and tether is most appropriate for what region). They'd get thrown into a net and second bag with (possibly with inflatable (heatable?) pockets to optimize shape a little). This is underpinned by a (spaceframe? - if speeds are low) or beam skeleton (e.g. H-shape) to give you mount points, stretch the shape into something more aerodynamic, and (big difference to to aeromodeller!) build distance between you and the hydrogen. Crew would spend most time in (spring loaded) zorbs (see globe-riding). If something went "poof" overhead the zorbs would zing away. I guess it would make sense to attach a foam flame barrier shading you from the explosion on one side. As you fall down it would/could probably turn aft (a little like a parachute) making it possible to deploy some sort of additional bumper to the front (needs to work on water, trees, and solid ground). My guess would be 2 or 3 bendy sticks with balls on the ends. My former concept was a tandem bubble design with (chainsaw) engines for propulsion - or rather offset. Because I'd launch it downwind, anchor it, and use the engines mostly for offset. It would then anchor with one part and the other part would run out a line and eventually the cable. After that balloons could provide lift to run stuff up and down sloping terrain. In the end you reassemble, wait for the right wind and cast off, or use another set of cables, or have a few donkey pick you up. If it wasn't for the weather - mountains with cable systems are actually pretty good for LTA travel. Depending on the region lighting may be a very serious issue - especially cable tethered. I assume one would have to mount a light ring and one or two more sturdy antennas to the H-frame. I have some sketches, back of envelope calcs, and a bunch of patents and other files I pulled of the net (a little of it in German, the rest probably only a subset in your collection). But if you are serious about this we can talk it through some more - but I really don't want to hi-jack the thread for this too much. After all there are other venues for this: http://transformaking.org/<br><br><br><a href=#c6975916177273383644 title="comment permalink">10/26/14, 5:22 PM</a><br><br>

Definitely agree that a modern style railroad system seems unfeasible.<br>Still, as long as airships can provide an edge in terms of speed, there might be some intersection of speed/payload that makes it applicable. That doesn't necessarily mean that it'll be widespread, of course.<br><br>@Moshe<br>Airships aren't a substitute for faster sailplanes or gliders. For heavier-than-air aircraft the factor of power required to increase speed is much less than that required to increase weight. Airships are the opposite. This is just the law of aerodynamics. The slower the airship, the better it is in power consumption. Hence the amount of power you need is similarly less as you don't need large amounts of thrust to generate dynamic lift needed to keep the thing in the air. There's an intersection of speed/load below which airships are better, and above which aircraft are better. As for MRIs and such, those things definitely won't be around in the future.<br><br>Most of these disagreements are simply based on how much energy and what level of infrastructure is available if built from virtually, scratch.

I can understand where you would get that picture from, given my comments, but allow me to clarify. I believe that men possess a set of rights, which includes the right to the product of his own labor. If I grow food on my land, I think it's quite fair and true to say that it's mine. The same applies to anything else I produce, and to my labor itself.<br><br>The state provides a number of services which I benefit from, which includes the protection of my private property rights (as well as preserving me from harm, and so on). As such, it's not unfair or unreasonable for the state to ask for some share of what I produce to sustain itself, and this is taxation obviously. So long as the state does what it fundamentally exists to do - primarily defend its citizens from harm external and internal, though a few other things could be added to that category - then it is a legitimate state, to which I owe my allegiance. It is not a voluntary relationship.<br><br>When it comes to my labor, however, or any of my other God-given rights, these can only lawfully be taken from me by my consent. To violate my person without my consent is evil and criminal, whether it be assault, rape, murder, and so on. To violate my private property rights is theft, vandalism, etc. But a communistic system takes control of the means of production, which includes my labor. This is mine by right. That means, for it to be just, legitimate, and non-criminal, I must give it up voluntarily to them. That is legitimate, and that is what smaller communes entail; I swear a vow of poverty and obedience to my abbot, making me part of a voluntary communist organization. This is not the case with a Marxist-Communist state. Therefore it violates our rights by its very nature, and is inherently criminal and evil.<br><br>In short: a state is not a voluntary organization, but it is only legitimate so long as it preserves its citizens' rights by natural law. A communist society requires citizens to give up their rights; therefore it is only lawful when it is entirely voluntary. It is fair to say, then, that a Marxist-Communist state is evil.<br><br>As for your remaining comments, well, I think in some ways you may be conflating Burkean conservatism with a Hobbesian philosophy and/or Adam Smith's economic model. The two are correlated, but are not necessarily tied together. I don't agree with Adam Smith's model, or with Hobbes' view of mankind. I agree that, just as progressives can outright dismiss the existence of a fundamental human nature, some conservatives can overstate what is fundamental to human nature and human society. I don't disagree with anything you say about human nature there; I only (perhaps) disagree with the idea that the state must be the method of expressing it.<br><br>This ties to another idea about the nature of the state, but I've ranted quite a bit here so I'll only glance upon it. The nature of the state is violence - force - whether direct or indirect. It is the means by which the will of some ruling power is imposed upon the people. This is entirely acceptable in some cases (imposing a "no murder" rule is quite a good thing) and bad in others (stealing a person's labor through slavery or forced communism). After all, if the state enacts a program I disagree with, it's not as though I can withhold the portion of my taxes that go to that program. If I do, force will be used against me. In brief, the state should only demand from us those things for which they could justly throw us in prison. What qualifies for that line is debatable, but that's where the line is in my opinion.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c5386418665510792429 title="comment permalink">10/26/14, 6:22 PM</a><br><br>

I have been writing to the comment section of this blog irregularly for some time. I have noticed numerous times that describing reality as it is in large parts of the world leads to somekind "good versus evil"-debate with some other commenters. I believe it was Norman Mailer in his "Harlot's ghost" who wrote that to encounter true believer during Cold War you had to meet American, that Russians had wary, somewhat cynical but yet patriotic attitude towards their own country. To have gritty but at the same time patriotic view towards one's own nation seems to be very rare combination in your country. It is either first or second, not both at the same time. This fact was quite a surprise for me, because in Russia and even in China that mentioned combination is very common. It's collision of idealist worldview with pragmatic realpolitik of the other side. I honestly believe that many main players in the East have already picked up the fact of energy crisis at least, and they are playing their hand accordingly with long view objectives in their mind. Again, to my surprise, it doesn't seem to be fact with your nation. Short term gains and quarter-based thinking seems to dominate decision making. Sad thing, because in the past US had deep, positive impact to European affairs, and there still lingers a lot of gratitude for that... But time doesn't stop it's march, and that seems to belong to the past.<br><br>Russo-Serbian axis of friendship was long time coming, and first time it's modern version was announced in football terraces of Eastern Europe. At the same time, resentment of those groups who suffered the most during bolshevik rule, like West Ukrainians, towards Russian recovery made them to turn whatever source of inspiration, even if it means commemorating Galizien or displaying auf deutsch wolfsangel. This is no politburo scheme or elite conspiracy, it's genuine grassroots uprising at the both sides against old tribal enemies and Western post-World War Two progressive ideology. For me it seems that large parts of Eastern European youth and big segments of society there have shrugged teachings of the Sixties from their shoulders and turned to older values for their self-image. Not all, but many. I mentioned this trend two years ago in this blog, before football hooligans turned into paramilitary death squads again... Now the connection of grassroots counter-culture of hoods and football terraces making union with political powers with ruthless realpolitik in their minds has became obvious even for mainstream journalists...evolving into fullgrown ideology of the hood, of the lower-middle and working classes.<br><br><a href=#c3472304160273189811 title="comment permalink">10/27/14, 7:26 AM</a><br><br>

Not when you are trying to travel a ways with it. Blimps may or may not be useful for tethered lifting, but in real travel, with the wind blowing, too slow an airspeed may be efficient but it means negative groundspeed. Anything much less than about a-mile-a-minute is not very useful for travel by air. And the huge size (relative to payload) of the lighter-than-air devices means they are energy intensive to push through the air at such speeds. And in the case of hot air balloons, just keeping the thing bouyant (hot) is energy intensive. The procurement of hydrogen or helium is energy intensive too. In most circumstances I would expect the scarce energy is better spent on railroads, especially when and where scrap steel is available for salvage.<br><br>I also am not too hopeful that "simple engines running on ethanol", for either type of aircraft, are feasible. Internal combustion engines, to be practical (with a long enough running life) need advanced metalurgy (and thus a vast supply network). The Wright brothers designed and built their own engines, a marvel of power to weight ratio for the time, but they were only good for running a few hours, a proof-of-concept. Late in WW2 the almost-defeated Germans were building airplanes with primitive metalurgy engines, due to their loss of mineral sources and advanced industrial facilities. Not lack of knowledge, mind you. And those engines too only lasted for a few hours of runtime. But typically long enough to be shot down...<br><br>Craft floating on water can not only carry much heavier payloads than those floating on air, they can also utilize their contact with both the water and the wind (via keels and sails) to travel crosswind and even (more slowly, by tacking) upwind. This trick is not available to airships.<br><br><br><a href=#c276340319098566822 title="comment permalink">10/27/14, 2:03 PM</a><br><br>

As a fairly rebellious person, I was shocked to see how much I agreed with TC when I read the wiki page.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditionalist_conservatism#The_new_conservatives<br><br>I’ve only read the British take on TC so far. The emphasis on agrarianism, local and regionalism, the condemnation of big business as well as big government, the criticism of the idea of material progress, and of the notion that wealth, prosperity, and economic gain were the sum of human existence. We also share a fondness for the wisdom found within Classical and other ancient texts. All great stuff. So far, so good. <br><br>In America, so called conservatives have mocked or abandoned most of these TC ideas, and kept people like me from even considering any ideology using with the word conservative. That is truly a shame. I had read some of Chesterton's biting criticism of the crassness of capitalism, and the ideas of E F Schumacher (who has a following among the left). It seems that these TC ideas could be combined with some of the better ideas of the left to create the foundation of a truly sound, sensible, and comprehensive political movement.<br><br>Though I’m still working the hierarchy stuff, which for me, must be based on something truly legitimate and just.

It's pretty amazing when you open your eyes. <br><br>We were near Portland, OR this weekend. They recently had to shelve a plan to replace the aging I-5 bridge between Portland and WA State (the one that 125,000 people travel on every single day; the one that engineers have already said will not remain standing during a major earthquake). Why did they shelve it? Well, WA State, which had originally agreed to fund 1/2 of the cost of replacement, pulled out, citing the no-new-taxes pledge made by the State Senate. No funding. Well, Oregon can't pay for the bridge replacement themselves. They estimate it will take another 5-10 years to get to this same decision place again (why so long, I'm not sure).

I don't think the natural state of man is nasty, brutish, and short, and that the state is a mechanism for preventing that. I think that man is inherently social; the family, the tribe, the clan, the town, the nation are the natural state of man. We are meant to be communal, to cooperate, to be altruistic. We have vicious impulses too, to be sure, but no man I've ever met acted out of anything but an intent to do good, even when he did what was evil.<br><br>Gloucon X -<br>Yes, the modern "conservative" establishment has absolutely nothing to do with the original ideas of traditional conservativism. Subsidiarity has been abandoned entirely, the size of government and its connections to corrupt corporations is a non-concern, and they do nothing more than pander to a superficial sort of religious-political organization. They are inconsistent, dishonest, immoral, and at this point don't even feign traditional conservativism in their speeches anymore.

This makes me feel like the global industrial economic engine is already pretty low on steam, and leaves me pondering that maybe we are actually about a hundred years farther along on the hypothetical sample timeline presented here. I'm just not sure there's enough *oomph* left for all those large-scale wars, global hegemony, etc. I know JMG disagrees, we've discussed it before, he thinks there's enough room for one more global hegemon to arise during the remainder of the 21st Century, but that'll be the end of it. I'm still doubtful we can even support that one final one. Dissensus. <br><br>Another note about my "20th Century rebooted" analysis of this future history -- in this framework of mirroring the last century, one big thing is missing from the 2080s -- the second global pandemic, which was never really brought under control and continued killing people by the millions 30 years later. Eventually humans simply had to evolve genetic resistance to it, a process that was not really complete until near the *end* of the dark ages. In case anyone has forgotten, HIV is still killing as many people in Africa *every week* as Ebola has killed in its entire history (though mostly in a different part of the continent). Life expectancy in some countries has dropped from the 60s to the 30s. Globally, HIV deaths are only kept under control by expensive high-tech medications, and the virus continues spreading even in the "developed" world. Without the global pharmaceutical industry (something that sits very high on the energy pyramid), AIDS comes back with a vengance and deaths climb and climb and climb. Transmission also accelerates, since the meds lower the viral load in the blood and cut the risk of transmission by orders of magnitude. Plus, poverty and its associated conditions (medical and sociological) enhance HIV transmission. <br><br>This pandemic began in the previous century, and likely has several more centuries to run.<br><br><a href=#c4778927630243753501 title="comment permalink">10/28/14, 12:25 PM</a><br><br>

Green Wizardry isn't all about organic gardening and wind turbines, and there’s a lot that can be done without any tools at all. If you're interested in community and diplomacy, a Green Wizard could maybe start by finding time to volunteer with a prison outreach program or homeless shelter to get an idea of what the communities you'll be a part of someday will look like. Talk to people, especially very poor people who live in areas ruled by urban gangs about how they survive and how they navigate their worlds and power structures. If you’ve got a gift for it, learn the languages that you think will give you an edge in the future (Spanish, Mandarin, and Arabic, are all good bets depending on where you live and a syncretic language like Haitian Creole can give you a picture of the way languages change as populations mingle). The core of Green Wizardry is that it works within historical processes that began before anyone live today was born and will continue after everyone alive today has died. That means it has to adapt to that world as it materializes around us and the best way to do that is by participating in and adapting to a changing world, rather than prepping for or creating a world that may arrive someday.<br><br>Dltrammel: I may be asking a question with a stupidly obvious answer, but how do I actually join the Green Wizardry Forums?

Here's my Fairies of Progress and Decline...<br><br>Xestobium rufovillosum rubigosum of the order Coleoptera, vulgar "The fairies of Progress and Decline", are indeed one species. Its natural habitat is typically near gradients of concentrated energy, where it is generally found in a sort of anaerobic hibernation in which can have markedly different morphologies. The most common resembles a statue human likeness (often with a high concentration of noble metals in the skin), less often it is found in the form of a mathematical formula, or a political text. When conditions are right (abundant flows of concentrated energy, hot exhalations of other species, and a raised background noise level) it begins an intricate mating behavior. Their mating calls have been shown to mimic simple human exclamations, or that of other species such as the "Muse fairy". There seem to be certain key phrases that are necessary for a precopulatory ritual such as "They will think of something!" but only a fraction of them could be positively identified thus far.<br>A large (prime) number of eggs are placed in the feathers of a black swan where they slowly develop over several Kondratieff cycles. The time until hatching is rather variable and is probably triggered by external conditions. There is significant evidence of a coordinated hatching of a large fraction of larvae, typically on a Friday or a Monday. Their diet has been shown to have a large influence on their chance to develop into a "Fairy of Progress", a "False Hope", or a "Fairy of Decline". Misunderstandings, bad ideas, and mistakes in unit conversions lead to development of a "Fairy of Decline". It is unknown which elements are necessary to breed the increasingly rare "Fairy of Progress". Attempts to do this under controlled conditions in captivity have only resulted in "False Hopes" which differ in morphology only in the later stages of development but are said to excrete a slightly more pungent pheromone early on.<br>The fully developed "Fairy of Progress" has the appearance of a human torso and head with technicolor butterfly wings made of nanoscopic photovoltaic elements. The abdomen resembles that of a chrome skinned grasshopper with turbines on the last pair of legs, anti-grav pads on the mid pair, and a set of blue laser pointers on the front pair. The humans hands often initiate an electric arc in which they can refine lead to gold given a suitable protective atmosphere which is contained in the removable helmet. <br>Unlike its cousin the "False Hope" most "Fairies of Progress" are very reclusive and generally communicate with indirect visual cues and only sometimes in the high audible range (generally as alarm), however asked to elaborate they generally become more excited and drift well into the ultrasonic range. When threatened they will extend a sting which is a powerful antibiotic and cure for most known illnesses. The long held belief that any machine treated with "Progress Fairy" pulp will increase its efficiency above unity has been disproved several times however.<br><br><a href=#c1831265803000989283 title="comment permalink">10/29/14, 3:17 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_b6373a" id=c7884169881057734756></div><b><a href=http://latefall.wordpress.com/ rel=nofollow>latefall</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Observing the "Fairy of Decline" in the wild has proven extremely difficult. So far only 3 clearly independent cases have been observed. The least controversial one was a chance find in a 40 foot container which was only deemed significant after discovery of a sinkhole under it. The most accepted hypothesis is that the larvae undergo a so called dematerialization step (strictly speaking a misnomer) where its matter is spread out in a very rapid and highly complex manner. The result of this is a cascade of dislocated particles and emission of a spectrum of highly energetic (ionizing) radiation that at certain times pulse quite intensely at a soft x-ray energy level. So far this has been the only opportunity to visualize "The Fairy of Decline" in any form. Unfortunately no digital records of this survive anymore, which has been attributed to the notorious "grey shift" or "black shift", named so for the propensity of complex equipment to fail fully, or more often for critical times and functions. It is speculated that the "Fairy of Decline" lives to a large degree not in "our time" but a mathematical derivative thereof. This hypothesis is supported by the large concentration of strange loops and self ordered criticality if interpreted as change over time. The mentioned x-ray pulse events have also been shown to correlate with stock market events, but typically precede them. <br>Most of the above is derived from the so called "Pandora's Box" case, which was unwittingly monitored when a customs officer forgot to switch off the mobile freight x-ray device receiver. <br>Reconstructions of the damaged solid state disc are imperfect but they seem to show an abnormally large morbidly obese human in inverted fetal position who fills more than 3/4 of the container volume. There are clearly visible round mouth parts on the side opposite to the apparently false face, as well as long irregular antenna-like protrusions identified as Zircalloy. Protrusions barely visible at the sides of the body could be spiracles, but this is strongly contested. The whole body seems to have a high concentration of particularly toxic compounds and heavy metals. Locomotion could not be observed over larger distances but locations of movement seemed to correlate with locally increased entropy and corrosion, as well as isotope analysis from the sinkhole. <br><br><br><a href=#c7884169881057734756 title="comment permalink">10/29/14, 3:25 PM</a><br><br>
