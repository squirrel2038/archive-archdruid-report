<div class=MsoNormal>
The <a href=../../2014/09/dark-age-america-senility-of-elites.html>senility that afflicts ruling elites in their last years</a>, the theme of the previous post in this sequence, is far from the only factor leading the rich and influential members of a failing civilization to their eventual destiny as lamppost decorations or come close equivalent. Another factor, at least as important, is a lethal mismatch between the realities of power in an age of decline and the institutional frameworks inherited from a previous age of ascent. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That sounds very abstract, and appropriately so. Power in a mature civilization <i>is</i> very abstract, and the further you ascend the social ladder, the more abstract it becomes. Conspiracy theorists of a certain stripe have invested vast amounts of time and effort in quarrels over which specific group of people it is that runs everything in today’s America. All of it was wasted, because the nature of power in a mature civilization precludes the emergence of any one center of power that dominates all others. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Look at the world through the eyes of an elite class and it’s easy to see how this works. Members of an elite class compete against one another to increase their own wealth and influence, and form alliances to pool resources and counter the depredations of their rivals. The result, in every human society complex enough to have an elite class in the first place, is an elite composed of squabbling factions that jealously resist any attempt at further centralization of power. In times of crisis, that resistance can be overcome, but in less troubled times, any attempt by an individual or faction to seize control of the whole system faces the united opposition of the rest of the elite class.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One result of the constant defensive stance of elite factions against each other is that as a society matures, power tends to pass from individuals to institutions. Bureaucratic systems take over more and more of the management of political, economic, and cultural affairs, and the policies that guide the bureaucrats in their work slowly harden until they are no more subject to change than the law of gravity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Among its other benefits to the existing order of society, this habit—we may as well call it policy mummification—limits the likelihood that an ambitious individual can parlay control over a single bureaucracy into a weapon against his rivals.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Our civilization is no exception to any of this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the modern industrial world, some bureaucracies are overtly part of the political sphere; others—we call them corporations—are supposedly apart from government, and still others like to call themselves “non-governmental organizations” as a form of protective camouflage. They are all part of the institutional structure of power, and thus function in practice as arms of government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They have more in common than this; most of them have the same hierarchical structure and organizational culture; those that are large enough to matter have executives who went to the same schools, share the same values, and crave the same handouts from higher up the ladder. No matter how revolutionary their rhetoric, for that matter, upsetting the system that provides them with their status and its substantial benefits is the last thing any of them want to do. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All these arrangements make for a great deal of stability, which the elite classes of mature civilizations generally crave. The downside is that it’s not easy for a society that’s proceeded along this path to change its ways to respond to new circumstances. Getting an entrenched bureaucracy to set aside its mummified policies in the face of changing conditions is generally so difficult that it’s often easier to leave the old system in place while redirecting all its important functions to another, newly founded bureaucracy oriented toward the new policies. If conditions change again, the same procedure repeats, producing a layer cake of bureaucratic organizations that all supposedly exist to do the same thing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Consider, as one example out of many, the shifting of responsibility for US foreign policy over the years. Officially, the State Department has charge of foreign affairs; in practice, its key responsibilities passed many decades ago to the staff of the National Security Council, and more recently have shifted again to coteries of advisers assigned to the Office of the President.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In each case, what drove the shift was the attachment of the older institution to a set of policies and procedures that stopped being relevant to the world of foreign policy—in the case of the State Department, the customary notions of old-fashioned diplomacy; in the case of the National Security Council, the bipolar power politics of the Cold War era—but could not be dislodged from the bureaucracy in question due to the immense inertia of policy mummification in institutional frameworks. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The layered systems that result are not without their practical advantages to the existing order. Many bureaucracies provide even more stability than a single bureaucracy, since it’s often necessary for the people who actually have day to day responsibility for this or that government function to get formal approval from the top officials of the agency or agencies that used to have that responsibility, Even when those officials no longer have any formal way to block a policy they don’t like, the personal and contextual nature of elite politics means that informal options usually exist. Furthermore, since the titular headship of some formerly important body such as the US State Department confers prestige but not power, it makes a good consolation prize to be handed out to also-rans in major political contests, a place to park well-connected incompetents, or what have you. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who recall the discussion of catabolic collapse three weeks ago will already have figured out one of the problems with the sort of system that results from the processes just sketched out:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the maintenance bill for so baroque a form of capital is not small. In a mature civilization, a large fraction of available resources and economic production end up being consumed by institutions that no longer have any real function beyond perpetuating their own existence and the salaries and prestige of their upper-level functionaries. It’s not unusual for the maintenance costs of unproductive capital of this kind to become so great a burden on society that the burden in itself forces a crisis—that was one of the major forces that brought the French Revolution, for instance. Still, I’d like to focus for a moment on a different issue, which is the effect that the institutionalization of power and the multiplication of bureaucracy has on the elites who allegedly run the system from which they so richly benefit. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
France in the years leading up to the Revolution makes a superb example, one that John Kenneth Galbraith discussed with his trademark sardonic humor in his useful book <i>The Culture of Contentment</i>. The role of ruling elite in pre-1789 France was occupied by close equivalents of the people who fill that same position in America today: the “nobility of the sword,” the old feudal aristocracy, who had roughly the same role as the holders of inherited wealth in today’s America, and the “nobility of the robe,” who owed their position to education, political office, and a talent for social climbing, and thus had roughly the same role as successful Ivy League graduates do here and now. These two elite classes sparred constantly against each other, and just as constantly competed against their own peers for wealth, influence, and position. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the most notable features of both sides of the French elite in those days was just how little either group actually had to do with the day-to-day management of public affairs, or for that matter of their own considerable wealth. The great aristocratic estates of the time were bureaucratic societies in miniature, ruled by hierarchies of feudal servitors and middle-class managers, while the hot new financial innovation of the time, the stock market, allowed those who wanted their wealth in a less tradition-infested form to neglect every part of business ownership but the profits. Those members of the upper classes who held offices in government, the church, and the other venues of power presided decorously over institutions that were perfectly capable of functioning without them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The elite classes of mature civilizations almost always seek to establish arrangements of this sort, and understandably so. It’s easy to recognize the attractiveness of a state of affairs in which the holders of wealth and influence get all the advantages of their positions and have to put up with as few as possible of the inconveniences thereof. That said, this attraction is also a death wish, because it rarely takes the people who actually do the work long to figure out that a ruling class in this situation has become entirely parasitic, and that society would continue to function perfectly well were something suitably terminal to happen to the titular holders of power. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is why most of the revolutions in modern history have taken place in nations in which the ruling elite has followed its predilections and handed over all its duties to subordinates. In the case of the American revolution, the English nobility had been directly involved in colonial affairs in the first century or so after Jamestown. Once it left the colonists to manage their own affairs, the latter needed very little time to realize that the only thing they had to lose by seeking independence was the steady hemorrhage of wealth from the colonies to England. In the case of the French and Russian revolutions, much the same thing happened without the benefit of an ocean in the way: the middle classes who actually ran both societies recognized that the monarchy and aristocracy had become disposable, and promptly disposed of them once a crisis made it possible to do so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The crisis just mentioned is a significant factor in the process. Under normal conditions, a society with a purely decorative ruling elite can keep on stumbling along indefinitely on sheer momentum. It usually takes a crisis—Britain’s military response to colonial protests in 1775, the effective bankruptcy of the French government in 1789, the total military failure of the Russian government in 1917, or what have you—to convince the people who actually handle the levers of power that their best interests no longer lie with their erstwhile masters. Once the crisis hits, the unraveling of the institutional structures of authority can happen with blinding speed, and the former ruling elite is rarely in a position to do anything about it. All they have ever had to do, and all they know how to do, is issue orders to deferential subordinates. When there are none of these latter to be found, or (as more often happens) when the people to whom the deferential subordinates are supposed to pass the orders are no longer interested in listening, the elite has no options left. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The key point to be grasped here is that power is always contextual. A powerful person is a person able to exert particular kinds of power, using particular means, on some particular group of other people, and someone thus can be immensely powerful in one setting and completely powerless in another. What renders the elite classes of a mature society vulnerable to a total collapse of power is that they almost always lose track of this unwelcome fact. Hereditary elites are particularly prone to fall into the trap of thinking of their position in society as an accurate measure of their own personal qualifications to rule, but it’s also quite common for those who are brought into the elite from the classes immediately below to think of their elevation as proof of their innate superiority. That kind of thinking is natural for elites, but once they embrace it, they’re doomed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s dangerous enough for elites to lose track of the contextual and contingent nature of their power when the mechanisms through which power is enforced can be expected to remain in place—as it was in the American colonies in 1776, France in 1789, and Russia in 1917. It’s far more dangerous if the mechanisms of power themselves are in flux. That can happen for any number of reasons, but the one that’s of central importance to the theme of this series of posts is the catabolic collapse of a declining civilization, in which the existing mechanisms of power come apart because their maintenance costs can no longer be met.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That poses at least two challenges to the ruling elite, one obvious and the other less so. The obvious one is that any deterioration in the mechanisms of power limits the ability of the elite to keep the remaining mechanisms of power funded, since a great deal of power is always expended in paying the maintenance costs of power. Thus in the declining years of Rome, for example, the crucial problem the empire faced was precisely that the sprawling system of imperial political and military administration cost more than the imperial revenues could support, but the weakening of that system made it even harder to collect the revenues on which the rest of the system depended, and forced more of what money there was to go for crisis management. Year after year, as a result, roads, fortresses, and the rest of the infrastructure of Roman power sank under a burden of deferred maintenance and malign neglect, and the consequences of each collapse became more and more severe because there was less and less in the treasury to pay for rebuilding when the crisis was over. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the obvious issue. More subtle is the change in the nature of power that accompanies the decay in the mechanisms by which it’s traditionally been used. Power in a mature civilization, as already noted, is very abstract, and the people who are responsible for administering it at the top of the social ladder rise to those positions precisely because of their ability to manage abstract power through the complex machinery that a mature civilization provides them. As the mechanisms collapse, though, power stops being abstract in a hurry, and the skills that allow the manipulation of abstract power have almost nothing in common with the skills that allow concrete power to be wielded. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Late imperial Rome, again, is a fine example. There, as in other mature civilizations, the ruling elite had a firm grip on the intricate mechanisms of social control at their uppermost and least tangible end. The inner circle of each imperial administration—which sometimes included the emperor himself, and sometimes treated him as a sock puppet—could rely on sprawling many-layered civil and military bureaucracies to put their orders into effect. They were by and large subtle, ruthless, well-educated men, schooled in the intricacies of imperial administration, oriented toward the big picture, and completely dependent on the obedience of their underlings and the survival of the Roman system itself. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The people who replaced them, once the empire actually fell, shared none of these characteristics except the ruthlessness. The barbarian warlords who carved up the corpse of Roman power had a completely different set of skills and characteristics: raw physical courage, a high degree of competence in the warrior’s trade, and the kind of charisma that attracts cooperation and obedience from those who have many other options. Their power was concrete, personal, and astonishingly independent of institutional forms. That’s why Odoacer, whose remarkable career was mentioned in <a href=../../2014/09/dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html>an earlier post in this sequence</a>, could turn up alone in a border province, patch together an army out of a random mix of barbarian warriors, and promptly lead them to the conquest of Italy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There were a very few members of the late Roman elite who could exercise power in the same way as Odoacer and his equivalents, and they’re the exceptions that prove the rule. The greatest of them, Flavius Aetius, spent many years in youth as a hostage in the royal courts of the Visigoths and the Huns and got his practical education there, rather than in Roman schools. He was for all practical purposes a barbarian warlord who happened to be Roman by birth, and played the game as well as any of the other warlords of his age. His vulnerabilities were all on the Roman side of the frontier, where the institutions of Roman society still retained a fingernail grip on power, and so—having defeated the Visigoths, the Franks, the Burgundians, and the massed armies of Attila the Hun, all for the sake of Rome’s survival—he was assassinated by the emperor he served. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Fast forward close to two thousand years and it’s far from difficult to see how the same pattern of elite extinction through the collapse of political complexity will likely work out here in North America. The ruling elites of our society, like those of the late Roman Empire, are superbly skilled at manipulating and parasitizing a fantastically elaborate bureaucratic machine which includes governments, business firms, universities, and many other institutions among its components. That’s what they do, that’s what they know how to do, and that’s what all their training and experience has prepared them to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus their position is exactly equivalent to that of French aristocrats before 1789, but they’re facing the added difficulty that the vast mechanism on which their power depends has maintenance costs that their civilization can no longer meet. As the machine fails, so does their power. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nor are they particularly well prepared to make the transition to a radically different way of exercising power. Imagine for a moment that one of the current US elite—an executive from a too-big-to-fail investment bank, a top bureaucrat from inside the DC beltway, a trust-fund multimillionaire with a pro forma job at the family corporation, or what have you—were to turn up in some chaotic failed state on the fringes of the industrial world, with no money, no resources, no help from abroad, and no ticket home. What’s the likelihood that, without anything other than whatever courage, charisma, and bare-knuckle fighting skills he might happen to have, some such person could equal Odoacer’s feat, win the loyalty and obedience of thousands of gang members and unemployed mercenaries, and lead them in a successful invasion of a neighboring country? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
There are people in North America who could probably carry off a feat of that kind, but you won’t find them in the current ruling elite. That in itself defines part of the path to dark age America: the replacement of a ruling class that specializes in managing abstract power through institutions with a ruling class that specializes in expressing power up close and in person, using the business end of the nearest available weapon. The process by which the new elite emerges and elbows its predecessors out of the way, in turn, is among the most reliable dimensions of decline and fall; we’ll talk about it next week. </div>

Men who are brave under fire , tough and resourceful when placed in unexpected situations , willing to quickly cast off their previous assumptions and forge a new set , intuitive , not bound to reason or dogma , extremely adaptable . I suppose these qualities are relatively incompatible within a system that requires passive conformity and stultifying rigidity , the willingness to operate an existing system rather than create one .<br>Higher Commands in modern militaries are i suppose modelled along corporate lines , and the highest ranks may be noteworthy for their uncanny resemblance to the modern corporate CEO , difficult i guess, to say who was modelled on who . <br>During the breakdown of a vast Empire , i wonder if it would be someone from the lower echelons of military ( or gang ) command who finds themselves most suited to leadership in a fragmenting , dynamic situations. During WW2 , Generals such as Patton and Rommell became famous as dynamic commanders at Corps level , though both were considered too "unpredictable and highly strung" for higher echelon command . Perhaps it may be that some people from non military even civilian structures suddenly grow into themselves during such periods. <br>Though ex military may have some early running , as evidenced by Dmitri Orlovs observations in the failed Soviet Union , they are by no means the only candidates . I have a friend here in Oz from the northern territory who is a born leader ; tough fearless and resourceful . Around 40 now , he is still fit as a bull ; extremely familiar with the outback , excellent horseman , welder , eough mechanic ,helicopter pilot, good shot ; can butcher own meat . This bloke can throw a scrub bull and tie it up or discuss red wine or politics , though quite irrationally cierce when angered. Educated at good boarding school , intelligent , charismatic , never been anywhere near the military , of sober habits , excellent even temperament . Already a practicing dictator within his own vast outback fiefdom , seems to be able to relate to people of all walks of life . <br>Not unlike Kunstlers character in "world made by hand " . They exist , i have met them , no doubt they will emerge . This is the type of bloke that would only have entered the military when conscripted for war , and would have quickly found himself commanding a battallion. <br>In the ranks of pilots , i have noticed it is the Oedipal types who are often close to their mothers who seem to have the greatest penchant or driving need for heroism , and this can be explored through the history and writings of famous warriors such as Wing Commander Guy Gibson and Wing Commander Brian Kincome in his excellent philosophical tract "A willingness to die " . It seems an absent father helps ( either emotionally or physically).<br><br><a href=#c6760368035687718682 title="comment permalink">10/8/14, 4:58 PM</a><br><br>

What hits closer to home, and this may be true for many of your readers, is that we often view ourselves less as power-wielders than we do as power-resisters. Even the act of reading this blog is, for many of us, an act of resistance against the hegemony of our failing, but still potent society. How many of my lifetime's decisions have been driven by the desire to have more control over my life and shield myself from the meddling of others? So when you talk about how techniques of power become just so much obsolete baggage, I immediately wonder to myself how many of my current strategies of resistance are going to prove equally counter-productive and futile.

Particularly since successful revolutions require either a total collapse of the international power structure or foreign support for the revolutionaries.<br><br>(The Russian exception was based on the fact it was essentially a religious crusade. The counter revolutionaries didn't have anything happening soft power wise to counter this advantage of the Reds.)<br><br>(Which isn't to say such couldn't happen in America. It all depends if there's enough fuel left in Christianity's feed stock for one more Great Awakening with just that particular tone and pitch to make revolution into a Crusade. Christian militant rhetoric is quite bellicose but if they _truly_ believed their own rhetoric, I don't understand why the Crusade hasn't started yet.)<br><br>The thing is technology and power intensive technologies make repression in advanced societies very efficient. And America's mythology plus its high level of wealth makes people very reluctant to try changing the established order. The American elites had an epic success convincing the people they are parasites upon that their victims' best interests are the same as those who feed on them. I understand that mass poverty can change this. But it seems we're still a ways off from a quick or extreme enough drop in material well being to set things off?<br><br>I'm not saying the situation can't change very quickly.

This is one reason why the Ulysses S Grant’s, George Patton’s and Erwin Rommel’s of the world have such a hard time in the peacetime military. The real warriors and war leaders tend to get pushed aside in favor of the bootlickers and paper pushers. But as Fleet Admiral Ernie King once famously put it "When they get in trouble, they send for the sons-of-bitches." Historically, many generals, admirals, colonels and warship captains have tended to be relieved of command in the early stages of a war when it becomes clear they can’t lead effectively in combat.<br><br>It has also been observed that one major reason why revolutionary armies like the PLA during the Chinese Civil War, the IDF in its heyday (1940’s to early 1970’s) and the Waffen SS often outdo their more conventional counterparts is because they haven’t been around long enough for bureaucratic encrustation to build up, they tend to focus on basics like combat training and leadership and in such armies, the officers are generally promoted based on how well they do as frontline leaders and this does wonders for morale since the soldiers know they are being led by men who have proven their courage, competence and leadership ability in the toughest crucible of all. I expect this will be one of the factors that drives the decline of conventional armies and the rise of warbands and insurgent armies like the ones we are seeing emerge in Mexico and the Middle East.<br><br><a href=#c487115071632608119 title="comment permalink">10/8/14, 7:08 PM</a><br><br>

But from my own personal life experience, at least up until a few years ago, the situation seemed more complicated. My perspective has changed more recently though. <br><br>Growing up in the UK in the 60s, 70s and 80s I lived through the final coming apart of the old class system, and its replacement by a more meritocratic system. Sure there were still plenty of entitled (figuratively and literally) members of the old guard running the big bureaucracies, but there was a distinct influx of members of the working and middle classes getting into real positions of economic, cultural and political power at that time. It seemed like the old guard was changing, or at least letting a wider cross-section of people into the tent. And then as I moved to the US in the early 90s this country seemed by comparison to be even more meritocratic and, at least back then, its reputation for upward mobility even had basis in fact. So for my first few decades my lived experience was of the ruling elite of these advanced societies becoming more inclusive. Or perhaps I was just believing the storyline (I'm a trusting sort of fellow).<br><br>Anyway, and the point of my comment, is that this seems to be changing substantially in recent years, as measured by concentrating wealth, reductions in social and economic mobility and the hollowing out of the middle class. I wonder if this in part because the old elite allowed a broader cross-section of meritocratic strivers into the wealth tent from the 80s on, and these same strivers are now striving to hang on to their share of the pie, now that the pie is shrinking? There would be a certain irony to that.<br><br><a href=#c5715374158109597496 title="comment permalink">10/8/14, 7:16 PM</a><br><br>

Not a classical incursion in the way of the old barbarian raids onto Roman turf, but it was an article that appeared in the LA Times.

It seems that for several decades now Latino street gangs have been terrorizing the African American community in the city and surrounding area in what sounds very much like a low-intensity campaign of ethnic cleansing, with blacks subject to threats, intimidation and violent attacks.

A full-out uprising seems unlikely here in the US, unless conditions get a heck of a lot worse, in a relative hurry. Even then, it would probably come in the form of various states trying to secede, possibly leading to Civil War II, rather than guillotines and gibbets. Surveillance and enforcement might possibly be able to stop massive uprisings before they start, but the real damper is cultural (Democracy is good! Terrorists are bad! We deserve peace and prosperity! 'Murica!).<br>Admittedly, my perspective may be a bit biased by living in a former state of the Confederacy where the economy hasn't suffered quite so badly in recent years.<br><br>As for Christianity providing fuel for a crusade, this seems a bit unlikely. Christianity is, in general, allied with the elites; the Republican party in particular has done an outstanding job of tapping into that particular source of popular support. In addition, Jesus, who we might recall lived at the beginning of the Roman Empire's decline, actively dissuaded people from armed rebellion - a popular idea in his day - and told his followers to abide by the laws of the land. I guess a militant Christian uprising is technically a possibility - after all, the deeply counter-Biblical "Prosperity Gospel" has a pretty wide following - but realistically, I'd expect to see a few Branch-Davidian style incidents, and not much more.<br><br>However, I do predict that Christianity will still be around long after the United States are a thing of the past. It's shown itself to be resilient and adaptable over its 2000-year history, probably because it keys into some fairly universal quirks of human psychology (Feel inadequate? That's OK, Jesus loves you and died for your sins! Afraid of death? That's OK, you get an eternal afterlife in heaven! ...etc). In addition, there seems to be a phoenix-like pattern - whenever the church starts becoming fossilized and senile, sure enough, some kind of revival or Reformation ignites and sweeps across the cultural landscape, bringing new life in its wake. <br><br>(Amusing note, somewhat related to Christians and right-wingers: Per the New Testament, and especially obvious in the book of Acts... early Christians were literally communists.

The reason for that is simple: In spite of the anti-government, it's-all-falling-apart rhetoric from so many directions, I see the rank and file still 100% invested in the continuation of the system as it is. It may be handing they a raw deal, but they don't really seem to be hungry for something else. In fact, they are hungry for much more of the same, and they are paying no attention whatsoever to the power structures that stand on top of them. Sure there is a lot of talk, but it is for the most part just talk and everyone is quite content, or at least pacified, distracted, and sedated in Mall*Wart McNation. <br><br>Given that money has become even more of a fantasy and a fiction than it used to be, the ability of the "system" to sustain the appearance of itself out of nothing is at astronomical heights. And since we have managed to get just about everyone tied into the system one way or another, directly or indirectly, the health of the Stock Market is now seen as critical to the sustenance of everyone, by everyone. Hence bizarre measures, such as fabricating more imaginary money and pumping it into the market to hold up the imaginary value of nearly-imaginary securities, are done without even blinking an eye. Every time a crunch comes, and people say "here it is, it's all coming down," well, the magic wands are waived and the hologram of a functional economy is turned back on, as lifelike as ever, and everyone settles back down. Sure, there's eventually an end to it, but I have seen so many cycles of this play out in the last 5 decades that I'm not sure what it will take to actually cause the fundamental upheaval. I've seen the populace much more riled up than this, and faith in the central government far lower than it is today, and people even poorer and more destitute in the cities and backwoods, revolution was imminent... and then it all got subdued again. <br><br>Even now, if an energy/food/financial crash hits, people as a whole (in the nation I live in) are going to swarm TOWARDS the existing power structure to rescue them from it, not AWAY. The countryside is not going to fill up with neo-homesteaders and retro-barbarians looking to take care of themselves and sack Rome. It is going to empty out as people flee to the breadlines and [fill in name of current president here]-villes in the cities, where at least they might still get WiFi.<br><br><a href=#c3502523907219029570 title="comment permalink">10/8/14, 9:26 PM</a><br><br>

Television viewers are meant to cheer the cop who punches or shoots his way through suspects, and boo his superiors who want to arrest people “by the book.” Heroes and superheroes win their battles while running from corrupt police or a government conspiracy. <br><br>In real life, activists of the left and right alike want to strip down bureaucracy, candidates must claim to be outsiders ready to fight the government they’re joining, and business gurus host seminars on how to throw the rules out the window. In all areas of life, it seems, Americans want to abandon the organisations and traditions holding people back. <br><br>I don’t think they understand what they wish for.

As long as the cash flow exists, they're in business; when it stops, they're done for. The dependent populations to whom they sell their drugs won't have any money to buy the drugs with, they'll be concerned with buying - or finding - food. It's going to be interesting to see what happens to drug addicts when the supply gets cut off - I'd expect raids on hospital complexes in the inner cities, then doctors' offices and "urgent care" centers. After that, they're going to be out of luck - cold turkey time. Places of large concentrations of dependent drug addicts will not be fun places to be around. A lot of those people are going to wind up dead, one way or another. As a side note, I wouldn't bet on getting tea or coffee, both of which are imported, either.<br><br>The other way that drug gangs are dependent on police - or a totally disarmed population (Mexico has the toughest gun control in the world, with the predictable result that only cops and criminals can get guns) - is that a disarmed population or a population dependent on police make a pretty soft target. When the police go away (or turn into another feral gang as in New Orleans in Katrina), there will be no restraint stopping the population from administering rough justice to gangsters - and there are enough ex-military folk out there to constitute neighborhood patrols and suchlike. Gangsters and police also tend to favor automatic weapons, which waste ammo prodigiously without great result; civilians, if they're smart, will use scoped bolt-action rifles (with longer effective range) and not waste ammo - like those women Kurds in the YPG. Logistics will decide the outcome; with broken or non-existent supply chains, the gangs will soon be in a tough spot.<br><br>If I were going to write a novel of post-collapse America, the Mormon Church would play a big, big role, in fact I could see a Mormon theocracy running things - except in 300 years the First Presidency is likely to be a bit browner than today.

The bigger the predator the higher it is on the food pyramid. With social predators such as lions, the biggest, strongest, shrewdest lion is most often the leader as well. Predators serve a useful and recognized ecological function they keep herbivores and other predators in check and prevent over population and die-off. In human ecologies one could say that they prevent abuses of a relatively minor sorts (thieves, individual murderers) from occurring between the "herbivores" ie peasants. Whish is to say, warlords provide basic governance<br><br>Elites on the other hand are more parasitic. Parasites are highly, highly specialized and limited animals - a tapeworm is pretty much nothing but a digestive system and reproductive system that can live in an animal's gut. There are parasites in everytype of animal but the most parasites are found in apex predators who "bio accumulate" them. It is interesting to note that the smaller a parasite the higher its metabolism. In human ecologies elites usually cluster around the warrior class, those who deal in raw violence. There are more and better funded bureaucracies of war than bureaucracies of agriculture, for instance. Also the higher up the ladder the elites are the more access to wealth and privilege they have, ie "higher metabolism".<br><br>Elites have an important ecological role to, like predators they generally help control population, especially the population of apex predators. Elites frequently, at least in their early days, temper the excesses of warlords.<br><br>It seems in human ecology however there comes to be more and more parasites which are highly specialized to feed on other parasites. The metabolic costs go through the hide, and eventually the host, exhausted form running around day and night devouring herbivores and mid level predators, dies exhausted from the demands of the myriad parasites. New predators quickly evolve to fill the niche, leaving the parasites to die with their host.<br><br><a href=#c3966381042993390901 title="comment permalink">10/9/14, 3:56 AM</a><br><br>

One point to add to the conversation. Its interesting to me how people during and after the decline and collapse, still act as if legitimate power has to come from the same old pre-collapse sources. After the fall of the western Roman Empire for example, various warlords, up to and including Charlemagne himself, still saw legitimacy in stealing the clothes of the Roman Empire, almost as if that was the true wellspring of power (which drove the Byzantines postal of course). There seems to be a difference between real power and its ceremonial, almost mythic self, which can endure when the people who last wielded that power for real are dust and/or heads on spears.

It’s all there: the weird mix of old and new, the failure of mimesis, the frustration of academics hitting the limits of worn out methods, new religions, the collapse of old elites and institutions. It’s been giving me a much clearer picture of what the rhythm of life looks like just before and after the thread snaps. I can really see this week’s post in the conflict between Orestes and Cyril: one the perfect model of an Ivy League who knows how to win friends and influence people (Pagan, Christian, and Jew alike); the other a new type of leader, playing to the passions of the mob and dealing with opponents by assassinating or banishing them. Hypatia wound up murdered and Orestes wound up banished not because they didn’t know how the play the game of Classical politics, but because the game had changed, turning the secular government of Alexandria into an autocratic theocracy.<br><br>I’ve programmed all the fracking stocks into my computer and have been watching them plummet with a morbid fascination. This weekend when I went to mail my contract for After Oil someone gave me a flyer for a discussion group at a Quaker Meeting. I have fond memories of the Quakers who were my first spiritual community after finding Druidry and went. The hammer and sickle on their newsletter and some brief conversation revealed that they were a Marxist revolutionary group renting the building. I stayed and listened to outrage and frustration that could have come from anyone on the street wrapped unashamedly in symbolism and language that had lost the unifying stigma it had a decade ago. They were warm and friendly and we had some good conversation (though they thought I was agreeing with them when I wasn’t), but it was eye opening. As groups like that pick up speed and the economy continues to plummet (even after the Feds desperate tried to jerry rig it yesterday), it may be uncomfortably soon that history happens and everything changes.<br><br><a href=#c7294392927117887332 title="comment permalink">10/9/14, 9:48 AM</a><br><br>

On the other hand, a hierarchical social power structure is not necessarily an example of complexity - it frequently appears in nature, and is particularly typical for primate species. The complex bureaucracy is more a necessity for democracy, relatively egalitarian power structures than to hierarchal rule. A global decline will see definite revival of old-fashioned hierarchal glories, as you describe - indeed in more concrete, personal forms.<br><br>I would be more careful with the revolutionary examples of France, US, Russia, as they were not objectively forced by decline pressures (certainly not in terms of natural resources). Quite contrarily - new kind of resources were opening up, and the problem for respective royals was their obliviousness to the social-political progress. In contrast to France, the British or Dutch royals adjusted very well to the rise of burgeusie.<br><br>Even if many elites (especially new) will find themselves loosing badly in the civilization decline, their options are still more interesting than for the prolls. The ongoing economic austerity harakiris make sense if we see the governments working hard for the financial elites to make their billions tangibly significant. That is certainly useful for the anticipated decline. Also, cooperation is normally a monopoly of the elites (apart from a century of <i>"Workers of the world, unite!"</i>).

My mother lived there in the 40s. It was then all-white, actually a sundown town,i.e. Negros not allowed off the streetcar in the city limits after dark. When we lived in LA in 1960 the family of one of my grandmother's friends from back then was literally the last white household in their neighborhood. Their neighbors were mostly middle-class blacks, city workers, teachers and so forth. But the main streets showed all the signs of neighborhood decline--shops with metal grilles, groups of men just hanging out, etc. Of course part of the reason for the relatively quick changeover was deliberate block busting by real estate interests. One black family moves in and the real estate agent visits all the surrounding white families to urge them to sell before their homes lose value. Self fulfilling, of course, as each house put up of sale and purchased by a black family eager to move to a better area becomes evidence of decline. And, of course, every house sold is a commission in an agent's pocket.<br><br>Funny how many ethnic neighborhoods have actually had a great amount of shifting in ethnic makeup.

But I continue to contend that analogies with previous collapsing civilizations can often lead us astray. Groups that can maintain precision artillery or military aircraft will always have a dramatic advantage over their opponents. And there will be explosives and electronics for artillery and fuel for military aircraft long after there is far too little fuel to drive cars for personal transport. But those systems can't be managed with courage, charisma, and bare-knuckle fighting skills. You have to manage technical experts and maintain supply chains etc. JMG easily switches between talking about near future collapse of modern industrial civilization and far term collapse of its remains in a few centuries. But the near term part of any collapse (next century or two) is going to be dominated by people who can most effectively maintain the networks of experts and supply chains that allow 'modern' weapons to be maintained in the field. (Likely not the gee-whiz gadgets of the modern US military. Think of the artillery of World War I and aircraft of WWII, etc) I would argue that beyond a century or two, we have very little idea about whether there will be continued collapse toward a pre-industrial society or the emergence of a post-fossil fuel society that is fairly complex in the technology it uses for economic and military purposes.<br><br><a href=#c7149873666988701741 title="comment permalink">10/9/14, 12:59 PM</a><br><br>

Where alcohol is prohibited and shipments are seized and destroyed, bootleggers are going to sell whiskey, not beer.

Back in the old days, Israeli combat units tended to have a rather ramshackle appearance, with lots of cast-off, jury-rigged and heavily modified equipment obtained second-hand from the US, France and Britain and soldiers with a distinctly casual attitude towards proper dress, not to mention inspections. But these guys could fight like few others and were led by officers who were rigorously selected for their leadership ability in battle. Most IDF colonels back then were in their early 30’s and the brigadier generals were usually men in their late 30’s. Moreover, the IDF had a policy of fast-tracking promising young officers and grooming them for early promotion. It wasn’t unusual in a reserve brigade for the colonel to be only 32 or 33 while having lieutenants and captains in their late 30’s or early 40’s who would never be promoted any further and were staying in just long enough to qualify for a modest pension. But starting in the 1970’s, the IDF came increasingly under the influence of the US military, and it shows. They started relying more on technology and firepower and less on innovative tactics and a mastery of the basics of warfare. The policy of promoting the best young officers quickly while not promoting officers who lacked potential for further development was scrapped in favor of a seniority based system, ostensibly in the name of equal opportunity. <br><br>Not surprisingly, the last war the IDF really won was in 1973, and it’s all been downhill since then. Consider the difference in performance between the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, where the IDF was caught completely by surprise by the Egyptians and Syrians, who also had a massive advantage in numbers and firepower, and the 2006 Lebanon War. In the 1973 War, the Israelis still managed to win an overwhelming victory on the battlefield after three weeks of high intensity combat and huge losses and in spite of being badly outnumbered. By contrast, look at the IDF’s shockingly poor performance against a much smaller Hezbollah force, even the Israelis had an overwhelming advantage in firepower, technology and numbers.<br><br><a href=#c4983813492339841881 title="comment permalink">10/9/14, 2:28 PM</a><br><br>

I'll be talking about the role of what Arnold Toynbee called the external proletariat in next week's post. <br><br>YJV, exactly. Stand by for mutiny. <br><br>Andrew, excellent! That was why, in my novel <i>Star's Reach</i>, the hereditary monarch of 25th-century Meriga (basically, the Midwest and as much of the west-of-the-Appalachians South as is still above water) is still called the Presden. <br><br>Ice Torch, actually, this whole series of posts is inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wp4O7v5320" rel=nofollow>this piece</a> -- as you probably guessed in the first place! As for the current UK political situation, a British friend of mine commented that the only way she was willing to tolerate a hung Parliament was if it was going to be a public hanging. <br><br>Howard, I think you'll find that there will be no shortage of volunteer help to get that particular bit of infrastructure in place. <br><br>MawKernewek, that's a great example. <br><br>Kyoto, socialist governments were just as bad at devastating the environment as capitalist ones, so I think the OWS people were a bit off base. As for the future of capitalism, that's a topic large enough for a couple of posts all by itself; fortunately we'll be getting to that, as the end of the current economic system is one of the things on the menu. <br><br>Raven, well, yes -- there's a single more or less coherent philosophy underlying all these blog posts, on both blogs. <br><br>Ed-M, no argument there. In either case, government and business are basically the same thing. It reminds me of the old Soviet era joke: "In capitalist countries, man oppresses man, but in communist countries, it's the other way around!" <br><br>Eric, excellent! Yes, it's the same story told in a slightly different language. As for the attempted jerry-rigging, things don't seem to be working too well today...<br><br>Das Monde, the revolutions I've cited are of course a different case, since -- as noted in the post -- the mechanisms of control remained in place, and so there wasn't anything like the same sort of transition of modes of power as we'll see. The point of including them was simply to show how power slips from the hands of ruling elites. <br><br>Hector, again, there doesn't need to be rebellion on the part of the internal proletariat -- though there can be.

Steve Pearson thanks for sharing your insights of how a combat unit operates in practice ...<br>Lately my attention has been on Europe, seemingly edging closer to fragmentation and collapse , and i cant help wondering what the old monarchies swept away by the Oil Age have been up to in the way of preparing to fill the power vacuum . <br>I am sure they would see the last hundred years as a mere blip on the radar of their reign .. No doubt they have used the time wisely , to reacquire wealth , property and assets , finance , and also to give the poor old gene pool a bit of a shot in the arm ( pardon the pun) . I am referrring here to old Otto Hapsburg and his clan ; the Thurn Und Taxis crowd , de Vasconcelos of Portugal .Obviously they will have metamorphosized into another format , perhaps to rule from behind the scenes , via some new institution or mechanism . I wonder if they can get behind a mega corporation with a private security force to assume some roles of governance , a modern feudal house in drag ? With the Underworld Vampires lurking somewhere behind it . I am sure they will have done everything possible to undermine the EU , perhaps some of the unelected clowns that run it have been placed there? ( where possible ) .<br>So far they havent been kind enough to set up a website for a couch surfer like me to see what their plans are , so i have had to use intuition . Mostly the websites / blogs are there to mislead . I have noticed the Maersk shipping containers a lot in my travels the last few years , and i cant help but feel this mob have some role to play , with its seven pointed star emblem and links to "the order of the white elephant " ..<br>Perhaps the international globe trotting feudalists are already in position with constantly shifting virtual castles , private armies , perhaps the resurgence may involve admitting some new blood with some not so ancient royal lineage . Blackwater , anyone , Kolomovski of the Ukraine ? ..<br>As far as Australia goes , i think the Archdruid may be right in suggesting that we will soon be busy fending off the Chinese , but like most critters over here , we seem somewhat dumb and cute , but when annoyed , watch out , our insurgency ( fuelled by a deeply ingrained racism ) will make the Jihadis look like toy soldiers ! ...especially if they cut off the beer; Ned Kelly taught us everything we need to know .<br><br><a href=#c8329182290502435539 title="comment permalink">10/9/14, 9:38 PM</a><br><br>

I really wonder, though, how many police departments can establish a good enough rapport with their prospective peasants to keep the latter from quietly letting the warband in the next county when the guy who always gets drunk on watch will be guarding the door. Political power is a complicated thing, and pure brute force is rarely enough to make it stick. <br><br>Wander, thanks for your perspective! It doesn't surprise me to hear that members of the elite think of themselves in those terms -- but we know where the road paved with good intentions always leads. <br><br>Eric, I'll look it up the next time I have some free time in DC!<br><br>Ganv, I'll be dealing with that to some extent in next week's post, and then further in posts beyond that. The short form is that this is why warbands target the support systems of their technologically superior enemy -- as those systems fail, dependence on them becomes a disadvantage, not an advantage. Jihadis in Iraq and Afghanistan have already shown that they can use that tactic to bog down the US in an unwinnable situation; once it's on our own turf, and countersystem attacks don't simply interfere with US capacities to project power somewhere else, it becomes even more dangerous. More on this soon!<br><br>Cherokee, I'm impressed -- here the federal unemployment figures openly exclude anybody who no longer gets unemployment, whether or not they've got a job, and the government just nods and smiles and pretends that the number means something. <br><br>Ed, it's an interesting question. I'm not at all sure it'll be one person -- the US is perilously close to fragmenting as it is. <br><br>William, when it comes to the current maneuverings of the US and its enemies, all of us who are outside the loop are speculating. Still, I don't think it's too hard to figure out what's going on. US hostility to Russia is anything but a Cold War hangover; the Russo-Chinese alliance of convenience is the most significant threat to US global dominance in the short term, and keeping Russia on the defensive and forcing a wedge between Russia and the EU are important US goals just now. The US tried the same thing on China's border by sponsoring an attempted revolution in Myanmar a while back, as I'm sure you recall, and the recent business in Hong Kong is more of the same. How long it will take for payback time to come around is an interesting question just now. <br><br>Ellen, thanks, but I have enough trouble keeping up with my current correspondence and workload, and I'm not particularly interested in yet another version of utopian reformism. As for your pessimistic version of the religion of progress, that's not pessimism, it's just a little less giddy and gullible than the usual sort. How about a version where you know that sooner or later, progress will fail, but commit yourself to the fight to keep that failure from happening any sooner than it has to? Think of Norse religion -- the gods are going to die when Ragnarok comes, and it's your highest aspiration to go down fighting next to them -- and you've got the idea. <br><br>MawKernewek, and then about a week later they'll find out that the local organized crime boss owns their properties, and they don't any more. Do you recall the story about how Vortigern brought the Saxons to Britain? It's worth revisiting, and not just in this context. <br><br>Ed-M, thank you! As for microstates, one consequence of dark age conditions is that states as such cease to exist; what you've got instead is roughly defined territories that fluctuate dramatically from decade to decade and even year to year. It's only when that settles down to stable baronies and a hierarchy begins to take shape that states begin to reform, and even then it takes a good long time before people stop thinking of themselves as Baron Cuthbert's vassals and start thinking of themselves as English, or what have you. <br><br>Rapier, an excellent piece of advice!<br><br><a href=#c614149176182163762 title="comment permalink">10/9/14, 10:41 PM</a><br><br>

Those are certainly some of the things that need doing just now. <br><br>Shane, exactly. <br><br>Mr. G., I could definitely see colonels on your continent getting into the action. Such exposure as I have to the US military suggests that its sheer scale puts low-ranking generals in about the same role as colonels in a Latin American army. More broadly -- yes, and we'll be talking about that as this sequence of posts proceeds. <br><br>Jonathan, they aren't two different scenarios. The decline and fall of a civilization includes a lot of sudden violent events -- consider the fall of Rome to the Visigoths, for one. The Long Descent isn't a smooth curve, it's a fractal shape made up of many different collapses on many different scales of space, time, and intensity -- and some of those collapses will likely involve the production of a very large number of corpses in a very short time. Is that a little clearer? <br><br>Merle, thank you! Take your time with Vico; he writes in a style that went out of fashion a couple of centuries ago, and it takes getting used to. <br><br>Matthew, let me fix that: "Every day is progress, but at the end of a year, a real mess gets made." There, that's more like it! ;-)<br><br>DeAnander, if you get past that now, you'll have less trouble when your life's on the line. <br><br>Kutamun, well, we'll see.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c1531474663407635626></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11238225391970353594 rel=nofollow>Lei</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Just a few thoughts:<br><br>This all may be eventually invitable, at least in the USA (the situation still appears a bit different from the point of view of Central Europe); however, it strikes me as excentric and actually unresponsible reality that many readers seem to welcome the new power holders, or at least feel a kind of excitement. One can only say, care for what you wish. Because we are not talking only about new nobility, which is a bit too premature; in fact, we are talking about the disintegration of the basic institutions and the rule of law. And of course, law is naturally made by the elites, but, on the other hand, most of the old civilizations knew that bad law was still better than no law and that it is a basis of a stable and thriving society.<br><br>Also, one should take into consideration the fact that the dynamics of revolutions in growing economies, which are basically all modern revolutions, removing obstacles for a more effective way of source managment, is diametrally different from the processes in times of regression. I am sure the author is well aware of it, but it seems that these two things are too often mixed up here in comments. As a result, we can hardly use the historical revolutions as comparative or illustrative material.<br><br>And, although this may be different for the USA I am not especially familiar with, I doubt that the new elites are those gang leaders everyone mentions. It is not only that an average European does not have any experience with a drug or any other gang. It is rather the mental outfit of such people - they may be capable in some respects, but it is usually not accidental that they occupy a certain niche in the present society. Simply put, I don't think that the future nobility will recruit from criminals (and, please, don't start talking about early medieval nobility as of criminals, which they certainly were not, though they had much in common) - I think rather of the type of men close to the leaders of historical communist guerillas, e.g. the early Chinese communists, later dominated by Mao Zedong, but not exclusively. Those people are not only able in organization and power building, but are also the charismatic leaders, which are able to present an attractive vision and win the favour of common people. But such people usually do not engage in gang wars and, in general, tend to show an entirely physical outfit than maffianos.<br><br>I am a bit perplexed by time frames we are talking about, although I try to follow the discussion closely. One is never sure about whether this is projected to coming decades, or a century later, or even later. Yes, I know "Dark Ages" will come according to JMG in one to three centuries; but then, it is quite funny that the favorite sport in comments here is to look for and find everywhere the first signs of these developments. Which is, in fact, a bit annoying, as it has a flavour of chilliastic hallucinations - those initiated ones diclose the signs of the coming apocalypse - though those phenomena can be manifestations of quite different and unrelated social processes. Sorry, but it this is to happen in next three centuries, I don't think we can identify now the shape of it and its sprouts.<br><br>What is more: maybe it is because of the unclarity in time frames, but is really strange to advocate relearning of basic democracy and interest in politics (which is laudable), and, on the other hand, speak about the rule of gangs, in fact - either we have brutal "new elites", and then we have no politics at all, let alone legality and due suits, or we have a political system of modern making, and than we cannot have "new elites".<br><br>And the last thing: there was a nice debate about fascism here. And warnings against it. It is then a bit disturbing to see the readers of this blog to admire precisely those attributes in men that are absolutely characteristic for fascist Duci and Führer, and Putinove - that of the hypermasculine macho, who cares nothing about "decadent" mechanisms of a complex society.<br><br><a href=#c1531474663407635626 title="comment permalink">10/10/14, 2:57 AM</a><br><br>

How would they fuel that military action? Would the domestic US population be prepared to sacrifice its energy and stuff benefits or would it play a blame game with the government for the incredible mismanagement of the situation?

Captains seem to do well in African miltary takeovers, for instance, and the classical cases of veteran tyrants are the two grand corporals of Europe - Bonaparte and Hitler. Power is indeed contextual, and in times of crisis command of a company may offer more actual power than (notional) command of a battalion, in that the other ranks may be willing to accept orders from a closer superior than a more distant one. When the complexity of a military hierarchy becomes unsustainable, command of a single garrison can hold together when an army group falls apart, with an impotent and isolated general in headquarters being unable to sway anyone but his AdC. In such a situation, the power is clearly in the hands of the officer 'on the ground'. <br><br>We should also bear in mind the personal adherence some commanders evince in their troops. Here the classic example comes from the Iberian theatre during the Punic Wars, where both the Barca family and the Scipii attracted the support of Iberian tribes on a personal basis. The tribes fought for the generals involved, not for Rome or Carthage, and their allegiance could be swayed by fluctations in perceived power. This also underlines the internal competition within elites, although Rome, being in the ascendant, seems to have had more success in maintaining cohesion to the central myth of the Republic than the senescent Carthaginian polity could achieve. The internal conflict in the Roman elites did break out under the late Empire, though.<br><br>Incidentally, whoever thinks drug gangs and veterans are necessarily distinct should look into the history of the Zetas ;-)<br><br>In other news, the more astute (or local) readers may have noticed that UKIP has just won its first seat at Westminster. It raises lots of interesting questions and observations, one of which is the way the BBC news went on and on about how UKIP were now a signmificant force and how it all presages Big Things, yet there was hardly an eyelid lifted for the first Green MP. <br><br>Still, I think the 'Why?' of the UKIP success is the more interesting thing. Let's be clear, I do not like UKIP, so perhaps I'm biased, but considering they don't have a coherent policy, I find it surprising how much support they are garnering. They seem to have two strategies: one is the 'cold pricklies' of a decidedly Daily Mail strain, and the other is their insistence on being 'political outsiders'. They have managed to tap a strain of discontent, and whilst it's clear what they're against, no-one seems to know what they are for, including themselves. A few years ago they were banging the Libertarian drum, but seemed to have turned against that a bit (I personally think that Libertarianism is merely deferential apologetics for billionaires, a political Stockholm syndrome). UKIP don't seem to have any economic policy, their environmental policy is climate change denial, they do not have any grasp of any of the topics discussed here, in short they seem just as blind as the establishment they pretend not to be part of. They provide a platform for the kind of xenophobe who can't admit to racism, and it's interesting to see the BNP is collapsing now, but all the talk is of UKIP poaching from Conservative and Labour support. I guess really it is to be expected in times of decline, after all - part scapegoating, part entitlement tantrum as the privileges of industrial society fade away. Anyway, it will be interesting to see how it all unfolds, what with a general election next year.<br><br><a href=#c3126748554353432532 title="comment permalink">10/10/14, 5:12 AM</a><br><br>

The suggestion I have received, so to speak from the far side of the Narva River separating Estonia from Russia, is "Something like 98 percent [or was it 97 percent?] of tried Moscow cases result in a conviction." <br><br>PS: Mr Putin is himself an example of a warlord, having risen from modest ranks. If I am correctly briefed by source(s), he was not a Polkovnik, or colonel, when doing his 1980s KGB work in Germany when the 1917 Lenin-putsch regime was still intact, but instead was something called a POD-Polkovnik - this being in some sense a step down from colonel.<br><br>Can someone confirm the rank? <br><br>The low rank is perhaps consistent with Mr Putin's academic record, where his grades are said to have been on the American scale Ds, rather than Bs or Cs.

A more explicit phrasing might be "The exception that proves the existence of the rule."<br><br>This is not the sense in which it was used by JMG or by most American English speakers. The original sense dates to Roman law. The contemporary American sense is actually rather different in that it means "the exceptions demonstrate the limits of the rule" or even "the existence of an exception does not invalidate the rule." It originally meant "the need to specify an exception proves the existence of the general (unwritten, unstated common-law, implicitly understood) rule." Many would consider the modern usage incorrect, though it is in wide usage and has never quite made sense to me -- it sounds like you are actually making excuses for why your rule does not apply in a particular case, and not really "proving" anything in either sense of the verb "prove."<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_that_proves_the_rule<br><br>And now I will go prove that I am not a robot.<br><br><a href=#c7973826989782145869 title="comment permalink">10/10/14, 9:36 AM</a><br><br>

And this place has about one tenth the population of the US. Americanize that number and you're talking roughly EIGHT billion buckaroos in a U.S. context. Impressive, no? <br><br>Now, you say there may be good reasons for the cancellation. HAH! The Premier and his boys tried to get those plants built in the face of vociferous nimby opposition. It would cost them a few precious seats in the provincial legislature. With the plants partially complete, they pulled the plug.<br><br>Was there outrage? You bet. Were there consequences?

Much of the "sudden frenzy" on July 14 was pure theater -- a mob stormed the Bastille and freed all seven of its prisoners, and in the weeks afterwards a significant portion of the old aristocracy was given jobs in a new "citizen" government. Lafayette, himself a marquis, gave speeches about how everything was different now, then returned to his manor to gamble with aristocratic friends. It was only the continuation of a paradigm already articulated by Rousseau and Voltaire, and the beginning of real violence was some years off. None of the Europeans (like Wordsworth) who delighted in the bloodless transfer of power in 1789-90 foresaw what would begin in 1792, or indeed the strange twists and turns of the decades afterwards. If you look at the Russian Revolution you will see a similar phenomenon -- it was not about a single day or even a year, because it took decades to transition the nation from a corrupt monarchy into an efficient prison state.<br><br><a href=#c9206193623770108765 title="comment permalink">10/10/14, 9:15 PM</a><br><br>

Our mutual fate, south and north of the current dividing line, is intertwined. <br><br>The way I see it, as borders are re-drawn, which side of a border you end up on may determine whether you get the cosmic thumbs up or thumbs down. Will you be able to migrate, re-settle and make a living relatively un-impeded? Or will you be barred by war bands asserting new boundaries?<br><br>In any case, you said "It’s dangerous enough for elites to lose track of the contextual and contingent nature of their power ...". And that's the thing, the elites up here have no apparent idea of the fragility of their position. <br><br>The way things are currently structured is that an elite from the Great Lakes Basin contends for power with one far to the west. Left vs Right ideology is mostly a matter of posturing. The basis for power here is regional and economic in nature, both elites governing pretty much alike, both having an eye to the bottom lines of their masters.<br><br>Both elites are consumed with this national rivalry. Consequently, both are utterly blind to the fact of living defenceless on a treasure chest of natural resources. They think we have no enemies. Or that THEY have no enemies.

Not even with recent history as their guide.

The elites may be incompetent, as you say, but their middle managers are no less so and they are at hand, while the elites are distant. Insolent govt. clerks, rapacious cops, duplicitous businessmen, and the invincible ignorance and arrogance of social workers is what we are dealing with daily. Cops might be feared in inner city neighborhoods, but I can tell you, having lived in some, that social workers are literally hated. Spank your kid because he or she got caught stealing, next thing you know someone has called CPS, and you are in for a nightmare of indefinite duration. <br><br>Rebecca Brown, you might consider where I live in central New York. Real estate is some of the cheapest in the USA; there is a flourishing local food scene and even cultural scene. Both are far more impressive than I ever saw in rural CA. Crime is relatively low--most people do not lock their cars, unheard of in CA--because there are more private and public resources to help desparate people than I ever saw in five decades living on the West Coast, and, anyone with some kind of income can afford rent somewhere. I think I am about as far from the Atlantic Coast as is the Archdruid in Maryland.<br><br>About recommending yourself to warbands and their leaders, you might want to make yourself useful. Become the go to person in your area for some necessary skill, small engine repair, auto repair, electronics, and so on. The leader has to keep his guys fed, clothed, and equipment in working order.

Your assumption seems to be that any other option would continue the same level of benefit that elders currently receive. Millennials and Gen X'ers whose meager paychecks are being garnished to pay for Social Security and Medicare may have other ideas. A return to pre-Social Security eldercare, whereby elders are at the mercy of their children, would benefit younger generations by giving them the power and control of eldercare instead of their parents and grandparents. Those under 40-50, or especially 30, can't understand why they have to pay into a system they won't benefit from so that their parents and grandparents can live lifestyles they'll never enjoy, living to ages they'll never reach. It goes back to the theme of these posts: the elite and the abstract power they wield in our current system. The silents and the boomers are the elites wielding abstract power via AARP, stocks and other wealth, and political power. Younger generations are the ones wielding concrete power. It amazes me how the viagra and cialis generations fail to see the privilege they wield and just how much they're trying their hardest to be the epitome of evil to future generations. I assume on some subconscious level they're aware, which is why they've raised their children to be dependent on them. As a thought experiment, I'd like to go back to JMG's ecofascist scenario. Imagine that the ecofascist dictator of the future demonizes boomers and what silents may be left as the ones responsible for our situation, the ones who neglected taking steps to solve the problem while there was still time. He or she would find a ready audience among younger generations as they look around at 60-80 something overgrown teenagers with their cialis and viagra. It's also not to hard to see them looking the other way and not asking too many questions as elders start disappearing and an "eldercaust" gets underway. It's an interesting thought experiment. You can never underestimate what's simmering under the surface of younger generations. Now, it goes without saying that an "eldercaust" would be a tragedy and do nothing to change the predicament we're in, but older generations seem to be doing everything in their power to be the epitome of evil to younger generations.<br>Regarding Canada, <br>I'm bullish on Canada. In fact, I can easily see Canada and the Canadian government outliving the U.S., as long as they keep their wide open immigration policy, providing lebensraum for the elites of the BRICS, and continuing to cozy up to the up and coming BRIC powers diplomatically. Thankfully, Canada has a weaker, more flexible national identity than the U.S., and virtually no civil religion around it founding, which makes it that much more adaptable. What I DO see being troublesome for Canada is an immigration/volkerwanderung problem once the U.S. finally collapses. The borders will move north, and Canada will be in the same position the U.S. is in now from an uncontrolled influx. For example, I'm acutely aware that I'm only 6 hrs from the Detroit/Windsor crossing and 9 hrs from Toronto, and already, to my eyes, life in Southern Ontario seems a lot better than in the states. I'd imagine if things continue the way they are, that will increase. ..<br><br><a href=#c9197818550027879676 title="comment permalink">10/12/14, 7:12 AM</a><br><br>

The disdain that the baby boomers felt for their parents was an aberration, and it is not shared by the generations that have followed them. Nor is it stopping middle-aged boomers now from personally bankrupting themselves to care for their elderly parents, if needed. Younger people today tend to be quite close emotionally to their parents and grandparents and might not be so inclined to throw them under the economic bus as you suppose. <br><br>As for your conspiracy theories about parents deliberately making their children financially dependent on them, oh please. Yeah, right, it's a plot by the boomers to insure their old age security. It's got nothing to to with the general ongoing economic collapse and the demise of the American middle class. Sure thing. It is also a return to the patterns of earlier generations, where children lived with their parents until they married, and even after wards if they did not yet have the means to start their own household. Again, it's a weird aberration of this particular generation of Americans to think that the multi-generational household is per se a bad thing.<br><br><a href=#c988668563222399851 title="comment permalink">10/12/14, 9:39 AM</a><br><br>

I live in the Canadian prairies, and see a number of what looked to be once nice houses abandoned as rural populations have declined and farms have grown in size. If Ebola or other cause drops the population in half in less than a generation, what is going to to happen to the resultant settlement patterns? I think that well maintained property in desirable locations will hold it's value (relatively) but slum landlords will be hard pressed to maintain extracting rents if a significant portion does not go back into upkeep, as the renter will be free to go and squat in other vacant properties around them at a lower net cost. I also see that many of the subdivisions made up of housing unsuited to be lived in without a lot of fossil fuel energy devolving to nomadic grazing, because what else would they be good for? I ask as formulating strategies for abandoned houses in the area will have consequences down the line. Here I am thinking burn them, so they are only a hazard as a hole in the ground, vs save for salvage and having them put to undesirable purposes.

We're a typical rust-belt city -- much of our heavy industry has disappeared or left the country. Our population has declined from 383,000 in 1970 to 287,000 today. Vacant buildings all over the inner city. We got hit really hard in the recession, but things aren't *quite* as bad as they were a few years ago, though the short-lived water ban due to the algae in Lake Erie made a lot of us realize that our infrastructure isn't in terribly great shape -- but I'm not sure that's unique -- a lot of the issues that we are dealing with here may soon be faced by other cities as well.<br><br>The one thing Toledo has going for it is its geography. We have extensive waterways (the Maumee River is supposedly the largest east of the Mississippi). We have railroads (at one point we were 5th largest in the nation). We're only 50 miles from the Canadian border.<br><br>The heavy industry of the inner city is slowly being replaced with small-scale agriculture. We have community gardens and "hoop houses" and chicken coops going up in the older neighborhoods. It's kinds of amusing to see sweet corn growing where factories used to be!<br><br><a href=#c2869059145545317221 title="comment permalink">10/12/14, 11:13 AM</a><br><br>

The process by which the new elite emerges and elbows its predecessors out of the way, in turn, is among the most reliable dimensions of decline and fall; we’ll talk about it next week."<br><br>In catching up on the recommended reading from this blog, I just encountered this gem in E. C.

Similar to the thought in the recent past that most people loved their Congressman/Senator but hated the institution. Regardless of feelings, there's a deadly mismatch between Silents and Boomers demands for BAU regarding Medicare &amp; Social Security, and younger generations ability to pay. Something's got to give somewhere. One aberration of the recent past that needs to give are ideas of what's "old" and "young", considering that life expectancy is going down. We need to get back to thinking of anything over 60, or especially, 70, as old and on borrowed time. Somethings got to give somewhere. I could think of any number of policy changes a hard pressed government could make to balance out the mismatch of clout and wealth--anyone over a certain age is legally regarded as a dependent of their family or a ward of the state, much the same way all people under a certain age (18) are regarded, complete with a transfer of their property as well. Mandatory retirement. I just don't think that the demands that BAU regarding our elder policies is sustainable or will end well.<br>Regarding youth dependence, it's not so much living arrangements as an ability to think and do for oneself. In the years since my 100 year old grandfather was a child, there's been a progressive lack of emphasis on resilience and the ability to think, do, and care for oneself and one's family. On so many young people coming of age today, there's this vacant look on their face that is frightening--the deer in the headlights look, and their inability and helplessness is equally frightening. It's a failure of parenting that these kids are growing up so helpless and unable, and it will be dangerous to them, too, in the near future, regardless of whether they live with family or not.<br><br><a href=#c3004909015747736733 title="comment permalink">10/12/14, 4:30 PM</a><br><br>

Not only did we lose Duncan, a Dallas ICU nurse has contracted Ebola. The CDC is finally admitting that maybe our hospitals aren't prepared after all, given budget cutbacks of recent years. I have never swallowed the standard assurance that PPEs will be sufficient for US healthcare workers, given that in Africa they wear biohazard suits, dress with spotters watching and decontaminate after with bleach sprayed on. And that our 4 BSL-4 hospitals with special isolation units do much the same.

I doubt the notoriously quoted examples (Maya, Easter Islands, or Rome) can be generalized; some shapes and curves may be similar, but the overall context is to my knowledge is quite different. This is even truer of the Dark Ages - the only Dark Ages actually documented at least to that extent that we have a clue what happened are several centuries after the decline of Rome in Western Europe. We know practically nothing about what happened in Greece between Crete and early classical era, and there were no real Dark Ages in China nor in India. In addition, the processes in Europe during fater the fall of Rome were shaped by many factors that are not present now, and the societies in Europe both in the Roman provinces and, especially, behind the limes, lived in very different conditions from both us and medieval feudal societies.<br><br>Yesterday, I took again a trip to a lovely place, where the oldest standing church in Bohemia from around 900 CE is found on a grassy and bushy hill, protected by steep valleys of two creeks; the place was fortified at least 12 centuries ago. At that time, the Czech state was being formed, after the Czechs came into our land in around 530's, replacing very probably peacefully the rests of the Germans, who had replaces the Celts in around 200 CE. So I don't know, but it seems to me that our people and state survived so many crises and periods of relative unprosperity that it has some chance to live through coming centuries as well.<br><br>Moreover, and importantly, although the times before the formation of the state (though we know it was perceived as the territory of the Czech tribe and defended as such) were far from idylic, in a sense it was freer than later Middle Ages: no, there were no vassals of such and such; before the feudal state, there was typically were tribes here, gentes, lead by duces gentis, on whom the elite was centered, but for all we know, these archaic late Indo-European social structures were relatively egalitarian, "democratically" managed, and the people, the farmers, were basically free men. Collectively, the people felt as a tribe, which is governed by very different rules than that of a feudal state. As far as I know, there were hardly times in Europe when people felt primarily as "vassals of XY" without acknowledging the identity of a tribe or of an early medieval state, or, a bit later, late Medieval nation. Thus, historically, we know little about stateless, tribeless times of small armed groups.<br><br><a href=#c4975903021265953115 title="comment permalink">10/13/14, 1:44 AM</a><br><br>

We now have about 10 full-time mostly millennial members (I am the only full-time boomer) and 20-30 folks of all ages who regularly join in work parties, potlucks, etc. Not a commune, we are helping each other to build tiny off-grid, off the radar houses on sites within biking distances. Most of the materials we use have come from the waste stream. We all catch rainwater, compost our waste, and cook on rocket stoves, cob ovens or solar cookers. We planted and are harvesting a 2 acre garden that has made us closer to food self-sufficiency (still working on the coffee), all without fossil fuel. We are educating ourselves towards collectively raising larger animals (some sites already have chickens, rabbits and/or bees). <br><br> My larger more typical house and permaculture grounds have become the food storage hub, with a root cellar and cold room full of fermented and canned vegetables, acorn flour, corn for popping and grinding, vast numbers of squash, potatoes, garlic etc. With the help of the younger folks, my engineer husband is building a solar greenhouse complete with rocket stove - he already timber framed a workshop. <br><br> Few of these young people have much building or gardening experience. They have learned through mentoring and doing. They TOTALLY understand peak oil, climate chaos, and the Long Descent (our collective favorite peak oil book) and are getting ready, committed to educating others. Although this might sound hopelessly idealistic, we want to develop a localized moneyless infrastructure to replace the increasingly exploitative globalized one. For most of us, our commitment to this rather uncomfortable work springs from a deep spiritual understanding of interconnection and a desire to heal or at least stop harming the earth. <br><br> The recent ebola posts have made me realize our collective needs to seriously prepare for medical disasters, as well as physical ones.

Life expectancy in the U.S. is not yet declining. The most recent data show it has continued to increase for the U.S. population as a whole. I do believe it has stalled or slipped for some demographic sectors, but of course those are the sectors with no political power. <br><br>As for the other things you describe, they are functions of the increasing affluence of the 20th century and the beginnings of a reversal of this trend we have seen so far in the 21st century. Intergenerational tensions about money are a symptom, not a cause. We have the same disconnect about maintenance of infrastructure, public education, and every singe other aspect of public finance and public service. We can't pay for *any* of the 20th Century institutions anymore, that serve people of any generation. <br><br>Same for dependency. Everyone is a hopeless dependent now, from the newborns to the centenarians. Again this is a function of the affluence that that grew during the previous century and peaked just as the current century was dawning. If your entire society is based on have it now, get it easy, care not for the world, then you will wind up a dependent boob regardless of your parents intentions. Even Amish kids have "smart phones" now.<br><br><a href=#c4157460891418218268 title="comment permalink">10/13/14, 5:19 AM</a><br><br>

That does not mean someone couldn't take off their PPE in the wrong order and touch their face, but it would be a lot safer to have an inner layer that is removed last. The Liberian student nurse who pulled her family through wore 4 gloves. Also, they don't ever seem to answer the questions that I have, such as, exactly what PPE were they using? What kind of mask? <br><br>Magicalthyme,<br><br>What is double digging?<br><br>Shane,<br><br>I find your efforts at simplistic scapegoating of the older generation a bit absurd. Older people may vote more, but that comes with maturity and no one is stopping the younger ones from voting. SOME older people have financial security, but that, too, is a natural consequence of being around for a while. It is perfectly normal for young people to struggle financially as they are starting out in their independent lives and producing children. Financial stability is something that takes years to achieve, independent of the question as to what sort of economics are going on. If I think of the (few) people of boomer age I know who have a bit socked away, all were quite poor as young parents. They saved hard and they saved for years, and none could begin till their kids were more or less grown. Also, it irritates me for you to speak as though the social security check were some kind of conscious group conspiracy against the young. These people had their paychecks garnished for fifty years before collecting, and during those fifty years they were likewise supporting their own parents and grandparents. That our population demographic has changed is a problem, but not a reason to sow hatred. Anyway, there are far, far more old people who just squeak by. <br><br>I do agree, however, that we have gone too far in preserving the lives of people who are in very poor health, whose bodies are ready to die, and who quite often have brought early disease upon themselves and are more or less impervious to serious personal change, effort, or discipline to improve their own health. But people should not be cut off at some arbitrary age based upon the bad habits of the above mentioned type.<br><br>I can't help but think, though, as our nation becomes overwhelmed with certain difficulties such as possibly ebola, that we could lighten the load enormously by just letting people who are ready to die to naturally go. But I worry that the pendulum might swing too far, as people are like that once they get a new notion in their heads.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c2689025921161157561 title="comment permalink">10/13/14, 8:19 AM</a><br><br>

The raw numbers on flu deaths are misleading. I don't know if I have ever in my life heard of anyone who has died of the flu - oh, wait, I knew two people who did. They both lived in the nursing home where I worked and were about 90.<br><br>I'm becoming interested in finding the difference between people who live and who die of ebola. How long is the course of the ones who recover? Do their symptoms generally not get so bad? How much of a difference does supportive care make? So far, it looks like about 10%, but perhaps that could be improved, esp with holistic medicine.<br><br>Duncan was apparently given both dialysis and intubation! That means his kidneys had shut down and there are several layers of respiratory support that one would try before intubation. Treatment of ebola will be a learning process, but I suspect that if someone requires extreme respiratory support, they are probably a goner. Unless ebola cases remain few and far between, there are going to be some choices to be made, re waste of resources.<br><br><a href=#c4771721709855257086 title="comment permalink">10/13/14, 10:15 AM</a><br><br>

It's what's going to make it stop growing, and how. If the best answer you can find is "nothing" (or "they'll think of something"), that's valid cause for concern. More likely the answers you find will be less certain one way or the other ("they'll probably try X, Y, and Z, which may or may not work"), but that's still valid cause for, at least, planning for mitigation.<br><br>It's the same thought process I had to go through regarding collapse in general. I've noticed for decades that some things about present-day life have been getting worse. It's only when I started skeptically asking, "what's going to make them <i>stop</i> getting worse?" that their significance became apparent.<br><br>Yes, there are diseases and hazards closer to home that most of us have a much higher chance of dying from, right now. (Similarly, many if not most of us probably have issues in our own lives more immediate, more pressing, more likely to ruin us if neglected, than the ongoing early stages of collapse are.) But, what is going to stop ebola from outpacing them over time, and what will that cost?<br><br>(I'm reminded of railroad disaster scenario. Imagine a 100 car freight train going a mere 20 miles an hour, beginning a long downgrade. Nothing seems wrong, and yet the train is already out of control and doomed, even though no one knows it yet. A combination of under-estimated weight and broken equipment on board means that the train doesn't have enough braking power to hold its speed, let alone slow down, on the downgrade. This really happened, in San Bernadino in 1989, and the train was going 110 mph around a 35 mph curve when it finally left the rails.)<br><br><a href=#c1492005967391852495 title="comment permalink">10/13/14, 12:05 PM</a><br><br>

No one has really seemed to address my concern regarding the (deadly) mismatch of clout, wealth, and benefits between generations, and what that means as things start to unravel, and the danger maintaining BAU could cause.

What you described sounds like a wonderfully practical and good subcultural community. If I lived anywhere near you, I'd participate. If I were in my twenties or early thirties, I'd be all in. I hope the example gets passed around in that age cohort and propagates more cooperative groups of this kind.<br><br>I have two pieces of advice. The first is economic. Money is useful as a medium of exchange. Rather than trying to create a moneyless economy right now, I recommend that your group look into local currencies and either begin a project to create one that is based in the nearest market town, or if there is already a localized currency functioning somewhere nearby, adopt it. <br><br>Localized paper currencies are entirely legal in the United States and there is at least one in use fairly near you in part of a New England state; I saw coverage of it on a green economy TV news magazine. This particular currency was pegged to the dollar at a discount. One [local unit of currency] costs 95 cents US but is worth $1 US when purchasing goods from local merchants and producers who choose to participate. The point of doing this is that it provides an incentive to buy local and keeps money circulating in the community longer.<br><br>My other advice is about managing growth of your community. This comment is already pretty long so I'll post it separately.<br><br><a href=#c1335222203999114216 title="comment permalink">10/13/14, 2:50 PM</a><br><br>

The organizations were located within and expressions of two different subcultures. They started as tiny groups operating under the radar.<br><br> The original members had strong esprit de corps from having been friends before forming the organizations, from being committed participants in those subcultures, and from spending a lot of time working together on activities that outsiders didn't understand or appreciate.<br><br>Previous to my joining, both organizations undertook successful outreach projects that attracted new members such as myself. It wasn't possible to fully socialize the newcomers into the outlook of the old members, because the newcomers saw themselves joining established successful organizations, not struggling startups, and because they didn't have previous social ties with the founders.<br><br>Both organizations had growth crises when they reached about one hundred active members. One organization decentralized its governing structure, lost some momentum, but carried on for another thirty plus years. The other suffered a schism with bad feelings and AFAIK none of its offshoots survived.<br><br>I'm telling you this because your community is probably facing one of two futures. Perhaps it won't attract many new people, and will fade away as participants die, lose interest, or move out of the area. Perhaps it will attract new people at a faster clip than the group is now prepared to accommodate, and you will have to figure out how to assimilate newcomers without turning away valuable prospective participants or setting up a destructive power struggle between the old guard and the newcomers. The least likely possibility is steady state, where you attract new members at or barely above replacement levels.<br><br>Some sociological research indicates that the natural social unit for human beings is about one hundred people. That is the upper limit for the number of people an average person can know by name and interact with enough to keep up with what's going on in each other's lives. <br><br>I advise your community to plan ahead for growth by setting things up so that daughter groups will split off from the mother group well before the hundred mark is reached. The daughter groups will be expected to be in a cooperative relationship with the mother group but will be completely autonomous, i. e., they will have access to all the resources they need to sink or swim on their own. <br><br>The opportunity to start an autonomous group on the same model reduces political strife because up and coming leaders don't have to compete for authority within the group they joined. If they have differing ideas on what to do next, or just a differing style of interaction, rather than overcoming opposition they can gather like minded people and start a new group that runs to their liking.<br> <br>To some degree, this advice applies to larger and smaller organizations as well.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c1902209997458041325 title="comment permalink">10/13/14, 3:43 PM</a><br><br>

These things are emotional, not rational, so you can't talk people out of them. <br><br>Still, when I hear the Ebola panic in the media, mostly I hear biophobia, xenophobia, and racism. You can always tell that xenophobia and racism are the driving issues when politicos start talking about The Southern Border. Just a few weeks ago, it was ISIS planning to storm across The Southern Border. Now it's Ebola being smuggled in across The Southern Border to punish sweet innocent White Americans for slavery (I kid you not, high profile pundits have said these things). And Obama is secretly aiding and abetting this scheme. Again, not making that up, it's being said on the national airwaves. <br><br>Indeed the fact that there is no Ebola vaccine is almost surely because of the socioeconomics of the people who have been most affected by the disease. Now that it might affect some rich white people too, suddenly the need for a vaccine is urgent, and one will probably be developed post-haste if it really begins spreading among people who can afford to pay enough for the shot. It's not like this is a new disease suddenly coming out of the blue. It's been known for decades. But somehow vaccine development just wasn't that big of a funding priority... until now. <br><br>Shane W. - we have addressed your issues.

To today's millennials working at poverty wages, that represents a much bigger cut, money they need more than wealthy retirees (Social Security and Medicare are not means tested benefits) <br>@ Nastarana <br>JMG has discussed charity on here before. As best I can remember, he said that it's about the giver feeling good and patting themselves on the back, and rarely, if ever, changes the situation of the receiver, nor the power dynamic between the giver and receiver. I'd go so far to say the same is true when giver and receiver are related, if not more so.<br>I'd have to disagree about immigration.
