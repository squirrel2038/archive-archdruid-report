It was definitely the sort of week that could benefit from a little comic relief. The Ebola epidemic marked another week of rising death tolls and inadequate international response . Bombs rained down ineffectually on various corners of Iraq and Syria as the United States and an assortment of putative allies launched air strikes at the Islamic State insurgents; since air strikes by themselves don’t win wars, and none of the combatants except Islamic State and the people they’re attacking have shown any inclination to put boots on the ground, that high-tech tantrum also counts in every practical sense as an admission of defeat, a point which is doubtless not lost on Islamic State. Meanwhile stock markets worldwide plunged on an assortment of ghastly economic news, with most indexes giving up their 2014 gains and then some, and oil prices dropped on weakening demand, reaching levels that put a good many fracking firms in imminent danger of bankruptcy. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the teeth of all this bad news, I’m pleased to say, Paul Krugman rose to the occasion and gave all of us in the peak oil scene <a href=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/slow-steaming-and-the-supposed-limits-to-growth/ >something to laugh about</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My regular readers will recall that Krugman assailed Post Carbon Institute a couple of weeks ago for having the temerity to point out that transitioning away from fossil fuels was, ahem, actually going to cost money. His piece was rebutted at once by Post Carbon’s Richard Heinberg and others, who challenged Krugman’s crackpot optimism and pointed out that the laws of physics and geology really do trump those of economics. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Krugman’s response—it really is a comic masterpiece, better than anything I’ve seen since the heyday of Francis Fukuyama—involved, among other non sequiturs and dubious claims, assailing mere scientists for thinking that they know more than economists. Er, let’s see: which of these two groups of people is expected to test their predictions against hard facts and discard a theory that produces inaccurate predictions? That’s what scientists do every working day, while economists apparently have something else to occupy their time. This may be why, when it comes to predicting macroeconomic conditions, economists these days are rarely as accurate as a tossed coin: consider the IMF’s continued advocacy of austerity programs as the road to prosperity when no country that has ever implemented them has ever achieved prosperity thereby, or for that matter the huge majority of economists who insisted the housing bubble wasn’t a bubble and wouldn’t crash, right up until the bottom dropped out. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Like so much great comedy, though, Krugman’s jest has its serious side. He sees a permanent condition of economic growth as the normal, indeed the inevitable state of affairs; it has doubtless never occurred to him that it might merely be a temporary anomaly, made possible only by the reckless extraction and consumption of half a billion years of fossil sunlight in a few short centuries. That the needle on the world’s fossil fuel gauge is swinging inexorably over toward E, to him, thus can only mean that some other source of cheap, abundant, highly concentrated energy will have to be found to keep the engines of economic growth roaring on at full throttle. That there may be no such replacement for fossil fuels ready and waiting in Nature’s cookie jar, and that economic growth can thus give way to an economic contraction extending over decades and centuries to come, has never entered his darkest dream. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That is to say, Krugman is still thinking the thoughts of a bygone era when the assumptions guiding those thoughts are long past their pull date and a very different era is taking shape around him. That’s a common source of confusion in times of rapid change, and never more so than in the decline and fall of civilizations—the theme of the current series of posts here. One specific form of that confusion very often becomes the mechanism by which the governing elite of a society in decline removes itself from power, and that mechanism is what I want to discuss this week. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To make sense of that process, it’s going to be necessary to take a step back and revisit some of the points made in <a href=../../2014/09/dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html>an earlier post in this series</a>. I discussed there the way that the complex social hierarchies common to mature civilizations break down into larger and less stable masses in which new loyalties and hatreds more easily build to explosive intensity. America’s as good an example of that as any.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A century ago, for example, racists in this country were at great pains to distinguish various classes of whiteness, with people of Anglo-Saxon ancestry at the pinnacle of whiteness and everybody else fitted into an intricate scheme of less-white categories below. Over the course of the twentieth century, those categories collapsed into a handful of abstract ethnicities—white, black, Hispanic, Asian—and can be counted on to collapse further as we proceed, until there are just two categories left, which are not determined by ethnicity but purely by access to the machinery of power. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Arnold Toynbee, whose immensely detailed exploration of this process remains the best account for our purposes, called those two the dominant minority and the internal proletariat. The dominant minority is the governing elite of a civilization in its last phases, a group of people united not by ethnic, cultural, religious, or ideological ties, but purely by their success in either clawing their way up the social ladder to a position of power, or hanging on to a position inherited from their forebears. Toynbee draws a sharp division between a dominant minority and the governing elite of a civilization that hasn’t yet begun to decline, which he calls a creative minority. The difference is that a creative minority hasn’t yet gone through the <a href=../../2014/09/dark-age-america-senility-of-elites.html>descent into senility</a> that afflicts elites, and still recalls its dependence on the loyalty of those further down the social ladder; a dominant minority or, in my terms, a senile elite has lost track of that, and has to demand and enforce obedience because it can no longer inspire respect.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Everyone else in a declining civilization belongs to the second category, the internal proletariat. Like the dominant minority, the internal proletariat has nothing to unite it but its relationship to political power: it consists of all those people who have none. In the face of that fact, other social divisions gradually evaporate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Social hierarchies are a form of capital, and like any form of capital, they have maintenance costs, which are paid out in the form of influence and wealth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>The higher someone stands in the social hierarchy, the more access to influence and wealth they have; that’s their payoff for cooperating with the system and enforcing its norms on those further down. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As resources run short and a civilization in decline has to start cutting its maintenance costs, though, the payoffs get cut. For obvious reasons, the higher someone is on the ladder to begin with, the more influence they have over whose payoffs get cut, and that reliably works out to “not mine.” The further down you go, by contrast, the more likely people are to get the short end of the stick. That said, until the civilization actually comes apart, there’s normally a floor to the process, somewhere around the minimum necessary to actually sustain life; an unlucky few get pushed below this, but normally it’s easier to maintain social order when the very poor get just enough to survive. Thus social hierarchies disintegrate from the bottom up, as more and more people on the lower rungs of the latter are pushed down to the bottom, erasing the social distinctions that once differentiated them from the lowest rung. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That happens in society as a whole; it also happens in each of the broad divisions of the caste system—in the United States, those would be the major ethnic divisions. The many shades of relative whiteness that used to divide white Americans into an intricate array of castes, for instance, have almost entirely gone by the boards; you have to go pretty far up the ladder to find white Americans who differentiate themselves from other white Americans on the basis of whose descendants they are. Further down the ladder, Americans of Italian, Irish, and Polish descent—once strictly defined castes with their own churches, neighborhoods, and institutions—now as often as not think of themselves as white without further qualification. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same process has gotten under way to one extent or another in the other major ethnic divisions of American society, and it’s also started to dissolve even those divisions among the growing masses of the very poor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have something of a front-row seat on that last process; I live on the edge of the low-rent district in an old mill town in the Appalachians, and shopping and other errands take me through the neighborhood on foot quite often. I walk past couples pushing baby carriages, kids playing in backyards or vacant lots, neighbors hanging out together on porches, and as often as not these days the people in these groups don’t all have the same skin color. Head into the expensive part of town and you won’t see that; the dissolution of the caste system hasn’t extended that far up the ladder—yet. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is business as usual in a collapsing civilization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sooner or later, no matter how intricate the caste system you start with, you end up with a society divided along the lines sketched out by Toynbee, with a dominant minority defined solely by its access to power and wealth and an internal proletariat defined solely by its exclusion from these things. We’re not there yet, not in the United States; there are still an assortment of intermediate castes between the two final divisions of society—but as Bob Dylan said a long time ago, you don’t have to be a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The political implications of this shift are worth watching. As I’ve noted here more than once, ruling elites in mature civilizations don’t actually exercise power themselves; they issue general directives to their immediate subordinates, who hand them further down the pyramid; along the way the general directives are turned into specific orders, which finally go to the ordinary working Joes and Janes who actually do the work of maintaining the status quo against potential rivals, rebels, and dissidents. A governing elite that hasn’t yet gone senile knows that it has to keep the members of its overseer class happy, and provides them with appropriate perks and privileges toward this end. As the caste system starts to disintegrate due to a shortage of resources to meet maintenance costs, though, the salaries and benefits at the bottom of the overseer class get cut, and more and more of the work of maintaining the system is assigned to poorly paid, poorly trained, and poorly motivated temp workers whose loyalties don’t necessarily lie with their putative masters.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You might think that even an elite gone senile would have enough basic common sense left to notice that losing the loyalty of the people who keep the elite in power is a fatal error.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In practice, though, the disconnection between the world of the dominant elite and the world of the internal proletariat quickly becomes total, and the former can be completely convinced that everything is fine when the latter know otherwise. As I write this, there’s a timely example unfolding at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where hospital administrators have been insisting at the top of their lungs that every possible precaution was taken when the late Thomas Duncan was being treated there for Ebola. According to the nursing staff—two of whom have now come down with the disease—“every possible precaution” amounted to <a href=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20141015-in-statement-nurses-at-presbyterian-dallas-describe-confused-response-to-ebola-case.ece>no training, inadequate protective gear, and work schedules</a> that had nurses who treated Duncan go on to tend other patients immediately thereafter. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A few weeks ago, the US media was full of confident bluster about how <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/what-would-happen-if-someone-got-ebola-in-america/375928/?single_page=true">our high-tech medical industry would swing into action and stop the disease in its tracks</a>; the gap between those easy assurances and the Keystone Kops response currently under way in Dallas is the same, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, as the gap between the august edicts proclaimed in the capital during the last years of every civilization and the chaos in the streets and on the borders. You can see the same gap at work every time the US government trots out the latest round of heavily massaged economic statistics claiming that prosperity is just around the corner, or—well, I could go on listing examples for any number of pages. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So the gap that opens up between the dominant minority and the internal proletariat is much easier to see from below than from above. Left to itself, that gap would probably keep widening until the dominant minority toppled into it. It’s an interesting regularity of history, though, that this process is almost never left to run its full length. Instead, another series of events overtakes it, with the same harsh consequences for the dominant minority. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To understand this it’s necessary to include another aspect of Toynbee’s analysis, and look at what’s going on just outside the borders of a civilization in decline. Civilizations prosper by preying on their neighbors; the mechanism may be invasion and outright pillage, demands for tribute backed up by the threat of armed force, unbalanced systems of exchange that concentrate wealth in an imperial center at the expense of the periphery, or what have you, but the process is the same in every case, and so are the results. One way or another, the heartland of every civilization ends up surrounded by an impoverished borderland, scaled according to the transport technologies of the era.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the case of the ancient Maya, the borderland extended only a modest distance in any direction; in the case of ancient Rome, it extended north to the Baltic Sea and east up to the borders of Parthia; in the case of modern industrial society, the borderland includes the entire Third World. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
However large the borderland may be, its inhabitants fill a distinctive role in the decline and fall of a civilization. Toynbee calls them the external proletariat; as a civilization matures, their labor provides a steadily increasing share of the wealth that keeps the civilization and its dominant elite afloat, but they receive essentially nothing in return, and they’re keenly aware of this. Civilizations in their prime keep their external proletariats under control by finding and funding compliant despots to rule over the borderlands and, not incidentally, distract the rage of the external proletariat to some target more expendable than the civilization’s dominant minority. Here again, though, maintenance costs are the critical issue. When a dominant minority can no longer afford the subsidies and regular military expeditions needed to keep their puppet despots on their thrones, and try to maintain peace along the borders on teh cheap, they invariably catalyze the birth of the social form that brings them down. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Historians call it the warband: a group of young men whose sole trade is violence, gathered around a charismatic leader. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Warbands spring up in the borderlands of a civilization as the dominant minority or its pet despots lose their grip, and go through a brutally Darwinian process of evolution thereafter in constant struggle with each other and with every other present or potential rival in range. Once they start forming, there seems to be little that a declining civilization can do to derail that evolutionary process; warbands are born of chaos, their activities add to the chaos, and every attempt to pacify the borderlands by force simply adds to the chaos that feeds them. In their early days, warbands cover their expenses by whatever form of violent activity will pay the bills, from armed robbery to smuggling to mercenary service; as they grow, raids across the border are the next step; as the civilization falls apart and the age of migrations begins, warbands are the cutting edge of the process that shreds nations and scatters their people across the map. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The process of warband formation itself can quite readily bring a civilization down. Very often, though, the dominant minority of the declining civilization gives the process a good hard shove. As the chasm between the dominant minority and the internal proletariat becomes wider, remember, the overseer class that used to take care of crowd control and the like for the dominant minority becomes less and less reliable, as their morale and effectiveness are hammered by ongoing budget cuts, and the social barriers that once divided them from the people they are supposed to control will have begun to dissolve if they haven’t entirely given way yet. What’s the obvious option for a dominant minority that is worried about its ability to control the internal proletariat, can no longer rely on its own overseer class, and also has a desperate need to find something to distract the warbands on its borders?
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They hire the warbands, of course. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s what inspired the Roman-British despot Vortigern to hire the Saxon warlord Hengist and three shiploads of his heavily armed friends to help keep the peace in Britannia after the legions departed. That’s what led the Fujiwara family, the uncrowned rulers of Japan, to hire uncouth samurai from the distant, half-barbarous Kanto plain to maintain peace in the twilight years of the Heian period. That’s why scores of other ruling elites have made the obvious, logical, and lethal choice to hire their own replacements and hand over the actual administration of power to them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That latter is the moment toward which all the political trends examined in the last four posts in this sequence converge. The disintegration of social hierarchies, the senility of ruling elites, and the fossilization of institutions all lead to the hour of the knife, the point at those who think they still rule a civilization discover the hard way—sometimes the <i>very</i> hard way—that effective power has transferred to new and more muscular hands. Those of the elites that attempt to resist this transfer rarely survive the experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Those who accommodate themselves to the new state of affairs may be able to prosper for a time, but only so long as their ability to manipulate what’s left of the old system makes them useful to its new overlords. As what was once a complex society governed by bureaucratic institutions dissolves into a much simpler society governed by the personal rule of warlords, that skill set does not necessarily wear well. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In some cases—Hengist is an example—the warlords allow the old institutions to fall to pieces all at once, and the transition from an urban civilization to a protofeudal rural society takes place in a few generations at most. In others—the samurai of the Minamoto clan, who came out on top in the furious struggles that surrounded the end of the Heian period, are an example here—the warlords try to maintain the existing order of society as best they can, and get dragged down by the same catabolic trap that overwhelmed their predecessors. In an unusually complex case—for example, post-Roman Italy—one warlord after another can seize what’s left of the institutional structure of a dead empire, try to run it for a while, and then get replaced by someone else with the same agenda, each change driving one more step down the long stair that turned the Forum into a sheep pasture. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Exactly how this process will play out in the present case is impossible to predict in advance. We’ve got warband formation well under way in quite a few corners of industrial civilization’s borderlands, the southern border of the United States among them; we’ve got a dominant minority far advanced in the state of senility described in an earlier post; we’ve got a society equally well advanced in the dissolution of castes into dominant minority and internal proletariat. Where we are now in the process is clear enough; what will come out the other side, which will be discussed in a future post, is equally clear; the exact series of steps between them is of less importance—except, of course, to those who have the most to fear when the hour of the knife arrives.<br>

Paul Krugman is funny in the unintentional style the NYT is good at, but this was only typically funny - he shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence as a master comedian like Fukuyama. <br><br>Krugman's a 61-year-old at the tail end of his career whose entire identity is based around a delusion: in his case, perpetual growth by means of Keynesian economics. Having fallen to that view for a few years before reality hit me was a severe shock; I can't even begin to imagine how I'd respond if I'd spent my entire adult life immersed in the economic mainstream and risen to claim its most prestigious prize. He has staked his life on a worldview that is visibly crumbling around him: of course he's going to flail around like this as it disintegrates.<br><br>Of course, he already knows that growth is a physical process and that efficiency gains still don't allow indefinite exponential growth. He doesn't accept it consciously, but if you look at his columns you'll see the evidence of some subconscious realization of what's really going on written all over the place. He's written about and endorsed fellow comedian Larry Summers' idea of secular stagnation (otherwise known, but never phrased, as the end of growth), and used that to advocate negative interest rates as the only way to get the economy to keep expanding. During that weird, metastable early-2010s plateau that seems to be ending now, he actually did occasionally write about whether growth was slowing down permanently; he usually dismissed that notion, but never with any real evidence.<br><br>Some part of him must also be aware of the connection between economic growth and GHG emissions, even if carbon intensity usually falls slowly as GDP increases at a more rapid clip. Then there's the part of him that actually understands the implications of the exponential function: sure, you can improve efficiency as measured by GDP per unit energy consumed and grow your favorite economic statistic somewhat faster than energy consumption for a while, but there's no way this can continue for very long. An economy that becomes totally decoupled from energy and other resource inputs is an obvious absurdity, and I think some part of him knows this too.<br><br>That's why he's suddenly started attacking the Post-Carbon Institute, which he would have considered beneath him even a few months ago. If you eloquently troll him for long enough he might even respond to you directly - if he does, that post might actually put him in Fukuyama's comedy league. I agree with you that it's a fascinating sign of decline that the most mainstream of mainstream economists has suddenly started feeling the need to reply to peak oil bloggers.<br><br>I hope The End of History does manage to survive any future dark age, though. It's an amazing snapshot of the pulse of jubilation that appeared in 1989 right around the time of Fukuyama's first version of the essay.

Er, let’s see: which of these two groups of people is expected to test their predictions against hard facts and discard a theory that produces inaccurate predictions?...consider the IMF’s continued advocacy of austerity programs as the road to prosperity when no country that has ever implemented them has ever achieved prosperity thereby, or for that matter the huge majority of economists who insisted the housing bubble wasn’t a bubble and wouldn’t crash, right up until the bottom dropped out."<br><br>To be fair to Krugman, he has been pointing out the folly of "expansionary austerity" for years and was one of the few economists who thought that the housing market was in a bubble at the time. However, he had no idea how bad the bubble bursting would be. He's also made a few other predictions that have come true, such as expanding the money supply would not create inflation so long as interest rates were so low, but which other economists and policy makers have generally ignored. Just the same, those are successes within his paradigm, which means they don't fit in a world of limits to growth. Speaking of which...<br><br>"That the needle on the world’s fossil fuel gauge is swinging inexorably over toward E, to him, thus can only mean that some other source of cheap, abundant, highly concentrated energy will have to be found to keep the engines of economic growth roaring on at full throttle. That there may be no such replacement for fossil fuels ready and waiting in Nature’s cookie jar, and that economic growth can thus give way to an economic contraction extending over decades and centuries to come, has never entered his darkest dream."<br><br>That's pretty much what I've been saying about him. Peak oil? He's not having it.<br><br>However, he's not alone in assuming that "they'll think of something" because otherwise the assumptions of his world will be shown to be false.

He's a "nice" economist, with compassionate sensibilities, but in the end he's still an economist. Economics is one of America's "Civil Religions" as you've defined the term, and as a High Priest of Economics, Krugman is one of the senescing elites you describe. Krugman, and most of his compatriot economists, are blind to the natural limits of their profession in much the same way that telescopes can't see beyond 14 Billion light-years. Just the way that Karl Rove is alleged to believe, when he said "We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality." Economists are indeed lords of the reality that they create -- a mumbled word from an economist like Alan Greenspan can make the livelihoods of thousands of the internal proletariat appear or disappear like magic -- but because all they can see is within the bounds of their artificial reality, they don't notice and _CAN'T_ notice that the size of their sphere of influence is shrinking, due to real-world constraints. Krugman’s got a great plan for how the shipping industry can continue to grow infinitely on some theoretical planet other than Earth, but in the real world, he will be perpetually mystified by the mysterious, pessimistic dropoff in shipping demand as unemployed people can no longer afford to buy plastic crap shipped halfway around the world from China in the first place.<br><br>Krugman is basically admitting that economics is a separate, divorced reality from the physical world -- a reality of numbers and customer satisfaction, which can theoretically increase without limit and create numerical "wealth" out of thin air. He believes his theoretical economic numbers can visit the physical reality, "slumming" from their home dimension, to provide happiness and sustenance to real-world people -- in much the same way that the Christian "Holy Spirit" can visit Earth from Heaven to provide salvation and balm to the downtrodden. In some ways he has a point, because money itself is a figment of theory and imagination. We can re-jigger the formulas, create more money from thin air, pay people more, and in many circumstances that alleviates hardship. But that basically only works for human-induced hardship. <br><br>The example in his column about steamships is instructive. More or less he says that the shipping industry can experience growth and profits while using less petroleum if we order our ships to travel slower, because slow travel gets better gas mileage. In order that the total amount shipped not decrease, which would slow growth, we "simply" put more ships on the seas. Numerous objections leap to mind. Let’s ignore for a minute the fact that we’ve already tried this experiment on our highways, and found out that fuel economy is not sufficient incentive to get people to lower their travel speeds voluntarily. When Krugman says shipping can use less petroleum but still experience economic growth "simply" by adding more ships, I immediately started to think about logjams of container ships at ports, lining up to wait for an inadequate number of berths; the extra water pollution caused by leaking oil and trash from ships spending longer and longer times at sea; and so forth. How about refrigerated cargo, is there no extra cost for refrigerated or fragile cargo to spend months longer at sea? Isn't there a saddle point in a new graph between speed and efficiency somewhere, such that we can't continue to reduce speed by throwing more ships at the problem, because each ship is taking years or decades to make the journey? Doesn't the construction of more ships also use petroleum? He's right that there's still a lot of low-hanging fruit to be plucked in terms of energy efficiency... but at some point, the low-hanging fruit _will_ run out. His stance appears to be that we’ll find a new source of growth by then. Welcome to the perpetual bubble economy.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c8093996283550060671 title="comment permalink">10/15/14, 9:59 PM</a><br><br>

The pieces fit together so nicely, and I think the Krugmans of the world subconsciously recognize the link between perpetual progress, economics, and American exceptionalism.<br><br>The root of our exceptionalism myth is tied to three things, to my mind: our "just" form of governance, our military prowess, and our economic success. This, more than the nature of the collapse, is why I think Rome is such an alluring target of comparison. It's the same myth rewritten, the myth that all of Europe pursued at least until the First World War, when it lost its Tsars, Kaisers and Austrian emperors. The replacement myth has failed as well, but I digress.<br><br>The main thing I wanted to point out was how utterly silly the myth is when looked at from the outside. Whatever just elements our government once held are gone, and even Ivy League institutions issue political analysis conclusively demonstrating that the common people's views have zero correlation to government policy. Our economic success is the most striking, I think, because we just happened to one day find ourselves sitting on the largest stockpile of the most useful resource ever known to man. We had so much of it that it <i>accidentally</i> poured from the ground. I can't even imagine the fool who couldn't conjure massive growth in that situation. But that's the whole thrust of the myth; our military prowess is the product of that resource (as well as the good fortune to not be easily bombed during the World Wars), as is our economic strength, which is the "proof" offered up of the goodness of our system.<br><br>A whole system of mad hubris sustained itself for two centuries based on the fact that we sat on the largest pile of black goo. At least it was better than a system based upon enslavement or overt conquer-and-pillage methods, I guess. And even with this, the most elaborate, wealthy and bizarre civilization that's ever existed on earth, all the old rules of human nature dictate with Foundation-trilogy certainty the outcome we can expect. ISIS (or its inevitable successor) won't be our borderland warband, but it'll certainly be Europe's. Once the drug cartels have solidified themselves as governing systems, caring for the poor and enforcing basic rules of law in place of the failed Mexican government, they'll have all the panache, legitimacy and loyalty they need to become ours.<br><br>I suppose the most we can hope for is either the assimilation of the warbands into our society (a la the Normans in England or Romans in Greece) or our own charismatic leader who can replace the old system and rally the people against the threat. Both the US and Europe will soon sorely need a Charles Martel, or at least a Jan Sobieski. <br><br>As for me, I'll take comfort in knowing that I live in a place that the warbands will find intolerably cold, and try to secure the position of an Irish monastery of the new dark age. In a thousand years, between the lines of our Spanglish prayer books, some future academic will find the faded words of Francis Fukuyama, and laugh.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c933101445145338440 title="comment permalink">10/15/14, 10:48 PM</a><br><br>

What economist, mainstream climate change scientists and senile elites are mistaking most is using the "business as usual" scenario which they know very well to project future trends... whitout considering the profound changes that what they project will have on the complex system feedbacks.

Perhaps our abstract analyses could help predict where iterative trial and error will actually trend. (I remember for those of us who were there, the London EEE Conference this year; JMG a keynote speaker. This conference included a ‘simple’ participatory experiments in iterative behaviour and resulting patterns.)<br> <br>Our proletariat – both internal and external - is needed for hands on work, but as we have come to realise, most of the physical work that we ‘consume’ is actually done by ‘energy slaves’. Most of our proletariat are surplus to requirement except in one important sense as ‘consumers’. Without mass production and consumption the per-unit costs of each piece of our technology (shipping, airlines, tractors and trucks, factories, information and trading links moving supporting materials, and pre-eminently pipelines) do not make sense. We are not looking just at a proletariat resource tied mostly to the land and food production. These same modern resources feeding political and military structures, including ‘warbands’, feed the large network of urban societies.<br><br>I take it that your JMG point is that such ‘low-cost’ alternatives as warbands and the like, cannot run the larger system. So the system will adjust to what the warbands can run? Well, there are sure some interesting experiments ongoing both sides of the fence as it were. China is attempting to envisage a trading zone where the old silk roads are transformed into something like the Roman Mediterranean as low-cost infra structure to secure trade (added economic value) with Europe. All kinds of highway and pipelines are envisaged. On the other hand, marginal lands* nevertheless critical for connections, are in active contention in many key border zones, where low-cost (parasitic) violent organisations seek control of hubs. The larger networks are puzzled at the moment to deal with these violent interventions - and the USA for one, has lost respect. But the ratios are not yet entirely tipped in favour of parasitic low-cost control systems – in my humble opinion.<br> <br>PS * Ukraine with its very large area of arable land (a large per capita ‘surplus’) should not be considered ‘marginal’, but given relative cost structures just now, farming seems not the prime concern in that situation.<br><br>best<br>Phil<br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c743664476707275895 title="comment permalink">10/16/14, 5:00 AM</a><br><br>

I'm a little confused about your mention of protofeudalism and the rule by warbands in the context of much of the rest of your writing over the last many years. I did not think that you felt that a return to feudalism was an obligate or even likely outcome of the long descent. And how does the rule-by-warbands square with your other writings about government by small-scale participatory democracy? Are we talking about different scenarios that might all play out in different regions, perhaps even within the same present-day nation? I don't see much warband development here, and I doubt you do in Cumberland either. Our "drug lords" are the AMA doctors pushing opiates, and the local pot distributors who are for the most part stoned, passive, and no better armed than the rest of the population. The meth culture is not actually all that organized, just a bunch of small-time cookers who tend to blow themselves up, no need for warlords to do it for them. In these regions I see more of the structures in place that could transition into local democratic rule fairly smoothly, barring massive external disruption. Of course it will contain corruption, it always does. The voters actually do not really want law enforcement that is objective and unbiassed. <br><br>Or is one scenario the one you promote and hope for, while the other is the scenario you fear and warn about?<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c1469813559735001004 title="comment permalink">10/16/14, 5:57 AM</a><br><br>

The THREAT of violence means that these groups are already apparently being allowed to exercise increased power, especially in declining cities, through means that look democratic. In fact, compared to the old regime of Plutocracy, the rising power of the internal proletariat might be more democratic and less violent! An example would be the revolution to community policing and restructured police forces that are occurring right now in American cities. <br><br>"The border lands" seems to imply locations outside the US borders. But from my perspective, since the era of "White Flight," the suburbs have generally had an exploitive colonial relationship with American cities, which is increasingly true today. Most suburbs are kept afloat through a process of "mining" the cities by liquidating their infrastructure, wealth, real-estate, institutions ("privatization"), etc. and exporting the value to the suburbs. Meanwhile, further value is extracted in the form of "subsidy mining" where money intended to help urban poor is mined by suburban whites, who reap most of the value, while the risks and maintenance costs of "programs" are dumped on urban poor. <br><br>All of this is kept in place by power structures that we call "non-profits" and "NGOs" but would appear very familiar to managers of the East India Company. <br><br>I'm not sure that these areas have been "internal," as in sharing much in the benefits of the empire," for some time.<br><br>As a final, I can't help but notice that warbands and the constituencies they represent, from what I can tell, don't necessarily share much of the values of white liberal Gaia worshipers like me, with our fantasy of an inevitable "Permaculture Future" that's somehow dictated by natural law.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c5525842353249253974 title="comment permalink">10/16/14, 7:10 AM</a><br><br>

He's much smarter than the other public economists (faint praise, I know), and he has a quaint faith that economics is a science designed to serve truth and the creative minority. He seems truly frustrated and mystified as to why it seems to be simply fabricating convenient lies for the senile elite. <br><br> I don't occupy the same bubble as him (due thanks to peak oil bloggers and others!), but I do sympathize with one aspect of his optimism. His steamship digression can be read as a claim that predictions of collapse are unnecessarily pessimistic, because there is still tremendous scope for humans to adapt and muddle along using less energy than they do at present. I think that's inarguably true. As to whether energy efficiency could alone serve as an orderly transition to a (down-shifted) post-peak stability for some subset of the West - well, neither of us have done that math. Unlike many people here, I actually see Krugman as an earnest enough empiricist to eventually grapple with that. In his defensive way, he's thinking about energy constraints, which is a remarkable change for the de facto conscience of liberal economics.<br><br>What he is blind to, however, and what he could stand to learn from this blog, is the unlikelihood that the powers that be (or their "market forces") will engineer any such orderly downshift. <br><br>For several years he's been hammering away at one theme in particular - namely that economists and economic policy have been serving the delusions of political and economic elites rather than studying and seeking a way out of economic stagnation and the ongoing or upcoming erosion of the material position of global majorities. He's right about that, of course, but he seems to have no real insight into why that might be - and until he does much of his analysis remains irrelevant.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c7447552986902793778 title="comment permalink">10/16/14, 7:26 AM</a><br><br>

If anything, it was more empty of useful information than Krugman's posts. What dogs fusion power more than anything is that every single reactor design so far requires far more energy to produce the fusion reaction than the reaction itself supplies. Given that, the lack of any mention of energy efficiency at all in the Reuters article is astonishing. If I read it right, the only thing they are claiming is that in ten years they think they think they will be able to build a small-enough reactor to fit on a truck. Big whoop-ti-do. It's still useless in any real-world sense if it takes more energy to get the reaction running and sustained than the reaction provides. But since this article seems to have been written by and for economic interests, it should not surprise me there is no real-world data in it. After all, Krugman says economists are smarter than mere scientists. Economists don't need no stinkin' physical data to spin a tale well enough to get some money flowing in a direction they want it to flow ... at least so far.

In that story, the Alexandrian Elites reduced the entire social world of Alexandria down to “Hellenes” and “Barbarians” (using Hellenic antiquity the same way Southern Aristocrats in the 1800s used Shakespeare). Even the writings of the Christians in Hypatia’s circle of elites (such as Synesius) refer to monks and priests as barbarians tainting divine mysteries for the common rabble. And of course, when the hour of the knife arrived in the year 415, it was the monks, priests, and common rabble who came out on top. Now I’m about to start reading a biography of Theodosius I next, which should be filled with warbands and crumbling borders.<br><br>As for the energy bubble, this has been a learning experience about just how the beginnings of scarcity economics actually look and a lesson in how to sort through the nonsense spouted economists to pull out the underlying truths. What I’ve gathered so far is that the high price of energy made the energy investments of drilling depleted deposits in the US economically viable, fueling the oil and shale boom. Decreased demand started driving prices down, putting strain on the energy boom and opening the door for OPEC countries which haven’t hit their resource peak and have smaller economies comparatively to flood the market. Which means that the bottom should fall out of the American energy industry around the time that the cost of energy equals the cost of production, right? (Chesapeake is selling off wells which may be a sign that we’re getting close too...). It seems like that number will be really important number, since it reveals just how depleted America’s natural resources actually are. It’s tricky, because the way it plays out creates an illusion of abundance when what’s happening is actually a preview of what scarcity industrialism looks like. It also shows the difference between technical feasibility and economic viability.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c4769337254496163106 title="comment permalink">10/16/14, 9:51 AM</a><br><br>

Imagine a set of human inputs typical of a Monday morning as a family gets ready for work and school. Everyone is awash in a variety of inputs from oatmeal to news on the radio, kinesthetic feedbacks from putting on coats and shoes, oh, and everyone has breath coming in and out - steady as you please, burning up the food calories and creating respiration. Krugman is asserting that turning off the radio and choking off someone’s air supply are equivalent. Picture it; as your child grows blue in the face, clawing for survival more desperately by the moment you offer to satisfy all their immediate needs, being the good parent you are and always looking out for what is best for your offspring, by turning the radio back on.<br>This week I traced energy through succession to <a href=%E2%80%9D rel=nofollow>carrying capacity </a> on my blog, maybe it just made me sensitive to such statements but it leaves me feeling dizzy. If Krugman’s comment is an example of our intellectual elite’s thinking, we are indeed far into never–never land.

Before my research project I was a political anarchist. Afterwards I was a traditional conservative. My worldview was totally shaken. <br><br>Humans by and large behave like other social primates, that is, the claims that there will be imminent social equality is total bunk. Equally dubious are claims that any social program can make us stop acting like the great apes we are.<br><br>I bring this us because you make note in your essay that:<br><br><i>So the gap that opens up between the dominant minority and the internal proletariat is much easier to see from below than from above. Left to itself, that gap would probably keep widening until the dominant minority toppled into it. It’s an interesting regularity of history, though, that this process is almost never left to run its full length. </i><br><br>To which I reply of course it almost never runs its course! If I remember correctly Jane Goodall goes into great detail about how chimpanzees form and negotiate hierarchies: essentially a male comes to dominate the troop, he gets the most access to food and sex, eventually he grows old and is disposed of by a younger, stronger and less senile dominant male.<br><br>What we see with human hierarchies is, more or less identical. Spengler points out that as civilizations grow old they become stiff, rigid. Lao-tsu says beautiful that what becomes hard and rigid is following the path of Death.<br><br>Humans being humans we don't allow for a power vacuum. Even if most people are only managing to just get enough to survive there will always be those who get significantly more because they are dominant. As the elites grow weak and weaker, their muscles atrophy and their bones soften it is only a matter of time before a bigger, meaner kid comes and kicks them out of the tree.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c3339511949487387475 title="comment permalink">10/16/14, 1:58 PM</a><br><br>

I am unsure what other historians would say about the date of these migrations, and the numbers involved. I would be sceptical about a 1st millenium BC date for Celtic occupation of Britain, the placename "Karrek Loos y'n Koos" <i>The Grey Rock in the Wood</i> for St. Michael's Mount presently surrounded by water suggests a much earlier date, and I don't know of any real evidence for a distinct pre-Celtic population in Britain in the Bronze Age. Nevertheless it could be supposed there was a core territory of Britain, Ireland and Gaul and parts of Iberia dating much to a much earlier time that the later expansions of the 1st millenium BC sprung out of. <br><br>I have not studied the history of Classical Greece in detail, but did not the Hellenic world go through something of a previous collapse after the end of Alexander the Great's career, with the wars that followed his death until the time Greece fell under the Roman orbit? <br><br>Perhaps though this was not the same process, because the Celts did not end up in charge of Greece, indicating it was perhaps the Celts culture or economy that was decaying, and therefore any of that the warrior caste that did remain and settle were assimilated into the Greek societies in time.<br><br>Nevertheless, this period where the various Greek states were employing non-Greek mercenaries of various origins would serve perhaps to diminish the feeling of distinctness between different kinds of non-Greek, and different kinds of Greek over time, so that in the end there would be a dominant minority though in this case it was temporarily replaced by the Roman empire rather than warbands.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c3623830307455167272 title="comment permalink">10/16/14, 2:37 PM</a><br><br>

The chart is not misleading. The shipping industry is already using the principle presented; they could hardly be making use of a numerical error that is just all in Krugman's imagination.<br><br>It is extremely common to think that any fuel savings gained by moving slower is swamped out by the loss of taking more time, but that is an innumerate conclusion.<br><br>The effect Krugman is pointing out is simple enough to understand if you know fluid dynamics. The drag on an object is a function of the square of the speed. A car moving at 65mph is using 40% more power to overcome air resistance than a car moving 55mph even though it only gains 18% more speed. The effect only gets worse the greater the speed differential.<br><br>For a ship. 10 knots=100, 15 knots=225, 20 knots=400, 25 knots=625. If you want to go from 15 to 25 knots you only gain 66% more speed but have to use 177% more power. These are of course only BOE calculations missing tons of refinements but they illustrate the basic principle.<br><br>Krugman is wrong not because of innumeracy but rather because he seized on one of the few places where energy expenditure is exponential to the gain achieved.

Warband culture leading to feudalism is the norm. It's not quite inevitable -- I'm thinking here, among other examples, of Roman cities that survived the Dark Ages and maintained significant elements of their original system of government straight through to the high Middle Ages -- and it might be possible to forestall it, or at least temper it, with a revival of democratic culture and practice.

We have also talked about the “drug gangs” in America and Mexico as emerging warbands. Judging from this popular hip-hop song and video, it would appear that the rappers and inner city gangbangers here in America recognize Putin as a kindred spirit and that right wingers like Pat Buchanan and William Lind aren’t the only Americans who admire him and see him as a role model. Of course, given the complete failure of leadership from the likes of Obama, Cameron, Hollande and whatever non-entities are currently warming the prime ministerial seats in Rome, Athens, Stockholm and Madrid this month, that shouldn’t be too much of a surprise.

Its corollary might be ‘Modern Western Thought, Modern Western Weakness’. As the West has adopted the ideology of cultural Marxism that has as its primary objective the destruction of traditional Western culture, it has devoured itself. Now, in most of the West, the will to live is almost gone (just look at the birth rates). China too became weak during Mao’s “Cultural Revolution,” which sought to destroy traditional Chinese culture. Now, the return of that culture has brought China new strength. Perhaps there is a lesson there for the West.<br><br>Whether or not the West rallies and turns back from the road to Avernus, it will face a China that thinks and acts differently from the itself. In a contest between head-butters and maneuverists, the maneuverists usually win, absent a gross disparity of strength. If the West insists on destroying everything that has defined it for 3000 years, that might be good news. A world dominated by traditional Chinese culture would likely be a far better place than a world dominated by Islam, corporate greed, or unending disorder.”<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c1697940625821274834 title="comment permalink">10/16/14, 6:07 PM</a><br><br>

The short form is that at some point in the next few years, possibly as soon as now, we're going to enter the second major round of crises in the decline and fall of industrial civilization. The first such round ran from 1914 to 1954, give or take; think about the events of those years -- two world wars, a global pandemic, a global depression, and a steady drumbeat of revolutions, political crises, mass murders, and so on -- and you've got a very rough sense of what we're facing.

I learned much the same thing from comparing the oh so liberal Neopagan groups I've encountered with baboon troops, and noticing that the only significant difference is that the baboons don't insist that their hierarchy doesn't exist. Have you read Burke yet, btw? He should be high on the list for any recent convert to conservatism. <br><br>Laylah, no, I hadn't -- thanks for the link!<br><br>MawKernewek, good -- it's not quite the same process, no, but familiarity with any troubled period of history will give you useful points of comparison for the present. I see the Hellenistic era as parallel to the early modern era in Europe, when the various nations were still forming and Britain hadn't yet risen to global domination. <br><br>Varun, relations between the locals and the hordes vary all over the potential space of human interactions, and it's far from uncommon for the barbarians and the local inhabitants to work out a modus vivendi very quickly -- warlords like food on the table, so they have a vested interest in keeping the peasants productive; peasants like to be protected from raiders and the like, and so they have a vested interest in finding a competent warlord. Of course there are exceptions to that rule, but it's very much a matter of specific conditions. <br><br>Ed-M, Putin isn't exactly a warlord -- he's a talented despot in charge of a large and potentially very powerful nation, who's figured out that the age of scarcity industrialism is here but may not grasp all the details yet. He could certainly crash and burn -- it's a common occupational hazard in his field -- but we'll see. <br><br>Mark, I see the joke writers are working overtime these days!<br><br>Dornier, I think you missed both our points. Of course slow steaming has some economic payoff -- the point is that the chart in Krugman's piece overstates it by neglecting to factor in the increased number of days per voyage. That's the innumeracy we were discussing. <br><br>Greg, a good point! Having turned the F-35 into one of history's great subsidy dumpsters, the folks at Lockheed Martin may have noticed how well the fusion crowd has been playing that game, and decided to try to get a piece of the action themselves. <br><br>Aanos, thank you!

The direct cause was carrying on with business as usual in a crisis situation, which is what institutions ordinarily do at first. Mr. Duncan wasn’t sent home with pills on his first visit because anyone wasn’t doing their job. Their job was not to admit any uninsured patient who showed up at the ER unless that patient was at death’s door. BAU continued after his admission. The administrators didn’t foresee any reason to change the normal staffing practices or implement extraordinary measures against infection.<br><br>IMO the test of whether this is an example of normal institutional stupidity or sclerotic decline will be whether and how fast people in charge learn from the initial mistakes. The media attention to the mishandling of Duncan’s case could result in treating it as a shakedown cruise. <br><br>However, I think the lesson hospitals are actually learning is to dump any Ebola patients they receive on some other institution. Caring for Ebola patients in US hospitals is going to be very expensive. There are no effective drugs available at almost any price, only supportive care and perhaps blood transfusions from recovered survivors. Double staffing is required to implement a buddy system for the donning and removal of protective gear; otherwise large portions of your staff will soon be in isolation themselves or infecting the hospital’s regular patients, neither of which is good for the bottom line. A huge amount of medical waste is generated in industrialized care for hemorrhagic fevers. According to Rachael Maddow’s report tonight, the facility to which one of the sick nurses was moved has a giant autoclave in which everything the patient has used is sterilized—laundry as well as medical equipment. There are four US facilities for highly contagious diseases that have this kind of autoclave, and they have a total of nine beds for Ebola patients.<br><br>I suspect that until a day or two ago the advice that the CDC was giving hospitals on how to avoid transmitting the disease was not based on the protocols used by organizations like Doctors Without Borders and the WHO which have experience treating it in Africa. Those organizations apparently had a pretty good record in preventing health workers from being infected during previous outbreaks. The information is readily available; I posted a link to one of the manuals here a few weeks ago. If CDC thought they knew better than the people with field experience, that is indeed a sign of institutional rot. <br><br>Finally, if the social fabric is more or less intact at the beginning of an outbreak, having a public health system that is not very technologically advanced may be an advantage in containing it, in part because it simplifies triage. I gather that in viral diseases of this kind, the sicker the patient, the more contagious, as the immune system fails and all the body’s resources are hijacked into producing more copies of the virus. The interventions possible at that point may be more likely to kill the nurses than to save the patient. Also, a patient in extremis with fluids coming from every orifice probably doesn’t care whether she’s lying on a clean sheet or a straw mat. The straw mat can be burnt.<br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c7686613329062279016 title="comment permalink">10/16/14, 11:09 PM</a><br><br>

This, for me, rings truer than issues of imitation or respect for the elite. No doubt respect for the elite helps but, failing that, a full belly and some of the loot goes a long way to keeping people loyal to you. This at least has been my observation based on personal experience with some of the warlords and cruder elites and their retainers in the third world. <br><br>Just to be clear who the elite are, we could use the case in Canada. 86 families in Canada (representing 0.002% of the population) hold the same amount of wealth as the bottom 34%. Combined, these families have enough wealth to buy every private asset in the province of New Brunswick. Many of these families have criminal pasts. Only 10 of Canada's highest paid CEOs are part of the Wealthy 86. These CEOs are just the top end of the retainer class; not really part of the elite at all. <br><br>This underscores a point you made in an earlier post: the extremely wealthy stay that way not through income but by building and trading assets, mostly companies. This brings me to a question I brought up some time ago. In most civilizations of the past, wealth was based on resource extraction from land. Of course this is still the case; thus the need for an ever expanding frontier. However, in the past, the link between land and wealth was much more direct. Wealth meant ownership of land and those who worked it for you. Right now, extreme wealth is based on owning companies. In the past one could kill his landlord (or someone else could) and one could be further ahead ... not so much now in the OECD countries.<br><br>As the economic decline progresses, will we not find that a significant portion of the elite and their top retainers simply cease being such because the basis for their wealth disappears? Many of the companies they own will simply go bankrupt. Certainly a core group of the elite will buy up what are still going concerns; but will not the rest simply atrophy? No doubt the warlords will move in at some point, but well before that point, will not much of the elite simply cease to be such? So, say in the case of Canada, will we not see Wealthy 86 contract to say the Wealthy 20 long before these last are threatened seriously by warlords? A positive answer to this question does not contradict your main point at all but it would involve a making the basic process more specific to our time.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c6986529341915965139 title="comment permalink">10/17/14, 6:17 AM</a><br><br>

Everyone's saying the worst is over, and economists are making increasingly bold claims about the invincibility of the American energy boom. Based on what energy companies were doing earlier this week, I'm getting the distinct impression the 80 dollars a barrel price of oil was teetering on the brink of what the industry can handle. These are the numbers energy analysts are giving to the press for the point at which fracking and directional drilling in America stop being economical(http://www.cnbc.com/id/102094881). Would it be safe to assume that that price is probably actually a lot higher? I can see this whole situation teetering on the edge of collapse, but I'm not sure how long it will take. My thought is that if the industry can limp along until winter, cold weather demand could prop up the bubble until sometime next spring but I just can't see it lasting any longer than that. I'm still expecting November, especially if there's another price drop next week. I do know that my friend in the energy industry for whom peak oil is usually a no-go topic if we want to maintain our friendship told me that he's trying to find a way out of the industry before it goes. I grew up in Midland Texas, and its population has more than tripled since the energy boom started and it's sprawled out, built new extravagent and flashy wastes of space. Once this bubble bursts, I may just have to go visit just so I can see the abandoned buildings getting claimed by tumbleweeds and dust. Do you have any recommendations for a good place to follow the bubble that doesn't require mucking through the nonsense that economists and journalists say?

The disagreement seems to stem from fundamentals: Krugman sees growth continuing, and most here do not. So it's a religious dispute: his religion is Progress, and people here practice the anti-religion of Decline. (Me personally? As with God, I have an agnostic attitude toward the Progress-Decline dichotomy right now.)<br><br>My point in bringing it up is that all of you laughing at Krugman et al are essentially being unfair, or at least being unreflective about it. Fact is, a majority here seem to agree that his policy economic positions are mostly right, but his worldview is mostly wrong.<br><br>To put it another way, despite the general belief here that none of this will last, when it comes to specific questions of contemporary economic policy, most of you seem to find yourselves in the position of having to awkwardly agree with one or another of the Progress authorities. Eg. most seem to agree with JMG that "everywhere austerity has been tried it has failed." But austerity is the act of ceasing to spend money when the money has run out, no? So non-austerity *is* spending money even after it's run out... which is Krugman's position.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c5490765260705007219 title="comment permalink">10/17/14, 10:03 AM</a><br><br>

It has failed *almost* every time it's been tried, but not every single time. The reason it usually fails is that it is not accompanied by debt repudiation--- eg in the form of currency revaluation, or by defaulting wholesale on debt obligations like Iceland in '08 or the USA in 1933 (I'm referring to the bank holiday and wholesale contract abrogation in spring 1933---FDR's Keynesian style make-work and infrastructure programs ramped up later, particularly after the Supreme Court killed the NRA in 1935).<br><br>The reason debt repudiation is rarely done is that it causes pain for everybody, rich and poor; the benefit is that it places an economy in a greatly improved position later on. How? Interest payments are wealth transfers from productive to unproductive sectors of society---with lower debt levels, an economy functions more productively. Austerity *without* debt repudiation (which is the IMF's cure) causes pain for debtors (mostly less wealthy) but enriches the lenders (mostly wealthy)... the result is an economy with ever greater shares of its productivity going to the rich, and a *much* more poorly functioning economy. Eg Greeks become impoverished, even while writing ever bigger checks to German bankers.<br><br>Krugman's Keynesianism provides an alternative: when debt becomes unpayable, have a more creditworthy entity (the government) issue even greater amounts of debt to cover the transfer payments. The benefit is far fewer people suffering… at least right now. The negatives are three-fold: 1) increased wealth-transfer from the economy in general to the rich, in the form of ever greater interest payments, 2) almost inevitably the new debt won't finance productive asset-building, but will finance consumption and/or speculation: so we get a housing bubble, a stock-market bubble, or a fraking bubble, which *WILL* lead to another crisis later, and 3) the *risk* (not certainty) that the authorities may loose control of the money supply (uncontrolled inflation). Usually this only occurs when, in addition to everything else, there is some kind of supply shock---like the occupation of Ruhr in 1923, or an oil-shock which we might see again in the next few years.<br><br>Outside of a few libertarian and/or right-wing circles, possibility 1 (austerity + debt repudiation) is completely ignored by everybody. The consensus (against evidence) is that the result is an automatic great depression---the actual Great Depression had multiple causes, most of them rooted in WWI and its aftermath. The IMF and the big banks like possibility 2 (austerity only), and the center-left economic mainstream likes possibility 3 (more debt, no austerity at all). To me it's strange that this blog sympathizes with the mainstream on this one!<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c1508805684159113784 title="comment permalink">10/17/14, 10:16 AM</a><br><br>

You know how it is, like every other kid I wanted to fit in.

The common people will be caught in the middle, as usual.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c9039978842860663205 title="comment permalink">10/17/14, 1:41 PM</a><br><br>

I had honestly never paid too close attention to the goings on in Iraq so maybe this is old news but I found some details pretty surprising.<br>First, I learned that the insurgents the US military spent so much time fighting were largely former soldiers of the Iraq military, something the Americans disbanded early on in the invasion. After fighting them for many years, General David Petraeus led a plan to hire them as peacekeepers and they became known as the "Sons of Iraq." Predictably, with the insurgents on the payroll, this made things a lot more stable temporarily. But now that they aren't being propped up, many of them have defected to ISIS. This seems like as close a definition of a warband-scenario as anything else I can imagine!<br><br>And if anyone's curious that episode of Frontline is watchable online here if anyone is curious - http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/losing-iraq/<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c7030054318773533906 title="comment permalink">10/17/14, 2:06 PM</a><br><br>

Other than that, pretty much the same. <br><br>Dorda, there I disagree. ISIS makes sense from the point of view of hardcore takfiri Muslim fundamentalism -- "put your trust in Allah and forget about everything else" makes perfect sense from the perspective of people who won't use toothpaste because it isn't mentioned in the Quran. <br><br>Agent, loyalty and mimesis are powerful forces when the elite is still a creative minority, and people dream about being successful in the same mode. It's precisely when loyalty becomes solely a matter of a paycheck that you know the rot has set in. As for the dissolution of the elite due to the collapse of the system that gives them their wealth and power, bingo -- the thing to watch is the emergence of alternative structures of power within the crumbling shell of the existing order. I'll be discussing that as we proceed. <br><br>Eric, get used to sifting through the stupid. As for the temporary pause in the decline, those are common -- I'd encourage you to read Galbraith's <i>The Great Crash</i> if you haven't already; he talks in some detail about the way that every temporary respite got turned into an excuse for renewed fantasies of prosperity "just around the corner." <br><br>1ab, I'd love to see that -- but I don't imagine the experiment will ever be tried. I doubt anybody among the current dominant minority in the US wants to know the answer to that question. <br><br>NosVemos, the woods are a good place to learn just now!<br><br>Andropos, you're late to the conversation. No, most of us don't agree with Krugman's policies -- quite the contrary.

I noted in a post here <a href=../../2012/07/the-upside-of-default.html rel=nofollow>back in 2012</a> that a comprehensive default on unpayable debt is the only way that today's debtor nations will return to prosperity, so I'd encourage you to check your facts next time before insisting that this blog favors a set of policies that I've critiqued at length.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c1343937191053263138 title="comment permalink">10/17/14, 3:54 PM</a><br><br>

Here is the original set of columns:<br><br>http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/JA08Ag01.html<br><br>http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/JH13Ag01.html<br><br>http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/JH19Ag04.html<br><br>Goldman pointed out back then that Putin would have been a far better leader than either Obama or McCain and that one of the reasons why the US is in so much trouble is because of poor leadership by the current crop of elites. Goldman is himself a very well connected member of the elite and served as a senior official in both the Reagan and Bush Sr. administrations, so he speaks from first hand experience as someone who was a high ranking government official and knows the shortcomings of the establishment all too well. <br><br>Again this comes back to a failure of mimesis as well as leadership. When you have diehard conservatives, inner city gangsters, rap stars and even certain members of the elite openly expressing admiration for a foreign despot like Putin and you have a leading paleoconservative and military analyst like Lind saying that a world dominated by China would be preferable to a continuation of the present American Empire, it speaks volumes about just how hated and unpopular the status quo has become. I am also reminded of Cornelius Tacitus, a Roman senator and a leading intellectual of Imperial Rome, who denounced the growing degeneracy of his own people while praising the Germanic barbarians who were assailing the northern frontier of the Roman Empire as exemplars of virtue. I think we will see similar sentiments expressed a lot more in the not-so-distant future.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c38790958466110350 title="comment permalink">10/17/14, 4:03 PM</a><br><br>

I spent much of my book <i>The Wealth of Nature</i> pointing out that mainstream economists these days live in Neverland. <br><br>Daniel, see August Johnson's comment. I'd encourage as many people as possible to download copies and make them accessible via the web, so we can keep this information out there. <br><br>Grebulocities, granted. If people get good and scared at this point, it might just get them wary enough to slow the transmission of further cases below the point that an epidemic can sustain itself. <br><br>Justin, you're pulling one detail out of context rather than trying to follow the whole argument. Warbands by themselves don't result in feudalism; warbands in a declining civilization do. Ming China was fairly stable, thus the continuation of the same civilization under different management for another three centuries. <br><br>Ed-M, where did you get the fifty years? No, that's not what I think at all. Again, my take is that we're on the brink of a multidecade crisis period, which will be followed by another period of relative calm -- mind you, the US will probably be an impoverished Third World nation by the time the crisis ends, but that's common enough in such situations. The calm will be followed by another round of crisis, another calm, and a final round of crisis toward the latter part of the 22nd century in which the last scraps of industrial civilization will go under once and for all. I'll talk about the reasons for that scenario in an upcoming post. <br><br>Brian, to my mind it's less empire management than crisis management, and increasingly inept crisis management at that. <br><br>Nemo, typical. A lot of German barbarians were on the Roman payroll at one point or another. <br><br>Donalfagan, you'll notice that the fall of the Marcos regime did not equal the end of Philippine civilization.

It seems the point of confusion was indeed our different understandings of the word "austerity." The way you explain it in your reply, I agree that it has always failed to restore prosperity.... although it has been successful in its main goal which is to keep the rich happy and wealthy regardless of what's going on with everyone else. I suppose I must also retract my assertion that "Outside of a few libertarian and/or right-wing circles, possibility 1 (austerity + debt repudiation) is completely ignored by everybody"..... since you have pointed out that something like this was discussed on this blog 2 years ago. Again, apologies.<br><br>As for "check your facts next time before insisting that this blog favors a set of policies that I've critiqued at length" .... Well gee! I'd have to familiarize myself with at least 2 years of posts and read a book! Now your work is worth reading, but that's quite a bar to pass before contributing to the Archdruid's comment threat.<br><br>To William Church: yeah, Krugman's favored trade policies have definitely contributed to USA middle class decline. In fact he's admitted so himself, in some of his lectures on trade policy. His (overt) justification is compassion: it's OK to sacrifice some well-being of the American middle class in order to outsource jobs to the rest of the world...that lets the even poorer people in other societies escape their rice polders and become part of the world economy, too.<br><br>I'll leave it to others to pick apart this kind of argument if they want to---there are numerous ideologically different ways to do so from all across the spectrum---but I will say that if you believe in eternally expanding economies, or even if you merely believe the planet has enough resources for 7 billion to live like Americans, then there is at least something to be said for his point of view. The younger me held views like that at points in the past, and I don't think I was a *complete* idiot.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c4656577135369659594 title="comment permalink">10/17/14, 4:48 PM</a><br><br>

One person, a journalism professor, objected to the word "impact. Strenuously. She said we had to replace it, because it was inappropriate.

When the group seemed disinclined to agree with her she doubled-down and defended her position - she was PROUD of tossing talented young people's work in the trash over a stupid (and incorrect) matter of opinion. <br><br>She said the people who make grants would not take us seriously with that word.

Just last week you were pointing out how government functions become cemented in place. In fact you even wrote that "Getting an entrenched bureaucracy to set aside its mummified policies in the face of changing conditions is generally so difficult that it’s often easier to leave the old system in place while redirecting all its important functions to another, newly founded bureaucracy oriented toward the new policies. If conditions change again, the same procedure repeats, producing a layer cake of bureaucratic organizations that all supposedly exist to do the same thing."<br><br>Then today it turns out Bush III has appointed an "Ebola Czar"! And not a doctor or nurse, either. A Biden crony. Of course, if the surgeon general were expected to do his or her job (sad that I don't know who he or she is), and Obama suspected that he or she wasn't up to par, wouldn't the logical consequence be simply to replace him or her?<br><br>This very idea that this job is for the surgeon general in fact came to my attention earlier in the week when Mike Shedlock suggested it on his blog. It makes sense to me. If one of your employees isnt fulfilling their duties, you don't hire another one and still leave them on the payroll!<br><br>Yet, thanks to your post last week I understand why, in the case of a bureaucracy, you would. From a personal perspective, I still can't get over it though. I guess I'm just too practical a personality. <br><br>Your timing is certainly impeccable.

Caesar is interesting because he both aspired to supremacy in Rome (secure the heartland) and because he thought that conquering/pillaging the periphery might make the heartland more secure (I think Ortega y Gassett pointed this out somewhere). A legion was just a gigantic and well organized warband with lots of discipline and the power of the mutating Roman state behind it. They could invade virtually anything (Caesar went across the Rhine and into Britain, just for sightseeing and practical reasons), live off the land, and settle down comfortably into winter quarters, while their enemies starved and hid in the hills, plotting revenge. I think you'll see US military operating like that as well, behind a charismatic general or colonel. So the chaos is going to cut both ways. <br><br>It's interesting that someone like Violet Cabra can end up becoming a traditional conservative from such a different starting point than myself (it's my birth right, but I had to 'rediscover' it, like all real learning). A sign of the times. Traditional conservatism's motto (given by Burke) is "never, without strongest necessity, disturb something that is at rest (equilibrium)." It's basically geared towards the preservation of a "bottom up" peasant-democracy as the underpinnings of whatever superstructure you build on top.

It's quite a bit cheaper to order in bulk. My thoughts on herbs for kidneys, liver and other things like soothing the intestines or controlling bleeding, are to make a strong tea of it, cool it off, stuff it with powdered vitamin C or whatever other medicinals I've come up with, and either sip it or use it as a slow rehydrating enema solution. You can also buy pedialyte. There is a formula for adding salt and sugar to a quart of hydrating water. I believe its 6 teaspoons of some kind of sugar and 1/2 tsp of salt.<br>There's the idea of hydrating as soon as you know you're sick, to get a jump on it before it gets more difficult to take anything in. Also, I like the emergen-c formula as it is 1000mg of c with some other electrolytes and B vitamins. All of this can go up the backside as well as down the hatch. Naturally, you might wonder how to accomplish much is diarrhea is bad. The answer is to drip it slowly and not worry when you lose some that you put in. Some will be absorbed. Likewise in the mouth, even if vomited back up, some is absorbed and the key is to go slow. There might be a time when the vomiting or diarrhea is really severe, but you would try not to let that go without replacement for more than about 12 hours. Consider an enema kit. <br><br>I'm not buying detox formulas, as they have different goals and mixes. Some herbs I'm interested in are yarrow for intestinal irritation, control of bleeding. and fever. Chinese medicine says it is good for kidney, spleen and liver. Boldo tea- antiinflammatory, for liver-gallbladder and GI upset.<br>Dandelion- both liver and kidneys. Milk thistle- liver. Can chew the seeds. couch grass for kidneys. turmeric- antiinflammatory. peppermint tea - quite soothing to stomach. Never forget cayenne. It can be added to tolerance to every beverage of tea or coffee. <br>Burdock - fever, blood purifier, liver.<br>Sheperd's purse- fever, vomiting blood, headache, diarrhea.<br>Licorice - if blood pressure low.<br><br>I'm also looking into homeopathic remedies for hemorrhagic fever. For some reason homeopathics really makes rationalists nervous, but I have never understood why. If you get the right treatment, it's pretty amazing. For example, the flu remedy oscillococcinum. The first time I tried it, it took away a headache with flu that nothing would help for about 3 days running. My symptoms began to recede an hour after I took it. I then gave it to two or three more family members, all of whom got better quickly. That was over ten years ago, I have tried it two or three more times to no avail. Right now I have some sort of respiratory flu/cold with chest involvement, was feeling really bad Tuesday night, tried the oscillo, and felt immediate relief in 1-2 hours. My conclusion is that oscillo works like a charm if you really have the kind of flu it is made for. There are lots of upper respiratory, flu-like, cold-like illnesses.<br>The homeopathics I'm looking at consist mostly of snake venom and spider venom. Crotalus hurridus, Bothrops, Lachesis, phosphorus, mercurius corrosivus, sicarius. <br><br>I think consulting an herbalist is a good idea. someone here recommended Herbal Antivirals by Buhner, which I bought.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c7872569665135486840 title="comment permalink">10/17/14, 8:24 PM</a><br><br>

You were thinking of growing some? They also have some interesting vegetables and I think I remember seeing dried herbs in their catalogue. For bushes like elderberry, schizendra, goji berries, some sources are Horizon Herbs in Southern Oregon, Forest Farms from the same region, and Raintree in Washington State. You might want to place orders ASAP. The best East Coast source I know of is probably Fedco, in Maine.<br><br>Wadalusi, about the future Republic of the Pacific, or Cascadia: <br><br>First, you might be getting a little ahead of yourself. I doubt the USA is going to splinter apart in the next few years, although, stranger things have happened. <br><br>A new nation of Cascadia would be surrounded by some large players wanting to take over so prestigious and lucrative territory a territory as the Pacific Northwest; some of their names are Mexico, the remnants of the USA, Canada, and China. The governing authorities of such a new nation would need to immediately fortify and control the mouth of the Columbia River (with its experienced pilots), and the San Juan de Fuca Straits. Also, the Cascadian authority must control and fortify the major dams, from Lookout Point (where the Willamette R. emerges from the mountains), to at least, The Dalles and John Day ,and preferably Grand Coulee as well, so must be able to project power into what is now Eastern Oregon and Washington, over the armed objections of "libertarian" ranchers who are used to having their own way. Militaries are likely to still have aircraft long after anyone else, and most have one or two of those huge dam-busting bombs tucked away. Flood out the inhabitants of, say, the Willamette Valley, and then you get to settle your own people there.<br><br>What I do think people across the USA need to start doing now is seizing control of local governments and taking back assets such such as water systems from corporate ownership. The anti-GMO movement in Southern Oregon does look it could become the nucleus of an insurgent (and maybe in future decades, governing) political party.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c1252151785434487840 title="comment permalink">10/17/14, 11:07 PM</a><br><br>

There's not a lot of good information about them, but there's a little. I'm sure that if we knew the real story, these stories would all be very Shakespearean. It's not hard to imagine this era retroactively becoming a great age of legends, especially if you were to white wash a lot of the brutality (which I expect is as par for the course as anything else). Common themes include armed militant wings of larger organizations becoming independent enemies of their previous bosses (Los Zetas came from the Sinaloa cartel, but I seem to remember other similar stories, maybe in Michoacan?), a very very quickly changing map of territories and alliances (these organizations seem too fluid to ever actually pin down or understand), and also the conflict between more brutal and more business-like factions of cartels. In the case of the Zetas and Sinaloa, the more brutal side won, broke away, became one of the biggest cartels in Mexico, and is in the forefront of escalating violence and brutality. In the case of the Tijuana cartel, the more business-like side won. As I understand, their leadership was several brothers but is now their sister (who has a degree in accounting) and her son (who leads the men). My sense is that are closer to filling the role of a government than other cartels. John Michael Greer, what can you say about conflicting trends towards both becoming more organized, defined, and legitimate on the one hand, and becoming more brutal and aggressive on the other hand? I'm guessing we'll see both. I'm curious how the two will interact with one another.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c3960295274164780224 title="comment permalink">10/17/14, 11:36 PM</a><br><br>

It might not be immediately obvious why the First World War starting in 1914 would be a crisis of decline, because per capita energy use in the industrialised nations taking part was well under what its eventual peak would be. It could instead be thought of as a crisis of growth, because for example the working classes in Britain around the beginning of the 20th C were still poor even in the head nation of the wealthiest imperial structure of the time, so while there was still a lot of growth, demand from rising expectations was outstripping it? Likewise this same pattern would make the retention of overseas colonies untenable in the long term.<br><br>Or can we analyse it as a crisis of decline, because the main resource that the empires had, namely colonies, had now pretty much all been added to one empire or another during the "Scramble for Africa" in the 19th C?

Professional members have been practicing and go through a rigorous peer review. You can also search locally for herbwives, root doctors, medicine makers, but if you don't already travel in these circles it can be hard to find the opening. Finally, you can do an internet search for herb schools in your area, which may also have a free clinic where their students gain experience.<br><br>Doing Our Own Research<br>Even if you are working with a qualified herbalist, you might want to research herbs that are supportive to various organ systems as opposed to detoxing herbs or formulas. While some supportive herbs can have a detoxing effect, that is not their sole function. To my mind there are few situations that benefit from detoxing because we are not all toxic, shoring up our systems will have more far reaching benefits for most of us. I was interested to read Matthew's comment wherein he quoted traditional conservatism's motto as "never, without strongest necessity, disturb something that is at rest (equilibrium)." Ebola would be the strongest necessity, but using the strongest measures <i>in preparation</i> of a viral threat may upset our body's balance and ability to respond. <br><br>Using keywords such as "hepatoprotective," "lymphatic," and "trophorestorative and (enter organ system here)" could be a good start. Herbs that are anti-virals may be helpful, certainly I am thinking about herbs that help prevent capillary fragility. A search for "nephroprotectives" will turn up material on kidneys that isn't necessarily herbal and if you search for "kidney herbs" you'll turn up a bunch of information on cleansing your kidneys. So herbs to support your kidneys may require a deeper search.<br><br>continued...<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c4713419722539016633 title="comment permalink">10/18/14, 8:41 AM</a><br><br>

I just finished reading Bruce Catton's excellent history of the endgame of the US Civil War, <i>Never Call Retreat</i>. I was struck by the almost blind groping Lincoln did around the issues of slavery. At first he claimed to be ambivalent towards it, and then issued the Emancipation Proclamation solely as a military expedient, and by the Gettysberg address went to recast the entire war as being about slavery. By the end of the war he was working to pass a constitutional amendment banning slavery from the united states forever. <br><br>People can agitate towards social justice, and I think that this agitation has the potential to do great good. The changes aren't likely to be accepted though until the views themselves are middle of the road. By the end of the US civil war ending slavery was sufficiently middle of the road that it was workable. Even the confederate government decided to allow slaves to be soldiers with freedom and money afterwards at the request of Gen. Lee. This of course happened only a few months before Richmond fell, but speaks volumes about how attitudes about slavery had shifted tremendously.<br><br>My point is that social justice can happen, but only does so at a horrifically slow pace. There is certainly a "should" that exists. Slavery is clearly an injustice. It <i>should</i> have never happened and/or been abolished much sooner. However, there is also, the "could" and "would". And these are, in my estimation, much weightier than any "should". The should is born out historically of being, at most, secondary.<br><br>My personal belief is that it is always more <i>effective</i> to allow for the horrifically slow pace of change than to burn away the fabric of society to endeavor bold sweeping changes. As a corollary I think it is almost always the most effective to have change come though the institutions already in place rather than dismantle said institutions and start from scratch. Human beings are reluctant to change and sweeping changes have a tendency towards total failure. Have you read Warren Johnson's <i>Muddling Towards Frugality</i>? It is an charming book that articulates the appeal of Conservatism in terms of both resources and social structures in gracious, light-hearted prose.<br><br>Matthew Casey Smallwood , It is indeed interesting! ;7) <br><br>Thank you for your Burke quote and beautiful explanation.

To facilitate the merger, the FDIC put about $24 million of its own money (accumulated FDIC deposit insurance premiums) into the deal. Maryland has a couple of factors making bank failure more likely now: it's a "judicial foreclosure" state, and its proximity to Washington DC ensures that some of the wealth pumped in from the provinces splashes its way.<br><br>Judicial foreclosure means that a court ruling is necessary to put a debtor out of the house. (The alternative is "administrative foreclosure", which can apparently be done by mail: "We both know that you're not paying the mortgage, so get out.") A judge, on the other hand, may ask to see documentation that the party collecting the mortgage payments is actually the owner of the property (not merely performing a service for the owner) and therefore has the right to foreclose. [At least, that's my understanding of the issue; I am not a lawyer and do not give legal advice.] <br><br>Anyway, until the house of a delinquent buyer is actually re-sold, its value as a bank asset is ambiguous. The bank can pretend that it's still worth what it once was. But when enough homes get sold at lower values, the asset base of the bank sinks, and its insolvency can no longer be denied.<br><br>Deposit insurance premiums come out of the money that a bank would otherwise pay as interest on savings, by the way, which is one reason that bank savings are paying so little interest.<br><br>Banks almost never fail on other than a Friday night, so the clean-up crew has two days to sort out the bookkeeping and re-open on Monday.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c3530775336474339942 title="comment permalink">10/18/14, 5:20 PM</a><br><br>

They are getting ahead of the patient dumping problem by dumping proactively. <br><br>In the short run, concentrating materiel and training enough to do some good may, in fact, do some good. At the very least, it isolates the ill more quickly and leaves the rest of the hospitals in operation for ordinary purposes.<br><br>Those CDC approved treatment centers might go VA.

By and large Britain’s ‘food problems’ had been ‘solved’ by importing food mostly from ‘new’ temperate agriculture elsewhere, (though we should not neglect the importance of Caribbean sugar calories in the British diet). It is sobering therefore to calculate that per capita use of coal was considerably higher in Britain (4.4t/person) back then than in present day China (2.9t/person)! (China’s production approaches 4 billion tonnes coal just now for 1.35 billion persons compared with 200 million tonnes used by about 45 million persons in 1913 Britain).<br> <br>UK was mining nearly 300Mt coal per annum in 1913, but sold 100Mt for export. Oil of course was a much smaller part of the picture in those days (as it still is in China) although burning oil in steam engines was about to become briefly important in 20thC shipping and naval logistics.<br><br> Agricultural production both here and in new farming elsewhere had barely been touched directly by fossil fuels at this stage although coal and railroads and shipping enabled both continental and inter-continental shipment in an already sophisticated market system.<br> <br>Rapid industrial growth or the prospect of it (in for example Imperial Russia) destabilised previous European social / governance structures despite often seemingly effective attempts at rapid catch-up during the 19th Century. Very large migrations within and across Europe (urbanisation) and emigration to New World and colonies followed from the sudden population expansion and seemed to have added to social de-stabilisation. Old dynasties and previously reasonably stable regions (Ottomans for example) then fell-over after full-on industrialised warfare was unleashed.<br> <br>I think it is true, however, that the largest migrations ever seen have been and still are ongoing in China and to a lesser extent elsewhere (urbanisation involving hundreds of millions). This second phase for industrialisation is much bigger than the first in Europe and in the Americas despite there being far fewer fossil fuel energy resources per capita than in the first limited phase to 1914. The degree to which internal urbanisation can be maintained and for how long in China seems to me to be the defining question of the next decades. India (which is not just ‘one-place’) just mind-boggles me, and I cannot even ask the questions. <br><br>Europe and the USA and satraps do indeed seem like Top Dogs past their prime and the last few decades of petroleum have provided what appears, as I think you suggest an illusion of solution to an ongoing crisis. It is here, JMG, it seems to me you are asking the pertinent questions.

It's the fact that generally we must sift through those things which don't work to find those which will. Take for example fusion research, if there were only a finite, relatively small number of ways of tackling the problem, one could imagine that researchers could have iterated through them all in short order, at which point they would have either found a working method, or alternatively they would have known it was impossible. As it stands there are all sorts of different ways to tackle the problem, most (or all) of which don't work.

In contrast if fusion is possible it could potentially lead to an infinite amount of human effort being thrown at the problem, but still not hitting one of those possible solutions.

And of course we still have ISIS, ISIL, IS. Y'all are forgetting one of the basic principles of life in the 21st Century:<br><br>Whatever the mainstream media are ranting about, that thing is NOT what you need to be worried about or preparing for. <br><br>Ebola is not a new thing. It has been known for decades. Its means of transmission are well-understood. And we know what type of bug it takes to make a global epidemic-turned-pandemic. Ebola is not that type of bug. Please, don't even bring up the "but it could mutate and go airborne" slogan. Yeah, sure, anything can happen. But that is really not one of the more likely scenarios. Don't bother saying "but we don't know!" We do know. Ebola is a well-known virus. <br><br>There will be another global pandemic almost surely, unless global travel fades out before it happens. And it won't be the first by a longshot. We are still in the middle of one, in fact -- HIV is still spreading. HIV epitomizes one of the strategies for a bug to conquer the globe in the era of modern medicine: it is not easy to catch, BUT it has a lag time of years before it causes symptoms, yet is contagious during this long asymptomatic phase. The other strategy is typified by pandemic flu -- be very easy to catch, and spread faster than the vaccine can catch you. Ebola is neither of these. <br><br>Whatever global pandemic comes next will almost surely be either a variant on influenza, or a new bug that has just made the jump from animal to human and can spread easily. In the latter case, it will be something you have never heard of before, and probably will just be known by some acronym ending in "S" (for syndrome, meaning "we don't know what is causing it, but a lot of people have it"). <br><br>As for ISIS, haven't we had a militant Islamic State that hates the west ever since the Iranian Revolution 35 years ago? Sure they have caused us some trouble, but the sky has hardly fallen, the oil has kept flowing, and no mobs of Iranian terrorists have ever stormed into the U.S. across The Southern Border. Given they have no actual nation backing them, I'd be shocked to see ISIS have even a small fraction of the long-term impact that the Iranian revolution had. <br><br>Again, I repeat, whatever the mainstream news media are jabbering about, that is NOT what you should be worried about.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c8404655330129029636 title="comment permalink">10/19/14, 10:08 PM</a><br><br>

I suspect that many economists would be stumped by that question.<br><br>The transfer of ideas goes both ways too!<br><br>Incidentally, Fatso pointed out this little gem to me the other day in the business section: <a href="http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac;jsessionid=D29C863151A2CBAD87B166BD605CAD12?sy=afr&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=1month&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=brs&amp;cls=2246&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=SMH141011E07DL6MD2JF" rel=nofollow>Transfer pricing presents a huge challenge for the taxman</a><br><br>Now at first glance this is quite a boring article about a topic which few people ever wonder about. However, it is being reported anecdotally that many large corporations are paying very little taxes on their earnings. This is achieved through a process called transfer pricing.<br><br>It works like this. Local company A makes heaps of mad cash and they don't really want to pay taxes on it so they have a holding (or other) company in a foreign location which can also be conveniently in a tax haven (i.e. Country with very low or zero taxes on income).<br><br>The holding company then charges a management or some other such fee to the local company and all of their local profits magically (apologies, but this refers to the Harry Potter type - which I've never read or seen incidentally) disappear. That's how many large companies go on trading year in year out but cry poor at the same time.<br><br>Is this against the law? Possibly if it can be proven in court that it is part of a tax avoidance scheme. Although it should be mentioned that such descriptives as avoidance are considered to be in poor taste and you rarely hear them spoken.<br><br>Oh yeah, I won't mention loans to directors from offshore entities whereby the loans are used to pay day to day expenses of said directors. I wouldn't want to mention that at all and know even less about such things.<br><br>Anyway, I'm digressing so back to the article. My favourite quote is: "A report by the Tax Justice Network last month claimed that about 60 per cent of world trade now takes place within, rather than between, corporations"<br><br>and<br><br>"On any given year, about 20-25 per cent of the Australian economy happens between related parties".<br><br>Please hang with me! Many of those transactions are legitimate, but if you think about the situation one step further, you'll note that these transfer pricing transactions (I'm assuming) also form part of the GDP equation.<br><br>All I can say is: Give a man a key performance indicator and he will soon be thinking of ways to game it. Plus it sort of makes you feel like you are getting the raw end of the deal when the tax man comes knocking. It is also worthwhile mentioning that these sorts of arrangements are well beyond the capacity of the average Joe or Jane and/or small to medium business.<br><br>Cheers from Fatso the wombat as translated by: Chris<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c6356758580079095019 title="comment permalink">10/20/14, 1:02 AM</a><br><br>

The Greeks borrowed it from Old Persian and used it to mean "someone else's silly religion," in the same way that we use "myth". Scholars today don't use the word to describe societies at large, because it's been acknowledged to be basically pejorative. The closest any scholar ever came to defining "magic" neutrally was Levy-Bruhl's proposition that "magical thinking" is a type of thinking that interposes secondary causes that mediate between causes and effects.

We could apply the same principle to trains, cars and planes. If we switch them off and leave them where they are, then they will not use any energy. We can also apply the same idea to all other forms of machinery and electronic gadgetry. If we switch them off then they will not need any energy. This means that we can reduce the energy consumption level of our industrial civilization down to zero.

Southern slavery was partially about economics, but it was also firmly rooted in violent racism - too much racism for those in power to ever voluntarily free the slaves - the slaves would have just been redeployed to other positions, which they pretty much were anyway (even with the "ending" of slavery and the coming of mechanization, many African Americans lived in near-slavery-like conditions in the South right up until the Civil Rights Movement came along). <br><br>I always find it interesting to read the actual Declaration of Causes of Secession, written by several of the States, in which the reasons for the secession of the state are spelled out.

While I tend to be more charitable towards Krugman than you, the real focus of your latest piece -- the looming hour of the knife -- really hit home. While your emphasis on the internal and external proletariats is justified, I was pleased to see that you also note the example of Aetius, where an ostensible member of the elite became the leader of a warband. Especially as things fall apart, I suspect that will be a common phenomenon, as members of the lower elite in particular abandon their "class" allegiance to side with the proletarians. At the same time, especially as the transition occurs, the proletarians still have some residual respect for and deference towards members of the elites. You can see this in, among others, the eagerness of the Bolsheviks to welcome Tsarist officers into the Red Army -- the most notable examples being Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Aleksei Brusilov<br><br>I have encountered a recent example of this phenomenon among the elites of the United States. I know a young man (named, oddly enough, Alexander) who is by any measure a product of the elites. He went a "public" school in a wealthy suburb of Washington, then went on to graduate from one of the country's top universities. His friends have become consultants and entrepreneurs. He, on the other hand, joined ROTC, became a combat engineer, and proceeded to spend a good deal of time in the mountains of Central Asia living under conditions a good deal more spartan than those found in our leafy suburbs. While he stated that he was there to teach the local army mountain warfare tactics, when I asked him who was teaching and who was learning, he seemed to think the answer was too obvious to justify an answer.<br><br>At one point, I asked him what his career plans were. He replied, only partly ironically, "To become the leader of a warband after civilization collapses." In our conversations, he has demonstrated keen insight into both our (US) political situation and into the underlying dynamics of American society. While it's just one data point, I think his apparent realization that his elite status may not last out his lifetime, and his willingness to consider fairly radical alternatives, is quite significant. I just wonder how many others there are like him out there.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c5254737346256280121 title="comment permalink">10/20/14, 9:54 AM</a><br><br>

This is true whether the proposed utopia is some left-wing Workers' Paradise or right-wing Jesusocracy or something in between. The reason is that human nature is what it is, and, historically speaking, attempts to socially engineer human nature out of existence have met with pretty much universal failure. And that failure, when it inevitably occurs, leads the utopians to double down on their folly, which in practice usually means jailing or executing anyone who disagrees with them. Or, after the Revolution comes the Terror.<br><br>"Democracy for all" is a fine idea in the abstract, but consider this: was France really better off during the Terror than before the Revolution? Was Soviet Russia really better off than Tsarist Russia? Are Ukraine, Libya, or any other country where we have instigated a color revolution under the pretext of "democracy for all" really better off for our having done so?<br><br>History has borne Burke out in that democracies do not have an appreciably better track record than monarchies, broadly speaking, in terms of human rights and so on (and of course, specifically, he was right about the French Revolution being a bad idea). So, in the end, was the change really worth all the killing? But that's not to say that Burkean conservatives are opposed to democracy <i>per se</i>, or would be in favor of bringing back monarchism. Attempts to roll back the clock to re-institute a romanticized past is also a form of utopianism, and thus looked upon with deep suspicion by Burkeans. <br><br>For a Burkean conservative, to pick up a weapon with the idea of remaking society into a fantasized paradise is virtually never worth the real-world consequences that are the most likely result of that action, no matter the details of the imagined paradise, and even no matter whether you succeed or fail. In the end, all that happens is a body-count gets racked up and human nature remains as it was before.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c1839420881163529226 title="comment permalink">10/20/14, 1:23 PM</a><br><br>

The time to begin building a network is NOW (just like becoming a Green Wizard!), when it would be easy for the families to fade into the background as time passes. There are yearly get together's like Rabbit Stick in Idaho and one a ways north of me at a state park to practice pioneer/Native American skills which cover the whole gamut of wilderness survival, like learning how to move through the woods silently and invisibly. (And a few pioneer skills like blacksmithing, tanning hides, spinning and weaving.) <br><br> I've bought a few books by Nicholas Tomihama on making both wood and PVC bows. PVC to get started and wooden bows later. (I want to do horseback archery, if I can consistently hit a target from the back of a running horse I can hit a target on foot!) Bows are quiet unlike a gun and in the relatively near future you wouldn't want to advertise your presence. (If you learn to throw a knife or a warhawk dressed as an Indian or a pioneer you're just considered a kook with a weird hobby!) Eventually you could hold your own get together's without necessarily contacting anyone outside the core group or just hold any meetings necessary for covert business as well as political decisions before the official beginning or delay until after non members leave. At that point you would just be considered hard core re-enactors. Formal Martial Arts training for anyone is just another skill to be learned publicly then shared and combined later at private gatherings.<br><br>At the end of the meet time allotted everyone would scatter back to their homes around the territory. To keep skills fresh after group travel becomes difficult, kids could be swapped between families for cross training. One adult right of passage could be for young members of the people to trek overland to a chosen destination, in a set amount of time to carrying a token of Cascadian Ninjas. (For want of a better designation.)<br><br>When the tech becomes scarce/gone, Ranchers can be persuaded that friendship and cooperation is most useful, because they'll need a little 'quiet help' from time to time just to defend their little kingdoms as well as trade and mutual protection agreements with Cascadia. After all, real luxury goods would be coming UP the Columbia and there's the port sitting there for them to sell cattle, hides and any other products they'll make or grow.<br><br>Visible and rapid communication would be done the old fashioned way, on the mountains of Cascadia by way of signal towers, using mirrors and or fires.

As JMG has stated, the U.S. is not one nation, but a collection of nations. The function of the South in the U.S. conscious is the scapegoat, straight out of Deliverance, the repository of blame for racism, poverty, ignorance, etc. That view has nothing to do with the actual reality of the South and its very real problems, but the inability of the rest of the country to effectively deal with its own racism, poverty, and other social ills. The North (the other parts of the nation) had be the shining city on the hill, beacon of progress and equality, where there was no room to deal realistically with slaslavery, race, class, and poverty. So you have the dishonest, hypocritical Northern way of dealing with it, dating back to before Lincoln's time. The Northern experience with slavery has been swept under the carpet--most of Lincoln's cabinet were slaveholders at one time. Slavery was already in the process of being eliminated in the border states at the time of the Civil War, slave numbers were already declining. My guess is that, absent the Civil War, if the South didn't eventually emancipate their slaves, and instead, realizing it was doomed, doubled down on the slaves instead, there'd be a slave revolt, similar to Haiti, that would have done it in instead. One thing you have to remember is that the South, especially, but not only the cities, is the most integrated region of the country both in actual interracial neighborhoods and communities, and culturally. What we're witnessing right now is the reversal of the Great Migration, where African-Americans all over the country are returning to the South and throwing in the towel on life outside the South, basically, the failure of regions outside the South to effectively integrate African-Americans into their society. It's nothing really new, though, the idea of black people as an unwelcome, foreign, and inferior goes way back in Northern history--many Northern states/colonies once had much larger black populations than they do today--Northern de facto segregation/racism has always been more effective and enduring than Southern de jure segregation, which is probably why white Southerners fought so hard to keep it. My guess is that once the civil religion of Americanism, and Lincoln's hallowed place in it as saviour of the nation, is a thing of the past, Lincoln's reputation will take a beating. Imho, the South remains the only region of the U.S. that's ever dealt candidly with its social ills, including racism, and a lot of the bitterness and anger that still exists among a subset of southerners can best be understood through the prism of imperialism/conquered province that has had solutions imposed upon it. Not saying that all would have been rosy had the South had won, or even had more autonomy in its affairs, it probably would resemble something similar to Latin America, but that is just conjecture at this point.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c8180050363683175988 title="comment permalink">10/20/14, 5:32 PM</a><br><br>

The precautionary principle applies, though. <br><br>Angus, thank you! <br><br>Moe, the whole point of Burkean conservatism is that abstract judgments of the sort you're asking for aren't useful. Each society evolves ways of dealing with the various needs of human community, and their arrangements have one factor in common that most arbitrary intellectual projects for a better world lack -- the former have been proven to work. Thus Burke argued that social change was best done incrementally, taking existing conditions and ameliorating them a step at a time within the framework of the existing order of society, rather than trying to impose some intellectual's head trip about what a perfect society ought to be like. <br><br>Some human societies assign land ownership to individuals. Some assign it to families or clans. Some assign it to the community, tribe, or nation as a whole. There are also plenty of variations on those basic themes -- for example, land can be held collectively but the right to use it can be conferred on individuals in exchange for some specified service or benefit they perform for the community. Any of those and others still can be a viable way of handling things, in the context of the broader social and cultural system in which it has a place. Rather than worrying about whether private property in the abstract is a good thing or not, the Burkean conservative looks at the way that property is handled in his or her own culture, and if there are notable injustices in that -- as of course there always are -- looks for ways to address those specific problems. Does that clarify things a little?<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c7659285639571194310 title="comment permalink">10/20/14, 10:22 PM</a><br><br>

While it's possible I could lose my house and garden to a war band, I think I'm much more likely to lose it to a local quasi-official. Property is easily seized through forfeiture based on taxes especially if the currency system goes haywire, or a single marijuana plant is more than enough. Zoning? Eminent Domain? Nuisance fines that balloon?<br><br>I'd recommend to anyone to look at how people at the bottom of the heap lose their houses, cars and freedom and assume that those techniques and more will be applied to everyone soon enough.

I agree with you that words are a kind of place holder for a body of meaning. I have been paying attention to the kinds of circumnavigation that can occur to access the same information. The re-costuming of ideas is highlighted here quite often. For me, once we began gardening and growing food all plant-life became worth knowing about. And where to place trust is a crazy adventure. It is a small or large step to food as potential medicine depending on a large number of factors.

Apparently, due to enlightenment/egalitarian sentiment in the founding documents, abolition sentiment was at an all time high, particularly in the mid-southern states of Maryland and Virginia. A gradual abolition involving no dispossession of the kind northern states had passed was a real political possibility, and many Virginia founding fathers supported it, but the Federalists opposed it, and the buck was passed. Most then thought it would die out on its own, as slave numbers were already down, and manumissions up in the Chesapeake area.

Lots and lots of Roman elites lost their position and their lives in the collapse, that's certain, but I don't believe it was disproportionately worse for them than for general population. Probably the inverse. I don't like our elites and wish they would at least get the full brunt of the catastrophe they are dragging us into, but history doesn't care about my emotional satisfaction.

Ebola is not likely to become the type of pandemic that will significantly affect global population. I respectfully disagree with the notion that "[...] the West African countries currently at ground zero of the epidemic are somehow utterly unlike all the other troubled and impoverished Third World nations it hasn’t yet reached [...]."<br><br>Actually, there are some salient differences, including a virtually non-existent public health education and infrastructure, widespread mistrust of what health care does exist, and a long tradition of touching the bodies of the departed. Though such factors exist globally to varying degrees, west Africa seems to have all of them in spades, creating the perfect environment for the outbreak we have there now.<br><br>This does not doom the rest of the third world to their fate. Nigeria and Senegal have successfully stopped outbreaks (yes, the public health machinery in Lagos is arguably as effective as that in Dallas), and the outbreak in Congo turned out to be a different strain.<br><br>Why is West Africa so bad? Because hospital-only responses to any deadly virus are doomed to failure. Successfully dealing with them involves public health action: isolating active cases, tracking their contacts, educating the community, and changing behaviors where necessary. These unsexy elements of epidemiology and public health require less technology and money than they do the foresight and will to plan and execute. The current failure of the global community lies in ignoring public health in this region and not having taken meaningful steps early in this outbreak. Why is unclear, but the somewhat lower mortality rate of the current strain has certainly invalidated the "do nothing and it will run out of hosts" strategy.<br><br>But neither should we adopt Bill's "don't worry about or prepare for what the media is currently ranting about" strategy. No, Ebola will kill you, given the opportunity. This outbreak has surprised public health experts, and none of the people with whom I work would claim that it can't happen here.<br><br>The hospital I work for (an academic institution in a mid-sized midwestern city) activated a command center two weeks ago, has been actively developing a plan, and executing drills with the expectation that we will at some point get an Ebola patient. As bad as the mistakes in Dallas were, hospitals nation-wide are learning from them. They should serve as a wake-up call for every health care institution regarding the current state of training and communication especially, but also a host of deficiencies in our health care system.<br><br>A substantial part of our area's Ebola preparations have been in the realm of working with entities outside the hospital itself. Clinics, EMT agencies, local public health,transportation, waste disposal and sewerage are being evaluated for when, not if, someone presents with Ebola. Though it's possible that we may have some breakthrough in treatment or vaccine technology, planning and action are not limited to any such "miracle" alternative.<br><br>Preparations are being made not because there's any scientific indication that the virus will mutate to become as contagious as something like SARS or MERS, but because the existing transmission mechanism and mortality rate are bad enough. The thinking is that "we're doing all we can, but do not have the situation under control." Make no mistake, the epidemiology profession views Ebola as a clear and present danger. <br><br>But I would neither contend that the strain as it is presents a threat to world population to the degree that has been suggested by Mr. Greer. Though what's happening in West Africa is horrific, it's not yet reasonable to extrapolate what's happening there to a global scale.<br><br>My advice? Don't panic, and don't spend too much mental energy on Ebola, especially at the expense of recognizing other threats. Stay informed using a variety of sources. Know your risks. Live life. Be happy.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html#c8510582006885414214 title="comment permalink">10/24/14, 1:08 PM</a><br><br>
