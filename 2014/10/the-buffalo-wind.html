I've talked more than once in these essays about the challenge of discussing the fall of civilizations when the current example is picking up speed right outside the window.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In a calmer time, it might be possible to treat the theory of catabolic collapse as a pure abstraction, and contemplate the relationship between the maintenance costs of capital and the resources available to meet those costs without having to think about the ghastly human consequences of shortfall. As it is, when I sketch out this or that detail of the trajectory of a civilization’s fall, the commotions of our time often bring an example of that detail to the surface, and sometimes—as now—those lead in directions I hadn’t planned to address. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is admittedly a time when harbingers of disaster are not in short supply. I was amused a few days back to see yet another <a href=http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/25/investing/zero-hedge-wall-street-blog-finance/ >denunciation of economic heresy</a> in the media. This time the author was one Matt Egan, the venue was CNN/Money, and the target was <a href=http://www.zerohedge.com/ >Zero Hedge</a>, one of the more popular sites on the doomward end of the blogosphere. The burden of the CNN/Money piece was that Zero Hedge must be wrong in questioning the giddy optimism of the stock market—after all, stock values have risen to record heights, so what could possibly go wrong? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Zero Hedge’s pseudonymous factotum Tyler Durden had nothing to say to CNN/Money, and quite reasonably so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>He knows as well as I do that in due time, Egan will join that long list of pundits who insisted that the bubble du jour would keep on inflating forever, and got to eat crow until the end of their days as a result. He's going to have plenty of company; the chorus of essays and blog posts denouncing peak oil in increasingly strident tones has built steadily in recent months. I expect that chorus to rise to a deafening shriek right about the time the bottom drops out of the fracking bubble. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile the Ebola epidemic has apparently taken another large step toward fulfilling its potential as the Black Death of the 21st century. A month ago, after reports surfaced of Ebola in a southwestern province, Sudan slapped
<a href=http://en.starafrica.com/news/sudan-bans-reporting-on-ebola.html>a media blackout on reports of Ebola cases in the country</a>. Maybe there’s an innocent reason for this policy, but I confess I can’t think of one. Sudan is a long way from the West African hotspots of the epidemic, and unless a local outbreak has coincidentally taken place—which is of course possible—this suggests the disease has already spread along the ancient east-west trade routes of the Sahel. If the epidemic gets a foothold in Sudan, the next stops are the teeming cities of Egypt and the busy ports of East Africa, full of shipping from the Gulf States, the Indian subcontinent, and eastern Asia.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve taken a wry amusement in the way that so many people have reacted to the spread of the epidemic by insisting that Ebola can’t possibly be a problem outside the West African countries it’s currently devastating. Here in the US, the media’s full of confident-sounding claims that <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/what-would-happen-if-someone-got-ebola-in-america/375928/?single_page=true">our high-tech health care system</a> will surely keep Ebola at bay. It all looks very encouraging, unless you happen to know that diseases spread by inadequate handwashing are common in US hospitals, only a small minority of facilities have the high-end gear necessary to isolate an Ebola patient, and the Ebola patient just found in Dallas got misdiagnosed and sent home with a prescription for antibiotics, exposing plenty of people to the virus. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
More realistically, Laurie Garrett, a respected figure in the public health field, warns that <a href=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/08/14/you_are_not_nearly_scared_enough_ebola_vaccine_west_africa_outbreak>”you are not nearly scared enough about Ebola.”</a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the peak oil community, Mary Odum, whose credentials as ecologist and nurse make her eminently qualified to discuss the matter, has <a href=http://prosperouswaydown.com/uncharted-territory-overshoot/ >tried to get the same message across</a>. Few people are listening. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Like the frantic claims that peak oil has been disproven and the economy isn’t on the verge of another ugly slump, the insistence that Ebola can’t possibly break out of its current hot zones is what scholars of the magical arts call an apotropaic charm—that is, an attempt to turn away an unwanted reality by means of incantation. In the case of Ebola, the incantation usually claims that the West African countries currently at ground zero of the epidemic are somehow utterly unlike all the other troubled and impoverished Third World nations it hasn’t yet reached, and that the few thousand deaths racked up so far by the epidemic is a safe measure of its potential. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who have been thinking along these lines are invited to join me in a little thought experiment. According to the World Health Organization, the number of cases of Ebola in the current epidemic is doubling every twenty days, and could reach 1.4 million by the beginning of 2015. Let’s round down, and say that there are one million cases on January 1, 2015.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Let’s also assume for the sake of the experiment that the doubling time stays the same. Assuming that nothing interrupts the continued spread of the virus, and cases continue to double every twenty days, in what month of what year will the total number of cases equal the human population of this planet? Go ahead and do the math for yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you’re not used to exponential functions, it’s particularly useful to take a 2015 calendar, count out the 20-day intervals, and see exactly how the figure increases over time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course this is a thought experiment, not a realistic projection. In the real world, the spread of an epidemic disease is a complex process shaped by modes of human contact and transport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are bottlenecks that slow propagation across geographical and political barriers, and different cultural practices that can help or hinder the transmission of the Ebola virus. It’s also very likely that some nations, especially in the developed world, will be able to mobilize the sanitation and public-health infrastructure to stop a self-sustaining epidemic from getting under way on their territory before a vaccine can be developed and manufactured in sufficient quantity to matter. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Most members of our species, though, live in societies that don’t have those resources, and the steps that could keep Ebola from spreading to the rest of the Third World are not being taken. Unless massive resources are committed to that task soon—as in before the end of this year—the possibility exists that when the pandemic finally winds down a few years from now, two to three billion people could be dead. We need to consider the possibility that the peak of global population is no longer an abstraction set comfortably off somewhere in the future. It may be knocking at the future’s door right now, shaking with fever and dripping blood from its gums. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That ghastly possibility is still just that, a possibility. It can still be averted, though the window of opportunity in which that could be done<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>is narrowing with each passing day. Epizootic disease is one of the standard ways by which an animal species in overshoot has its population cut down to levels that the carrying capacity of the environment can support, and the same thing has happened often enough with human beings. It’s not the only way for human numbers to decline; I’ve discussed here at some length the possibility that that could happen by way of <a href=../../2014/08/dark-age-america-population-implosion.html>ordinary demographic contraction</a>—but we’re now facing a force that could make the first wave of population decline happen in a much faster and more brutal way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Is that the end of the world? Of course not. Any of my readers who have read a good history of the Black Death—not a bad idea just now, all things considered—know that human societies can take a massive population loss from pandemic disease and still remain viable. That said, any such event is a shattering experience, shaking political, economic, cultural, and spiritual institutions and beliefs down to their core. In the present case, the implosion of the global economy and the demise of the tourism and air travel industries are only the most obvious and immediate impacts. There are also broader and deeper impacts, cascading down from the visible realms of economics and politics into the too rarely noticed substructure of ecological relationships that sustain human existence. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And this, in turn, has me thinking of buffalo. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In there among all the other new stories of the last week, by turns savage and silly, is a report from Montana, where representatives of Native American peoples from the prairies of the United States and Canada signed <a href=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/9/26/save-buffalo-montana.html>a treaty pledging their tribes to cooperate</a> in reintroducing wild buffalo to the Great Plains. I doubt most people in either country heard of it, and fewer gave it a second thought. There have been herds of domesticated buffalo in North America for a good many decades now, but only a few very small herds, on reservations or private nature sanctuaries, have been let loose to wander freely as their ancestors did. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A great many of the white residents of the Great Plains are furiously opposed to the project. It’s hard to find any rational reason for that opposition—the Native peoples have merely launched a slow process of putting wild buffalo herds on their own tribal property, not encroaching on anyone or anything else—but rational reasons are rarely that important in human motivation, and the nonrational dimension here as so often<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>is the determining factor. The entire regional culture of the Great Plains centers on the pioneer experience, the migration that swept millions of people westward onto the prairies on the quest to turn some of North America’s bleakest land into a cozy patchwork of farms and towns, nature replaced by culture across thousands of miles where the buffalo once roamed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The annihilation of the buffalo was central to that mythic quest, as central as the dispossession of the Native peoples and the replacement of the tallgrass prairie by farm crops. A land with wild buffalo herds upon it is not a domesticated land. Those who saw the prairies in their wild state brought back accounts that sound like something out of mythology: grass so tall a horseman could ride off into it and never be seen again, horizons as level and distant as those of the open ocean, and the buffalo: up to sixty million of them, streaming across the landscape in herds that sometimes reached from horizon to horizon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The buffalo were the keystone of the prairie ecosystem, and their extermination was an essential step in shattering that ecosystem and extracting the richness of its topsoil for temporary profit. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A little while back I happened to see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q">a video online</a> about the ecological effects of reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone Park. It’s an interesting story:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>the return of wolves, most of a century after their extermination, caused deer to stay away from areas of the park where they were vulnerable to attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once those areas were no longer being browsed by deer, their vegetation changed sharply, making the entire park more ecologically diverse; species that had been rare or absent in the park reappeared to take advantage of the new, richer habitat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even the behavior of the park’s rivers changed, as vegetation shifts slowed riverine erosion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All this was narrated by George Monbiot in a tone of gosh-wow wonderment that irritated me at first hearing. Surely it would be obvious, I thought, that changing one part of an ecosystem would change everything else, and that removing or reintroducing one of the key species in the ecosystem would have particularly dramatic effects! Of course I stopped then and laughed, since for most people it’s anything but obvious. Our entire culture is oriented toward machines, not living systems, and what defines a machine is precisely that it’s meant to do exactly what it’s told and nothing else. Push this button, and that happens; turn this switch, and something else happens; pull this trigger, and the buffalo falls dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We’re taught to think of the world as though that same logic controlled its responses to our actions, and then get blindsided when it acts like a whole system instead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d be surprised to hear any of the opponents of reintroducing wild buffalo talk in so many words about the buffalo as a keystone species of the prairie ecosystem, and suggesting that its return to the prairies might set off a trophic cascade—that’s the technical term for the avalanche of changes, spreading down the food web to its base, that the Yellowstone wolves set in motion once they sniffed the wind, caught the tasty scent of venison, and went to look. Still, it’s one of the basic axioms of the Druid teachings that undergird these posts that people know more than they think they know, and a gut-level sense of the cascade of changes that would be kickstarted by wild buffalo may be helping drive their opposition. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That said, there’s a further dimension. It’s not just in an ecological sense that a land with wild buffalo herds upon it is not a domesticated land. To the descendants of the pioneers, the prairie, the buffalo, and the Indian are what their ancestors came West to destroy. Behind that identification lies the whole weight of the mythology of progress, the conviction that it’s the destiny of the West to be transformed from wilderness to civilization. The return of wild buffalo is unthinkable from within the pioneer worldview, because it means that “the winning of the West” was not a permanent triumph but a temporary condition, which may yet be followed in due time by the losing of the West. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of course there were already good reasons to think along those unthinkable lines, long before the Native tribes started drafting their treaty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The economics of dryland farming on the Great Plains never really made that much sense. Homestead acts and other government subsidies in the 19th century, and the economic impacts of two world wars in the 20th, made farming the Plains look viable, in much the same way that huge government subsidies make nuclear power look viable today. In either case, take away the subsidies and you’ve got an arrangement without a future. That’s the subtext behind the vacant and half-vacant towns you’ll find all over the West these days. That the fields and farms and towns may be replaced in turn by prairie grazed by herds of wild buffalo is unthinkable from within the pioneer worldview, too—but across the West, the unthinkable is increasingly the inescapable. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Equally, it’s unthinkable to most people in the industrial world today that a global pandemic could brush aside the world’s terminally underfunded public health systems and snuff out millions or billions of lives in a few years. It’s just as unthinkable to most people in the industrial world that the increasingly frantic efforts of wealthy elites to prop up the global economy and get it to start generating prosperity again will fail, plunging the world into irrevocable economic contraction. It’s among the articles of faith of the industrial world that the future must lead onward and upward, that the sort of crackpot optimism that draws big crowds at TED Talks counts as realistic thinking about the future, and that the limits to growth can’t possibly get in the way of our craving for limitlessness. Here again, though, the unthinkable is becoming the inescapable. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In each of these cases, and many others, the unthinkable can be described neatly as the possibility that a set of changes that we happen to have decked out with the sanctified label of “progress” might turn out instead to be a temporary and reversible condition. The agricultural settlement of the Great Plains, the relatively brief period when humanity was not troubled by lethal pandemics, and the creation of a global economy powered by extravagant burning of fossil fuels were all supposed to be permanent changes, signs of progress and Man’s Conquest of Nature. No one seriously contemplated the chance that each of those changes would turn out to be transient, that they would shift into reverse under the pressure of their own unintended consequences, and that the final state of each whole system would have more in common with its original condition than with the state it briefly attained in between. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are plenty of ways to talk about the implications of that great reversal, but the one that speaks to me now comes from the writings of Ernest Thompson Seton, whose nature books were a fixture of my childhood and who would probably be the patron saint of this blog if Druidry had patron saints. He spent the whole of his adult career as naturalist, artist, writer, storyteller, and founder of a youth organization—Woodcraft, which taught wilderness lore, practical skills, and democratic self-government to boys and girls alike, and might be well worth reviving now—fighting for a world in which there would still be a place for wild buffalo roaming the prairies: fought, and lost. (It would be one of his qualifications for Druid sainthood that he knew he would lose, and kept fighting anyway. The English warriors at the battle of Maldon spoke that same language: “Will shall be sterner, heart the stronger, mood shall be more as our might falters.”)</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He had no shortage of sound rational reasons for his lifelong struggle, but now and again, in his writings or when talking around the campfire, he would set those aside and talk about deeper issues. He spoke of the “Buffalo Wind,” the wind off the open prairies that tingles with life and wonder, calling humanity back to its roots in the natural order, back to harmony with the living world: not rejecting the distinctive human gifts of culture and knowledge, but holding them in balance with the biological realities of our existence and the needs of the biosphere. I’ve felt that wind; so, I think, have most Druids, and so have plenty of other people who couldn’t tell a Druid from a dormouse but who feel in their bones that industrial humanity’s attempted war against nature is as senseless as a plant trying to gain its freedom by pulling itself up by the roots. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the crucial lessons of the Buffalo Wind, though, is that it’s not always gentle. It can also rise to a shrieking gale, tear the roofs off houses, and leave carnage in its wake. We can embrace the lessons that the natural world is patiently and pitilessly teaching us, in other words, or we can close our eyes and stop our ears until sheer pain forces the lessons through our barriers, but one way or another, we’re going to learn those lessons. It’s possible, given massively funded interventions and a good helping of plain dumb luck, that the current Ebola epidemic might be stopped before it spreads around the world. It’s possible that the global economy might keep staggering onward for another season, and that wild buffalo might be kept from roaming the Great Plains for a while yet. Those are details; the underlying issue—the inescapable collision between the futile fantasy of limitless economic expansion on a finite planet and the hard realities of ecology, geology, and thermodynamics—is not going away. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
The details also matter, though; in a very old way of speaking, the current shudderings of the economy, the imminent risk of pandemic, and the distant sound of buffalo bellowing in the Montana wind are omens. The Buffalo Wind is rising now, keening in the tall grass, whispering in the branches and setting fallen leaves aswirl. I could be mistaken, but I think that not too far in the future it will become a storm that will shake the industrial world right down to its foundations.</div>

We were briefly discussing a solution to the problem of arts students not getting jobs after graduating. I said, 'that's quite a complex problem, I'm not sure'. His response? take away student loans/ allowances for arts students. I tried to point out that this was a fairly linear unimaginative response and his response was something like 'well the fact of the matter is decisions have to happen, often in a short space of time!' sigh. Now I'm not saying his idea was totally wrong but just the treating every problem like a machine without any consideration of wider feedback loops/effects that I found a bit well... disturbing.

I've been following you for two years now and, in that (short) timespan, this is the week a post like this has been needed most. I’ll admit to refreshing the browser window a number of times through the afternoon and early evening waiting for it.<br><br>My median-case prediction for the current Ebola outbreak is that billions of people won't die of it in the next year (although my answer to your question is September 17, 2015 at 7.2 billion current population). Instead, it becomes one of those diseases that just happens from now on, like multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. The world adjusts to the fact that a new disease has appeared that kills a few million a year in developing countries along with occasional outbreaks in developed ones. Maybe we get lucky and develop a new vaccine, saving rich-world people from their already reduced risk of the disease. But I’m picturing a fat-tailed probability distribution with my best guess at a ~10% chance of a global pandemic. Not exactly the odds we want with a disease that has a CFR somewhere in the 50-70% range.<br><br>I previously thought about pandemics from time to time, but I dismissed Ebola - given its historical pattern of killing most of the people in a few African villages but dying out in humans because it killed people too quickly to propagate, I suspected it was fairly low on the list of likely pandemics, far below a 1918 flu repeat or something of that nature. But biological entities in general, and RNA viruses in particular, evolve rapidly when an obvious opportunity presents itself, such as 7.2 billion closely connected and susceptible apes on the same planet. I would like to admit to the Ebola virus, and to the horseman Pestilence in general, that I underestimated them. Unfortunately this is not a horseman that is likely to spare anyone in exchange for a good microbrew. I salute it anyway.<br><br>Thinking about it more clearly than I would have otherwise, I’m actually really surprised that we only managed to suffer one post-1950, new, pandemic disease, severe enough that even the richest countries had to pay attention to it: HIV/AIDS. Given the frantic effort throughout the intervening years to connect all of the world economically, and the exponential increase in global travel that came along with the exponential phase in global economic growth, I would have expected several in that timespan if I were an alien observing Earth as we observe a Petri plate.

In the wake of the <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2014/10/first-ebola-case-diagnosed-in-us.html rel=nofollow>first Ebola case diagnosed in the U.S.</a>, markets fell more than one percent for the day as anything involving transportation got clobbered.

I don't blame them.<br><br>As for the other half of your essay about the reintroduction of the bison to reservations on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border, that ties into two of my lectures. One of them I gave a couple of weeks about about the lack of integration between the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service around Yellowstone National Park. Inside the park, the bison are protected. Outside the park, the Forest Service allows ranchers to harass the buffalo and herd them back into the park. Things were worse for years before that. Because of fears of brucellosis passing from the wild animals to cattle, bison in the National Forests could be shot! Recently, I read that practice has stopped. The same page that reported that good news also mentioned the reintroduction of bison that you reported. I see it as a good thing.<br><br>The other lecture is one I'll give tomorrow about the effects of keystone species and trophic cascades. I can add the anecdotes about wolves and bison that you related to that explanation. That should be both entertaining and enlightening.<br><br>Speaking of animals that produced winds, last month was the 100th anniversary of the death of the last passenger pigeon. Both of the major state universities here in Michigan are <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2014/09/passenger-pigeons-extinction-on-exhibit.html rel=nofollow>hosting exhibits on the extinction of the species</a>. That event connects to the survival of the bison because the loss of the passenger pigeon, which used to number in the billions, made people realize that the bison and other once-abundant species could follow them into oblivion and should be saved. So the bison were, and may roam again because people heeded the warning.<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c7221043710455288950 title="comment permalink">10/1/14, 7:36 PM</a><br><br>

Very fiercely.<br><br>the four horsemen have a tendency to come together, all at once. The strain created by global pandemic on the global economic system could well threaten to make room for the appearance of the others. To withstand all the other winds tearing at the high tower of the elites - domestic race conflict, distrust from the internal proletariat, and resource limits - requires huge investments of energy. As the pandemic spreads, it will require large allocations of energy resources, as well as pulling labor away from industries. The damage done by disease on economic systems is not only the sick people, but the people needed to treat the sick people. Following the plague comes the famine. Famine drives people in need to rise up against the political status quo (high food prices - near famine - were the origin of the so-rebranded "Arab Spring.") Into these destabilizations gets mixed the problems of racial and religious conflict. Destabilizations in the Middle East lead to recessions of energy flow from that critical region. <br><br> All of a sudden, a year from now or 4 years from now, famine and plague ravaged Middle Eastern populations consolidate under new military theocratic leadership and invade Europe. (O before that, probably, south and east asian populations that produce much of the goods for sale in American markets have been ravaged as well by plague and famine, and the US stock market has plummeted.)<br><br>Ecological domino theory.<br><br> Regarding lessons, it's clear the only way humanity will learn is the hard way.<br><br> Having said that, this plague may not kick off the big winds.

On the way I noticed a grim sight, motels, many burned or abandoned littered the roadside of this formerly prosperous highway.

To increase something a thousand-fold (3 orders of magnitude) takes ten doublings. That's why Moore's so-called Law is so powerful. If transistor density doubles every 18 months (and thus, approximately, computer power) it takes 15 years for a thousand-fold increase, 30 years for a million-fold, 45 years for a billion-fold. So we can now buy what would have been considered a super computer a few decades ago and put it in our pockets.<br><br>Applying this to your thought experiment, 10 doublings at 20 days each is 200 days.

Get a calculator and a sheet of paper, and figure out how many times you have to punch in "x 2 =" to get from 1 to a number higher than 7300. Multiply that number by 20 (the number of days per doubling cycle), and then check the calendar. I strongly encourage you to do it yourself so that it sticks in your mind!<br><br>Sven, the US doesn't even begin to have the facilities to deal with a major pandemic. If we're lucky, it might be possible to squash local outbreaks using military teams in chemical-warfare gear; if not -- well, you can imagine that as well as I can. As for the Black Death, there are dozens of good histories; I'm partial to Philip Ziegler's <i>The Black Death</i>, but that's mostly because I read it in my misspent youth. <br><br>Tom, both of those are classic. Notice how the farmers are stuck in the classic myth-of-progress mental trap: any alternative to the present way of doing things, unless it's even more of the present way of doing things, equals going straight back to the caves.

The photo of the Arctic, with blue water sailing from Iceland straight through the Northeast Passage to the Bering Strait, was very unnerving...<br><br>Yupped, excellent. I've also gotten the sense that people are running short on faith-based optimism, and starting to take hard looks at the world around them. I wonder if anybody in DC or Wall Street has even begun to think about the tectonic implications if Americans by and large give up on American delusionalism. <br><br>Thepublicpast, that may well have done it. I grew up spending a lot of time on the coast of Washington State, where the pilings of abandoned canneries are all over the place; it's not hard there to get a sense that bust follows boom, and our civilization can end up as nothing but nameless ruins. <br><br>Steve, I'd heard about that! Yes, I suspect we're going to hear a lot of babble about America's great leap forward to 19th-century conditions in the not too distant future. <br><br>Kylie, good -- you're paying attention. The only thing that reliably makes money in large parts of the industrial world today is money -- and that means the token economy of money is fatally detached from the real economy of goods and services. As that gap widens, quite a bit can fall into it. <br><br>Fleecenik, bingo.

Today, while I followed my Mom through a big box store we stopped in the DVD section. This being South Western Colorado the taste in Westerns at the store have a unique flavor. "I Will Fight No More Forever" and "Broken Arrow" were both innovative in sympathetic portrayals of Natives; a quick glance at the facial features of those around me gave a pretty clear clue why this is the case. Interestingly the garb around me was pearl snap shirts and stetson hats just like I was wearing.<br><br>I nearly bought the movies, but then remembered that I don't have a DVD player and refrained. Recently my meditations have been focused on how the West will be lost to the Western (in both senses) civilization. On one hand is is completely lacking of the features needed to maintain anything resembling the current way of life, and yet on the other even as desolate as the west is on average, it is dotted with small lands that are inviting to human habitation, given adequate adaptation. That is to say that the West will likely support vibrant cultures, perhaps even a wide diversity of vibrant cultures, but cultures whose way of life share only the most meager commonalities with the current inhabitants. The return of the Buffalo to the planes (north of the areas overly devastated by drought at any rate) would be a wonderful step in that direction.<br><br>The seed stock of cultures and traditions who exist in rugged conditions in various impoverished rural areas are too diverse to list, and as the tenderfoots retreat those ways of living with the land which are in their infancy today will take root in the land and begin a process of ethnogenesis. What will come from it is impossible to predict, but I suspect that the Native peoples who were here when my ancestors fled the War of Northern Aggression to settle in Colorado are as good of a clue as one is likely to find; adjusting for shifting climate zones and the availability of vast reserves of salvageable tool sources, and the availability of several new techniques which might change which ecological niches humans are likely to favor in the area.<br><br>The stories of how those cultures will emerge as the current culture of beer and bicycles (to use Fort Collins as an example) looses its iron grip on the ordering of things is especially interesting to me. Obviously History will write those stories at a day by day pace, and humans will recall and interpret those stories along the way, but as the current order faces serious disruptions I wonder what those future cultures stories will say about some things.<br><br>Those Westerns were a clue, I walked out of the store thinking of the story told by Westerns and how it would go played in reverse, or with various roll reversals. The settlers who came to tame the west driven East, or to oblivion by wild reprisals from Nature and new Cultures alike. Stories of driving away those 'pilgrims' at long last. Native stories mixing and mutating in together with the stories of the Westerners who decide to embrace the lessons that 'the natural world is patiently and pitilessly teaching us' and the stories emerging from the psychic maelstrom of urban decay both in the ravaged hearts of imploding western cities and the hearts of story tellers arriving from other such forges. War stories as one people turn the tables on a force become alien to then. Heroic stories of balances being found with the Natural world, and limits ordained from the Divine figures of these cultures. Ghost stories haunting the taboos, and other spirits bringing to a people those boons by which one culture survives its childhood while the neighboring community passed into oblivion before they ever became themselves.<br><br>Sad thing the news these days, good time to remember "Will shall be the sterner, heart the bolder, spirit the greater as our strength lessens."<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c8134596284333222393 title="comment permalink">10/1/14, 9:53 PM</a><br><br>

The authors set up a taxonomy of well-known "sways" which can and do lead people to do remarkably stupid things. All through the book, Peak Oil and Climate Chaos were jumping out at me. It was all there...<br><br>... the psychology of sunk investment, of loss aversion, of diagnosis attachment and bias confirmation, all adding up to an inability to come to grips with facts on the ground and a desperate need to cling to some imagined future. Worth a read as we ponder apparently lunatic responses to our current predicament :-)<br><br>Just a week earlier I had been reading old J Varley short stories and marvelling at the future I used to (sort of) believe in.<br><br>My personal bet on Ebola: there will be some "realpolitik" thinkers in the affluent countries who, off the record, won't be too upset if there's a major cull of poor brown people on the other side of the world. I don't expect any substantive or really helpful intervention from the great powers for that reason. <br><br>Should it get a foothold *inside* the industrial cores however, I expect orchestrated panic -- remember all the drama and [ahem] flap over Avian Flu? People wearing filter masks while grocery shopping and so on? I expect embargoes on travel from designated high-risk countries, and forcible deportation of travellers suspected of infection. Possibly cordons sanitaires around any barrios or ghettos where infection is present. And extremely lucrative govt contracts for favoured pharma giants to produce the eventual vaccine for favoured populations.<br><br>In the worst case -- major Ebola outbreak in urban centres of power and politics, like DC, NY, etc -- I expect the great and powerful to do what they did during plague summers in old England: flee to the countryside and their walled estates :-) So I expect Ebola, like AIDS, to take out swathes of the world's poor and brown, and leave whitefolk and the ruling class almost untouched. Another ongoing tragedy, like famine, civil wars, AIDS, farmer suicides, species extinctions, sweatshop fires, to occupy a few seconds of attention span before the next rigged election, Olympic circus, politico scandal, hockey game.<br><br>I'm feeling grumpy and cynical tonight.<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c6839755471708004945 title="comment permalink">10/1/14, 9:53 PM</a><br><br>

I think the most maddening part about it for me is that I can see how utterly unready almost everyone around me is from a mental and psychological standpoint. A little while back I had a conversation with one of my best friends on this topic. He's about my age (early 30's) but he has done pretty much all of the things I would tell someone not to do if they are concerned about facing the challenges ahead. He's extremely overweight and has not taken care of his health (and is now starting to deal with a lot of the medical problems that come with that), he's $60,000+ in debt to private creditors and also has the IRS coming after him for back taxes. His employment situation is up and down and up and down, and most of his jobs have been ultra ephemeral things like being a paid pop culture blogger. And he knows what's coming because I've distilled this blog's message for him on many occasions, and when we talked about it last we were discussing the attractiveness of apocalyptic fantasies nowadays and he was surprisingly more honest than anyone else I've talked to. He said: "It would be so nice for Ebola or nuclear war to just end it, because it would really save me the trouble of figuring out what I'm going to do with the rest of my life and how I'm going to possibly do with the the mess I've made of everything."<br><br>On that note, over the past few months I've actually been taking a lot of personal development courses. These ones that I've been doing aren't the tacky, lazy retreads of generations old quick fix fads like "The Secret", but rather courses aimed at building up your communication skills (both internal and external) and strengthening yourself emotionally. They very much deal with the fact that people in this world usually actually know what it is that they need to do to be successful, to deal with problems in their lives, to overcome challenges, but they can't actually bring themselves to do it or stick with it once they've decided to do it. That's a skill that's helpful for a lot of things, and I consider this training to be every bit as much a part of my preparation for peak oil and the end of industrial civilization as the practical skills that you document in books like GREEN WIZARDRY. After all, that book on organic gardening or solar heating is pretty much useless to you unless you can find the discipline to read it and then put it into practice, and I suspect that I'm not the only reader of this blog who has struggled with the fact that I know exactly the things I need to learn and practice but have had a great deal of difficulty committing to learning and practicing them.<br><br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c8854043234031949509 title="comment permalink">10/1/14, 10:32 PM</a><br><br>

Times of the sort we're entering are times of stories, and anti-Westerns (Easterns?) will doubtless be among them.<br><br>DeAnander, that's certainly one set of possible scenarios. It's all too likely that nothing will be done until it's clear that the pandemic won't stay confined to Africa, and once that happens there may not be much that anyone can do: given the presence of huge immigrant populations from the Third World all through the industrial nations, and the substantial enclaves of urban and rural poverty in the industrial world, once it's jumped to the Arab world, south Asia, and the Caribbean, we're in for it. Whether the rich can keep themselves safe, or weather the cascade of social and economic impacts, is a complex issue -- more on that as we proceed. <br><br>Chris, that's a good working metaphor. <br><br>f50, okay, this time you're square on target. <br><br>Svea, there are two obvious reasons: the practices necessary to grow grain on the Great Plains waste topsoil at a frightening rate, and much of the plains acreage is being irrigated using water from Ice Age aquifers that are rapidly being depleted. Still, there's more going on than that. Farming the plains has only been economically viable when the price of grain is artificially boosted, as in wartime, or when government subsidies absorb some of the costs. That lack of economic viability is just as crucial as, though less easy to pin down than, the ecological issues. <br><br>Pongo, excellent! You've put your finger on a crucial issue -- the gap between understanding and will. That's eventually going to be a major issue for <a href=http://galabes.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>my other blog</a>, but I have a lot of preliminary ground to cover first.

We are next to a (relatively) unpolluted water source, crime is low, community is fairly strong, extravagance is already frowned upon, we produce more food than we consume, we are hundreds of miles from a large city, and we're not far removed from tougher times. It's one of the main reasons we've stayed where we are. I'm worried first about food, water, shelter. I think we can survive here. That's enough for the time being, at least. Sure, it gets very cold, but pack a few of us families into an insulated house like sardines and light a fire. We'll be fine. Economically we're in a boom, but I don't care about that. I care about the day when things go wrong and nobody will be coming to help us. And on that day, I think we'll survive well enough.<br><br>As for lands so even it looks like the ocean, well, I see that every day. You can see the curvature of the earth just outside of town. And what's more fun, I used to drive by the local buffalo (well, bison) ranch every day on my way to work! <br><br>I'll tell you what, I'll make you a deal: you keep up with the advice and posts, and I promise to set them free once it hits the fan. They'll find their niche again with or without legislation.<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c1881199340644840021 title="comment permalink">10/1/14, 11:53 PM</a><br><br>

The Boy Scouts formed around that time, and growing food became a compulsory school subject in many European countries and in many schools in rural America. <br><br>Clarence Hall Robison’s 1911 report on American high schools, for example, recommends “320 hours of agriculture,” including studies of local fungi and insects, fossils and glacial actions, soil types and nutrients. “These are in addition to the required work in botany, zoology, physiology, physics and chemistry,” he wrote, and to their courses in music, French, German, Physics, Drawing, Astronomy, Trigonometry, Surveying and Engineering, and Rhetoric, all in country schools in places like Mississippi and Iowa. School projects he cites, created by students themselves, included experimenting with home-made pesticides and breeding crop varieties specific to their location. <br><br>On the less cultivated end of things, the early Boy Scouts were quite hard-core compared to their current incarnation – the original Boy Scout manual has chapters on slaughtering an animal for food, stopping runaway horses and helping a man regurgitate poison. I’m perennially astonished at the breadth of information learned by children in earlier eras, which few adults learn today. <br><br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c8725304333842793021 title="comment permalink">10/1/14, 11:55 PM</a><br><br>

Usually they are exceptional people. For the most part they live in worlds that affirm only one value system. They fall because of a fatal flaw that is invisible to them and by the time they realize it's already too late. <br><br>Looking at Western, or Faustian, Culture through this lens it becomes clear that we are a people heavily defined by the tragic. Jesus Christ could be considered the ultimate tragic figure, his "fatal flaw" being his divinity. The persistent "lone genius" stock character is another; be it an artist, inventor or scientist.<br><br>In America we are arguably settled on a tragic ideal of the Pioneer going forth into Manifest Destiny to live lawlessly in isolation.<br><br>And if I'm reading your post right we may be on the brink of the unraveling of the plot, the Denouement or Catastrophe. That we are like Pentheus from The Bacchea, right around the time Dionysius causes his madness that will lead to him to be torn limb from limb. Which of course was horrible, messy and demoralizing, and caused political waves, but still wasn't exactly the end of Thebes.<br><br>There is also the Comic figures who is usually ridiculous, ugly in some way that causes no harm. They are usually morally inferior, caring more about survival than dignity, often are focused on their bodies rather than spirits, live in worlds of conflicting values, and most crucially they move from rigidity towards greater freedom and from individuality towards group cohesion.<br><br>A great example of a comic figure is Odysseus who using his wits, sacrificing his dignity, and overcoming his “flabby legs” is able to, against all odds!...return home to his family<br><br>What makes the difference between a Tragedy and a Comedy so fascinating to me is that it emphatically <i>isn't</i> a different between content per se – Pentheus ends his life a duped drag queen and Odysseus was by all accounts a mass-murderer. Instead the difference is one of <i>approach</i>.<br><br>One of my personal disciplines is to disengage myself from a Tragic inner narrative and move towards a sense of my own Comedy. To become a Comic figure rather than a Tragic one. My hope is that if enough people stop playing along with the generally Tragic script of our culture we may be able to approach the coming trials with if not more grace at least more good humor. We might come together instead of coming apart.<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c8189392850356002390 title="comment permalink">10/2/14, 3:43 AM</a><br><br>

It's like it's actually incomprehensible to them that anyone ever won't just take their word for it, now and forever. At least the toddler has the excuse of an as yet undeveloped theory of mind to explain the cognitive deficit, what's their excuse? It's not that they don't know they're lying, that they think short-term reassurance before it really matters trumps all other concerns, that they're so staggeringly incompetent that they can't string 2-3 ideas together to make a coherent thought.

Obviously, by the time the last of the rubble stops bouncing, business as usual will have been put on hold in so many departments. The global economy would certainly morph into some completely different animal.<br>Another thought comes to mind: the surviving population will be made up of two types, with respect to the virus: the untouched and those who managed to recover -- the latter being immune.

They pay the BLM an annual fee for their grazing lease, and get to graze their herds.<br><br>In theory, the wildlife is to be supported, and other citizens get to use the same land (hunting/fishing/collecting firewood? as do other industries (most notably gas and oil). In practice, though, the ranchers will often give the BLM officers, fisherman, or hunters or drilling companies trouble if they think their "rights" are being encroached upon. I once heard a rancher fenced off the Hazleton road, a public right of way (albeit just a dirt track) to prevent interlopers from driving down it. Some anglers got pissed off, cut the barbwire, the ranchers showed up with rifles, and the Sheriff had to get involved.<br><br>The guys got to drive down the road.<br><br>If they re-introduce free-range buffalo, they compete for fodder, which reduces the value of the range, and increases the rancher costs. So they oppose it.<br><br>As well, brucellosis is endemic among buffalo. Even though their is not one documented case of brucellosis transmission from buffalo to cattle, the rancher risks losing brucellosis free status for his herd, thus reducing their market value, and increasing his costs. (the disease causes cattle to abort their calves).<br><br>Finally, free-range buffalo invite meddling by environmentalists, conservationists, Game and Fish agents and other and sundry undesirables.<br><br>Thus, the BLM land ceases to be a susidized cash-cow (pun intended) for the ranchers. Their rationale is simple short-term economics, but that is the rationale for most of our miscalculations, isn't it?<br><br><br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c2633055210662330879 title="comment permalink">10/2/14, 7:11 AM</a><br><br>

Interviewing his contacts since he became sick to learn who <i>their</i> contacts have been, quarantining his family, etc., all seem rather like hit or miss actions. But I wonder what more could be done. They reminded me of the ultimately futile early attempts to control the spread of the emerald ash borer. Sigh. <br><br>Are we absolutely, 100% certain that, as reported, one who has been infected with Ebloa virus is not at risk of infecting others until one actually comes down with the fever? Much of the public health effort is based on the belief that the Dallas individual didn't become infectious until he became ill, four days after he returned from Liberia. So health officials aren't, for example, too worried about the possibility that others on board the flights this person took might also become infected.<br><br>Regarding the upcoming Hajj, I also heard in the same NPR news segment a mention that the Saudi government is planning to try and keep people living in the Ebola-affected west African nations from attending the pilgrimage.

Invariably, open lands previously accessible to nomadic herders became private property of farmers who extracted rents from the nomads or simply locked them out.<br>Paradoxically, farming which is generally viewed as a renewable enterprise is primarily an extractive practice like mining, making use of finite resources topsoil and in areas such as the Great Plains, fossil water. Farming the Great Plains had an expiration date built into it from the start. Pumping rates on the Ogallala aquifer were set to deplete the aquifer in 100 years, and time is up.<br>Given that farming on the Great Plains is doomed, the return of the Buffalo is only appropriate. Also, the nomadic hunting culture of the Great Plains Indians was a recent development fostered by the introduction of horses. Prior to the horse, hunting of buffaloes was a difficult task and not the mainstay of native subsistence. People lived primarily in bottom lands adjacent to rivers and raised various crops. The hunting of buffaloes was a part-time occupation, not the mainstay of the culture. <br>Going forward, we may well see a mix of bottom lands farming and nomadic hunting cultures coming back to the Great Plains.<br>In general, much of the southwest is unsuitable for farming but can support a mix of small garden plots and orchards near oases and nomadic subsistence gathering where food becomes seasonally available. <br>The greatest asset that places such as deserts and savannahs have in a post industrial environment is sparse populations making nomadic lifestyles an option for those that do not wish to be tied to a plot of land.<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c2021539819206358468 title="comment permalink">10/2/14, 8:18 AM</a><br><br>

This week’s essay leaves a lot to think about and a lot to process. When you said “brace yourself,” I didn’t think you meant that the crash would start the very same day. It looks like the world is going to be giving us a pop quiz on our collapsing skills. I’ve definitely come a long way since the last recession. Back then I was fresh out of college with no job experience or life skills and nothing but my life savings to live on. Back then my dreams of the future were in activism and hope for systematic change followed by a good wallow in neoprimitivism. Even once I started realistically grappling with the problems of our time there was year of promising I’d change my life as soon as this or that happened before I snapped out of it and actually doing something. I’m definitely in a better place than I was then. I’ve got some skills, some frugality, steady employment, a strong community, and some modest home food production. I still don’t feel ready though. This is going to be a long, hard winter and there’ll be some hard knocks and some sharp drops. I should probably replenish my emergency supplies, especially dried food this weekend just in case. I also intend to do some cemetery shopping and red tape cutting so that I might be able to have a natural burial someday instead of my final legacy being pollution from the industrial death system. If I could have one single wish granted about the future, it would be for me and the global infrastructure to live long enough for me to finish my OBOD coursework, but that may still take another decade. What happens will happen, and if I leave this world with work unfinished so be it. It’s not completing our work on ourselves and on the world that matters, but doing it with all our hearts until the end.

Nature isn't "safe," despite what many imagine. Efforts to dominate nature have included minimizing it, and portraying it as cute, similar to the way Disney sanitized the dark old fairy tales. Another form of attempted magic, I think, trying to re-imagine nature along the lines of an over-manicured suburban neighborhood or theme park on the theory that then it really would be safe. Tried to de-complexify, de-magic, de-sacralize, <i>de-nature</i> it.<br><br><i>Bison bison</i> cannot be reintroduced too rapidly, in my admittedly biased opinion. Tribes are cooperating with biologists to reintroduce many other species, as well. In that is hope for the prairies.

And there was just a conference here about living with the large predators such as wolves, cougars and (not strictly predatory) black bears that are starting to find their way down from the north.<br><br>Indians, biologists, ecology-minded folks of many persuasions and stripes, druids-- that the seventh fire peoples are discovering some commonality in worldview and finding ways to work together is a bright strand in a rough, dark fabric.

It was already sobering enough, as even with 1,000 cases you would win the bet (though just barely). Then a few days ago I learned from later comments that the actual case load was about 6,000 cases at the time. Gack. I can only assume Ben either didn't have the actual case number or couldn't/wouldn't do the math to propose a bet at such unfavorable terms to himself. I also came up with September 2015 for this week's challenge, again doing it in my head with rounding-off. <br><br>Over the summer I read Barbara Tuchman's book A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century. I'd chosen it for my reading on the end of a civilization because I'd found it for $2 at a used book sale. As you know, the Black Death (bubonic plague) figures prominently in the book. I did not realize at the time just how appropriate that reading would be for what we are facing. The extent to which the plague changed the underpinnings of the social order of the time, and how the social order then changed, combined with my learning of the number of Ebola cases and its doubling time, and the fracking bubble about to burst, and the fact of decline in the oil supply that isn't fracked, and what Ebola in the Middle East would likely do to oil production there, and what I'd learned from your posts on the religion of progress and the psychology of peak oil ... and the result was I spent a sleepless middle of the night in the cold hard reality of serious social breakdown heading our way. I foresee a very difficult next few years. The psychological shakeup will be extreme ... I could see those strange bright banners you've spoken of being unfurled before long. The best I can say is that knowing this, I can do some mental and physical preparation now for what is coming.

(or on other words, return to a stable equilibrium?)<br><br>The history about buffalo reintroduction reminds me of the current trend in depressed rural areas here in Spain, where the slow depopulation has relieved pressure on wildlife and now there are many places with a density of wild goats or boars that was unheard of since maybe 50 years ago...<br><br>While ebola is very scary, I'm quite old fashioned regarding deadly bugs, and would like to remind people of such demode bugs as cholera, malaria, typhus or yellow fever.<br>Particularly water borne epidemics such as cholera will become very widespread in Western nations when the drinking water infrastructure begins to crumble- you know, as when the wastewater treatment plants upstream of your city shut off and the maintenance of the local drinking water system that takes water from the same river starts to fail... <br>Oh! And BTW, all the above mentioned nasties were widespread in many parts of Europe (and probably the US) until right after WWII. And will again be, even with a new push northward thanks to climate change... <br><br>It happens that my better half works for the regional health authority in things regarding precisely drinking water, and she is definitely not optimistic on this. And besides, she has pointed out another failure mode of the system: in places where drinking water is sourced from wells (in theory with very low risk of bacterial contamination), there are a lot of new found problems because increased water contamination due to pesticides, nitrates, etc. It seems that while the usual water table level stays more or less constant, the concentration of contaminants stays also roughly unchanged, but when the water tables fall hard, for example during a prolonged drought, the water quality becomes quickly really, really bad. Literally the dregs of the barrel...

The southeast has to deal with automobileacidal deer, exploding feral hog populations, and the new intrusion of the Western puma (which is replacing the vacuum left by the pretty much inoffensive Florida cougar) simply because of the involvement of the game managers, the hunters, and the farmers.<br><br>We think we can handle ecological trends - we can't.

Perhaps people are finally starting to wake up. <br><br>As someone who has long subscribed to a cyclical view of history, I gave up on the Religion of Progress long ago. I read Oswald Spengler and Arnold Toynbee for the first time a decade ago (the local library here still has the full, unabridged editions of both “The Decline of the West” and “A Study of History”) and they both had a huge influence on my thinking. I came to Spengler and Toynbee in large part from reading “The Pentagon of Power” by Lewis Mumford, which was one of his last works. By then Mumford had become thoroughly disillusioned by the Cult of Progress and reconsidered his earlier, optimistic views about technology and the modern world. If you haven’t read “The Pentagon of Power”, it’s well worth the effort. Mumford’s observations about the World Trade Center in New York City back when it was still a set of blueprints and a builder’s scale model in 1965 were quite prophetic, especially in light of its eventual fate…<br><br>Of course the buffalo herds will return and the great experiment by the palefaces on the prairie will fail. Everything comes to an end sooner or later, but the cycle continues and time marches on. If I remember correctly, it was Einstein who said that you cannot break the laws of nature, you can only break yourself against them. Our descendents will eventually learn to work with nature, instead of engaging in a misguided attempt to bend and break it to their wills, and that will be one of the factors that eventually leads to the ecotechnic cultures and civilizations of the future. The prairie will go back to being occupied by tribes of nomadic warriors on horseback and will probably play a similar role in the future history of North America that the steppes of Central Asia did in Eurasian history. The future inhabitants of the Great Plains will probably be a mixture of indigenous nations like the Lakota, the Comanche and the Kiowa and Hispanic immigrants who revive the traditions of the vaqueros. The world keeps turning and the forces of history and nature can only be temporarily diverted or denied, but not for long…<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c3326507461427277418 title="comment permalink">10/2/14, 1:48 PM</a><br><br>

Ebola is following the normal process by which pathogens make the jump from animal to human hosts and then gradually normalize. Two or three thousand years from now Ebola will likely be a common childhood disease, the sort of thing most kids get and get over, like measles. <br><br>Marc, thank you. <br><br>Stuart, that's worth knowing.<br><br>Kylie, most Native American peoples did the same thing, with good effect. Some of our descendants may well do that as well. <br><br>Derv, it's entirely possible that the river valleys will continue to be farmed, while the plains in between go to herding or hunting nomads -- that's a fairly common pattern, historically. As for your proposed deal, you're on. <br><br>Brian, I'd rather just let evolution fill in the blanks itself -- we've messed up enough. As for Woodcraft and its equivalents, exactly -- thus my comment that a revival would be a very sensible thing right now. <br><br>Bogatyr, well, yes. I expect the medical system to collapse totally in most countries if this thing gets well under way. <br><br>KL, I certainly never heard that verse. <br><br>Jason, excellent. Yes, I've been thinking about that, too. <br><br>Violet, that's a fine choice of reading matter. I think, though, that so many people are enamored of the Tragic model that they'll follow it all the way down -- they've earned their last big scene, and won't let anyone take it away from them! Those who prefer the Comic model need to lie low, in the best Sancho Panza style, and wait for the Tragedy to finish. <br><br>Raven, of course people will still be around -- remember that even under West African conditions, 30% of the people who catch Ebola survive it. <br><br>Hector, I appreciate hearing that from you. I hope you're making as much in the way of preparations as you can -- as a physician, you're going to be in the firing line if a pandemic gets going here. <br><br>Justin, excellent!

Anybody for the opening scenes of Stephen King" "The Stand?"<br><br>Besides getting buttoned up for winter, I'm also thinking in terms of "what if I have to hold up for three months?" I'm looking at everything I eat and do. <br><br>Sure, I'll probably miss some things. Hopefully, whatever I miss won't be lethal. Just something that can be done without, worked around or adapted to. If lethal, well, I'm of an age that every day is an unexpected pleasure and that an ending is inevitable. I accept that, and there's not (much) fear. <br><br>A good book on the Black Death is "The Great Mortality" by Kelly. A good book on the 1918 flue epidemic is "Flu" by Kolata.

For example, the media keep saying over and over again that the transmissibility of Ebola is very low. Indeed there was an article just now on NPR.org that made the truly remarkable claim that Ebola is actually less contagious than either HIV or Hepatitis C.<br><br>http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/10/02/352983774/no-seriously-how-contagious-is-ebola<br><br>And that isn't even the first time I have seen that claim put forward in the media. Yet if that were true, what's up with the hazmat suits? Does it really need to be pointed out that doctors don't need a hazmat suit to treat an HIV patient? Why would they need one to treat a disease supposedly even harder to get than HIV? More importantly, how is it that doctors have been infected with Ebola *despite* the hazmat suits?<br><br>This notion that Ebola is less contagious than HIV is an outright lie of course-- so obviously false that I have a hard time believing that the people who frantically proclaim such things are unaware that they are spreading misinformation. But the fact that the media/government is deliberately spreading false-but-soothing information-- presumably to prevent a panic-- is, if anything, more frightening than if they were trying to whip up public hysteria (as they did with bird flu, West Nile virus, etc). Overnight the number of potentially exposed contacts in Dallas went from 18 to "about 100" and four additional people were put under quarantine. By now, damage control (by which I mean border/airport closings) should at least be on the table for discussion. Several African and Asian countries have already closed their borders to Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. But political correctness apparently prevents us from even talking about doing the same. It may already be too late for that anyway. I think it's past time for the elites to level with us and admit that they are too far behind the curve to catch up at this point. But they can't do that now-- midterm elections are coming up. Have to paste on a smiley face.<br><br>Meanwhile, the coca harvest season begins in October in West Africa, source of half the world's cocoa. Throngs of migrant workers are normally streaming into Liberia, Ivory Coast, and neighboring countries at this time of year, all set to do some seriously sweaty labor. I'm sure nothing could go wrong with that; after all, the alternative would be for the first world to pay higher prices for chocolate this year.<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c5856180621737832890 title="comment permalink">10/2/14, 2:45 PM</a><br><br>

Catchment basins and cisterns may be worth investigating. <br><br>Heretick and Becky, that's the one. Thank you. <br><br>Don, the people I know who have health care training insist that the media is overgeneralizing, and someone infected with Ebola will become infectious as soon as the viral load gets to a certain level -- which is around the time, but not identical to the moment, that obvious symptoms occur.

On a serious note, they're grumpy and mostly drunk from the toxic diet of eucalyptus leaves that they eat. Plus they sound like razorback the feral boar. Nasty little claws that'll do you up a treat mate - Look at the bones!!! hehe! On a serious note and as a fun fact: they actually prefer manna gums which are so named because during summer those trees drop a sweet gum like product which is edible and a traditional source of sugar around these parts.<br><br>You know, JMG, I reckon we've had this conversation before in the distant past, but memory fades...<br><br>The keystone species here was in fact the bunyip, which most people suspect is the cultural memory of the only local mega fauna - Diprotodon.<br><br>The fossil records for this beast disappear once humans arrived on the continent. You can even see the bones at places like the Naracoorte caves in South Australia where they accidentally fell in and died. They must have been tasty beasties!<br><br>Anyway, the humans then found to their dismay that once they'd eaten all of these beasts, they then had to perform the eco-system services of this animal. They had in fact promoted themselves to the unpaid position of key-stone species.<br><br>Who'd have thunk it? Nature provides eco-system services free of charge!<br><br>Incidentally, I'm discovering here that that particular function if wielded thoughtfully, promotes an increasingly productive eco-system over time. It is just a lot of work. Once the system is set up though, it is very easy to maintain and therein lays the true beauty of biological systems.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c6966169824540351106 title="comment permalink">10/2/14, 4:23 PM</a><br><br>

In ordinary times this reminds diagnosticians that the patient with a fever and a cough is more likely to have the flu than Ebola. Obviously this rule backfires when the possibility of a zebra stampede becomes real. <br>I just read a story of a nursing student in Liberia who kept 3 out of 4 of her family alive at home with an elaborate routine involving four layers of gloves, plastic trash bags, etc. donned twice a day, guided by her one year of nursing training. But, readers of this blog will note that plastic bags and gloves do not grow on trees. Nor do the tons of single use medical supplies that are now routine.

The first thing I did when Sara and I bought the place we live is start tearing out the lawn and replacing it with garden beds. <br><br>Ando, many thanks! That's the one. <br><br>Alphonse, thank you. <br><br>Richard, in the current outbreak the death rate has been running around 70% without medical care, and rather better than that if you've got some degree of care. Since I live in a small town, it's probably a safe bet that by the time Ebola gets here, the US health care system will be in total collapse, so I'm laying plans for home care. Rehydration is crucial; there are traditional medicinal herbs with strong antiviral properties, and there are also herbs that protect the liver, which is the main organ Ebola hits. It's a bit like getting ready for a all-out fight when you have time to prepare and size up the other guy: you can't guarantee a favorable outcome, but if you can make the odds better than a coin toss, that's worth doing. <br><br>Nathan, it is indeed. <br><br>Adrian, we can hope! <br><br>Ecologist, thank you. The point of this blog is to hit people across the face with the cold, wet mackerel of reality. <br><br>SweaterMan, yes, I read that. Hoo boy. A month from now, if infections start popping up all over the Muslim world, we'll know we're in for it sooner rather than later. <br><br>Peacegarden, thank you. No need to bring it; it's coming on its own four hooves. <br><br>Dammerung, it's not at all uncommon for that sort of bizarre religious movement to kick off during a time of pestilence. I admit I'd rather see people wake up to the need to live in harmony with the cycles of nature, but that's just me. (What would you call people who worship an anime character? I think the word "animist" is already taken...) <br><br>Howard, funny. Listening to Musk these days is rather reminiscent of an old Cheech and Chong movie, where the protagonists spend all their time stoned out of their gourds saying really, really stupid things.

Thanks for the recommendation. <br><br>SLClaire, my guess is that Ben just doesn't get the exponential function. It's very counterintuitive. As for Tuchman's book, that's an excellent suggestion for reading material just now!<br><br>NosVemos, well, I hope somebody gets a clue and lets the beavers get to work. I wonder how many simple solutions to massive problems are being ignored because they amount to letting nature take care of it. <br><br>Judy, you're very welcome. I remember how strongly Seton's phrase resonated with me when I first read his essay!<br><br>Herr Doktor, oh, granted. It's not as though we don't have a bubbling cauldron of pathogens waiting for us as the fragile structure of public health breaks down. <br><br>Robert, the moment you said "Tower time," that's the image I thought of. No surprises there, I suspect. <br><br>Steve, a lot depends on how vulnerable the US government and economic system are to sudden unraveling. There might be attempts to impose some such stupidity; alternatively, there might not be enough of a national structure left to do the thing. Time will tell. <br><br>Leo, I've heard -- though can't vouch for the statement, as I haven't had time to check into it -- that the guy in Dallas got sent home with an antibiotic because he didn't have health insurance. That is to say, you're probably right. <br><br>Wolf, I didn't know that the puma had expanded into the southwest -- that's very good news, though I suspect a lot of people down that way will disagree. There needs to be a climax predator to keep deer and feral hogs from wrecking the ecosystem, and <i>Felis concolor</i> ought to be just the ticket. <br><br>Kaitain, that's basically my take, adjusted for long-term climate change.

Factor in the exhaustion of groundwater and topsoil and you've got a losing proposition across the board. Congrats, though, for helping your friends to get a clue; if nothing else, the Ebola pandemic may finally manage to make Americans realize that if things go pear-shaped, we're on our own. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, try to find an old book on home nursing care -- the Red Cross used to sell them -- and then combine that with everything you can find on infection control. Rehydration is easy -- water plus sugar and a little salt will do it, or you can stockpile Gatorade. Then do your best and pray. <br><br>Lewis, oddly enough, I was remembering the same book -- also George Lewis' <i>Earth Abides</i>. <br><br>Troy, exactly. If it's so hard to catch, why are people catching it <i>through</i> tight infection control procedures? I didn't know about the cocoa harvest; combine that with the Hajj, and we've got the ingredients for a global pandemic within six months or so. Gah. <br><br>Charlie, yes, that's also a possibility -- at least as much in the immediate aftermath as in the crisis itself. <br><br>Kaitain, nah, they're just too short on money to afford the media management to cover their incompetence. <br><br>Jacopo, I don't see the Buffalo Wind as hope, I see it as reality -- the reality to which industrial civilization has been trying to close its eyes and ears all these years. That reality includes pain and death, and also life and joy -- and it reminds us that you can't have one side of that balance without the other. <br><br>MawKernewek, that makes sense.

Keeping the person hydrated will be task number one. Those who die of ebola do so from hypovolemic shock and organ failure. It attacks the kidneys and liver, but I am unsure whether the kidney damage is from low blood volume or from the virus or both.<br><br>It occurs to me that several natural remedies that I often keep around the home might be useful. Vitamin C is probably number one. Vitamin K perhaps also, and vitamin D. And A. Research into herbs is in order. Oregano oil?<br><br>This year I gathered elderberry and made syrup. But you can buy it and you can buy dried berries in bulk. Elderberry is meant to be quite medicinal, and has antiviral properties. <br><br>Avoid tylenol and aspirin or ibuprofen. The latter can make the bleeding worse and tylenol may deplete the body of something but I forget what. Also, very hard on the liver, which is having enough trouble. I suppose that in a hospital setting, tylenol will be given copiously. I think this is a mistake.<br><br>Pine needles are very high in vitamin C and a tea could be made.<br><br>Don't forget garlic, although it is quite possible the sick will not be able to stomach it. <br><br>A dilution of bleach does indeed kill the virus. If you are caring for someone sick, give thought to collecting their vomit and feces, and have a place to remove it to. I'm thinking a hole in the ground. You might want to stock up on plastic garbage bags. They can be used on the floor under a makeshift potty, used to wrap yourself up in in lieu of other gowns. <br><br>I don't think a gauze mask is adequate, but I'm not sure what you mean by gauze. There is a light cottony mask they use in the hospitals which seems quite thin but it is comfortable and I might use two. <br>Not sure what you mean by washable work gloves. You want your gloves to be rubber or plastic and soft enough to let you do fine tasks. If you have the finer, medical type gloves, you can double glove. They've got pictures of people in Africa wearing what looks like classic dish washing gloves, but I think they are doing bigger tasks like removing dead bodies.<br><br>The main thing is not to touch anything in the vicinity or let anything touch your skin that might be contaminated. If caring for a person with strong vomiting or diarrhea, try to be careful, step back and don't get in the line of fire. It would probably be necessary to have some sort of bedside toilet and vomit basin, that's why I suggested taping down black plastic bags to contain the contaminated area and the sick person will probably have little strength to walk to the bathroom anyway. The sick person should be confined to one room and only a completely attired caregiver should enter.<br><br>I am supposing that your glasses would be adequate. You don't want to lean in toward the sick person's face with your own face.<br><br>I am actually wondering, if a sick person could be kept hydrated, the biggest challenge, might some home treatments of herbs and vitamins give the greatest positive outcome?<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c1775433442783181663 title="comment permalink">10/2/14, 6:11 PM</a><br><br>

How many other people from Liberia got on that plane and where did they go? How many people flew out the next day and the next? Perhaps we will have multiple, more or less simultaneous outbreaks.<br><br>By the way, a recent research paper says the Black Death was probably not plague.

Questioning travel history is standard protocol in collecting medical history.

They had to purchase numerous large trash bins and store it on site while searching for help. They finally resolved the problem by autoclaving all the waste, with help from the CDC facility up the road from them.

There are some moves I would like to be making to prepare, mostly in terms of gifting preparatory measures to carefully chosen friends; but during my time away I will be able to refill my coffers enough to afford to take more actions than I could make by hurrying back to Fort Collins.<br><br>The advantage of exponents is that you have a block of breathing room at the beginning before things reach the break in the line. Here in America it is very likely that we have months before infection rates have a chance to become a major existential hazard. With some luck we might have a good bit longer than that, even moderately effective control responses could bottle neck expansion for a while. This does not change the fact that we face an extreme risk of a serious global pandemic, but it is worth remembering that exponential trends themselves are not governed by their own progress narrative and can stall out for reasons that are hard to foresee. Only fools count on such stalling, but the wise remember that they can happen, they do not mean the danger is over, and that they mean that the time frame for the danger reaching a particular area is very unpredictable. It could get a foot hold where you live in March or maybe not for years; we don't know. There is still some room for doubt that this will get out of control globally, though that room is many times smaller than is commonly appreciated. <br><br>The complication of this coming into view at a time when the popping of the Fracking bubble is also threatening to disrupt substantial and unpredictable sections of business as usual makes things more delicate.<br><br>So, I am going to make sure that I am ready with famine foods to make it to winter; I need to get my garden supplies in good order; consult the apothecary about having a good herb pouch ready; consult with trusted friends about emergency plans, duties and rights under various contingencies. And I don't even know where I am living this winter, if I face any existential threat there are enough land owners who value my services enough to intervene, and it would teach me humility!<br><br>Alright Wizards, if the next year is going to be a crazy one, lets be our best and face it with courage, grace, and wisdom. The dice are rolling, and if you think you have something to offer your community now is the time to put it on the table. If things get to the point that the Green Wizards are struggling remember that many people, potentially very good people, could be in much worse condition, if you are given the opportunity to help them at a tolerable risk level that right there is the opportunity that community in a strong sense can take root in.<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c5110018531260215699 title="comment permalink">10/2/14, 7:56 PM</a><br><br>

At the western edge you get 15 inches of precipitation a year. Much of the Great Plains has never been plowed, a fair amount has seldom been grazed -- it's miserably suited for agriculture. At the eastern end of that stretch, you get 40 inches of precipitation a year and had a completely different ecosystem. Radically different settlement patterns and population distributions. And of course, all of it was forested until about 12,000 years ago when the glaciers finished retreating and grass got the upper hand.<br><br>The population of the Great Plains proper has been steadily shrinking since the 1930s, with people retreating back towards the edges (eg, Denver on the western edge and Omaha on the eastern). The only significant exceptions are the areas of Texas (and now North Dakota) with large hydrocarbon deposits.

That was always going to happen -- the fall of a civilization involves a lot of death, and it's not distributed solely to the clueless -- and I know it's a bit of a shock to see it transition from "someday" to "soon."

I read a study about a year ago, or a reference to a study, which suggested that the total annual tonnage of meat produced by the Great Plains bioregion when it was a climax prairie populated by millions of bison far exceeded the annual tonnage of beef produced today by "advanced" farming methods -- i.e. using enormous fossil resources, draining aquifers, and contaminating land and water with various chemicals, hormones, etc. In other words, we are spending more resources and doing significant damage to produce less meat than the ecosystem was producing every year *for free*.<br><br>But... the reasons for destroying that immensely productive ecosystem were deeply political as well as individually selfish. For a start, the masses of bison were a *commons*, which was antithetical to the cult of private ownership and Enclosure that had swept Northern Europe starting, oh, sometime in the 1500s at a guess. Fenced-in, branded, individually *owned* cattle were ideologically acceptable in a way that bison simply were not. [I believe a similar terror of the commons underlies the enthusiasm for CAFO salmon which governments exhibit even at the cost of their precious wild salmon stocks: CAFO salmon are caged, identifiable, owned, private property, whereas wild salmon are a commons.]<br><br>And for seconds, the bison were a keystone of food security and a cultural icon of profound meaning and importance to the indigenous people; so as soon as the political decision was made to displace or exterminate those people, the bison had to go. Food security for non-whites was a nono (you can find other examples galore in colonial history of the destruction or outlawing of indigenous foodways and food sources, damming of watercourses to starve out indigenous farmers, etc).<br><br>So the decision was made, in the not-quite-informal almost-spontaneous kind-of-official-but-deniable way that such things happen, to exterminate the bison; and that accorded well with base elements in human nature like greed, cruelty, wanton destructiveness, so there was an ample supply of volunteers to commit the act of ecocide. The question of what was the most efficient, low-cost, or sustainable way to produce large amounts of excellent meat was never even, so to speak, on the table. That was never the point.<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c6515079099793255309 title="comment permalink">10/2/14, 8:49 PM</a><br><br>

It just crosses my mind that in the event that the proverbial fan gets soiled enough to gunk up its workings, radio might be a way to keep these discussions going. It seems like the really rough times will be times when a big picture perspective like the ones you offer here will be more needed than ever.

I'm sure to a lot of people that probably seemed like a strange thing to list as a prep skill, but more recently I've come to realize that a part of that does relate to the role of death in the future. The idea that living in times like this is necessarily about surviving them is, in a way, rooted in the myth of apocalypse, and the idea that the world that comes out on the other side of times like these is supposed to belong to us. It seems to me that part of the reason spirituality is so important in times like this is that our inner state can wind up making the difference between welcoming death openly as an old friend when it comes and dying in agony and turmoil, refusing to let go until the very last moment.

I really recommend you to go check the wikipedia article about that (and request if anyone can recommend some more serious resource about that too). It was the Great Pandemic of the 20 century, and studying it will teach us aspects of how this things move in a modern setting that simply do not exist in the Black Death references.<br><br>For starters, it is called "Spanish Flu" because at the time Spain remained neutral during WWI, meaning it had no incentive to fudge with the reports to prevent morale to go down in the troops, meaning the media spread the meme that Spain was hit disproportionally hard.<br><br>Some will say that there is no comparison, since Ebola is much more deadly. While this is true, Spanish Flu was not a walk in the park either. With mortality rates firmly in the double-digits percent and easier to transmit, it spared no continent, nation or region and killed 3-6% of the world population in a 2 year span. If Ebola manages to spread this much, there might as well be 1 billion lives cut short in a very messy and painful way.<br><br>Reflecting on this has made me realize that the odds that all of us will be spared are uncomfortably low, but the odds that all of us will die in this round are even lower. Without doubt someone's going to stay behind and will have to pick up the pieces afterwards.

You can download a PDF of the <a href=https://irma.nps.gov/App/Reference/Profile/2210987 rel=nofollow>Department of the Interior report here</a>, about halfway down the webpage under the header "Holdings." There's a handy map on page 24, which shows the scope of public lands that are under consideration. When I look at the locations in Nebraska—Valentine National Wildlife Refuge, for example—I can't help noticing how much is still unknown, and how difficult it's going to be to manage the logistics, and how much budget is likely to be required. Where is the funding for that going to come from?<br><br>Second, in response to this: <i>"Still, it’s one of the basic axioms of the Druid teachings that undergird these posts that people know more than they think they know, and a gut-level sense of the cascade of changes that would be kickstarted by wild buffalo may be helping drive their opposition."</i><br><br>I'm not personally opposed to the general idea of reintroducing bison, not at all. I do think there's a lot of truth in that statement, though. The issues are not as simple as "<a href=http://prairieecologist.com/2014/01/21/bison-good-cattle-bad/ rel=nofollow>bison good, cattle bad</a>." Not meaning to pick on any of your commenters in particular, but I sorta wish that everyone with a "huzzah, let the buffalo roam free!" attitude would at least take time to skim that very readable essay, which addresses some of the complexities that are involved. I could go on and talk about certain incidents and accidents involving bison in my immediate area, which have occurred over the past few years, and which have affected people I personally know.

It's exactly what I had been hoping to find. My husband is an ER doc at a hospital serving a low-income community in California, so it's not at all unthinkable that he, and therefore the rest of my family, will be exposed to Ebola some time in the coming months. If this happens, I am assuming that the institutional care facilities will be overwhelmed. His ER has ONE room with air ducts that vent to the outside, thus suitable for isolating an infectious patient. The rest of the hospital's preparations are similarly pathetic. Right now the direction coming down from on high is that anyone who comes in with fever, headache, etc. and reports international travel is supposed to be isolated and tested for Ebola. So every guy coming back from visiting family in Mexico who comes in with the flu is going to get this level of examination and resources? You can see already that this directive is impossible to follow and so will be widely ignored- thus allowing real cases to slip through undetected. So I expect things to be bad here at some point. Rather than abandon any member of my family to the tender mercies of an Ebola tent in the parking lot of the hospital, with overwhelmed care staff and inept, panicked government officials "in charge", I am planning to care for family members at home, if, God forbid, it becomes necessary. So understanding how to do this with lower risk and with supplies I can round up without alerting homeland security is very, very helpful.<br>This mental exercise has been very useful for me in understanding the choices of many West Africans who do not want to take their family members in to Ebola "treatment" centers. It's not necessarily that they are ignorant or superstitious- quite the opposite, perhaps. They recognize that there is no magic treatment coming through the official channels, that the isolation wards are warehouses to hold the infectious until they either die or get better by themselves, and that perhaps they can better care for their loved ones at home. The trick is doing so without spreading the disease. All those who may be horrified at the idea of my planning not to use the official channels can rest assured that we will be self-quarantined in our rural home if these events should come to pass. Again, God forbid. Wish I had another incantation to ward off these events I fear, but that's all I've got.<br>--Heather in CA<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c1039738812690357037 title="comment permalink">10/3/14, 11:22 AM</a><br><br>

The surrounding dangers in this version are very real, any kind of success is not assured, and the story actually reminds me of the "story project" of this blog: green wizards and cultural conservers, not to mention ecologists, herbalists, druids and so on, in my view, are going about a similar project. So are the Indians and white (and Indian) naturalists and biologists working to reintroduce native prairie species, as well as organic farmers and gardeners and so on.<br><br>It is not a question of emerging into a new life of utopian peace and plenty, it is a question of understanding that human life should be based on natural systems and learning the traditional knowledge and other kinds of knowledge that can help heal ecosystems and help make a way of life in the midst of dark times. And developing an appropriate spirituality, I suppose, if an individual or group is led in that way (I am).<br><br>There is also the idea that the people working together in this way might cross traditional ethnic/racial/political fault lines--thus the idea of a "hybrid culture," which feeds into JMG's discussion of how new ethnicities could easily arise in the future.<br><br>That being said, I completely agree that all kinds of end-times, cargo-cult kinds of mythologies will sprout, not to mention nihilistic theologies/ideologies that place a premium on the taking of life. We humans are good at that sort of thing.

In all, the results demonstrate that a kinase inhibitor cocktail consisting of genistein and tyrphostin AG1478 is a broad-spectrum antiviral that may be used as a therapeutic or prophylactic against arenavirus and filovirus hemorrhagic fever." http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21947546<br><br>The study says that genistein alone (as well as tyrphostin AG1478, a pharmaceutical preparation) are effective but the combination has enhanced effectiveness due to a synergistic effect.<br><br>It turns out that genistein is found in fermented soy products, such as miso: "Miso, like other soyfoods, contains high concentration of a potent anti-cancer agent known as genistein. Researches indicate that miso contains 25 times more genistein than other unfermented soyfoods, like soy milk and tofu. As such, miso is beneficial in lowering the risk of cancer, especially breast cancer." http://recipeclout.india-server.com/miso.html<br><br><br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c8382036993531902083 title="comment permalink">10/3/14, 12:45 PM</a><br><br>

You make excellent points re bison and the complexities of reintroduction. Chris Helzer's blogpost you linked really does a good analysis of management issues. I read his blog often.<br><br>Interestingly, Helzer doesn't discuss the different physical grazing methods of the two species or differences in hoof anatomy, but perhaps this is obviated by the different habitat preferences and the general effects of overstocking. Too many grazers in too small a space will have a negative effect on the plant life, no matter what the species. (Deer are a problem in the forest preserve areas I help maintain.)<br><br>At Nachusa Grasslands in Illinois, one big hurdle that has had to be overcome for bison reintroduction is the building of a special corral for inoculation against brucellosis, a controversial subject in itself.<br><br>I guess when a native wild species is reintroduced or even simply encouraged there will always be complex issues, controversies and difficulties. My area of knowledge really is more native plants than animals; you'd be amazed at the controversy and even legal battles sparked by gardeners who plant wild native plants in their yards or what happens when groups want to plant prairie grasses instead of turfgrass in a public area. This is starting to change, thank goodness, though slowly. <br><br>I think the social, political and cultural issues surrounding reintroduction are as thorny as the physical and monetary issues. Around here, people are having to learn to live with the fact that coyotes are a presence; there have been incidents involving small dogs--but the answer is not to exterminate the coyotes (even if we could, which is highly doubtful). There are camps--coyotes ok and coyotes evil; it just depends on how people view ecosystems and the human place therein, I guess, and also how well they understand how ecosystems function--which you clearly do--no criticism implied! <br><br>Are you familiar with the rewilding going on in the Netherlands and other parts of Europe?<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c5640706613014605870 title="comment permalink">10/3/14, 2:14 PM</a><br><br>

Most human beings don't make decisions on a rational basis; they decide based on their feelings, and then come up with rationalizations to justify those feelings. The visceral hatred of wildness is one such feeling, and it was very deeply rooted in American culture in the 19th century. <br><br>Janet, I actually prefer the first edition of Buhner's herbal antibiotics book, as it concentrates more on commonly available herbs and less on exotics. Still, whatever works for you!<br><br>Glenn, of course it was -- thanks for catching that. <br><br>DeAnander, and that's been being predicted now for decades. Not that anyone was listening...<br><br>Edward, good. Also spot on -- all I asked was the month and year, after all. <br><br>Bogatyr, every photo I've seen of people doing much of anything around that apartment has had a noticeable shortage of protective gear. Oh well, I don't suppose we'll miss Dallas much. <br><br>Beneath, true -- and of course it's equally true that complicated data processing systems also provide people with a galaxy of additional excuses for their own incompetence. <br><br>Zachary, thank you!<br><br>Don, of course. The Sudanese strain of the virus pops up every so often; like most of the eastern African strains, it's apparently less transmissible than the West African strain. The question is which strain is involved in this outbreak. As I mentioned in my post, it might be an ordinary outbreak of the local strain; if it's not -- if the West African strain has already spread along the old Sahel trade routes -- we are much closer to a global pandemic than most people realize. <br><br>Kutamun, zoologists are very worried that it may wipe out the gorilla -- they've had an epidemic of it as well. It seems to be harmless to fruit bats and wild pigs, but not to primates. <br><br>Ice Torch, I hadn't heard that the mainstream media has noticed me -- one clumsy negative review in one financial blog, I think, doesn't quite count.

That site should be useful. And yes, it's getting very real indeed. <br><br>Donalfagan, every time somebody loudly insists that an Ebola epidemic can't get going here in the US, that makes it more likely that an Ebola epidemic gets going here in the US. Complacency is the worst risk factor of all. <br><br>Eric, well, we'll see! For what it's worth, I don't expect the internet to go down as a result of this crisis, even if we get a full-blown epidemic here in the US. That possibility lies further off, I'd say. <br><br>RPC, so noted!<br><br>Crow, how very cheery. Ahem. ;-)<br><br>Raymond, exactly. That's why I put the upper end possibility around 2 to 3 billion deaths.

It remains to be seen whether the US is one of those countries, but that's a secondary issue. The point I'd make is that a very large number of Third World countries are failed or semi-failed states with minimal health care systems, and if Ebola is allowed to spread outside its current hot zone into those other failed states, a huge number of people are going to die. <br><br>The Nigerian case is misleading, as it involved people who were wealthy enough to travel by plane and get access to Western-style health care, and both of those factors brought the situation to the attention of the government.

(I haven't read all 183 comments -- so far -- so I apologize if I'm repeating something.)<br><br>First, for those who enjoy indulging in alternate histories, imagine how the contact between the indigenous Americans and Europeans starting in the late 15th century might have played out if the diseases introduced by the Europeans had been only a mild annoyance to the natives, and thus the Europeans had to deal with thriving populations and well-established civilizations.<br><br>Back to our current reality, but keeping the longer historical focus: Charles C. Mann, in the book 1491, points out:<br><br><i>Until Columbus, Indians were a keystone species in most of the hemisphere. Annually burning undergrowth, clearing and replanting forests, building canals and raising fields, hunting bison and netting salmon, growing maize, manioc, and the Eastern Agricultural Complex. ... But all of these efforts required close, continual oversight. In the sixteenth century, epidemics removed the boss.<br><br>American landscapes after 1492 were emptied ... Suddenly deregulated , ecosystems shook and sloshed ... The forest that the first New England colonists thought was primeval and enduring was actually in the midst of violent change and demographic collapse. So catastrophic and irrevocable were the changes that it's tempting to think that almost nothing survived from the past. This is wrong; landscape and people remain, though greatly altered. And they have lessons to heed, both about the earth on which we all live, and about the mental frames we bring to it.</i><br><br>(Actually, Brian Cady beat me to referencing this book -- thanks, Brian.)<br><br>Pinku, thanks for the passenger pigeon reference. Mann also gives an interesting account of their nature and fate. Before the epidemics, the pigeon and the people were competitors for many of the same resources, so the people ensured that they never got too numerous (think of rats with wings -- my image, not Mann's). So, the vast throngs of pigeons that the "new bosses" encountered were the natural result of the lifting of an ecological constraint.<br><br>On another topic: some of the comments have mentioned growing populations of Native Americans in the Midwest, and generally a slow recovery of their culture and identity (not exactly as it was, of course). In my area, the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, the local tribes have been quietly establishing a modest presence. It may be, when the population of us "newcomers" has declined far enough, the Tongva, Chumash, and Tataviam will inherit what we perforce abandoned.

It's helping me to calm down and put together plans of herbs, foods, and so forth that we can use and that I can offer as suggestions to anyone who asks me.<br><br>I'll make some suggestions too: if you are looking for a very good basic book on preparing herbs, the one I use is Making Plant Medicine by Richo Cech. He tells you how to do it both without making exact measurements and how to make preparations using simple math and cheap glassware (a graduated cylinder) so you can make preparations of fairly well known strength. He also offers dosage info for many common herbs. My copy is well used. Buhner's books are excellent for the details on each of the herbs he profiles, but in my opinion not as helpful on making preparations, where Cech's book shines.<br><br>If you want to use the more exact method you can buy graduated cylinders of various sizes from American Science and Surplus at http://www.sciplus.com/ Everything else you'd want is easily obtainable if you don't already have it. <br><br>Consider, too, measures to keep your immunity level up to at least slightly increase the chance that you won't get Ebola (or other communicable diseases). Getting enough sleep, walking or similar kinds of physical activity, doing something you enjoy whenever you can, and similar things may help with this. Look into vitamins, minerals, and/or herbs along this line that you can use every day.<br><br>Yesterday I learned that a friend from the dulcimer club my husband and I belong to died of West Nile virus. That's the third person I know who has died in the last month. Puts me in mind of general demographic decline as you spoke of some weeks back. Not that Ebola won't overshadow other diseases in the near term, but as others have said, there are plenty of diseases out there and they will all prosper with declines in public health measures.<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c8159552024083826654 title="comment permalink">10/3/14, 6:06 PM</a><br><br>

If cases appear in India and Europe and China and Brazil, even if one or two, suddenly flights are empty, borders are closed, materials and food left on the docks. This can all happen way before any epidemic gets out of control. Parents will not send their kids to schools, nobody will ride the bus, public meetings will cease, stores will become deserts, empty.

There's a good herb store within walking distance of my place. Today I bought Herbal Antibiotics and Herbal Antivirals, housemade elderflower syrup, zinc tablets and an herbal tea mixture to strengthen the immune system. (I don't have space to grow many herbs or places to gather most of them.)<br><br> I've read part of the antiviral book and skimmed the rest. Things I've learned so far:<br><br>Stephen Buhner is a very good writer, well organized, direct and clear about his sources. He is also a punster, sarcastic, and funny. Chapter Six has a two page rant about taxonomy that had me laughing out loud repeatedly. <br><br>The first chapter contains a long scientific explanation about how viruses propagate. I had an odd double reaction to this. I tried to read with detachment, emulating Buhner's respect for viruses and their ingenuity at overcoming obstacles. OTOH, from a more personal point of view it's a horror movie. I learned that there are DNA viruses and RNA viruses. RNA viruses mutate more rapidly.<br><br>Chapter Two has clinical details of the progression of symptoms in Spanish Influenza. I had thought it was just a more severe kind of flu. Turns out people soaked sheets with blood. I also didn't know that one third! of everyone on earth caught it (a much smaller number got very ill). <br><br>When one gets into the chapters on remedies and prevention, things get cheerier.<br><br>Wikipedia says Ebola is an RNA virus. I draw three conclusions from that. First, as it spreads, new strains will develop, and it won't be possible to create vaccines for all the strains. Second, natural selection favors mutation in two directions: easier transmission to new hosts and reduced lethality to those hosts (so they will have more opportunities to pass the virus on). When both those tendencies are pushed far enough you get the common cold, which you can catch from touching a dry doorknob, but nearly everyone recovers from.<br><br>Those are general trends and the way any given virus mutates in a short period of time isn't predictable. So I believe the course of this epidemic is not predictable. Just as medium sized earthquakes teach engineers how to build more earthquake resistant structures, the good that might come out of this would be realistic but not utterly destructive testing of both the public health system of the entire world, and the ability of human beings to keep calm and carry on.<br><br>Captcha 1900<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c7989255611050385206 title="comment permalink">10/3/14, 11:38 PM</a><br><br>

I could list the antivirals he gives in the book, but you really should get the book and learn how to use them properly. It's especially critical that most people who attempt to use herbs underestimate the dose on an order of magnitude, when it comes to acute illness of any kind. At this point it is impossible to know just what will work. We can only speculate.<br><br>My speculative approach that I would use if I were to come down with the disease, would consist of a cocktail of at least three of the antivirals in Buhner's book, of which I already have several quarts prepared, as the primary approach. Say, elder, chinese skullcap, and lomatium, for example. Elderberry syrup is a good preventative. A tablespoon taken daily is something that some claim will ward off the flu. It may help with ebola as well. It's not at all considered curative though. Elder flowers, and perhaps leaves, bark and root, may carry curative properties not contained in the berries. The two have quite different biochemical profiles.<br><br>In addition to direct antivirals, I would reach for supportive herbs. Echinacea is excellent. It's one people tend to dramatically underdose. The dosage given on a bottle of echinacea tincture is likely to accomplish exactly nothing at all. I prefer it by the ounce, hourly, when fighting off a bug. You might as well toss out your capsules as well, you don't even know what's in those things. The other supportive herb that jumps out at me is licorice. Licorice is synergistic with a number of herbs that have antiviral properties. It is seen as an adrenal tonic, and ebola is believed to target the adrenal system. In addition, it is known to have hypertensive properties in some people. This is typically considered a harmful side effect, but when hypervolemic shock is a risk, it could potentially be a good thing.<br><br>Milk thistle is the most broadly liver-protecting herb I am aware of, with effects well verified scientifically. It is best consumed in a whole/crushed or encapsulated form. The extract is considered by some to be worthless.<br><br>Blood volume balancing herbs and antihemorrhagics come to mind as a possibility. Yarrow is viewed as an herb that balances bloodflow and blood volume, stems hemorrhage, and is a diaphoretic, useful in fighting viral infections that are fever-producing. Yarrow can be consumed safely in copious amounts. If I had ebola I would drink several quarts of hot yarrow and elderflower tea a day. Shepherd's purse tincture and cayenne powder, tea or tincture come to mind as strong antihemorrhagics that I would also attempt to use in small, supportive doses.<br><br>It isn't widely known, but if all else fails, water can be absorbed through the skin. I'm not sure just how much you take in that way, but for someone soaking an a warm bathtub, given enough time, it can be enough to matter. Rectal injections, while distasteful for most to think about, are also very effective in getting fluid aborbed quickly and directly into the bloodstream. Plain water, electrolyte solutions, and also herbal teas.<br><br>These are just speculations. I have no idea if any of this is any good, and I welcome criticism or suggestions. It's simply where I would start if I were looking for answers.<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c5423889866109883708 title="comment permalink">10/4/14, 1:22 AM</a><br><br>

Taraxacum, all we really have is speculation at this point, but we also have a responsibility to ourselves to think about how we'll respond to what's in front of us, so I'm happy to have read your thoughts on the matter as well as those of others. The speculation here is at least informed. Thanks Deborah, for the link to the VHF guide. Along those lines, here is a link to an older Red Cross guide to home hygiene and care of the sick, which I'm also finding useful in terms of planning. http://www.gutenberg.org/files/32250/32250-h/redcross.html<br><br>I'm trying to understand how Ebola works in the body so that what I put together is as sound as possible. I would love some help understanding this if anyone here grasps how it functions. It looks like the virus "rides" on the immune system and takes advantage of it, so straight up immune stimulants such as Echinacea might not be indicated. However, it may be wise to support the immune system in other ways with Astragalus and use other gentle herbs such as Red Clover and Cleavers. One area where herbs can really help is in supporting the liver, which will be hit hard by Ebola, so Dandelion root, Burdock root and Milk Thistle seed tinctures.<br><br>Taraxacum (the commenter), I would also use Elder as I have it at hand, although would suggest berry and flower together in a syrup or flower on its own in a tincture. The stem and bark are purgative and emetic, so I'd save those for another time. I would not take the root of Elder unless given freely and then I would be hard pressed to use it directly as medicine. Yarrow comes to mind for me, too. I'd probably lean toward Shepherd's Purse before Cayenne just because of how irritating the latter can be. My thinking on this in general has been informed by a podcast by herbalist Sam Coffman wherein he also suggested that Andrographis has been researched specific to Ebola, but I have no experience with this herb and will be reading up on it for the first time tonight. (Podcast can be found here: http://prepperbroadcasting.com/2014/08/05/ebola-virus/ ... the prepper intro is relatively short). I'll look into Lomatium, too, so thanks for bringing that up. <br><br>Astringent berberine containing herbs may be appropriate for the diarrhea. These would include Goldenseal (although over harvested), Barberry or Oregon Grape root.<br><br>For hydration, I'd make a strong nettle infusion with a pinch of licorice or on its own to mix with a cold infusion of marshmallow and use that as a base. If it were accepted in small sips, then there would be some much needed nutrition as well as hydration. There is only so much that a person can take in, I think, so I'd work on making concentrated infusions.<br><br>I tend to use herbs energetically in drop doses, but in situations like this I agree that larger and quite frequent doses are probably necessary. There isn't much time to experiment.<br><br>For now, we're taking care with what we eat, including more fermented foods, taking Elderberry and flower syrup, and bitters—many of which are hepatoprotective. It's good to have a plan and stick to it, but I want my focus to be on our being as healthy as we can now.<br><br>Best to you all.

As finances decrease so will imported ammunition. Many of those city boys will be crashing through the woods scaring the game to ground for miles around.

Even given they ride bikes they're only good for fifty miles and seasonally time and temperature is going to be problematic. The learning curve for bow hunting is going to be ugly steep for most of them and where are they going to get their bows, not to mention good arrows.

I'm sure you'll find it very comforting. <br><br>SLClaire, it's good to remember that Ebola isn't the only microbe that's expanding its range rapidly, and causing increased death, in a world that's gone out of ecological balance.

I suspect it's a thylacine wind down your way. <br><br>Will, my guess is that you're wrong -- as population contraction intersects with decreased access to transport, getting to the targets will be an increasing challenge, and then there's the question of just how heavily armed the Native peoples guarding the buffalo will be.

Myself, I'm looking at antivirals that are part of the local ecology -- we've got some useful ones here in the north central Appalachians, including one (<i>Erigeron philadelphus</i>) that also prevents hemorrhaging in the stomach, bowels, and other internal organs. But there's still time to draw up plans. <br><br>Phil, it is just a breath away. That's normal. The last seventy-five years aren't. <br><br>Cherokee, I'll certainly cheer for the tiger if it gets another run at things. <br><br>Dagnarus, I have to admit that these claims about how we can't restrict travel seem stunningly daft to me. It's as though we're rushing on our fate. <br><br>Degringolade, I'm sure the figure will vary up and down due to rounding errors, etc. As you say, though, if it's an exponential process, no matter what the doubling rate is, we're in trouble. <br><br>Shane, I'm not sufficiently familiar with the different environmental needs of buffalo and cattle to say. The Great Plains have been a depauperate region in terms of megafauna since the end of the last ice age, though, so my guess is that there's ample room for both, and for wild horses as well. <br><br>Hector, as a physician, you might be able to do a lot of good, knowing that about Clomid. Just saying...<br><br>Moshe, I've seen that also. Much of the carbon went into the Amazon basin, which was thickly settled and farmed before 1492 and turned into impassable jungle after that, but there was a fair amount elsewhere. Depending on how far Ebola gets, we might see a reprieve from global warming along the same lines. <br><br>Ixtlan, thank you -- I'm clearly going to want to read more of what M. Lion has to say. <br><br>Onething, I wish I could say that I'm surprised.

The virus isn't particularly sneaky or wantonly transmissible, and the protocol for stopping its spread is pretty straightforward - isolation and monitoring. But watching the fail parade in Dallas changed my mind about that. It was the official reaction of placing the family under armed guard and confining them for days to an apartment full of infectious materials. It is easy to see this reaction as a foreshadowing of disaster writ small. If infection starts to rage in an immigrant neighborhood or a half dozen neighborhoods, how long would it take until we rolled out the razor wire, wrote them off as lost and let them die in place? And once that spectacle hits the public consciousness, who is going to report their daughter's fever to the authorities? Or admit that they've been in contact with the disease?<br><br>If we wanted to turn Ebola from medical curiosity to epidemic this would probably be the shortest route.<br><br>I guess the CDC has some competent medical anthropologists on staff, because it was remarkable how abruptly officials changed course. The official in charge removed the family from the apartment, and gave effusive apologies, insisting that “I want this family treated as I would like to see my own family treated,” and purportedly spirited them off to isolation in some luxurious suburban McMansion. It is not in the DNA of Texas politics to hear a top government official speak of dark-skinned immigrants in those tones, so I can only assume that someone in Washington pushed hard to head off the damage that was about to be done to the ability to deal with an outbreak of Ebola.<br><br>With one patient, the CDC was able to hold the line against counter-productive official panic.

With a little more research it looks more complicated, though. Clomid probably can't reach the blood concentrations required to suppress Ebola. Some of the chemotherapy agents could... but they're chemotherapy agents. The way medicine is practiced, a humble family doc could probably get by under the radar with off-label prescriptions of a mostly benign fertility drug. Handing out prescriptions for chemotherapy agents for any reason would raise a lot more eyebrows. The cinematic image of the heroic and innovative doctors sticking it to the establishment and saving lives is mostly a myth. It's really one of the most deeply conservative, paint-by-numbers affairs you can imagine. One of the common sayings is, "Never be the first or last doctor to use a treatment." It's for mostly good reasons much of the time, but in this case I imagine the bog-standard ponderous, unimaginative, patent-generating approach the Powers That Be seem to taking is going to fall woefully short.<br><br>I dunno, I'll have to look into it more.

This doubling period is sensitive to the choice of this number. At 1.4 it is now a doubling time of 40 days, 1.2 80 days and 1.1 160 days. The rule of thumb of 2^10 = 10^3 can help thinking what sort of numbers of cases will be reached.<br><br>Without really knowing the situation on the ground in the affected areas, it's hard to say how this will pan out. <br><br>Even the exponential function is a simplification. It could be that as the number of cases increases, public health infrastructure becomes increasingly overwhelmed in the affected areas, leading to a larger average number of infections per sufferer, or that over time, the virus finds the most vulnerable communities and grows faster there. Thus it would become superexponential. Or else that in relatively speaking more developed countries such as Nigeria and Ghana the infection rate would be too low for a self-sustaining epidemic, at least until the numbers of infected people coming out of the worst affected areas are sufficient.<br><br>The prospect of groups like Boko Haram in Nigeria deliberately spreading the infection is another frightening element to the mix. <br><br>The search engine <a href=www.wolframalpha.com rel=nofollow>Wolfram Alpha</a> can be useful to get an idea of the populations of different countries.

Could you please elaborate about what you mean by Ebola riding the immune system?<br><br>From what I have read about Spanish flu, it killed mainly by a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_storm rel=nofollow>cytokine storm</a>, which is basically a strong overreaction of the immune system. The result was that mortality amongst young healthy adults was higher than the equivalent among children, the elderly, and the otherwise sick (which are typically the most vulnerable groups). This is the same pattern followed by the much smaller epidemics of 2003 (SARS) and 2009 (A(H1N1) influenza), but official results are preliminary/contested.<br><br>Nothing I have read so far suggest that Ebola in general, or the West African strain in particular, follows that pattern.<br><br>What I think you have read is that after infection (and this is a key issue, will come back to it later), Ebola virus makes affected cells to produce a type of glycoprotein (sGP) that helps it inhibit early immune response and bind itself to some type if while cell, neutrophils, which then allows it to travel through the blood vessels to the internal organs (specially, but not exclusively, the liver and kidneys).<br><br>I am neither a doctor nor a military officer, and what I am going to say is highly speculative... but the strategy you propose is the equivalent of Defense in Depth: the conscious decision to give up territory to the enemy, in the hope that it will spread its lines thin while you conserve strength for a powerful and decisive counter-attack. I don't think that strategy is going to work. The disease will not grow weaker as it moves inside your body, but stronger, and since there is no known cure the possibility of a decisive counter-attack is nil.<br><br>Back to the issue of infection, you have to consider that having contact with the virus is not game-over. First, it has to enter your tissue through either broken skin of natural body orifices (most likely nose, mouth or eyes). Once it has entered your tissue, infection is not complete until at least one viron has managed to break a cell's membrane and get himself into the safety of its cytoplasm. Before that happens, the viron is floating inside the aqueous mean called the interstitial space, where it is preyed upon by the immune system.<br><br>If my argument is correct - and I am far from sure it is - having a strong immune system will prevent infection in exactly the most common situations where exposure is likely for non healthcare workers: direct contact with non symptomatic patients that are borderline infectious at the time. <br><br>@all. Please tear down my argument if you can. Advice is a dangerous thing for both giver and taker, and it's way better to be proven wrong during cross examination than on first contact with the enemy.<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c81387737232038634 title="comment permalink">10/5/14, 10:50 AM</a><br><br>

When thinking of cytokine storm, it is indeed complicated. Reading around on sites it seems there is some folk knowledge out there re which treatments are anti inflammatory (good in this case) and which might not be the right thing for a cytokine storm. For example:<br><br>The Bad Guys (Remember, we're just talking about cytokine storms here - these herbs are generally very good for immune systems!)<br>Elderberry Juice (Sambucal) - AVOID - Increases production of cytokines TNF-a and IL-6. This substance is very effective against the common flu but may not be desirable for the H1N1 virus. Increases in these cytokines may trigger a lethal cytokine storm.

(Pubmed PMID 11731916)<br><br>Honey - AVOID - Increases production of cytokines TNF-a and IL-6. (Pubmed PMID12824009)<br><br>Chocolate - AVOID - Increases production of cytokines TNF-a and IL-6. (Pubmed PMID 12885154, PMID 10917928)<br><br>Echinacea - AVOID - Increases production of cytokines TNF-a and IL-6. Although it is often used for normal flu, research shows that it may increase the chance of cytokine storms for H1N1. (Pubmed PMID 15556647, 9568541)<br><br>Kimchee - AVOID - Increases production of cytokines TNF-a and IL-6. (Pubmed PMID15630182)<br><br>Coiloidal Silver - AVOID - While silver will likely work to kill the swine flu virus, in many healthy individuals it is likely to elicit a severe cytokine storm reaction.<br><br>Some good things to use might be (everyone should research everything), um, well...nicotine, and oil of clove, turmeric, garlic, feverfew, green tea and St. John's wort.<br>However, a nauseated person might not tolerate garlic too well.<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c214924649092407135 title="comment permalink">10/5/14, 4:27 PM</a><br><br>

In a nutshell, it initially infects monocytes and macrophages -- the innate, nonspecific immune system that normally protects us from nonself -- and when the new virions bud from those cells they start a cytokine storm, with a massive inflammatory response. The virions then infect the endothelial cells, which line blood vessels. Between the cytokine storm and the attack on the endothelial cells, the structural integrity of the blood vessels begins to fail. This starts DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), which means the coagulation system goes haywire, creating blood clots everywhere. The blood clots impede circulation in smaller vessels, causing tissue death throughout. This is especially severe in the liver, which is rich in blood vessels. The loss of integrity also allows blood components to begin leaking. Eventually, the DIC leads to lack of platelets and clotting factor, which then leads to bruising and hemorrhage. In the meantime, lymph cells also get infected, leading to mass apoptosis (cell suicide). The apoptosis releases nitric oxide. If the patient survives long enough, they'll pump out new lymphs as fast as possible, leading to many immature cells. Some lymphs will manage to be functional, initiating an antibody response. Obviously, though, most succomb to hypovolemic shock. All of this happens very quickly without intensive treatment.<br><br>The good news is that Ebola is relatively fragile outside of the body. It does persist longer in cooler temperatures than at room temp. It is also destroyed by UV light. The absolute best protection, frankly, is to avoid exposure.<br><br>More to come.<br>Mary<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c4238657572776931058 title="comment permalink">10/5/14, 6:06 PM</a><br><br>

Convalesence is slow and the immune system obviously compromised for some time. Here is where I think herbs could best help, by supporting the injured organs and helping to rebuild the immune system. <br><br>The best prevention is to avoid exposure, cover even the tiniest scratches, keep skin from becoming chapped. If there were an outbreak, I'd hunker down at home. The cameraman remembers getting a little splashback on his face while he was helping to clean a chair that a victim sat in.

Ebola prevents these cells from carrying out their antiviral functions but does not interfere with the initial inflammatory response, which attracts additional cells to the infection site. The latter contribute to further dissemination of the virus and similar adverse consequences far beyond the initial infection site."</i><br><br>best<br>Phil<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c3872266088209244628 title="comment permalink">10/6/14, 6:08 AM</a><br><br>

Note that you will need to allow the alcohol to air dry since it works by dehydrating the surface membranes (at least, that is how it destroys gram neg bacteria). Also be aware that UV light does not penetrate glass, so use it outside. In Africa, they wash, disinfect and air dry reusable PPEs outside in full sun.<br><br>A Liberian nurse recently saved 3 out of 4 family members she treated at home, using an IV setup up and gloves from work and fashioning her own PPEs from ,things around the house. Presumably we won't have IV setups or hospital gloves, but when you aren't trying to find a vein and insert a needle, you don't need them. That's a good thing, since accidentally needlesticks are the worst kind of exposure and hospital gloves tear easily. You will want to use inprenetrable gloves, such as kitchen gloves.<br><br>The nurse used multi-layers of large plastic garbage bags to cover her feet and legs, taped below her knees. I'd tape them above knee if possible, but you get the idea. Tall, uncracked rubber boots would be ideal, since cleanable and reusable. She wore a waterproof raincoat. She wrapped her hair in stockings and then covered her head. She also fashioned a face mask.<br><br>How to remove disposable gloves: with your nondominant hand, pinch up the glove on your dominant hand between thumb and forefinger near, but not over, the edge of the glove and pull it inside out while you pull it off. You can now take the unexposed inside of the glove into your uncovered dominant hand. Using the inside/unexposed glove to protect yourself from the gloved hand and finger, slide the forefinger of your dominant hand under the edge of the glove and pull it off inside out and over the free glove. You will now have 2 gloves inside out, one completely wrapped inside the other, without having touched the outside of either glove. It's a good trick to practice a few times before you need it. <br><br>If you don't have disposable gloves (and we probably won't, or at least not enough), then wash and disinfect the gloves totally, letting them air dry.<br><br>I'd wear a waterproof rain hat and if possible, fashion a clear plastic face shield for complete facial protection. If opened at the back and bottom to allow air to enter, it will protect from splash back while cleaning.<br><br>Patients generate massive amounts of infectious waste, from sweat-soaked sheets and clothes to towels and rags used to clean up vomit, etc. So you will need to be prepared to double or triple bag the waste and if possible remove immediately to a large, sealed plastic or metal bin for temporary storage until you can incinerate or otherwise deal with later. <br><br>If you keep the sick person in one room with a single entrance, and keep plastic bags, rags, hand washing materials and an alcohol foot bath right at that entrance, it will help control the ongoing cleanup and prevent spread throughout your home.<br><br>Mary<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c5022358866286024084 title="comment permalink">10/6/14, 6:22 AM</a><br><br>

I hardily agree and wanted to offer a couple thoughts in that direction. I am good friends with a wildlife specialist with USDA who spent his apprenticeship with that program doing beaver control in the southeast. Basically his job was to wage war on the beaver using traps, guns, and dynamite. It was and remains a holding action and most of the effort is expended on protecting highway infrastructure at considerable expense.<br><br>I think the intersection of beaver and modern roads is going to be pretty interesting. As many of you probably know, beaver are pretty good at plugging up culverts. In modern road design we tend to level the roadway through “cut and fill” techniques that are totally dependent on culvert maintenance. Next time you are out for a ride imagine what happens when every little creek and trickle along your way has a resident family of beavers taking up management of the operation. The impoundments they can create against a modern road can be pretty “dam” big. Pretty soon you’ve got wetlands, ponds, and lakes all over the place. Now that’s a keystone species at work.<br><br>The longer term impacts are significant. Roads are not meant to be dams, so eventually they will give way and release whatever impoundments happen to be behind them. Eventually the beavers will remove all the “cut and fill” and formerly sensible level roads will become very difficult or impassable routes. Modern interstates use heroic applications of “cut and fill” and will suffer the most from beaver action. <br><br>Imagine those beavers at work on your next commute, they’ve got big plans!<br><br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c7727932257109293178 title="comment permalink">10/6/14, 8:58 AM</a><br><br>

Most of the items on the "no" list are things we might be taking now in the hopes of strengthening our immune systems for the possibility of exposure. Elderberry has both berries and flowers which I did not even know until yesterday. They are not the same. <br><br>Also, I am wondering about nanosilver being on the no list. It states it might create a cytokine storm. I don't understand that as I thought silver was essentially "cidal." I also read that a study was done on silver for ebola and it had great efficacy - but only when taken after exposure and before symptoms.<br><br>It is very interesting that 40 or 50% of people exposed do not get the disease. This is worth looking at, although not really surprising. I also want to know more about the ones who survive. It looks like it is similar to the 1918 flu pandemic, in that children fare slightly better, perhaps due to not putting up as strong a storm. But it also occurs to me (What do you think, Magicalthyme?) that it might be sheer luck in that if you get just a tiny exposure of a few virions, perhaps your body begins to spot the problem before enough replication has occurred to totally overwhelm you.<br><br>I should go over to your site Violet Cabra, but along with treatments, there should be components about how to avoid exposure and what to do with contagion/decontamination if you are trying to treat someone at home. For one small example, it will be better to give them some sort of bedside commode than let them use the flush toilet, as flushes send small particles all over your bathroom - yes, better don't keep your toothbrush too close to a flush toilet! For the same reason, don't flush their vomit or feces.<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c7334212590156779498 title="comment permalink">10/6/14, 9:42 AM</a><br><br>

It is absolutely baffling, and perhaps it would be better to focus solely on preventative care? <br><br>A vital part of the thought experiment is "what if there are no doctors or hospitals available?" I am in earnest that if I were to get sick with ebola the first place I would go was the isolation room in a hospital, granted that one was available. If not then I would muddle along the best I could with the knowledge I have. The result wouldn't be total certainty, it would be putting one foot in front of the other and praying a lot. I honestly think I would stand a much better chance through western medicine.<br><br>The part about disposal of contagions is an important detail, though ideas about caring for others is unfortunately way beyond the scope of my essay and the parameters of the thought experiment, in large part for legal reasons, and also because of my own lack of familiarity and knowledge about caring for infectious sick people in any capacity.<br><br>I would be honored if you posted your thoughts as they come up to my site.

He accepts the credit and was televised carrying the girl in his arms and giving her a car ride, not wearing any protective gear.<br><br>His name is Clay Jenkins. His official title is Dallas County Judge. According to Maddow, he is the top elected official of the county. <br><br>Jenkins received praise from Maddow this summer when so many women and children from Central America were crossing into the US and surrendering to immigration authorities, expecting to be allowed to stay. Judge Jenkins made a public commitment that Dallas County would find decent housing for all the children who arrived in the county and not try to ship them off somewhere. He stated that children deserved to be treated as children, not as enemies or threats. That wasn't a popular stand in all quarters.<br><br>In the interview this afternoon, he said, "The science [about the disease] is known, and I rely on the science." He said that the delay in rehousing the family happened because all the places that were asked refused to house them; "There was no room at the inn." (Exact quote.) He said he found the house where they are now staying by turning to his "faith community."<br><br>Apparently Clay Jenkins is a leader and a Christian who takes the Golden Rule and Jesus's saying about how we treat the least of these to heart. His use of the term "my faith community" instead of "my church" also indicates that he doesn't parade religiosity or wish to imply that only Christians have concern for the welfare of others. <br><br>Altogether an unusual man and I hope he doesn't lose his post in the next election.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c7339564597968040520 title="comment permalink">10/6/14, 7:17 PM</a><br><br>

Honestly, I’m shaking my head.<br><br>So much of the energy expended by our civilisation is used to insulate the human population from nature. <br><br>However, whilst I find the threat of Ebola to be concerning and even somewhat alarming, that virus is also part of the natural world in which we exist.

The hypthesis is that possibly they had very low dose exposure through, for example, a piece contaminated fruit. So you're thinking is in the right place.<br><br>I also noticed that number correlates nicely with the 90% fatality rate when untreated. Correlation does not equal causation, but it does give some pause.<br><br>re: 40-50% contracting the disease after exposure, if you get a splash of vomit on your skin you are exposed. If your skin is intact and you wash it off immediately, you'll be ok. If you have a tiny cut there, even microscopic, it can get in and infect. Or if it's on your hand, you aren't aware of it, and you rub your eye, it can get in through the mucus membrane and infect.<br><br>Studies show that it only takes 1-10 virions to infect, but that would be monkeys. Hard to imagine, but it it more devastating to monkeys than humans. They have a 100% fatality rate.<br><br>Until now I've been feeling pretty lucky. Locally we have Somalian communities, but they're on the opposite side of Africa with strong countries and the ocean around them. And they're not exactly a "go to" place if you're looking to escape a disease. And we have international travelers, but I haven't seen any from Africa. Just some Asia and mostly Europe. A Spanish nurse with only 2 potential exposures contagious on vacation and sent away when she called in her initial symptoms is making it a little too real to me.<br><br>I have concerns about the guideline criteria for suspician. The ony 2 positives diagnosed outside Africa, and both initially turned away because their low fevers didn't meet the 101.5F threshold tells me the criteria need to be revisited. Duncan's temp was 100.1. Personally I think any symptom of a potentially exposed person should be enough, and 100F works for me. Or course, nobody's asking me, lol.<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c3685170949682253493 title="comment permalink">10/7/14, 5:19 AM</a><br><br>

It has offered a bit of peace of mind though the various flu and SARS outbreaks over the past couple of decades.<br><br>I would inject an uncharacteristic note of optimism into the discussion though... having followed emerging diseases over the years, I have noticed that they are oddly self-limiting in an unexpected way. This was especially obvious with SARS, where the disease should have done a global run based on its distribution in Asia and its transmissivity, but suddenly, and seeming inexplicably just... stopped. This reversal was so dramatic that at the time I wondered if SARS had an engineered component, but since then have seen similar effects with the various flus.<br><br>Science would probably not support it, but I have begun to think of acute viral diseases as having Transmissivity (R0) and a 'Timer' (X0) that is seemingly an independent variable. R0 has it's way until X0 is triggered, and then the virus suddenly goes underground to gloat at its success and plot its next outbreak, perhaps decades later.<br><br>Based on the JMG principle that "It's not really that different this time" I would not be surprised to see Ebola just...quit. <br><br>So, I prepare, but I also keep in mind that the last half dozen times I did so the preparations were not used, and I try to maintain a balanced stance when I discuss it with others. I encourage them to do the same, and to keep an eye on how the Buffalo Wind is blowing, but also to keep in mind that they are preparing for one possible scenario, not for a certain outcome.<br><br>I have found there are upsides to being over-prepared in this way -- One is that I'm never short of N95 masks when I need to insulate an old attic!<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c9024166367857999868 title="comment permalink">10/7/14, 7:57 AM</a><br><br>

Here's how he opened his blog entry today.<br><br>"Environmental pessimism makes strange bedfellows. We seem to be having a moment in which three groups with very different agendas — anti-environmentalist conservatives, anti-capitalist people on the left, and hard scientists who think they are smarter than economists — have formed an unholy alliance on behalf of the proposition that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is incompatible with growing real GDP."<br><br>http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/slow-steaming-and-the-supposed-limits-to-growth/<br><br>This time, his target is not the Post-Carbon Institute. Instead, it's Mark Buchanan at Bloomberg, who posted a response to the same opinion piece that prompted your essay last week. The title of Buchanan's piece is revealing--"Economists Are Blind to the Limits of Growth."<br><br>http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-10-05/economists-are-blind-to-the-limits-of-growth<br><br>This sent Krugman off into a discussion of how economies can use energy more efficiently, doing the same with less, using an example from shipping. He completely ignored the possibilities arising from resource depletion. Peak oil? As I wrote before, he's not having it.<br><br>Krugman also revealed that he's been critical of "Limits to Growth" for 40 years. When he was the research assistant to William Nordhaus, he picked up the latter's distain for both the ideas expressed and especially the execution.<br><br>It turns out Krugman has been beating up on "Limits to Growth" and its predecessor Jay Forrester’s "World Dynamics" for at least six years. Here's a link to an blog entry from 2008. Paradoxically, it also notes that things on the energy front haven't worked out as well as the optimists in the early 1970s thought they would. As Churchill once wrote, people will occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them will pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing had ever happened.<br><br>http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/22/limits-to-growth-and-related-stuff/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c2026656036299835030 title="comment permalink">10/7/14, 2:37 PM</a><br><br>

That's number one, but if it fails, it is certainly better to have something rather than nothing. I think that some things are also pretty reliable as being helpful. Coping with fluid loss by rectal administration or slow sipping to avoid retching, and using the right mix of salt and sugar in the water seems very safe. I would be quite comfortable adding vitamin C to the mix. In fact, Emergen C already has electrolytes and some B vitamins. People with diarrhea run short of magnesium and potassium. It seems very likely to me that ebola would deplete vit C, D, and A. And D is apparently soothing to the immune system so far as the storm.<br><br>Personally, I think the ideal would be to go to a hospital that provides the above, and they are unlikely to do so. They just don't operate that way. <br><br>My approach would be to research other herbs carefully, and then use them as the base for all efforts at hydration. <br><br>I know you are young and single, but those who have families, esp children, will need to think about that. Quarantine and cleanup. If you care for someone, you would need to be incredibly careful to suit up every time, and decontaminate carefully.<br><br>I have wondered about burial of wastes - whether that is safe. Ebola may have animal vectors that could keep the virus in the background. I also am not sure about burning. I believe both would have to be done correctly. If burning, I think a cover should be used, preferably over a hole in the ground.

I would encourage people who are interested in planning for the contingency of self-treatment and/or home care to keep the conversation going on my blog http://winterstrickster.blogspot.com/2014/10/surviving-ebola.html. If this is already happening on some other corner of the internet please let me know so I can check it out and learn valuable things.<br><br>The conversation we're having is important, and I think it benefits all parties to have more eyes doing over it and voices speaking up. If we continue to check each other's work and preparations and do research we can potentially arrive at a highly refined course of action should we depend on it for our lives.

Here's the WHO Ebola site:<br><br>http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/en/<br><br>On the right side of that page, look for Situation Report Update. I would link the report directly, but it's a PDF so the link changes whenever they upload a new one. They don't have graphs, but they do have maps of where new cases are coming from.<br><br>The current official figures of 7470 cases and 3431 deaths (as of Oct 3) is an enormous under-count, however. I suspect the leveling off of new reported cases is due to laboratories reaching their maximum capacity to test samples. An Ebola case is not "confirmed" unless a lab test is done that comes back positive. A case is not "probable" unless there is a verifiable epidemiological link to another confirmed or probable case. You can probably see why these criteria would result in an under-count. I'm reminded of that New York Times piece a few weeks ago about a cemetery in Freetown where they had recently buried over a hundred Ebola victims while the official count for Ebola deaths for all of Freetown at the time stood at only ten. So, yes, perhaps the number of new cases plateauing could be a good sign, but it is just as likely that the disease is outrunning the affected countries' Ministries of Health ability to even measure its impact, let alone contain it.<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c1631186126188635342 title="comment permalink">10/8/14, 8:55 AM</a><br><br>

I think what you are describing is an anomaly/limitation in the measuring process, rather than in the dissemination of disease itself. I have been following the WHO page since August, and the trend is roughly 2-3% daily growth for suspected cases. Confirmed cases growth has been falling behind in the last weeks, and now it is about 1.5%, but this is consistent with a saturated healthcare system that is working at or near capacity. I expect the tendency to turn linear, at least until the next infection gets a foothold in a new country with an intact healthcare system.<br><br>Around September 15th, there was a big bulge in statistics, but I think it was more a matter of correction for previous under-reporting. Measurement is never an exact process and, since it depends on cooperation between different entities, any particular data point may give you only very coarse reflection of reality. But the trend over time is closer (though may be subject to it's own set of biases).<br><br><a href=the-buffalo-wind.html#c7355505536901626999 title="comment permalink">10/8/14, 12:38 PM</a><br><br>
