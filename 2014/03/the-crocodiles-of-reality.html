I've suggested in several previous posts that the peak oil debate may be approaching a turning point—one of those shifts in the collective conversation in which topics that have been shut out for years or decades finally succeed in crashing the party, and other topics that have gotten more than their quota of attention during that time get put out to pasture or sent to the glue factory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’d like to talk for a moment about some of the reasons I think that’s about to happen, and in the process, give a name to one of the common but generally unmentionable features of contemporary economic life. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/images-fb9e12-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 src=../../img/images-fb9e12-g95.jpg></a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We can begin with the fracking bubble, that misbegotten brat fathered by Wall Street’s love of Ponzi schemes on Main Street’s stark terror of facing up to the end of the age of cheap abundant energy. That bubble has at least two significant functions in today’s world. The first function, as discussed in these essays already, is to fill an otherwise vacant niche in the string of giddy speculative delusions that began with the stock market boom and bust of 1987 and is still going strong today. As with previous examples, the promoters of the fracking bubble dangled the prospect of what used to be normal returns on investment in front of the eager and clueless investors with which America seems to be so richly stocked these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These then leapt at the bait, and handed their money over to the tender mercies of the same Wall Street investment firms who gave us Pets.com and zero-doc mortgages. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You might think, dear reader, that after a quarter century of this, there might be a shortage of chumps willing to fall for such schemes. Whatever else might be depleting, though, the supply of lambs eager to be led to that particular slaughter seems to be keeping up handily with the demand. We live in what will doubtless be remembered as the Golden Age of financial fraud, an era of stunning fiscal idiocy in which even the most blatant swindles can count on drawing a crowd of suckers begging to have their money taken from them. Millennia from now, the grifters, con men, and bunco artists of civilizations yet unborn will look back in awe at our time, and wish that they, too, might be fortunate enough to live in an era when tens of millions of investors passionately wanted to believe that the laws of economics, thermodynamics, and plain common sense must surely be suspended for their benefit. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To some extent, in other words, the fracking bubble is simply one more reminder that Ben Franklin’s adage about a fool and his money has not lost any of its relevance since the old rascal slipped it into the pages of <i>Poor Richard’s Almanac</i>. Still, there’s more going on here than the ruthless fleecing of the unwary that’s the lifeblood of every healthy market economy. The fracking bubble, as most of my readers will be well aware, has not only served as an excuse for ordinary speculative larceny; it’s also provided a very large number of people with an excuse to scrunch up their eyes, stuff their fingers in their ears, shout "La, la, la, I can’t hear you," and thus keep clinging to the absurd faith that limitless resources really can be extracted from a finite planet. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For the last three or four years, accordingly, the fracking bubble has been the most common item brandished by practitioners of peak oil denial as evidence that petroleum production can <i>too</i> keep on increasing forever, so there!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The very modest additions to global petroleum production that resulted from hydrofracturing shales in North Dakota and Texas got talked up into an imaginary tidal wave of crude oil that would supposedly sweep all before it, and not incidentally restore the United States to its long-vanished status as the world’s premier oil producer. All that made good copy for the bunco artists mentioned earlier, to be sure, but it also fed into the futile attempts at denial that have taken the place of a sane energy policy in most industrial societies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The problem with this fond fantasy is that the numbers don’t even begin to add up. The latest figures, neatly summarized by Ron Patterson in
<a href=http://peakoilbarrel.com/will-peak-oil-actually-arrive/ >a recent post</a>, show just how bad the situation has become. Each year, on average, the oil industry has had had to increase its investments by 10% over the previous year to get the same amount of oil out of the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even $100-a-barrel oil prices won’t support that kind of soaring overhead cost for long, and the problem has been made worse by the belated discovery that many of the shale beds ballyhooed in recent years don’t have anything like as much oil as their promoters claimed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a result, oil companies around the world are cutting back on capital investment and selling off assets. That’s not the behavior of an industry poised on the brink of a new age of abundance; it’s the behavior of an industry that has just slammed face first into hard supply limits and is backing away groggily from the impact site while trying to stanch the bleeding from deep fiscal cuts. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As a result, with mathematical certainty, a great many overpriced assets are going to lose most of their paper value in the years ahead of us, a great many businesses that have made their money providing goods and services to the drilling industry are going to downsize sharply or simply go bankrupt, a great many wells that can’t make money even at exorbitant oil prices are going to be shut in or go undrilled in the first place, and a very, very great many people who convinced themselves that they were going to get rich by investing in fracking are going to end up poor. It’s not going to be pretty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Exactly what effect this is going to have on the price of oil is an interesting question; my guess, though it’s only a guess, is that a couple of years from now the price of oil will spike, possibly to the $250-$300 a barrel range, then crash to $60 a barrel, and slowly recover to $175 or so over a period of several years. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This has a great deal of relevance to the project of this blog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The last time petroleum production failed to keep pace with potential demand, and the price of oil spiked accordingly, peak oil came in from the fringes and got discussed publicly in the pages of newspapers of record.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That window of opportunity gaped open from 2004 to 2010, roughly speaking, and during that period a great deal got accomplished. That was when peak oil stopped being a concern of the furthest fringe and found an audience in many corners of contemporary alternative culture, when local groups—some under the Transition Town banner, others outside it—began to organize around the imminence of peak oil, and when books on resource depletion and its consequences found a market for the first time since the early 1980s. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those are significant gains. It’s true, of course, that these achievements didn’t make peak oil go away, or find some gimmick that will keep the lifestyles of the industrial world’s more privileged inmates rolling merrily along for the foreseeable future. What sometimes gets forgotten is that neither of those things was ever possible in the first place. The hard facts of our predicament have not changed a bit:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>the age of cheap abundant energy is ending; the economic systems, social structures, and lifestyle habits that were made possible by that temporary condition are accordingly going away, and nothing anyone can do will bring them back again, not now, not ever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s worth being precise here:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>for the rest of the time our species endures, we will have to deal with much more sharply constrained energy supplies than we’ve had handy over the last few centuries. That doesn’t mean that our descendants will be condemned to huddle in caves until the jaws of extinction close around them; I’ve argued at quite some length <a href="http://www.newsociety.com/affil.mvc?Affil=ARCH&amp;Page=../Books/E/The-Ecotechnic-Future">in one of my books</a> that the endpoint of the mess we’re currently in, centuries from now, will most likely be the emergence of ecotechnic societies—societies that maintain relatively high technology on the modest energy and resource inputs that can be provided by renewable sources. I’ve suggested, there and elsewhere, that there’s quite a bit that can be done here and now to lay the foundations for the ecotechnic societies of the far future. I’ve also tried to point out that there’s quite a bit that can be done here and now to make the unraveling of the age of abundance less traumatic than it will otherwise be. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To my mind, those are worthwhile goals. What makes them difficult is simply that any meaningful attempt to pursue them has to start by accepting that the age of cheap abundant energy is ending, that the lifestyles that age made possible are ending with it, and that wasting all those fossil fuels on what amounts to a drunken binge three centuries long might not have been a very smart idea in the first place. Any one of those would be a bitter pill to take; all three of them together are far more than most people nowadays are willing to swallow, and so it’s not surprising that so much effort over the last few decades have gone into pretending that the squalid excesses of contemporary culture can somehow keep rolling along in the teeth of all the evidence to the contrary. </div>

The frantic attempts to sustain the unsustainable driven by this pretense have done much to make the present day such a halcyon time for swindles of every description. Not all of those, however, have taken aim at the wallets of what we might as well call the lumpen-investmentariat, that class of people who have money to invest and not a clue in their heads that Wall Street might not have their best interests at heart. Some of the most colorful flops of recent years have instead attracted money from a different though equally gullible source: government subsidies for new energy technologies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who were part of the peak oil scene a decade ago, for example, may remember the days when ethanol made from American corn was going to save us all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many of the same claims more recently deployed to inflate the fracking bubble were used to justify what was described, at the time, as America’s burgeoning new ethanol industry, but the target for these exercises was somewhat different. A certain amount of investment money from the clueless did find its way into the hands of ethanol-plant promoters, to be sure, but the financial core of the new industry was a flurry of federal mandates and federal and state subsidies, which in theory existed to lead America to a bright new energy future, and in practice existed to convince the voters that politicians really were doing something about gasoline prices that had just risen to the unheard-of level of $2 a gallon. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You won’t hear much about America’s burgeoning new ethanol industry these days. A substantial fraction of the ethanol plants that were subsidized by governments and lavishly praised by politicians a decade ago are bankrupt and shuttered today, having failed to turn a profit or, in some cases, cover the costs of construction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The critics who pointed out that the burgeoning new industry made no economic sense, and that making ethanol from corn uses more energy than you get from burning the ethanol, turned out to be dead right, and the critics who dismissed them as naysayers turned out to be dead wrong. Still, the ethanol plants had accomplished the same two functions as the fracking bubble did later: it sucked a great deal of money into the hands of its promoters, and it helped everyone else pretend for a while that the end of the age of cheap abundant energy wasn’t going to happen after all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s hardly the only example of the phenomenon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since I don’t want green-energy proponents to feel unduly picked on, let’s turn to the other side of the energy picture and take a look at nuclear fusion. Since the 1950s, a sizeable body of nuclear physicists have kept themselves gainfully employed and their laboratories stocked and staffed by proclaiming nuclear fusion as the wave of the future. In just another twenty years, we’ve repeatedly been told, clean, safe nuclear fusion plants will be churning out endless supplies of energy, if only the government subsidies keep pouring in. After sixty years of unbroken failure, even politicians are starting to have second thoughts, but the fusion-power industry keeps at it, pursuing a project that, as respected science writer Charles Seife pointed out trenchantly in <i>Sun In A Bottle: The Strange History of Fusion and the Science of Wishful Thinking</i>, has more in common with the quest for perpetual motion than its overeager fans like to think. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Every few years the media carries yet another enthusiastic announcement that some new breakthrough has happened in the quest for fusion power. Now of course it’s worth noting that none of these widely ballyhooed breakthroughs ever amount to a working fusion reactor capable of putting power into the grid, but let’s let that pass for now, because the point I want to make is a different one. As I pointed out in <a href=../../2013/08/the-ritual-theater-of-progress.html>a post here last year</a>, the question that matters about fusion is not whether fusion power is technically feasible, but whether it’s economically viable. That’s not a question anyone in the fusion research industry wants to discuss, and there are good reasons for that. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The ITER project in Europe offers a glimpse at the answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>ITER is the most complex and also the most expensive machine ever built by human beings—the latest estimate of the total cost has recently gone up from $14 billion to $17 billion, and if past performance is anything to go by, it will have gone up a good deal more before the scheduled completion in 2020.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That stratospheric price tag results from the simple fact that six decades of hard work by physicists around the world, exploring scores of different approaches to fusion, have shown that any less expensive approach won’t produce a sustained fusion reaction. While commercial fusion reactors would doubtless cost less than ITER, it’s already clear that they won’t cost enough less to make fusion power economically viable. Even if ITER succeeds in creating its "sun in a bottle," in other words, that fact will be an expensive laboratory curiosity, not a solution to the world’s energy needs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
My more attentive readers will doubtless have noticed that the flaw in the current round of glowing prophecies of a future powered by fusion plants is the same as the flaw in the equally glowing sales pitches for corn-based ethanol fuel plants a decade ago. Turning corn into ethanol, and using the ethanol to fuel cars and trucks, is technically feasible; it just doesn’t happen to be economically viable. In the same way, whether fusion power is technically feasible or not may still be up in the air, but the question of its economic viability is not. The gap between technical capacity and economic reality provides the ecological niche in which both these projects make their home, and a great many other alleged solutions to the energy crisis of our time inhabit that same niche. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d like to suggest that it’s high time to put a name to the technological fauna that fill this role in our social ecology, and I even have a name to propose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I think we should call them "subsidy dumpsters." </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A subsidy dumpster, if I may venture on a definition, is an energy technology that looks like a viable option so long as nobody pays attention to the economic realities. Because it’s technically feasible, or at least hasn’t yet been proven to be unfeasible, promoters can brandish enthusiastic estimates of how much energy it will yield if only the government provides adequate funding, and point to laboratory tests of technical feasibility as evidence that so tempting a bait is within reach. The promoters of such schemes can also rely on the foam-flecked ravings of economists, who have proven to be so stunningly clueless about energy in recent years, and they can also count on one of the pervasive blind spots in modern thinking: the almost visceral inability of most people these days to think in terms of whole systems. Armed with these advantages, they descend upon politicians, and if energy costs are an irritation to the public—and these days, energy costs are
<i>always</i> an irritation to the public—the politicians duly cough up a subsidy so they can claim to be doing something about the energy problem. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Once the subsidy dumpster gets its funding, it goes through however many twists and turns its promoters can manage before economic realities take their inevitable toll. If the dumpster in question has to compete in the marketplace, as fuel ethanol plants did, the normal result is a series of messy bankruptcies as soon as the government money runs short. If it can be shielded from the market, preferably by always being almost ready for commercial deployment but never actually quite getting there—the fusion-research industry has this one down pat, though it’s fair to say that the laws of nature seem to be giving them a great deal of help—the dumpster can keep on being filled with subsidies for as long as the prospect of an imminent breakthrough can be dangled in front of politicians and the public. Since most people these days consistently mistake technical feasibility for economic viability, there’s no shortage of easy marks for this sort of sales pitch. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are plenty of subsidy dumpsters in the energy field just now. What makes this all the more unfortunate is that quite a few of them are based on technologies that could be used in less self-defeating ways. Solar power, to name only one example, could make a huge dent in America’s energy needs, if the available resources focused on proven technologies such as solar water heaters; once this sensible approach is replaced by attempts to claim that we can keep the grid powered by paving some substantial fraction of Nevada with solar PV cells, though, we’re in subsidy-dumpster territory, as <a href=http://energyskeptic.com/2013/tilting-at-windmills-spains-solar-pv/ >a recent study of Spain’s much-lauded solar program</a> has shown. Renewable energy is a viable option so long as its sharp limits of concentration and intermittency are kept in mind; ignore those, and pretend that we can keep on living today’s extravagant lifestyles on a basis that won’t support them, and you’ve got a perfect recipe for a subsidy dumpster. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<a href=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M8hAcIDT0UM/UyEng0bVfVI/AAAAAAAAAIs/_frhttjdN8A/s1600/croc2.JPG style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"></a> </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now it’s only fair to point out that the energy issue is far from the only dimension of modern life that attracts subsidy dumpsters. Name a current crisis here in America—joblessness, urban blight, decaying infrastructure, and the list goes on—and there are plenty of subsidy dumpsters to be found, some empty and rusting like yesterday’s ethanol plants, some soaking up government funds like the ITER project, and many more that are still only a twinkle in the eyes of their eager promoters. Still, I’d like to suggest that subsidy dumpsters in the energy field have a particular importance just now. </div>
<br>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/crocodiles3-f016cb-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=129 src=../../img/crocodiles3-f016cb-200x129-g95.jpg srcset="../../img/crocodiles3-f016cb-364x235-g92.jpg 1.8x" width=200></a></div>
The end of the age of cheap abundant energy requires that we stop using anything like as much energy as we’ve been using in recent decades. Any approach to dealing with the crisis of our age that doesn’t start by using much less energy, in other words, simply isn’t serious. The parade of subsidy dumpsters being hawked to politicians these days is merely one more attempt to refuse to take our predicament as seriously as it deserves, and thus serves mostly as a way to make that predicament even worse than it has to be. By and large, to borrow a neatly Pharaonic turn of phrase from one of my longtime readers—tip of the archdruidical hat to Robin Datta—that’s the trouble with spending all your time splashing around in the waters of denial; all that happens, in the final analysis, is that you attract the attention of the crocodiles of reality.<br>

The four biggest surprises in the article for me were:<br><br>1. The multinational bookkeeping for the project is so complex it has its own currency, the ITER Unit of Account.<br>2. Each member country is supposed to contribute some proportional number of billions of dollars, but things are so complex that there are other billions floating around and nobody knows where they came from.<br>3. Despite all this complexity, there is no actual machinery on the site yet -- just some concrete foundations. (Check it out on Google Maps.)<br>4. The entire purpose of the thing is about the promise of the "sun in a bottle", cheap energy for everyone, but the project has been scaled back due to its immense cost overruns and, if successful, it will only produce marginally more energy than it takes in.<br><br>This is almost certainly one of the most complex things human beings have ever tried to make. But it will not, itself, function as a power plant.

Few years ago it was still expensive and needed subsidies, but today there are many markets where PV can compete and win against other electricity sources without aid. Therefore it is economically viable. For direct self consumption (which is not covered by the feed-in-tariff) even in cloudy Germany today it is cheaper to build PV on your roof than to buy electricity from the grid. <br><br>Therefore i wondered about your Spain-PV-study and crunched the numbers. First of all: the study is about large scale solar plants. PV can also be mounted on rooftops, which removes expences like roads, land, fencing, security and so on. <br><br>If you remove those large-plant-only-costs from the data, EROEI rises to levels between 3 and 4. <br><br>The next thing to take into account is technological maturity. Producing PV gets cheaper and more resource and energy efficient every year. This of course currently makes production equipement obsolete, which is taken into acount by the study. But this obsolenscence means that the technological limits of PV have not reached yet. <br><br>Once matured, PV will have a larger EROEI than in this study for several reasons: with maturity progress slows down and so does the obsolescence of equipement, lowering this cost factor signifcantly. Also a more mature process will involve less material/energy. Finally, the maturer PV will have larger energy gains in producing electricity for both longevity and effiency. <br><br>Removing obsolescence and just cutting production inputs raises us to EROEIs between 6 and 7. Then taking efficiency and longevity into account gets us to EROEI around 10, which is quite comfortable for a society. <br><br>So the study bascially just shows that PV is a technology to be applied on roofs and not in PV-plants and it shows that PV is not yet matured and has potential to grow. <br><br>And for all doomsters who are still stuck in the 2000s: PV is now cheap and economically viable.<br><br><a href=#c6540365198829616037 title="comment permalink">3/12/14, 11:15 PM</a><br><br>

I think it's the sort of technology that will probably survive the transition and will be viable in the long run, provided that the descent doesn't lead to that technology being lost. IIRC, one of the most interesting submissions to the Krampus challenge was about how silicon could be processed to a high enough purity to be useful in PV applications. To make PV cells, the silicon doesn't need to be as pure as is necessary for semiconductor devices, nor does it need to be doped with rare-earth metals or anything else that's going to be unavailable (or at least unaffordable) in a post-FF world. The efficiency suffers, of course, but the emenergy falls too and the EROEI is likely to be ~5 or so. Given that it's likely to be a substantial net energy producer that can be scaled down, PV is probably more likely to survive in the long run than computer chips are.<br><br>Of course that doesn't lead to a world that's fundamentally different from the ecotechnic societies that you envision. It just adds one more way to gain electricity under good conditions, not some sort of panacea to save modern society from its own contradictions. But it will still be useful to use PV and wind together to generate some electricity as long as either the wind is blowing or the sun is shining, for anywhere that doesn't have enough hydro power available locally.<br><br>The other solar technologies are quite important too, of course. For heating water, it obviously makes more sense to use the sun when available to build a solar thermal water heater, rather than convert to electricity and then back to heat again. And solar concentrators can deliver temperatures that would otherwise requite huge energy input, drive steam engines, and have a variety of other uses under good conditions.<br><br>It seems to me that a variety of renewable energy strategies will be employed by ecotechnic societies to make use of what is available, when and where it can be used. But I wouldn't discount solar PV as a part of this mix, even if the large-scale projects (which miss the point in a number of ways) aren't impressive.<br><br><a href=#c9118082015433710 title="comment permalink">3/13/14, 12:13 AM</a><br><br>

PV (electricity from photovoltaic cells) has raised its head again.<br><br>A month or so ago, I might have mentioned that I have some experience with PV electricity generation on a home scale, being not connected to the electricity grid and also 100% reliant on PV as a source of electrical energy for the entire year. I also happened to mention that during the 3 weeks on either side of the winter solstice (21st June) I'm limited to only 3.5kWh/day.<br><br>In addition to that I also happened to mention that it costs me approximately AU$0.80 per kWh to not be connected to the mains electricity grid. It is uneconomic.<br><br>Maybe, I misremember the reactions of some commenters at the time, but it was generally along the lines of, "gee, that's expensive".<br><br>I can honestly say that PV is not an option to power large scale grids. It will never happen. Yes panels are cheap as they are mass produced in China, but quality controllers, inverters and especially high current copper wire are most certainly not cheap. Often the mounts and cable runs costs almost twice that of the panels.<br><br>Small scale PV is fantastic, but due to intermittency issues it will never scale to meet the expectations of today's society. Think about how you lot would go with that little energy during the very coldest and wettest part of the year. What would you do without?<br><br>Please if you want to quote numbers at me keep them simple and look at only winter months.

Grid connect PV systems require the electricity grid itself including every single component from generators to sub stations to absorb the production from a grid connected PV system.<br><br>In its simplest form, a grid connect system uses the grid as an unlimited battery.<br><br>Gird connect inverters are much cheaper because they provide all the energy generated by the PV to the grid. They cannot balance production and demand like an off grid system has to (which is much more difficult and thus more expensive).<br><br>If the grid goes down then the grid connect systems are useless as they have to switch off.<br><br>Norfolk Island off the coast of Australia popped its small electricity grid a while back because the rooftop PV systems generated more energy than the Islanders used. Not good and an expensive fix.<br><br>I'm aware of some people who are tinkering with their inverters and systems so that they can continue in the event that the grid is disconnected, but this is a very dangerous thing to do for both them and other people if done incorrectly.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c7284042983516446986 title="comment permalink">3/13/14, 4:30 AM</a><br><br>

It seems to me that solar and wind energy are most viable at the local level, meaning primarily the household level. In other words, subsidizing the cost of installing solar panels, solar water heaters, and/or wind generators on America's rooftops would benefit Americans greatly, but wouldn't do much for utilities' bottom lines. Subsidizing your example, the Nevada solar collector, or the giant wind turbine "farms" that are sprouting up all around the Midwest, don't do that much to help individuals or families, but surely benefit the utility companies. It's really tragic that the help that could be provided by reasonable subsidies is thus wasted.<br><br><a href=#c5557458663983461913 title="comment permalink">3/13/14, 5:00 AM</a><br><br>

Although, as you point out, there are no solutions to keeping our existing culture running as is. <br><br>However, for the ecotechnic societies of the future, no one should overlook ethanol's potentials. If you're not mixing it with gasoline, there's no need to take it to 200 proof, which is a huge chunk of why it's energy intensive. Another huge chunk of energy it requires comes from the drying down of the distiller's grain - which would not have to be done on a smaller scale - since this high protein, high fat, high fiber "waste" could be fed straight to animals to supplement their mostly forage-based diet.<br><br>The energy that ethanol does require to produce is simply 200 F heat, which could be acquired from numerous waste wood sources. One certainly doesn't need coal or natural gas to supply that kind of heat. And yes, transforming the BTUs inherent in waste wood to a liquid fuel could be very useful.<br><br>The Japanese Zeros that could outmaneuver and out climb any plane the US had at the beginning of WWII were run on ethanol fuel produced from rice. Ethanol is 105 octane, is suited for efficient, high compression engines, and when run at the proper air-to-fuel ratios, burns much cooler than gas, which means that the energy investment in the engine itself would last for much longer.<br><br>Not to mention that ethanol doesn't have to made from corn. <br><br>Once again, it may not be appropriate for a culture of Suburbs and Mall-Warts.

(Or maybe I should say that the numbers are just different). If (big if) I can grow it,harvest it, and extract the oil myself, and turn it to fuel on site, using my labor and little or no fossil fuel inputs, then the economic viability equation looks quite different than that of a commercial ethanol plant.(In my opinion ethanol plants were always mainly a conduit scheme designed to channel government money into private pockets.)<br><br>The reason I mention this is because I frequently see the kind of misunderstanding taking place that I just read in the prior comments between deedl and JMG.

Energy quality or EROEI is the fundamental driver behind the complex system that is the economy (as it is for any self organized system). The problem is that EROEI analysis from first principles is never going to accurately reflect the live values because its far too complicated to fully account for. Pinku-Sensei is right that ROI reflects EROEI, but what is needed is a systematic means for evaluating it. PhD C.W. Carey in this paper http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/5/4/044006 provides develops means to get an accurate annual proxy on EROEI by normalizing energy costs for a specific energy source over the energy density for the whole economy.<br><br>Bottom line is it seems to work and make very good EROEI predictions. More to the point it predicts concrete price points where we will begin to fall below EROEI thresholds which will trigger economic decline. <br><br>Based on current economic energy intensities we'll crash before oil goes above $105 because that indicates the minimum EROEI in which the oil dependent sectors can be supported on.<br><br>Similarly as we have become more structurally depedendent on natural gas for electrical production we can predict an economic crash there somewhere above $6/mmBTU at current economic energy intensities.<br><br>Anyway we aren't in disagreement about the necessity of energy sources to be economic. I'm just saying i firmly believe that it is energy and energy gradients that are root driving the whole system, its just nearly impossible to calculate it all and that without the full data set the economic metrics are the next best thing.<br><br><a href=#c7321757141857187435 title="comment permalink">3/13/14, 6:58 AM</a><br><br>

I recently ran into a report (IIRC google solve for x) enthusiastic about getting the same energy out as the lasers impinged on the fuel container. Not counting efficiency of lasers (really low), cost of making the lasers, cost of harvesting the energy, harvesting efficiency, projected lower bound cost of building the facility (even though that was far better than e.g. ITER type tech), cost of making the makers of the lasers etc. It is sad that the conventional sources for such "background info" seem to be defunct. <br>Another point is that you might have to expressly label cold fusion vs hot fusion soon, I'm sure the last ARPA-E round also got some of the former as the "excommunication" has been lifted.<br>As depressing as all these failures are, there's a glimmer of hope in the tone of the last Davos, World Economic Forum. Now if someone started to give systems theory lectures in business schools I think a lot of the remaining headwind would die down in the next generation or two. Sad that it looks like "the quarterlies" have already spread to vital organs and we won't have that luxury. <br>As depressing as all this is - there are far more stupid and in some cases bigger projects one could get rid of as well (or before?). <br><br>Here's one:<br>Pin a person to a very ornate (on the inside) but somewhat flimsy garment. This allows him to fly around with godly speed - he only has to watch out that neither he nor his garment get ripped appart by the resulting herculean forces. This garment is used to fly over people that do not like you and conduct a (very short) war dance over them. <br>These unliked people will sit there and grin up from their little nooks and crannies while the garment is burning through (the equivalent of) their year's earnings. And if someone really wants the dude out of the sky he can use lasers, dust, bullets, rockets, etc. to good effect (there's still a soft human tied to this thing). But most of the time people can just use faints, ruses, decoys and wait an hour or so till it used up its 8 tons of magic juices, falls down eventually, or doesn't start again.<br><br>To imagine that this will be an effective way to tackle issues arising with people deprived of US$857 billion (obligatory Eisenhower quote 'Every gun that is made...') is an interesting thought experiment. I would say it ranks one notch below having TSA officers or similar superficially frisking (not) random people. You may achieve something with this, but it is not so much security.<br><br>Here's a very nice big picture overview about (US) spending. I would love to see this assessment again using a tad more holistic accounting methods.<br>https://xkcd.com/980/huge/#x=-10828&amp;y=-1320&amp;z=5<br>Now why did I never get to see something like this in school, and need to refer to a drop-out comic site?<br><br><a href=#c3845149912874717693 title="comment permalink">3/13/14, 8:56 AM</a><br><br>

If I recall his presentation correctly, I think he suggested the potential buyers are few. These would most likely be the big national oil companies: China, Mexico, those from UAE, etc. i.e. the ones with deeper pockets for the necessary capital investment who don't need to show a profit every quarter. Again, if I recall correctly, Shell is selling to be able to give dividends. Its never a good sign to sell your assets to show a profit.<br><br>Nothing above contradicts your essay. My point is that if we follow this possibility to its logical conclusion, we should see the end game of the oil industry dominated by a few big nationally owned companies with the former public companies bought up or nationalized (likely after or during massive bailouts). These nationally owned companies would only be able to operate with state assistance. At about that point, the oil industry itself would then become a subsidy dumpster.

My conclusion was that on an annual basis, the price of oil times volume traded should not rise much above a certain percentage of global GDP. Certainly there is a limit, whatever it is, as the oil trade can only be some fraction of overall global GDP. My attempts were amateurish. I readily admit that so is what follows. <br><br>If the money spent on oil is too high a proportion of global GDP, the global economy stalls. A stalling global economy means a sharp drop in the demand for oil and so a sharp drop in its price. Oil price should then climb again as demand picks up due to low oil price. Due to supply shortages, the price should again spike. Rinse and repeat. The price of whale oil as this resource hit peak production may be instructive. If I recall correctly (from an Oil Drum article years ago), the price after the production peak became somewhat sinusoidal at decreasing frequency trending upwards until it finally became indeterminate i.e. when you couldn't buy it at any price because production was so low.<br><br>In the case of rock oil, each price spike wreaks havoc on the global financial/economic/political system. There are only so many bumps on the head it can take. Given the financial, economic, and political damage the first bump did, my guess is the system can withstand maybe three, perhaps four, bumps tops. Then what? Well I suppose it ceases to be. This is not to suggest there will be no financial/economic/political systems afterward. Nor is to suggest oil will not be traded after the third bump. What I'm suggesting is that a largely global economy will cease to exist. “Cease to be” in this context means a drastic drop in global international trade. I haven't quantified “drastic” of course. Not doing so gives me wiggle room :-). Just guesses of course; but in the absence of a more rigorous analysis, these guesses may be useful in determining an order of magnitude of the speed of collapse as follows: <br><br>Take the period between the last oil price peak (2008) and what might be assumed to be the next (say 2016) and multiply by 3 (for 3 peaks ). This gives 24 years from 2008, or 2032. That should give a very rough idea of the terminal date of the global economy. Maybe its 48 years, maybe 12 years, from 2008. Maybe, but probably not. Of course there is no such thing as “the terminal date of the global economy” as decline is a process not a fixed date. I am well aware of your contempt for apocalyptic dates. What I'm suggesting is one sharp step down at about 18 years out give or take a wide margin. That step down is just one in a very long staircase. A drastic drop in international trade is only one part of collapse. Why international trade? I'm guessing its the part of the world economy most sensitive to oil price. The thing to watch is the price of oil more than the date.<br><br>So how is any of this useful? Well one would be well advised to switch to more locally produced low tech essential items well before this date. 18 years (or 6 … but not 42) is not so far from the present. So now would be a good time to start. And have I done this myself? Well yes. But again, its a process with no real fixed end date save my own personal terminal date whenever that may be.<br><br><br><a href=#c2713135347306889105 title="comment permalink">3/13/14, 11:55 AM</a><br><br>

I work at an automobile association (yes, I know it's crazy); soon after I started working there - this was some years before the financial crisis - an informal "meet the CEO" session was organized for us new employees. I asked him what he thought about the future of the automobile, given that petroleum was a finite resource. He agreed that petroleum was certainly finite and started to talk about several technologies en vogue at the time (electric cars, hydrogen, ethanol, you name it). However, these technologies had to become as cheap and comfortable as petroleum in order to be adopted widely, and he stated that for various reasons (difficulty to store and process hydrogen, problems with battery capacity/wear etc.) this would never happen. I agreed and asked him if he thought automobiles would therefore slowly disappear during the next decades as petroleum reserves dwindled with no equal replacement in sight. He became very uneasy, mumbled something about possible new petroleum discoveries and quickly changed the subject.<br><br>I learned something important from that conversation: When people are in denial about something, be it climate change, substance abuse or peak oil, sincere disbelief is rarely the true reason. The true reason is that there's no solution that preserves the status quo. Deniers know this, but they can't admit it. Consequently denial is the only way to save face, at least for a time.<br><br><a href=#c266317637121963714 title="comment permalink">3/13/14, 1:57 PM</a><br><br>

It is both insiteful and intellectually stimulating thank you. @ Juahna, I just had to comment to your post. While your right about the hypocracy of the so called "liberal" american middle class, and their hatred toward poor rural whites. I would like to point out that there is plenty of that same hypocracy on the other side of the debate as well. A quick google search will show you any number of "conservative" rants againsts poor urban blacks and other minorities and how theyre responsible for all this countries problems too. The truth is both poor rural american whites and poor urban american minorities have MUCH more in common poliyically, economically, spiritually and in general than our politicians and the media would have us believe. The fact is Republicans can secure the rural whie vote by waving the "scary uban minorities" in their faces. And Democrates can secure the urban black and minority vote by playing the "scary rural whites card". I believe JMG said something to that effective before. Being biracial and the product of a poor rural white american mother and a poor black american father, i may have a uniqe perspective. Theyre families were suprised to say the least at just how much they actually had in common, alot. Of course they met in the military, wich despite what the media may tell you, probably has less race and class issues than main stream america does. Again im not trying to deny what you said or insault you in any way, just wanted to point out that situation is a bit more complicated.than all that.

My friends seemed to be of the opinion that the only reason why this deal hadn't gone through was the extreme shortsightedness of the politicians. When I mentioned various possible problems with the plan I was informed that all such problems were non issues. At the end they were pumping in fresh water from desalination plants to wash PV cells which had a special dust repelling coating, while stealth bombers patrolled along the HVDC cable to make certain terrorists don't blow it up.<br><br>It occurs to me that the inability to think in whole systems which you discuss is related to the rise of rationalism. One of the weaknesses of applying logical reasoning to any given problem, is that it becomes exponential harder the more variables which are involved. This is generally overcome by finding smaller pieces of the problem which are either independent, or largely independent from one another, and then reasoning about those. This is obviously impossible to do in a system where everything in that system has interdependencies with everything else. Thus I wonder whether the inability to think in terms of whole systems is a case of "if all you've got is the hammer of reason every problem must be broken up into it's reductionist parts and reasoned about individually".<br><br><a href=#c4732113635937034717 title="comment permalink">3/13/14, 6:21 PM</a><br><br>

Its a little oasis of smart in a giant field of dumb.<br><br>A great deal of time is spent here and elsewhere discussing what a future will look like as the products of industrialism become scarcer due to the reality of a lower energy future. <br><br>When you actually try to disembed yourself from the products of industrialism, however, you find that a great many life supporting systems have been woven into the fabric of our industrial lives without our even knowing it. Further, the knowhow to replace industrial supports is in most cases lost or incomplete. We tend to focus on the biggies- energy, communication, transport, etc. But there are a vast array of supports that industrialism supplies for us that were incorporated precisely because people suffered so terribly as their lives transitioned away from traditional ones to industrial.<br><br>A great example is iodine consumption. We take it for granted because industrialism has long provided a solution to the problem that an industrial diet is bereft of this nutrient - iodized salt. As with most industrial fixes, this isnt the best way to get iodine. The best way is through the consunption of sea vegetables, as would have been a traditional method. In this case, if you lived inland in a preindustrial society, trade routes for such a priduct would have been very important.<br><br>And iodine is just a small, easily digestible example which is well understood. How many essential life functions is industrial life "taking care of" for us that we wouldnt even know to replace? <br><br>A great many preindustrial support systems were traditions people practiced without really knowing why. Its my suspicion that even though I'd like to see the end of doritos as much as the next guy, I really think were less ready than anyone thinks for a postindustrial future.<br><br><a href=#c4641970738282358932 title="comment permalink">3/13/14, 9:36 PM</a><br><br>

I have spent quite a bit of time on a community in the high desert in S. California: lots of sun, so ideal for solar and 3 miles from road and power lines, so grid was never an option. It works fine; it just doesn't work on the scale that mains would. It runs lights, fridge, office &amp; kitchen equipment,washing machine, some power tools. When you are not using something you turn it off, only leave on the lights you are using.

You state that it is impossible for us to sustain our current lifestyles for any real length of time. This is true, but only as long as it's us and not me ("me" being the psycho version of myself).<br><br>There are two ways around those limitations for a time. The first is to impoverish others for my gain. The US has been doing this for a good long while, as you've repeatedly pointed out. But the second is to get rid of the other guy, who in this case is a few billion extra people.<br><br>I'm not saying I think that this will happen, mind you, but only that it's an alternative that must come to mind among some of our grand leaders, many of whom are unburdened by the silly notion of conscience. See, for instance, overthrowing a legitimately-elected government to install one run by neo-nazis, or funneling billions into the hands and guns of al-qaeda. That's just in the last year.<br><br>Your view assumes that we're all in this together. A person with no conscience, a great deal of power, and a number of opportunities to see his guy win out in a zero sum game is a dangerous thing. We may well be seeing the beginning of the new resource wars and the inevitable dissolution of globalism right now. <br><br>When there isn't enough bread for every starving peasant in the line, people don't agree to go with half a loaf. They storm the trucks and beat each other up. Moreover it gives the IDEAL cover for economic crises (our economy would be fine if the dang *insert ethnic slur*s hadn't decided they hate freedom!). I don't like it, but such is the real world. That's a mess even harder to predict, but I think now more than ever it deserves some thoughtful consideration.<br><br>A bomb here, a nuke there, and pretty soon you're talking real surpluses again.<br><br><a href=#c4951888176664019622 title="comment permalink">3/13/14, 11:03 PM</a><br><br>

Solar gets into this territory in a more complex way.<br><br>The second larger however is that these subsidy dumps, along with their close cousin the speculative financial bubble, have on major occasions succeeded in funding an uneconomic technology on the front end. Granted the investors get burned, but the public gets to use the infrastructure after it is built. Railroads are a classic example, the cabling for broad band internet (telecom bubble) a more recent one, and as Warren Buffet has noted, he doubts there has been any net positive investment results within the airline industry over its short life.<br><br>So there is the chance that a viable, but overly expensive technology (fission, solar w batteries, worm holes, what ever) could get the funding it needs. The key is that the assets have an after-life after the funding rush tapers off, and that it actually work. It is hard to remember all the overfunded bombs, but I am sure they greatly outnumber the successes.<br><br><a href=#c7554884104347235554 title="comment permalink">3/14/14, 2:31 AM</a><br><br>

However, I take issue with regards to your contrasting ethanol production with fusion. <br><br>The technology that is used, currently, to produce ethanol from corn is thermodynamically infeasible - higher energy inputs than the stored energy in the ethanol (net energy loss). This is a matter of nature being the arbitrator of what is <i>possible</i>. <br><br>With regards to nuclear fusion, if the technology <i>does</i> succeed in net energy production, to me, that is a game changer! The "Laws of Economics" are nothing more than human abstractions that we can change at any time. Basically, it is a voting mechanism humanity has produced to divide the raw materials and finished goods that are produced - it has nothing to do with explicit limits of reality. The real materials and technology (the arrangements of those materials) are expensive because, mainly, a large number of very specialized disciplines are solving extremely complex problems. It may end up being technically impossible, with our current knowledge, but this is a different argument than saying it is not economically possible.<br><br><a href=#c440043950723369656 title="comment permalink">3/14/14, 6:41 AM</a><br><br>

As has been noted before on this blog, the nightmare scenario of Anglo-American strategic planners has been a Eurasian heartland dominated by hostile rising powers in alliance against the Western powers. The struggles of the Western powers against Germany and Russia in the 20th century were motivated in large part by a desire to prevent that from happening, and the same logic applies in American attempts to “contain” China, including Obama’s “Pivot to Asia”. The TPP likewise is an attempt by the US political establishment to create an anti-Chinese economic bloc in the Pacific Rim as a counterweight to the growing might of the PRC (following the dubious example of Obamacare, it also has a lot of corrupt giveaways for special interests like Hollywood, the recording industry, Monsanto and Big Pharma). Thanks to the folly of the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations, the nightmare scenario that kept earlier generations of British and American statesmen up late at night is well on its way to becoming a reality.<br><br>(Contd below)<br><br><a href=#c7541086069822829900 title="comment permalink">3/14/14, 7:05 PM</a><br><br>

Experts say it would take at least 2-4 years for the necessary terminals and other infrastructure to be built. Moreover, as was pointed out in this week’s post, there is every indication that the oil and natural gas bubble made possible by fracking is at its apogee and the downturn will likely be swift and hard. Those terminals should be completed right around the same time the big downtown in North American gas production gathers momentum. Personally, I doubt these half-baked proposals will go anywhere or that the terminals will ever be completed even if they are started. Not only that, but the US is still a net importer of natural gas and in spite of all the rhetoric about “energy independence” due to fracking, the US still imports more than half of the oil it consumes. The rhetoric from American politicians about using American natural gas exports as an energy weapon to undermine Russia shows just how deluded and out of touch with reality the American political class really is as the crocodiles close in. <br><br>All hail Sebek!<br><br><a href=#c1232606439362781614 title="comment permalink">3/14/14, 7:07 PM</a><br><br>

Carrying on from my comment last week about what technologies are viable in the future I want to throw in my two cents.<br><br>Mass production is the first thing I consider when thinking about how our technologies would have to adapt to stay viable as their environment changes. Current solar voltaic cells, at least the ones being lauded as 'cheap' coming from huge factories, are manufactured in a system which is completely dependent on mass production to maintain costs. I wonder, how small of an economy can possibly manufacture photo-voltaic cells? Perhaps a modest city state could, if its technological character is appropriate, support a tool set which would make the manufacture of silicon crystals possible? The process to make the crystals is 19th century, primarily needing extreme heat in a controlled space, burning hydrogen was the technique used; and a supply of clean base mineral.<br><br>Without mass production, or a large trade network, even if solar cells are made, how many could be made would? With out mass production it is more costly to get the tools, and the types of production likely to be able to endure are much smaller.<br><br>So you're a Cell-wright living in the future. Can you find the materials and tools you need on the market? At what scale? How does this limit your production? Who is interested in doing business with you? Are they rich? Do you have a, perhaps tiny, product the middle or lower classes might be willing to pay for? Is there something your product make possible that people value?<br><br>In the near future, tools and materials on a small scale might be at the market place as their former owner have liquidated, but how reliably? And can you afford one of the power sources available at the time? Could a work site power itself?<br><br>I don't have very good answers to such musings. But I think photo-voltaic best shot would not be in providing power for most of the things we do with electricity, it would be out competed in most situations, perhaps could focus on low wattage tasks which can only be done with electricity, especially ones that can operate independently or and sporadically. Out side of those niches I think that other energy sources, for example solar-thermal, bio-mass, and elbow grease, would out compete it, or demand would be too low to justify the expenditure on an additional energy source on the market.<br><br>Then again maybe some solar powered dumpsters can find some sustainable mass hysteria to live off of for a thousand years.<br><br><a href=#c2383548046079727383 title="comment permalink">3/14/14, 7:55 PM</a><br><br>

Because the relationship to time would be drastically different... The world of solar harvesting could be elegant but also very slow, and I suspect that fo rpeople living in that hypothetical society, time would have a different texture. Certainly more dilatated than in our own lifestyles which revolve around the idea of fast speed.<br><br><br>Anything that was done prior to petroleum and in the future post petroleum as well, takes time. If you live off the garden you plant or work with livestock, as in my case with occasionally training a horse, you'll realize that. You can't force a horse to accept anything until they understand thoroughly. If you DO try to rush it you pay for it with even more time getting them to understand and accept such an alien situation for the horse. It all depends on the individual horse which is what makes training a horse both fun and sometimes frustrating. It takes as much time as the horse needs to understand, just like it takes time for YOU to understand why you must do certain things in a timely manner to make a vegetable garden happy and productive.<br><br>Actually, what do you mean by sophistication? Many American Indian Tribes were very sophisticated socially and were still basically in the stone age when their/(our) lands were invaded and usurped. Oratory was highly valued in many tribes, isn't that a talent many European Peoples credited themselves with? Or are you equating sophistication with knowledge or a 'high' technology? Surviving sustainably within the environment requires a sophisticated working knowledge OF that environment.<br><br>Personally, I would love a world slowed down that way. Time to look at the changing sky, feel the wind caressing my face, the demanding heat of the sun prickling my skin, view the lives of the wild animals around me in their seasonal rhythms and even stop and play with my silly goats or watch my horses play or graze as the mood takes them. Maybe take a long ride over trails I haven't seen before to find berry vines, wild fruiting trees or even wild herbs to harvest.

Yet, I find working towards this end skillfully is wrought with peril... <br><br>I find myself imagining two groups of privileged suburbanites...

Meanwhile, the second group sets out to grow a garden of chardonnay grapes, arugula, and Escargot, which begins to make them producers in the economy instead of consumers, thereby reducing their reinforcement of the negative impact of a colonial food system abroad and an unfair migrant worker system at home. It begins to undermine a food distribution system predicated on restricted access (the market) and frees up production capacity for less powerful communities to access... <br><br>I don't mean to imply that we shouldn't try to work towards justice... just that doing so skillfully is something I'm currently struggling with, and I'd appreciate your thoughts on it.<br><br><a href=#c2730840965673496273 title="comment permalink">3/15/14, 8:43 AM</a><br><br>

"Green energy" sounds good if you say it fast. Wind turbines run into walls of opposition from people in whose backyards they are being built. <br><br>The government ends up looking highly attentive to the wind power lobby, that is, ideologically motivated urbanites who will never have wind farms in their communities. Not to mention monied interests who stand to gain from wind turbine construction. <br><br>And, on the other hand, they look highly disdainful of the interests of communities that bear the brunt of wind turbine construction. That is, those hicks out in the sticks who, in the opinion of highly self regarding urbanites, just don't "get it".<br><br>Never mind the politics. These are old stories. The most important thing to "get" is that, in Ontario, wind power is not do-able from an economic stand-point. At least, not the way it's being done.<br><br>In Ontario, wind power needs complicated and expensive integration with back-up capacity from conventional (ie natural gas) power sources.<br><br>This, naturally, is because wind doesn't blow on demand producing power when needed. Especially, in Ontario where, according to what I've read, wind does the opposite, it doesn't stop blowing when you don't need it. So, most inconveniently, wind produces 80% of its power when nobody wants it. <br><br>Most comically, it doesn't displace conventional and relatively dirty sources of energy which are there as back-up to ensure the continuity of supply. And, most un-comically, it requires the sale to the state of New York of excess power produced at the wrong time and at a large financial loss to Ontario.<br><br>While this may be good for the citizens of New York, it is not so good for the people of Ontario that end up footing the bill for this silliness. <br><br>No matter, the govt plan now is to triple the number of wind turbines. <br><br><br><a href=#c4466906812246329285 title="comment permalink">3/15/14, 10:04 AM</a><br><br>

I thought the cracks would barely show in my lifetime. Oops.<br><br>An interesting cultural experience is the BBC doco team's recent series, "Human Planet". In it they do a Nat Geo type of travelogue, visiting human communities who live a lot closer to subsistence than city folks. There's a curious mixed message in the series (I'm only 5/8 through it); on the one hand there's the familiar theme of "look how hard and depressing life is w/o industrial technology," yet on the other hand there's a wistfulness coming from the narration and from some of the interviewees, for lifeways now lost to them/us.<br><br>One interviewee refers to some remote tribespeople (as yet un-contacted by Western Civ) in the Brazilian rainforest as "the last free people on Earth." So, on the one hand the narration dwells on the challenges of wresting a bare subsistence from often-marginal environments, and on the other hand it acknowledges the enslavement of modern people to the calendar, the clock, and the machine. Definitions of "freedom" are in tension.<br><br>Admiration and wonder are also expressed by the Anglo film crew for the sheer competence of various indigenous people in their home environment -- their ability to build shelter, find food, move freely through difficult terrain. The Westerners certainly look clumsy and over-equipped by comparison.<br><br>The series ends up sending a very mixed message -- part late-industrial triumphal smugness (look at what a hard life you've been spared thanks to the wonders of cheap oil and technocracy), and part insecurity and uncertainty about our core values (maybe these people are smarter and better fitted to survive than we are, yikes).<br><br>That message would not have been mixed in the 1950's or 1960's. It would have been purely triumphalist cock-a-doodling.

I've noticed consistently that the people who think it's possible to maintain a modern industrial lifestyle on renewable energy aren't living on renewable energy.

Other than that, no argument. <br><br>M, "subsidy suck" has a certain alliterative charm, but I;'m sticking with my original. <br><br>Tubaplayer, by all means!<br><br>Chris, small-scale ethanol might be an option, or it might not, depending -- ahem -- on issues of economic viability. I notice with some amusement that, responding to a post that talked at such length about the way people avoided the issue of economic viability, you still avoided the issue of economic viability. <br><br>Donal, "subsidy leeches" also has a certain charm. <br><br>Eddie, that's a valid point. If you have the surplus necessary to produce something that will be a modest energy sink, and there are other good reasons to do so, that might well be a valid point. On the other hand, if you were a subsistence farmer living on the edge of starvation, and somebody claimed that you ought to turn a third off your grain crop into ethanol, your ability to follow that advice for more than a single season might be very limited.<br><br><a href=#c3391898271758775704 title="comment permalink">3/15/14, 7:30 PM</a><br><br>

Of course EROEI has an effect, and a massive one. What makes it tricky is that the effect is easy to mistake for the result of other factors, because it shows up via other effects, such as financial profitability. There isn't a big red EROEI alarm that suddenly starts letting off klaxon whoops! Instead, you just can't make money, and only if you run the numbers on energy in vs. energy out will you realize that this is happening because your EROEI is too low. <br><br>Ljosalfr, by all means!<br><br>Eduard, very funny.

There are a lot of folks who talk out of both sides of their mouths. I attended a few meetings of the local Sierra Club to offer advice on renewable energy, but no takers. I wrote the state chapter of the same group to suggest a survey of its members on usage of renewable energy but no reply. I then wrote the home office in San Francisco with similar verbiage - still nothing. <br>We're in our mid-eighties and decided when we retired 20+ yrs ago to stay in place with a too-big all-electric home in a nice area. We began to weatherstrip the house and power it with renewable energy. We've had a solar hot water system for 25 years and the rooftop solar for 10. We installed a ground-source heat pump in 2006 and replaced the windows that same year. We have triple cellular shades on all the windows and a special film on the inside window panes to block the UV rays in the summer. This past year we installed a 5kw PV system on the back lawn. We have yet to scrape all of the snow off those panels. Our 35+ year database of electrical usage indicates that the past 10 years our net average annual usage has declined 2/3rds from the annual average that existed prior to the inception of this renewable energy venture. What is quite evident is that even with 16+kw of installed PV there is insufficient energy to power the heating unit, etc. The idea that we could sufficiently run the household off the grid is goofy. Some idiots have even proposed electric cars charged at your work that would power the grid at night. (How would one get to work the next day?) None of this could have been done without cheap energy; making, delivering and installing the products. Fortunately the warranty date will probably outlast us. When we moved here in 1975 we planted trees and now we are harvesting some for firewood. Our neighbors said we were crazy. Some of them snickered when we put on the rooftop solar, yet we now have two more solar installations on our road and another three or four in the neighborhood. The good news is that all of this has paid for itself and the annual return on equity is 6% over the years since the hot water solar. <br>Although I have some slight disagreement with some of your thoughts I think you have good insights based on historical precedents.

I'm actually a fan of those who are building Farnsworth fusors in their basements -- I think they're barking up the wrong stump, but they're actually <i>doing something</i> about their beliefs, which is much more than one can say for most cornucopians. <br><br>Renaissance. "money pit" will also do, but I thought a more focused neologism might be useful. As for the broader point, exactly. <br><br>Jcummings, remember that we're not talking about the industrial system coming to a sudden stop at some point in the future. We are already in the Long Descent, which should give you some time either to figure out a source of seaweed or to check your own soil for adequate iodine content -- most soils have enough so that vegetables grown in them have adequate amounts. <br><br>Steve, exactly. Now factor in the fossil fuel inputs that are used to manufacture and install those panels and the rest of the system, and figure out just how demanding it would be to replace all those inputs with renewable equivalents; that's why I'm far from sure the PV fans are right to say that continued manufacture of PV systems will be economically viable straight through the Long Descent. <br><br>Derv, remember that population is a dependent variable of things like food supply. I don't see any need for nukes; all that's necessary is that the price of food keep moving raggedly upwards while the supply of jobs moves raggedly down, and you have the kind of steady population contraction found in most of the former Soviet Union, where current trends will halve population levels by 2100. I'd be amazed if people in the corridors of power in most industrial nations aren't quietly counting on that to take some of the pressure off. <br><br>Neo, I think it's more complex than that. By "subsidy" I mean specifically the diversion of funds by the government on a basis that has nothing to do either with financialization or any other economic value, but is straightforwardly political. When subsidies are used intelligently, they give an industry the boost it needs to get going, and then the subsidies stop and the industry becomes self-supporting. Otherwise, you've got a subsidy dumpster. <br><br>Anselmo, good! I'd add a good book on cognitive dissonance to Le Bon's book, too. <br><br>Russell, I'm actually hoping that we get a rush to PV as a subsidy dumpster; after the bubble has popped, there will be huge numbers of PV panels for sale dirt cheap, and a lot of green wizards can then swoop on them and set themselves up with off-grid home PV systems. That is to say, on occasion, you can be right -- though I can't think of much that could be done with the wreckage of ITER once that crashes and burns. <br><br>Tim, yes, I saw that. The results could be very interesting, in the apocryphally Chinese sense. <br><br>Dot, no, there you're wrong. The laws of economics are not merely human abstractions; they're whole systems properties of all economic systems, reflecting hard limits of energy and resource supplies. The fact that a fusion reactor might be able to produce plenty of electricity does not guarantee that the electricity can be produced at a price anybody can afford, and ignoring that reality is one of the things that's got us wedged into the present mess. <br><br>Phitio, that's certainly my impression. To get sustained nuclear fusion, you need a compressive force that isn't susceptible to distortion by electromagnetic fields -- plasmas are wickedly prone to twist lines of magnetic force, and the higher the pressure and heat, the more enthusiastically they do so. We know how many fundamental forces there are in the physical universe; only one of them -- gravity -- has the necessary properties, and it won't do the job on any scale smaller than a star. If someone wants to prove me wrong, I look forward to the working model.<br><br><a href=#c8965995698511886820 title="comment permalink">3/16/14, 6:30 AM</a><br><br>

You'd need fission, not fusion, to turn lead into gold. On the other hand, fusion might succeed in turning gold into lead -- and that would certainly explain the cost overruns at ITER! ;-)<br><br>RJ, remember that all this stuff was studied intensively in the 1970s. Those of us who didn't mortgage our brains in the boomtimes of the '80s and '90s reread <i>The Limits to Growth</i> and the collected works of E.F. Schumacher, and wondered whether anybody would get a clue in time. As for population, well, people have been beating that drum for a long time, without any noticeable effect; I think we'll probably have to wait for collapsing public health and food shortages to do the job. <br><br>Josh, the difference is return on investment. Light sweet crude from a shallow well had a net energy payoff on the order of 200 to 1, and so the very modest investment needed to drill the well was very quickly overwhelmed by the torrent of wealth to be had by selling the oil. With fusion, you've got colossal investment to produce a modest amount of electricity -- say, as much as a current fission plant, but for 20 or 50 times the price. It;'s not a windfall if you have to pay that much for it -- and only a refusal to deal with economic viability makes it look like one. <br><br>Myriad, you may be right! Still, it's worth the try. <br><br>Enrique, I'm using details from the Ukraine crisis to fill out my description of the Tanzanian crisis in the novel based on my scenario -- it's very much along the same lines, though not far enough from the other side's borders to make a good proxy war. <br><br>Ray, <b>Thank. You. For. Getting.

I consciously avoided it for many reasons, although I do agree with you that it is a crucial issue. In a nutshell, though, I avoided it because I feel you approach economic viability in a rather, excuse me for saying so, un-holistic fashion - despite the fact that I find you to be one of the most holistic thinkers I have read. And it was hard for me to explain why in a concise way. <br><br>But I will give it a try here - toward the end of your comments. I'll start with my smaller point. <br><br>1) Decades ago, most economists wrote off the sustainable/ local/ organic food movement. It was easy to write off because it was not economically viable. There was no way for SLOw food to compete with the cheap food of the industrial Ag system. Despite being uncompetitive, it has grown tremendously. I'll return to this point after the second.<br><br>2) I agree with you wholeheartedly that there will soon be another drop to another plateau along our long descent - that will likely leave oil prices stabilized for a while around $175 as you guess, and that of course, natural gas prices will be dramatically higher as well in the after-bust of the fracking boom.<br><br>It seems that as you stress the importance of economic viability in your article, you simultaneously stress how the economics are going to soon change as well.<br><br>I am simply trying to connect the dots and see therefore that the economic viability of any project in question is not a fixed status, but is going to change as well along with the changing economy - a changing economy that affects not only commodity prices, but joblessness numbers as well. <br><br>3) Juxtapose points one and two. Looking at point one alone, one could say that despite the SLOw food movement being the fastest growing sector of the food industry today, that it is still small potatoes relative to conventional Ag. <br><br>But juxtaposing it with point two, we can begin to see that anybody who owns cleared land in a relatively moist climate in the US will clearly want to use some waste-wood from a local sawmill to distill a batch of ethanol twice a week, and feed the wet distiller's grain to their dairy cows throughout the week as they come in from their pastures for milking twice a day.<br><br>Sure, this didn't catch on in the early 1980s as the North Slope, the North Sea, and the Bush family connections to the Saudi royal family brought oil prices down to the $20s, and there was an economy with jobs and benefits to be had.<br>But it's already a different world than the 80s. And as you well know, in another ten years, it will be even more so. <br><br>Things that were pie-in-the-sky in the early 80s will be common fare before too long - if we don't distort their potentials in the meantime based on metrics that will be irrelevant in the relatively near future.<br><br>In other words - what is not economically viable now may become economically viable in the not so distant future.<br><br>There is more to say (especially in regards to energy density and societal complexity), but that's it for now. Thanks for writing such an impressive weekly column, and thanks for reading your reader's comments.

Nothing too great, a steady 20-30mph breeze with the occasional 40mph gust. No snow, sleet, or freezing rain, even though all had been predicted. Just wind. And still, our electricity flickered on and off multiple times in the couple of hours before dawn. Then it failed for about an hour. Was restored. Failed again for about another hour. Was restored. Failed yet again for perhaps a half hour. Was restored. All this before noon. It's been on since then and it's early evening by now. But here's my point: I'm old enough to remember back to the 1960s, and I've lived in the US Midwest, land of severe thunderstorms, most of that time. A breeze like today never used to cause electric outages, much less multiple ones throughout a morning. Even severe thunderstorms didn't cause electric outages most of the time! As late as the 1990s electricity just stayed on, no matter what. But since then, a different story. First it was severe thunderstorms that sometimes knocked the electricity out for anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Now, the electricity just seems to go out every so often, for no particular reason, like today. Sure, it's fixed before too long, sometimes just a few minutes, maybe a half hour or so. But how long before it doesn't get fixed for hours? Then for days?

An example:<br>http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Cheapest-Solar-Ever-Austin-Energy-Buys-PV-From-SunEdison-at-5-Cents-Per-Ki<br><br>re: Prieto &amp; Hall (the study of the Spanish PV boom/bust).<br><br>Actually, small systems suffer from dis-economies of scale, and the special circumstances of each roof. Roof mounting (because these are mostly after market system) has to deal with the roof construction type/implementation. Access to the roof is different (some people will have flower beds, some not). Paperwork for a system costs about X $, regardless of the size. Smaller inverters are more costly per watt of capacity. One truck trip for a few kW costs about the same as the same truck hauling 50 kW of modules. Etc, etc, so small scale systems are more expensive on a per-watt-peak basis.<br><br>see "tracking the sun", around figures 7 and 8.<br>http://emp.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/lbnl-6350e.pdf<br><br>I do agree that Prieto &amp; Hall is deeply flawed.<br><br>I have a review at:<br>http://thingsidlikepeopletoknow.blogspot.com/2014/01/review-spains-photovoltaic-revolution.html<br><br>summary:<br>(1) outdated info - PV <b>SYSTEM costs</b> are less than half of what they were, so using their total national energy use/GDP method, EROEI more than doubled. Really?<br>(2) the total national energy use/GDP method is flawed. In 2007, polysilicon prices were stratospheric, (spot above 300$/kg, contract above $100/kg), and most of it was made by established vendors, using about 65 kWh/kg.<br>Now there is essentially no true fix priced contract market, spot is below $20/kg, and the marginal price depressing excess is made by small, inefficient Chinese producers using 80 kWh/kg. By the Prieto &amp; Hall method, EROEI radically improved/increased; in physical reality, it's now slightly worse.<br>(3) the "things other people didn't look at" turn out to consist mainly of the 8% overbuild - which happened no place else, due to the politics of the Spanish leadership.<br>(4) they're full of "we assume…" - sorry, I put more trust in the European life cycle cost people who go to factories, sign NDAs, and actually measure process energy use and material consumption.<br><br>So - you are correct, it's not a truly representative study of the EROEI of PV. Not that the EROEI of PV is anything like the halcyon days of 100:1 crude oil, I think it's between 5 and upwards, not exceeding 10 at the moment. Probably technologically limited to about 15.<br><br><a href=#c9063398780322046137 title="comment permalink">3/16/14, 4:30 PM</a><br><br>

Maybe people are so focused on the payback times and figure they'll move on in a few years, so why bother. Or maybe it's a squick factor of "what's that weird thing on the roof?". Or maybe it's "don't remind me of peak anything".<br><br>The federal 30% residential renewable energy tax credit is good for solar hot water as well as PV, wind, etc.<br>The only "limit" is you must get at least half your hot water from the solar system. No maximum.<br>Most states have some kind of incentives too:<br>http://www.dsireusa.org<br>Get it while the getting is good.<br><br>I do note that only about 18% of US home energy use is water heating:<br>http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/<br>So a lot will have to give in terms of heating efficiency. But super insulated houses can basically finesse the 45% of home energy used for heating - that would be an even better subsidy.<br><br>(2) Spain's "much-lauded" solar program.<br><br>"much-lauded" by whom?<br>Textbook example of how NOT to do it.<br>Stomp on the gas pedal with overly generous subsidies and all kinds of niggly, petty rules (100kW/system limit, etc.). Then slam on the brakes and renege on the deal.<br><br>Germany's Feed In Tariff is much-lauded, because it worked. Simple rules, declining subsidy forces people to get more efficient/economic over time. The boom years are over now, but the industry (at least installers) is in reasonable shape and still substantial sized, though down to only a couple of gigaWatts likely in 2014. Because the FIT for most people is at/below retail electricity rates, which effectively means new PV owners sell excess electricity for less than they have to buy back needed electricity at night. So now they start to work on storage.<br><br>If the coal lobby will let them. The latest political coalition is desperate to save conventional utilities, and extend the subsidies to the coal miners.<br>http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-10-21/when-it-comes-to-government-subsidies-dirty-energy-still-cleans-up<br>They're even proposing charging people for generating their own electricity.<br><br>But as you note, PV subsidies at least get something besides dirty air, black lung invalids, and ruined mountains.<br>Germany has 35 GW of PV installed, 10x Spain, 3x US. They generate 5% total electricity by PV. That's 420 watts per person in Germany, about two solar panels per person.<br><br>Nobody in the PV industry I know ever thought subsides should continue forever. They were always intended to get volumes up so costs could go down, down to grid parity. Then if we can cut subsidies to coal and nuclear it would be fair (fat chance).<br><br>Note that "remote industrial" and "off grid" PV markets have NEVER BEEN subsidized.<br>These are things like cathodic protection of pipelines, remote signal/control powering, navigation aids, roadside call boxes, remote highway signs, and people living "off the grid".<br>These markets were small - about 100 MW, so were too small to get the volumes need to get to grid parity. <br><br>But with the decline of system prices, we start to see larger volumes of <b>un-subsidized on-grid systems</b>. IHS predicts 700 MW in 2014. While a small proportion of the 40 GW or so predicted for 2014, it wasn't so long ago that the entire world-wide PV market was 700 MW, like 2003-2004.<br>http://www.pv-magazine.com/news/details/beitrag/global-pv-installations-to-reach-45-gw-in-2014--say-ihs_100013773<br><br>As far as PV's dependance on petroleum, that's transport, gas fired glass furnaces and polymer based encapsulants. The polymers are an issue, but very small volumes compared to world oil use. Solar/wind/... powered glass furnace anyone? So transport - well, we'll see how things turn out. People in the old West bought glass windows shipped in from the East.

That is why the stuff that most people eat is cheaper than organic. Yields are lower and costs are higher for organic. Only those higher incomes can support that difference. This is an economic issue and can't be dismissed as easily as you've done.<br><br>If you also provide some of your produce to the local wildlife - like I do here - then the costs for the produce are even higher again as the yields are further reduced.<br><br>The basic economic problem is that demand (wants) are unlimited, whereas supply (resources) are limited. It is simply not possible from my experience to feed the current population utilising entirely organic methods. Something has to give.<br><br>Plenty of people tell me that they'd like to eat organic food, but can't afford it as it is a luxury good. The majority of people actually prefer to eat (as just one example) industrially farmed chicken meat rather than a chicken produced on a free range organic farm. Just sayin...<br><br>Hi sunseekernv,<br><br>I have to ask this question form sheer curiosity:<br><br>How do you write those long screeds whilst ignoring the simple fact that Russ Day commented that his very large PV system is currently under snow? Sorry dude, but I just don't get it.<br><br>By the way, it’s maybe just me, but it is worth mentioning that the sun doesn't shine at night.<br><br>Hi Russ Day,<br><br>Sorry to drop you in that one above.<br><br>By the way your comment: "The idea that we could sufficiently run the household off the grid is goofy."<br><br>Perhaps, but it all depends on your location on the planet. The household here in a more sunny locale runs entirely on electricity generated from only a small 3.8kW PV system for the entire year (24/7, 365 days).<br><br>Conservation should be your number one goal if you want to go 100% solar powered. Still, snow doesn't help much and it is not a problem I have to deal with.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c5724571422650101096 title="comment permalink">3/17/14, 3:11 AM</a><br><br>

I see a parallel for this in the current spate of Western Hysteria and Double Standards in regards to Ukraine, where a Western backed Coup D'Etat has overthrown a legitimately elected (albeit corrupt and incompetent) Government and replaced it with a cabal of US/EU Stooges and violent Neo-Nazis. <br><br>This new "Interim" government the Western Powers and Media insist, is "Legitimate" but a referendum held under International Election Observation in the Crimea is strangely "Illegitimate". <br><br>The public however, are not buying the hype. People I talk to are seeing the hypocrisy and double standards for what they are. It is plainly obvious to anyone paying attention that if the US favoured such a referendum it would be declared "Legitimate" and the only reason they didn't is because they knew they would not get the desired result, laying bare their real opinions about "Democracy".<br><br>Likewise, the shouting and handwaving about Russian "Aggression" in the aftermath of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen etc is also blatantly hypocritical and it insults the publics intelligence to act as though they wouldn't notice, but that is what the Western political system seems to be attempting. <br><br>I see a similar reaction from the public beginning to occur in relation to Government promises on the Economy, of which claims surrounding Hydro-Fracking are a major part. Nobody believes the hype anymore. Or if they do, they're kind of thinking, "if I'm being lied to this time...".

One example that does follow what I would prescribe, more or less, is France.

This means that the results post-Peak Oil, Peak resources and Climate Chaos will vary considerably - since the preparations and responses will vary considerably. I do not expect the uniformity that you apparently do.<br><br>I am inferring that you think that effective mitigation is not technically possible, so the results will be more or less uniform. Perhaps an inaccurate assessment.<br><br>On a related note, you claimed that nuclear power has been a failure everywhere.

Yes, that's one way Polybius' cycle can certainly work out. <br><br>Nathaniel, this is why an introduction to the basics of thermodynamics ought to be an essential part of everyone's education. Of course zero point energy exists, but because it's at the zero point, it can do no useful work. Work can only be done by taking energy that is above the zero point and letting it move closer to zero. Thus it's utterly irrelevant to the future of any human society -- especially one that relies on energy at levels of concentration and intensity very, very far from zero. <br><br>Russ, excellent. You're walking your talk; any disagreements of detail we may have are irrelevant compared to that point. <br><br>Chris, as usual, you're completely neglecting the issue of the limits to available real wealth. Sure, some grain can be turned into ethanol; if so, that grain cannot be used to feed people or draft animals. You only have so much grain per year. What is the most economical use for that grain? It probably won't be fuel for engines, because engines require the infrastructure needed to manufacture and maintain them and the things they drive. Human and animal muscle requires much less infrastructure, thus in an environment of pervasive poverty and hard systems limits, are more economical. BTW, the slow food movement is hardly the example you want, as it's a status symbol of the privileged middle classes, who like to buy things that cost a lot to show how much better off they are than the poor; as the limits to available real wealth clamp down, the market for luxury items of that sort will go away. <br><br>SLClaire, exactly. Welcome to the Long Descent. <br><br>Matt, no, that's simply not true. The mere fact that a technology is technically feasible does <i>not</i> mean that it will be economically viable. If there are other ways to do the same tasks that cost less, all things considered, those other ways will be embraced and the technology will be abandoned. It amazes me that so many intelligent people simply can't grasp that the mere fact that a machine is possible to build and run does not mean that anyone can afford to do so, or that it will necessarily outcompete all the other options!<br><br><a href=#c2835105154512067567 title="comment permalink">3/17/14, 7:00 AM</a><br><br>

One reason was I was not brilliant enough to make a breakthrough.

As a result, they ensure that they cannot even become aware that there is a problem, until the problem consumes the non-elite (working) class on which the elites depend. Once the working class collapses or (in the most extreme cases) dies off, the elites are left to starve as they complain that "you can't get good help these days." <br><br>The second is that the argument that we won't have shortages in the future because our technological processes keep getting more "efficient," apart from being thermodynamically absurd, is also just a matter of clueless mis-observation. Our industrial processes are demonstrably more efficient than lower-tech processes, but because of the <i>efficiency of scale</i>. That is, it is more efficient <i>per unit</i> because we are making <i>more</i> of them per unit of industrial overhead, and consequently using <i>more</i> resources, not less. The overall process does not conserve scarce resources at all -- it actually uses more resources than any lower-tech process.<br><br>Neither takeaway should be surprising to anyone who has been reading your column for long.<br><br>This does provide some support for the idea of reducing the wealth-gap significantly as a means to soften the rate of decline. Within the US, of course, this means (probably) maximum wage limits and taxing the uber-wealthy back to the stone age, perhaps even outright confiscation of property, as when FDR recalled all the gold, or when the Colombian government took the <i>latifundio</i> from some of the biggest landowners and parceled it out. Where the tax money goes isn't that important; dump it into subsidy tombs. Build gold-plated stone monuments to the egos of the uber-wealthy you've offended. What matters is bursting the reality-distortion bubble. But half-measures won't do -- you have to get the movers and shakers back to working for a living, like everyone else, or all you've done is anger them and set them to plotting revenge.<br><br>The US itself, of course, is the elite of the world, and we would need to do much the same on a global level. But that would require a World Government with some kind of redistributory authority that would raise the rest of the world at the expense of the US, Germany, etc., which isn't going to happen. Even if you could get a super-government together (e.g. the EU), they invariably exist to pump air into the reality-bubble rather than to deflate it. And we have the basic problem of seven billion people, which spells a very low average quality of life for each person.<br><br>My impression is that the global economy needs to simply end, which could be done by those old-fashioned things called tariffs, or even (as in Shogunate Japan, or post-Ming China) closing the borders.<br><br>That all sounds a lot like what the various Communist governments have tried to do, and we see how well that worked out. The descendants of the wealthy of the 1930's are still spitting the initials FDR and trying to bring down Social Security, and I believe the Colombian land breakup is what created the FARC (?). <br><br>I think we're just going to go down the traditional way.<br><br><a href=#c7622066424172840370 title="comment permalink">3/17/14, 8:51 AM</a><br><br>

I understand perfectly the issue of cheaper competitive technics. <br><br>This is why I wrote IF they can be built and maintained in sufficient numbers. How can this be done if it is not affordable to do so? Affordability is assumed in my statement. Just as unaffordability is assumed by the conditional "if".<br><br>Also, the mention of luxury and specialty markets addressed the issue of cheaper competition. <br><br>There was a time when electric lighting was expensive and kerosene lighting was inexpensive and tallow candles were dirt cheap. What happened then? Did tallow candles monopolize lighting? Did electric bulbs do the same? Or kerosene lamps?<br><br>No, of course not. The notion that a product must either outcompete every alternative in every market niche or not exist is utterly mistaken.<br><br>So what happened with lighting is that the wealthy had electric lights, the masses in the middle had kerosene (or town gas) and outside of public or private spaces not theirs that had one of the above, the underclass had candles (or limited kerosene, etc.). <br><br>Now, why would the wealthy or institutions who could afford its high cost due to technical and material limitations pay for electric lighting? Were they perhaps just being trendy? Maybe they were just silly tech geeks ignoring sense?<br><br> No.<br><br>They paid for electric lighting because of that technic's PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGES : clean, quiet, odorless, steady light, safety, etc.<br><br>Which brings me back to my point.<br><br>If combustion engines can be made affordable for even a specialty market (like say, propulsion for military ships, even backup) then they will find a niche because of their performance advantages over cheaper alternatives. Because there are quite simply some tasks that combustion engines can perform that cheaper alternatives - or any alternatives - cannot feasibly do. <br><br>So, if there is desire enough for some such work and the engines can be made suitably affordable, there will be a market for engines. If this happens, there will be a market for alcohol fuels. If this happens, the products or byproducts of alcohol fuels will also have market potential.<br><br>If not, as I wrote before, the stills make only booze (and medicinal alcohol).<br><br><a href=#c2732848284594240344 title="comment permalink">3/17/14, 11:01 AM</a><br><br>

My gut feeling was that it sounded quite sensible as rules of thumb.<br><br>There's a couple of other aspects that deserve some consideration though:<br>If you imagine a "tech tree" similar to how e.g. the civilization computer games use it, just a lot more complex - and then start kicking out a few techs (or products) more or less at random (e.g. like http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/business/global/07iht-floods07.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) most techs that are based on this (or include it in the Bill of Materials) get nixed as well after a couple of decades - if no one wants to volunteer the up front cost in face of the perceived risks. I imagine JMG's early steps down will coincide with ripples product of extinctions.<br>If you want money to develop tech I would assume the risks are then perceived about a magnitude higher than say a decade ago. That is to say capital will be extra tight.<br>Techs that have more than one use or better access to markets of course have much better chances of scraping capital together from (potential) customers and suppliers. They'll need it, as I would imagine that up front costs also get doubled or so to reduce risk of failure to a large degree. Of course technologies that can adapt/have long half life equipment/good skill base have better chances to ride out disruptions without having to be revived from scratch.<br>I assume there are going to be many mutually exclusive "right answers" as much of this tech tree is based on self fulfilling (or not) prophecies.<br><br>This leads me to add other potential aspects to Ray's list:<br><br>Non-perishable high value goods with small mass and/or volume may also have some chance to survive for a while. <br>Especially if you need mass production you could nicely keep a worldwide "last man standing monopoly" (ie consolidation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_hard_disk_manufacturers 200-&gt;3-&gt;1?), of course only if there is sufficient willingness and capability to pay in the market. If that market is only 1E9 people of whom 9/10 are at bare subsistence level we go back to Ray's rules of skinny thumb.<br>However the ball bearings mentioned in a recent post are a nice example of a mechanical product and "bridge-tech". They are usually small, valuable, ship well and will always make a nice Christmas present to anyone in a "mechanical society" without much explanation.<br>A 8 gb micro-sd card or USB-drive in a no-internet (but physical postage) world on the other hand could add significant value to (remaining) electronics, e.g. for dissemination of knowledge, etc. - in an "electronic society". However another question is if their relative complexity is not too high for most societies to have/perceive a net benefit from all this, and not use them as door-stopper.<br>I assume societies will differ quite strongly in what kind of tech base they'll hang onto, as well as how means are distributed and stuff is valued.

You're still wrong. In the abstract, it would have been possible for societies during the post-Roman dark ages to maintain Roman urban centers and all their amenities -- it was technically feasible, and there were people who wanted the services those centers could have provided. The centers still were abandoned over large sections of the former Western empire, because what wealth was available had to go to more critical needs. The many advantages of Roman urban centers did not outweigh the hard fact that there wasn't enough wealth to maintain them and still survive. In the same way, while building internal combustion engines (and PV cells) in the post-industrial dark ages is technically possible, and there will no doubt be people who want them, the limits on the whole economic system will very likely be such that the necessary technological infrastructure will not be able to be supported, and the engines will not get built. <br><br>Robert, no argument there. <br><br>Latefall, I'm also biased in favor of windpower, but I want to see it on a small enough scale that it can be maintained with a much more modest technological basis and converted to mechanical use without too much difficulty.

A key to successful sustainability is to think, and think in systems, and make conscious/informed choices.<br><br>The fool's paradise of fossil fuel super-abundance allowed people to mindlessly set up camp anywhere without paying attention to local conditions/ecology/etc. As fossil fuels decline, places with poor renewables conditions will become less habitable.<br><br>Do you disagree with any of the above?<br><br>If one wants to use solar in places where it snows,<br>then one ought to think about things like:<br>* the panel angle w.r.t. slope so snow will slide off - maybe adjustable mount?<br>* azimuth w.r.t. the winds that may carry blasting snow<br>* If one has such windy snow, one may dis-consider things like evacuated tubes or certain PV mounts that collect snow.<br>* access for cleaning<br>* elevation above ground to allow snow that came off the panels to sit without shading<br>* is there potential for ice to fall/be blown off nearby trees, buildings onto panels and damaging them?<br><br>Same sorts of things for wind, hydro, geothermal, wave, tidal, biomass.<br><br>As to Russ's system, not clear if it warranted comment. It paid for itself, he accepts lifestyle changes are necessary. He's on the grid, so no immediate worries of freezing. I would take his comment about "… basement full of batteries…" as hyperbole - it's not absolutely true, a wealthy person in good sun with a big roof/large lot can do the BAU thing (at home) as long as panels/inverters/batteries hold out, but his comment certainly applies to most folks - so I felt no need to nit pick that.<br><br>As far as going off-grid (does he have batteries now?), would it not occur to him to raise the ground mount racks/steepen their angle? If he had a place to put the snow, would it not occur to him to go out and stomp down snow and/or move it around, assuming he has time/physical ability to do that? Is he just figuring - "gee, this is the worst winter in 30-40 years where I'm at, this will never happen again."? I wonder if his house is super-insulated, etc., but JMG's book covers the virtues of passive survivability and the interplay of conservation &amp; renewables - am I wrong to assume he hasn't read it when he says "We have your latest book on order"?<br> <br>I write to offer up my views when I think there are misconceptions and the correction is generally applicable, like:<br>The data I presented show small roof-mounted systems are more expensive/W than large ground mounts.<br>The Verneuil process cannot be used to make silicon or any other semiconductor crystals I can think of - hmmm, just thought of one, copper oxide.<br>But that's a rare curiosity AFAIK.<br>If someone disagrees and can point me to some reasonable data/papers, then point away.<br>Otherwise I'd like to save people some grief, for example:<br>if they should come across a bunch of silicon powder for sale cheap thinking they can save/make money fusing it in an oxy-hydrogen flame for silicon PV, the results will not work, or worse!<br>WARNING: finely divided silicon dust is FLAMMABLE, even EXPLOSIVE under certain conditions.<br><br><br><a href=#c7480459310574799585 title="comment permalink">3/17/14, 4:02 PM</a><br><br>

Think of it as like in a game of scrabble. You might have a really really good word you can spell with your allocated letters. But of course, in the game of scrabble, what gets you points is whether you can actually put the words on the board, not just whether or not you can spell or think of a good word that will theoretically win you a lot of points. For these purposes of course, a good knowledge of the English dictionary is necessary (analogy- a good knowledge of technical feasibility) but also a good idea of how a game of scrabble might actually work out in practice and what words you will actually be able to put on the board is also useful (analogy- economic/ practical/ logical feasibility).

When I said "technically feasible" I meant economics as part of technically feasibility. And I do think it is economically feasible with proper public policies. See the French Grenelle plans.<br><br>On a related point, the same Conservative government that created Grenelle had these follow-up plans.<br>--------<br>Since 2012, political discussions have been developing in France about the energy transition and how the French economy might profit from it.[21]<br><br>In September 2012, Minister of the Environment Delphine Batho coined the term "ecological patriotism." <br><br>The government began a work plan to consider starting the energy transition in France. This plan should address the following questions by June 2013:[22]<br><br>How can France move towards energy efficiency and energy conservation? Reflections on altered lifestyles, changes in production, consumption, and transport.<br><br>How to achieve the energy mix targeted for 2025? France's climate protection targets call for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030, and 60% by 2040.<br><br>Which renewable energies should France rely on? How should the use of wind and solar energy can be promoted?<br><br>What costs and funding models will likely be required for alternative energy consulting and investment support? And how about for research, renovation, and expansion of district heating, biomass, and geothermal energy? <br><br>One solution could be a continuation of the CSPE, a tax that is charged on electricity bills.<br><br>The Environmental Conference on Sustainable Development on 14 and 15 September 2012 treated the issue of the environmental and energy transition as its main theme.[23] <br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition#France <br><br>Unfortunately, the Socialists won the election in 2013.<br><br>Fortunately, the 2007 Grenelle plans continue to roll along. The Socialists have slowed them (the Paris Metro will be doubled (+208 km) by 2030, not 2025 as previously planned, but they added another major project).<br><br>The goal for oil consumption is to drop from 2 million b/day (@ 2000) to 850,000 b/day by 2040.<br><br>Circumstances may force an even deeper cut, but such a planned drop under BAU allows for greater cuts faster in an emergency.<br><br>It appears that France is (was ?) trying to couple economics with an aggressive energy transition.<br><br>And I repeat that the French nuclear build-out has been economic and not a "subsidy dumpster". They are taking care to make sure that the same is true for renewables.<br><br>In 2007, they believed that wind was then economic, but solar was not. In 2007, they planned a shift from wind to solar @ 2020. Subsequent economic improvements in solar are likely to bring that date forward in time.<br><br>I would use France (at least under the Conservatives) as an example of avoiding "subsidy dumpsters' while aggressively changing energy and resource use economically. And they are looking at what changes in lifestyle et al will be required.<br><br>Unfortunately, only a few other nations are doing likewise.<br><br># I am caring for my father after he broke his leg, so my concentration and precision are not as they should be,<br><br><br><a href=#c5931636618413391505 title="comment permalink">3/17/14, 4:47 PM</a><br><br>

No, not the fuel, the road. Roads only last, oh, 25 years for asphalt, or 75 for concrete, more or less. Consider the quick reversion to the hand-drawn Chinese wheelbarrow after one of their dynasties went down (they had asphalt roads). The Roman roads lasted longer, though those had most impressive engineering. As a modern example, Seattle is having trouble paying for its non-arterial roads, with no serious funding there since, oh, 1993. They do pothole patching, if you call it in, but that's a band-aid. Some of the arterials are in none too good shape: I can see the old brick under the broken asphalt on Eastlake Ave, when there is not an oily puddle in the way. The populace seems mighty tax-shy, so we'll see what funding they are willing to drop into road maintenance. Longer term, geographic and other barriers will come into play: who is maintaining the bridges, the mountain passes? What happens when the distance between boutique fuel-makers is too great, what remains of the road too troublesome? Local use, local neglect: cars going, cars gone.<br><br>On the plus side, horses are already self-driving, so that need not be invented. They are also expensive.

The oil industry spent $4 trillion on drilling since 2005. In the energy industry, $16B is just a deal. <br><br>2. Your physical arguments (in the comments) concerning fusion are not valid.

There may be unknown ones but you were arguing that known physical principles rule it out, which is incorrect. <br><br>Personally I'd rather invest $16B in a solar breeder project than a Tokamak, so I'm not carrying a torch for fusion, it's just that I don't see how the discussion is advanced by asserting something to be known when it is currently unknown.

One morning after milking I sat down to smoke and watched that days milk leaving the farm. Just after the milk went out of sight I saw a huge lorry load of fertiliser come into sight.<br><br>It suddenly struck me that there was a vast amount of goods coming onto the farm and in comparison very little was leaving. I began to question everything I had learned in college. As a newly minted young critic of modern farming I already had the advantage of having worked with and talked to many old time farmers in my teens.<br><br>By the mid 1980s I was a converted peak oiler. Like JMG I read "the Limits to Growth and the collected works of E.F. Schumacher". My greatest moment of existential angst came the first time I saw President Carter's malaise speech. It was then I realised that Reaganomics and Thatcherism were hideous historical mistakes. Carter wanted us to make sacrifices so that our grand children might prosper, Regan advocated partying on. Like insane drug addicts we betrayed our own grandchildren so that we could get one more fix of the industrial age party. After that I parted company with the mainstream world view and learned to keep my opinions to myself. The late 1980s were an angst ridden and depressing time in my life.<br><br>On the upside I rediscovered the virtues of the bicycle and fell in love with the joys of long distance solo bikeing and camping trips. In an other wise secure and dull life, my long distance solo bicycle tours in Ireland and England have been the great adventures of my life. From the lows of being lost in the dark far from home, cold and wet, with the wind driving the rain in my face, to the highs of cycling over a great plain with the sun beating down and a tail wind pushing me on. If I had not been peak oil aware I might have missed all that.<br><br>The really big upside of being peak oil aware for the last 30 years is that I live in a very small house, with very modest expenses and no debt. Our household income is way below the Irish poverty line, yet we live very well and have a modest amount of money for on going capital investment.<br><br><a href=#c9166752081826873869 title="comment permalink">3/19/14, 6:50 AM</a><br><br>

I was discussing the former because that's what the commenter to whom I was responding brought up. <br><br>Tom, that's quite a workable metaphor. <br><br>Alan, when the post to which you were responding was all about the difference between technical feasibility and economic viability, insisting that you meant to include the latter in the former is a bit disingenuous, don't you think? <br><br>Enrique, I noted in a post here several years ago that the US was in the process of <a href=../../2010/02/becoming-third-world-country.html rel=nofollow>becoming a Third World country</a>. As far as I can see, we're still very much on track. <br><br>LatheChuck, that's a classic example. Many thanks!<br><br>Dragonfly, duly noted.

As for focusing on the minutiae, well, yes -- that's how you avoid seeing the big picture if the big picture is too scary for your comfort zone. <br><br>RPC, in the case of wind, no argument at all -- PV is a more complex matter, since it requires all that industrial infrastructure to make PV cells and the rest of the ingredients for a system, and that also has to be maintained. As long as you're thinking about renewable energy as the equivalent of oil lamps and iceboxes, though, you're in the realm that renewable energy can support; it's when people insist we can maintain a modern middle-class standard of living on a renewable basis that we've passed into the territory of subsidy dumpsters. <br><br>Thrig, no argument there. I was in Chicago at a speaking gig this past weekend, and the streets were rutted with potholes to an astonishing extent -- if things go much further in the same direction, I'm not at all sure that cars will still be able to use the surface streets without suffering serious damage. <br><br>Will, no argument there, either. <br><br>Orwellian, the instinctive sense that something is very wrong and is getting worse seems fairly common on this side of the water, too. Unfortunately, as you've noted, it's usually combined with a complete lack of understanding of what's actually going wrong, and that leaves the door open to scoundrels of various kinds.<br><br><a href=#c4530795660771292786 title="comment permalink">3/19/14, 10:14 AM</a><br><br>

And $3.00/kWh is hardly a limit. Even in the present day, you might sometimes willingly pay well over $150.00 per kWh. How? By turning on a flashlight with alkaline batteries in it. Light, where and when you need it, is worth a lot. Always has been, always will be.<br><br>Weighing against that is all the difficulties Ray Wharton laid out in his excellent comment. Prediction one way or the other involves very complex factors. For example, if I didn't know it from history, I doubt I'd be able to "predict" that people would be able (technically or economically) to sail halfway around the world in wooden sailboats on two-year voyages to hunt huge animals in their own element with hand weapons, to obtain superior lamp oil.<br><br>But can 19th-century whaling and post-collapse PV making really be compared? Both require a lot of expertise, and roughly similar amounts of capital (a provisioned ship versus a small factory), so call that a wash. But one required high manpower and personal risk; the other would require more sophisticated tooling. Not directly comparable at all.

Realistic estimates have long suggested that a fusion reactor would cost 10 times as much as a fission plant, and produce only about the same amount of electricity. The current estimated cost of ITER ($17 billion at this point) suggests that if anything, those estimates were on the low side. Fission's already unaffordable -- no nation on the planet has ever been able to afford fission power without gargantuan government subsidies -- and an energy source at least ten times more costly is thus right out of the running. <br><br>Whether or not my speculation about the physical obstacles to nuclear fusion is correct -- and I note from one of the other comments here that it's a speculation shared by at least one specialist in the field -- is ultimately irrelevant, because, ahem, technical feasibility is not economic viability, and an abundant energy source that will bankrupt any society that tries to rely on it might as well not be there. As to the other potential modes of fusion, well, of course vaporware always looks great when it's still on paper; the tokamak concept looked really exciting in its early days, too. Until somebody can offer something other than verbal handwaving, I see no reason to pin unwarranted hopes on fusion, and every reason to plan for the future based on realistic estimates rather than the overdeveloped sense of collective entitlement that seems to drive so much thinking on that subject. <br><br>Renaissance, here again, I'm a great fan of windpower on a home and community scale. As long as you're willing to adapt your lifestyle to deal with the intermittency and low energy concentration that are inseparable from renewable energy, wind is great. It's the attempt to pretend that we can maintain today's absurdly extravagant lifestyles on a renewable basis that I'm trying to critique. <br><br>Onething, a deft display of cultural literacy will usually get something of the sort from me!<br><br>1ab, good catch.

My key point in my last comment was “what is not economically viable now may become economically viable in the not so distant future.”<br><br>2) JMG wrote: “you're completely neglecting the issue of the limits to available real wealth.” <br><br>Perhaps. But my experience has been that the great majority of modern folks view these issues (if at all) from a consumer’s perspective. This is natural, since a great majority of modern folks exist primarily as consumers.<br><br>However, I have found it extremely useful to look at the “limits of available wealth” from a producer’s perspective as well, which most of us will have to be in the not too distant future. I have made over ¾ of my living as an adult either producing organic food, crafting homes built from wood from trees I helped to kill, or by designing and installing off-grid utilities. I don’t claim myself as some kind of shining example of how to pull off these enterprises. But no doubt I’ve given it my best shot for the last 2 decades. <br><br>Nevertheless, when working on these front lines, I’ve found that one perceives not only the wealth enabled by our society’s cheap food, timber, and fuel, but also the wealth disabled by that very same cheap food, timber, and fuel. Our cheap commodity culture marginalizes an incredible amount of potentially valuable resources from our economy, including human imagination and labor, as well as all kinds of ecologically integrated systems.<br><br>As the modern age of cheap energy wanes, all kinds of wealth marginalized for so long from our economy will come back into play. Our industrial Ag system’s cheap food is built on that cheap energy – all the way from fertilizing through seeding, cultivating, harvesting, processing, refrigerating, and transporting. As the cheap energy goes, so will the cheap food.<br><br>Cheap meat raised in CAFOs will very likely disappear. The market share for Sustainable, Local, &amp; Organic (w) meat and dairy raised on rotationally grazed pastures will, on the other hand, likely actually grow, since it is more ecologically efficient and arguably more sustainable than cultivating annuals which require more energy intensive inputs (SLOw or not).<br><br>What I am saying here is akin to your theory of catabolic collapse – although I am focusing more on assets that were marginalized by the previous economic system, as opposed to assets that were abandoned by the previous system for lack of capital to maintain.<br><br>3) JMG wrote: “Sure, some grain can be turned into ethanol; if so, that grain cannot be used to feed people or draft animals.”<br><br>Actually, that’s not true. First of all, as a reminder, ethanol can be made from things other than grain (from bad apples to cattails grown in grey-water systems). But even if we are talking about grain – all that the process of brewing and distilling alcohol does is remove the sugar and starch from the crop. All of the protein in the grain remains (actually it is now pre-digested by the yeast, so is even more digestible), all of the fat in the grain remains, all of the vitamins and minerals remain (actually the vitamin complex has been improved by the yeast’s production of B vitamins), and all of the fiber remains.<br><br>People could eat the distiller’s grain (although likely wouldn’t unless they were real hungry). But ruminants can actually be more productive supplemented with distiller’s grain than straight grain. (The first stomach within a cow – the rumen, evolved to convert sugar and starch from the cellulose the animal ate – not to be flooded with sugar and starch from straight grain, which upsets the rumen’s whole microbial ecology.)<br><br>An engine designed or modified to run on straight ethanol will run dramatically cooler than on gas – dramatically increasing its overall useful life.<br><br>Once again, we are not going to run Suburbia and Mall-wart on this ethanol. But as great as bodies and muscles are, engines too may have their place in the ecotechnic future. <br><br>Thanks again<br><br><br><a href=#c7493002009055022755 title="comment permalink">3/19/14, 11:04 AM</a><br><br>

Fusion has been a cottage industry by comparison. I don't have the numbers at hand but it wouldn't surprise me if CERN is a bigger cottage industry and they've never had any practical purpose at all. It seems to me that the amounts spent, being so small, are not important. What is important is the question of whether this is being used as a distraction from a realistic future. Since ITER isn't even designed to achieve ignition, well, that speaks for itself. <br><br>I have no problem with speculations about fundamental obstacles to fusion. Indeed yours is not only a reasonable one, it was the starting point, obviously, when physicists first asked the question: is a gravity well the only way? Prior to the recent Higgs experiment, there were equally plausible speculations as to what it would find, but the truth is, nobody knew either way. Fusion is like that, nobody has proven it either way. It could be that it is simply "too big" for us. <br><br>None of that should have anything to do with planning for a future on the basis of speculative science. However I suppose, in the real world, the mere existence of energy research provides an excuse for anyone who wants to take it. "They'll think of something". Well, they certainly will but it might not be what was hoped for. <br><br>I wonder if there is a term that could be used in place of "uneconomic" to describe low EROEI energy sources.
