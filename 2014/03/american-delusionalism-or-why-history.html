<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the things that reliably irritates a certain fraction of this blog’s readers, as I’ve had occasion to comment before, is my habit of using history as a touchstone that can be used to test claims about the future. No matter what the context, no matter how wearily familiar the process under discussion might be, it’s a safe bet that the moment I start talking about historical parallels, somebody or other is going to pop up and insist that it really is different this time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In a trivial sense, of course, that claim is correct. The tech stock bubble that popped in 2000, the real estate bubble that popped in 2008, and the fracking bubble that’s showing every sign of popping in the uncomfortably near future are all different from each other, and from every other bubble and bust in the history of speculative markets, all the way back to the Dutch tulip mania of 1637. It’s quite true that tech stocks aren’t tulips, and bundled loans backed up by dubious no-doc mortgages aren’t the same as bundled loans backed up by dubious shale leases—well, not
<i>exactly</i> the same—but in practice, the many differences of detail are irrelevant compared to the one crucial identity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Tulips, tech stocks, and bundled loans, along with South Sea Company shares in 1730, investment trusts in 1929, and all the other speculative vehicles in all the other speculative bubbles of the last five centuries, different as they are, all follow the identical trajectory:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>up with the rocket, down with the stick. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That is to say, those who insist that it’s different this time are right where it doesn’t matter and wrong where it counts. I’ve come to think of the words “it’s different this time,” in fact, as the nearest thing history has to the warning siren and flashing red light that tells you that something is about to go very, very wrong. When people start saying it, especially when plenty of people with plenty of access to the media start saying it, it’s time to dive for the floor, cover your head with your arms, and wait for the blast to hit. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With that in mind, I’d like to talk a bit about the recent media flurry around the phrase “American exceptionalism,” which has become something of a shibboleth among pseudoconservative talking heads in recent months. Pseudoconservatives? Well, yes; actual conservatives, motivated by the long and by no means undistinguished tradition of conservative thinking launched by Edmund Burke in the late 18th century, are interested in, ahem, conserving things, and conservatives who actually conserve are about as rare these days as liberals who actually liberate. Certainly you won’t find many of either among the strident voices insisting just now that the last scraps of America’s democracy at home and reputation abroad ought to be sacrificed in the service of their squeaky-voiced machismo. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As far as I know, the phrase “American exceptionalism” was originally coined by none other than Josef Stalin—evidence, if any more were needed, that American pseudoconservatives these days, having no ideas of their own, have simply borrowed those of their erstwhile Communist bogeyman and stood them on their heads with a Miltonic “Evil, be thou my good.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Stalin meant by it the opinion of many Communists in his time that the United States, unlike the industrial nations of Europe, wasn’t yet ripe for the triumphant proletarian revolution predicted (inaccurately) by Marx’s secular theology. Devout Marxist that he was, Stalin rejected this claim with some heat, denouncing it in so many words as “this heresy of American exceptionalism,” and insisting (also inaccurately) that America would get its proletarian revolution on schedule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
While Stalin may have invented the phrase, the perception that he thus labeled had considerably older roots. In a previous time, though, that perception took a rather different tone than it does today. A great many of the early leaders and thinkers of the United States in its early years, and no small number of the foreign observers who watched the American experiment in those days, thought and hoped that the newly founded republic might be able to avoid making the familiar mistakes that had brought so much misery onto the empires of the Old World. Later on, during and immediately after the great debates over American empire at the end of the 19th century, a great many Americans and foreign observers still thought and hoped that the republic might come to its senses in time and back away from the same mistakes that doomed those Old World empires to the misery just mentioned. These days, by contrast, the phrase “American exceptionalism” seems to stand for the conviction that America can and should make every one of those same mistakes, right down to the fine details, and will still somehow be spared the logically inevitable consequences. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The current blind faith in American exceptionalism, in other words, is simply another way of saying “it’s different this time.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those who insist that God is on America’s side when America isn’t exactly returning the favor, like those who have less blatantly theological reasons for their belief that this nation’s excrement emits no noticeable odor, are for all practical purposes demanding that America must not, under any circumstances, draw any benefit from the painfully learnt lessons of history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I suggest that a better name for the belief in question might be "American delusionalism;" it’s hard to see how this bizarre act of faith can do anything other than help drive the American experiment toward a miserable end, but then that’s just one more irony in the fire. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same conviction that the past has nothing to teach the present is just as common elsewhere in contemporary culture. I’m thinking here, among other things, of the ongoing drumbeat of claims that our species will inevitably be extinct by 2030. As I noted in a previous post here, this is yet another expression of <a href=../../2014/01/2030-is-new-2010.html>the same dubious logic that generated the 2012 delusion</a>, but much of the rhetoric that surrounds it starts from the insistence that nothing like the current round of greenhouse gas-driven climate change has ever happened before.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That insistence bespeaks an embarrassing lack of knowledge about paleoclimatology. Vast quantities of greenhouse gases being dumped into the atmosphere over a century or two? Check; the usual culprit is vulcanism, specifically the kind of flood-basalt eruption that opens a crack in the earth many miles in length and turns an area the size of a European nation into a lake of lava. The most recent of those, a smallish one, happened about 6 million years ago in the Columbia River basin of eastern Washington and Oregon states.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Further back, in the Aptian, Toarcian, and Turonian-Cenomanian epochs of the late Mesozoic, that same process on a much larger scale boosted atmospheric CO2 levels to three times the present figure and triggered what paleoclimatologists call "super-greenhouse events." Did those cause the extinction of all life on earth? Not hardly; as far as the paleontological evidence shows, it didn’t even slow the brontosaurs down. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Oceanic acidification leading to the collapse of calcium-shelled plankton populations? Check; those three super-greenhouse events, along with a great many less drastic climate spikes, did that. The ocean also contains very large numbers of single-celled organisms that don’t have calcium shells, such as blue-green algae, which aren’t particularly sensitive to shifts in the pH level of seawater; when such shifts happen, these other organisms expand to fill the empty niches, and everybody further up the food chain gets used to a change in diet. When the acidification goes away, whatever species of calcium-shelled plankton have managed to survive elbow their way back into their former niches and undergo a burst of evolutionary radiation; this makes life easy for geologists today, who can figure out the age of any rock laid down in an ancient ocean by checking the remains of foraminifers and other calcium-loving plankton against a chart of what existed when. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Sudden climate change recently enough to be experienced by human beings? Check; most people have heard of the end of the last ice age, though you have to read the technical literature or one of a very few popular treatments to get some idea of just how drastically the climate changed, or how fast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The old saw about a slow, gradual warming over millennia got chucked into the dumpster decades ago, when ice cores from Greenland upset that particular theory. The ratio between different isotopes of oxygen in the ice laid down in different years provides a sensitive measure of the average global temperature at sea level during those same years. According to that measure, at the end of the Younger Dryas period about 11,800 years ago, global temperatures shot up by 20<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>°</span> F. <i>in less than a decade</i>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course that didn’t mean that temperatures shot up that far evenly, all over the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>What seems to have happened is that the tropics barely warmed at all, the southern end of the planet warmed mildly, and the northern end experienced a drastic heat wave that tipped the great continental ice sheets of the era into rapid collapse and sent sea levels soaring upwards. Those of my readers who have been paying attention to recent scientific publications about Greenland and the Arctic Ocean now have very good reason to worry, because the current round of climate change has most strongly affected the northern end of the planet, too, and scientists have begun to notice historically unprecedented changes in the Greenland ice cap. In an upcoming post I plan on discussing at some length what those particular historical parallels promise for our future, and it’s not pretty. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Oh, and the aftermath of the post-Younger Dryas temperature spike was a period several thousand years long when global temperatures were considerably higher than they are today. The Holocene Hypsithermal, as it’s called, saw global temperatures peak around 7<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>°</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">
F. higher than they are today—about the level, that is, that’s already baked into the cake as a result of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was not a particularly pleasant time. Most of western North America was desert, baked to a crackly crunch by drought conditions that make today’s dry years look soggy; much of what’s now, at least in theory, the eastern woodland biome was dryland prairie, while both coasts got rapidly rising seas with a side order of frequent big tsunamis—again, we’ll talk about those in the upcoming post just mentioned. Still, you’ll notice that our species survived the experience. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">As those droughts and tsunamis might suggest, the lessons taught by history don’t necessarily amount to "everything will be just fine." The weird inability of the contemporary imagination to find any middle ground between business as usual and sudden total annihilation has its usual effect here, hiding the actual risks of anthropogenic climate change behind a facade of apocalyptic fantasies. Here again, the question "what happened the last time this occurred?" is the most accessible way to avoid that trap, and the insistence that it’s different this time and the evidence of the past can’t be applied to the present and future puts that safeguard out of reach. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">For a third example, consider the latest round of claims that a sudden financial collapse driven by current debt loads will crash the global economy once and for all. That sudden collapse has been being predicted year after weary year for decades now—do any of my readers, I wonder, remember Dr. Ravi Batra’s <i>The Great Depression of 1990</i>?—and its repeated failure to show up and perform as predicted seems only to strengthen the conviction on the part of believers that this year, like some financial equivalent of the Great Pumpkin, the long-delayed crash will finally put in its long-delayed appearance and bring the global economy crashing down. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">I’m far from sure that they’re right about the imminence of a crash; the economy of high finance these days is so heavily manipulated, and so thoroughly detached from the real economy where real goods and services have to be produced using real energy and resources, that it’s occurred to me more than once that the stock market and the other organs of the financial sphere might keep chugging away in a state of blissful disconnection to the rest of existence for a very long time to come. Stil, let’s grant for the moment that the absurd buildup of unpayable debt in the United States and other industrial nations will in fact become the driving force behind a credit collapse, in which drastic deleveraging will erase trillions of dollars in notional wealth. Would such a crash succeed, as a great many people are claiming just now, in bringing the global economy to a sudden and permanent stop? </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">Here again, the lessons of history provide a clear and straightforward answer to that question, and it’s not one that supports the partisans of the fast-crash theory. Massive credit collapses that erase very large sums of notional wealth and impact the global economy are hardly a new phenomenon, after all. One example—the credit collapse of 1930-1932—is still just within living memory; the financial crises of 1873 and 1893 are well documented, and there are dozens of other examples of nations and whole continents hammered by credit collapses and other forms of drastic economic crisis. Those crises have had plenty of consequences, but one thing that has never happened as a result of any of them is the sort of self-feeding, irrevocable plunge into the abyss that current fast-crash theories require. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">The reason for this is that credit is merely one way by which a society manages the distribution of goods and services. That’s all it is. Energy, raw materials, and labor are the factors that have to be present in order to produce goods and services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Credit simply regulates who gets how much of each of these things, and there have been plenty of societies that have handled that same task without making use of a credit system at all. A credit collapse, in turn, doesn’t make the energy, raw materials, and labor vanish into some fiscal equivalent of a black hole; they’re all still there, in whatever quantities they were before the credit collapse, and all that’s needed is some new way to allocate them to the production of goods and services. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">This, in turn, governments promptly provide. In 1933, for example, faced with the most severe credit collapse in American history, Franklin Roosevelt temporarily nationalized the entire US banking system, seized nearly all the privately held gold in the country, unilaterally changed the national debt from "payable in gold" to "payable in Federal Reserve notes" (which amounted to a technical default), and launched a flurry of other emergency measures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The credit collapse came to a screeching halt, famously, in less than a hundred days. Other nations facing the same crisis took equally drastic measures, with similar results. While that history has apparently been forgotten across large sections of the peak oil blogosphere, it’s a safe bet that none of it has been forgotten in the corridors of power in Washington DC and elsewhere in the world. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">More generally, governments have an extremely broad range of powers that can be used, and have been used, in extreme financial emergencies to stop a credit or currency collapse from terminating the real economy. Faced with a severe crisis, governments can slap on wage and price controls, freeze currency exchanges, impose rationing, raise trade barriers, default on their debts, nationalize whole industries, issue new currencies, allocate goods and services by fiat, and impose martial law to make sure the new economic rules are followed to the letter, if necessary, at gunpoint. Again, these aren’t theoretical possibilities; every one of them has actually been used by more than one government faced by a major economic crisis in the last century and a half. Given that track record, it requires a breathtaking leap of faith to assume that if the next round of deleveraging spirals out of control, politicians around the world will simply sit on their hands, saying "Whatever shall we do?" in plaintive voices, while civilization crashes to ruin around them. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">What makes that leap of faith all the more curious is in the runup to the economic crisis of 2008-9, the same claims of imminent, unstoppable financial apocalypse we’re hearing today were being made—in some cases, by the same people who are making them today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(I treasure a comment I fielded from a popular peak oil blogger at the height of the 2009 crisis, who insisted that the fast crash was upon us and that my predictions about the future were therefore all wrong.) Their logic was flawed then, and it’s just as flawed now, because it dismisses the lessons of history as irrelevant and therefore fails to take into account how the events under discussion play out in the real world. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">That’s the problem with the insistence that this time it really is different: it disables the most effective protection we’ve got against the habit of thought that cognitive psychologists call "confirmation bias," the tendency to look for evidence that supports one’s pet theory rather than seeking the evidence that might call it into question. The scientific method itself, in the final analysis, is simply a collection of useful gimmicks that help you sidestep confirmation bias.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s why competent scientists, when they come up with a hypothesis to explain something in nature, promptly sit down and try to think up as many ways as possible to
<i>disprove</i> the hypothesis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Those potentials for disproof are the raw materials from which experiments are designed, and only if the hypothesis survives all experimental attempts to disprove it does it take its first step toward scientific respectability. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">It’s not exactly easy to run controlled double-blind experiments on entire societies, but historical comparison offers the same sort of counterweight to confirmation bias. Any present or future set of events, however unique it may be in terms of the fine details, has points of similarity with events in the past, and those points of similarity allow the past events to be taken as a guide to the present and future. This works best if you’ve got a series of past events, as different from each other as any one of them is from the present or future situation you’re trying to predict; if you can find common patterns in the whole range of past parallels, it’s usually a safe bet that the same pattern will recur again. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">Any time you approach a present or future event, then, you have two choices: you can look for the features that event has in common with other events, despite the differences of detail, or you can focus on the differences and ignore the common features.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first of those choices, it’s worth noting, allows you to consider both the similarities and the differences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once you’ve got the common pattern, it then becomes possible to modify it as needed to take into account the special characteristics of the situation you’re trying to understand or predict: to notice, for example, that the dark age that will follow our civilization will have to contend with nuclear and chemical pollution on top of the more ordinary consequences of decline and fall. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
If you start from the assumption that the event you’re trying to predict is unlike anything that’s ever happened before, though, you’ve thrown out your chance of perceiving the common pattern. What happens instead, with motononous regularity, is that pop-culture narratives such as the sudden overnight collapse beloved of Hollywood screenplay writers smuggle themselves into the picture, and cement themselves in place with the help of confirmation bias. The result is the endless recycling of repeatedly failed predictions that plays so central a role in the collective imagination of our time, and has helped so many people blind themselves to the unwelcome future closing in on us. </div>

For much of human history, the vast majority of people have been poor with very little access to either energy or resources. Yet, despite all of that, they still loved, lived and got on with their lives as best as they could.<br><br>It is weird that people just don't get that. You only need to spend a couple of hours in a third world country to see your own future writ large.<br><br>That message wasn't lost on me. Whilst we have access to cheap energy and resources, use it to improve your local environment so that it is productive. Few people will ever even understand what they are looking at so it will fly under the radar – so to speak.<br><br>As an interesting side note, I had a visit from the local power company today looking for a meter to read as he found that my place had been overlooked (they're remotely read here). It was pretty funny because he looked like a stunned mullet when informed of the situation here – it sort of said: “how could this be?” Just to add to the scene the dogs were going ballistic! I think they wanted to tooth him just a little bit as he clearly disregarded the keep out sign. Ahh, hill billy country. <br><br>Unfortunately people tend to only "see" the output side of industrial food production and therefore miss all of the "death and flies and stuff" (hehe - sorry I couldn't help myself with that quote) that goes on in the background to achieve that output and the wreckage of the environment left in its wake. Shame really, because it'll be too late before they realise. Still, it is never really too late to commence land restoration. Chemical and radioactive wastes on the other hand would be very hard to deal with.<br><br>By the way I liked the part in your essay about the "food chain". I was having lunch at the time of reading that and almost spat bread with blackberry and rhubarb jam all over the monitor as I was laughing so hard! Cheeky!<br><br>Being 700m above sea level, I don't worry too much about sea level rise. However, Blind Freddy here is telling me that the weather extremes are getting more extreme every year. Water management is the key to surviving in this place and I put a lot of thought and actions into that and will be again in the next few days. It never stops.<br><br>Hi Ruben,<br><br>If you look outside your own country, you'd see that the Australian government has eliminated its debt ceiling. It has also extended a $380bn facility from the Reserve Bank to the four main banks to utilise in whatever fashion they need if and when a credit crisis occurs. The last time I checked, the debt to GDP ratio here was about 26%, so there is a lot of space to breathe, before we resemble the US situation.<br><br>My gut feel is that in the US should any major crisis occur, the "noise" that you are hearing now will disappear. At the moment my gut feel says that it is all just noise, because they don't know what else to do and are simply repeating past strategies. That to me is actually scarier. But they'll act when needed, whether the outcome is favourable to you personally is another question altogether.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c4668777145894114078 title="comment permalink">3/19/14, 8:12 PM</a><br><br>

However, the main difference between this time and "last time" back in the 1930's is that fossil fuel energy were still cheap and plentiful in more than a few places. The wind was at the back of the central governments and therefor they all became more powerful, absurdly so in the case of Hitler and Stalin. The only exception I can think of is China falling apart, but they were probably still somewhat removed from industrialization.<br><br>It's hard for me to imagine a police state scenario working out with constantly declining energy. Plus at some point there would be severe negative feedback loop caused by war.

I'm not near that shallow but sometimes I almost find myself agreeing with them. <br><br>It's one thing to make mid-range plans towards marginal self- sufficiency with the understanding that the "party" is winding down and things are going to get progressively rougher and now is probably a good time to buy a bicycle. Quite another, to accept the kind of massive dislocation of every sort that will happen if/when the temp. starts rising by 2f a year, every year for ten years. Not that we have any choice as to "accepting," or not.<br><br>At that point, though, it seems it all comes down to the rather academic question of just what constitutes "civilization." People living? I imagine far too many will. A president in the White House? For all the good he will do. Some form of economic activity? As long as there are people with something called "dollars" goods will exchange hands in some manner. Beyond that, how much of the life we know today would survive? Virtually none. How much quality would any normal persons life have at that point? So far less than none that "hell on earth" starts to become frighteningly literal. <br><br>Since, at this point, there is absolutely nothing any individual can do about it, and quite possibly nothing realistic that can be done at all, it doesn't seem to be surprising that irrational denial and "Beyond, There be Monsters" are the popular responses.

A difference in scale is not a difference in kind; the same gravitational equations that govern the arc of a thrown paperclip also govern the orbit of Jupiter around the Sun. The patterns of decline and fall I'm discussing hold good for societies that range from Neolithic kingships ruling a single river valley right on up to continental empires with market economies and international trade; since other patterns found across that same spectrum can already be shown to apply to us, it's arguably safe to assume that the arc of decline and fall will, too. <br><br>Escape, thank you!

Of course you're right that the measures I've discussed won't work forever, but they don't have to; they just have to stop the immediate panic, so that the economy can settle back into its present state of slow strangulation. <br><br>Btidwell, the vast majority of people on this planet have much less in the way of wealth than you and I do, and yet they still find life worth living, by and large.

For what it's worth, I expect birth rates to go down over much of the world, the way they did in the post-Soviet states, and for death rates to climb steeply as antibiotics lose the race with microbial resistance, public health collapses, and malnutrition and stress-related phenomena such as alcoholism and drug abuse become even more common than they are now. Over that background pattern of fewer births and many more deaths, you get bursts of morbidity and mortality driven by wars, famines, epidemics, natural disasters that governments no longer have the resources to mitigate, and so on. It's not a pretty picture, but it's fairly standard for a civilization in the course of decline and fall.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c2628523008635196522 title="comment permalink">3/19/14, 11:07 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c924136109716708647></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/05139197061386426472 rel=nofollow>deedl</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Very important Article. Confirmation Bias is a topic too rarely discussed in any context, despite its appearance all over the disputing world. There are two additional phenomenons i would like to add to complete the overview about argumentative traps: Cognitive dissonance and false induktion. <br><br>Cognitive dissonance is the condition when the world in your mind differs from the world of your senses. So whenever you face facts that contradict whataver you thought to be true, you have to cope with that. There are three strategies: Adapting, ignoring and discrediting. You can work on your view of the world and adapt it to the facts, you can ignore reality and then live with the uneasy feeling that someting is wrong or you can attack the fact (or the messenger) to defend your worldview. Those are the cornucopians clinging to their business as usual hopes. <br><br>False induktion is a logical mistake of confusing necessities und sufficiencies. For example oil is sufficient to heat your house. But the same is true for wood, coal, geothermy and even bodyheat (when combined with super insulation). So the fact that oil is sufficient to heat the house does not mean that without oil the house can not be heated, because oil is not necessary, just sufficient. Many peak oilers list all the things oil is sufficient for and then claim that it would be a necessaty for this. Those are the doomsters in the argumentation. <br><br>Finally i want just add how to deal properly with the social science dilemma of not making experiments but just observing different economies/societies and then conclude based on the observation. Let us assume for example, that a scientist crunches properly collected data and finds that countries with a minimum wage are poorer then countries without. Proper scientific treatment of this observation means to equally consider four causal connections: <br><br>1. minimum wage causes nations to be poor (the confirmation biased neoliberal would stop here)<br>2. poorness causes nations to install a minimum wage (the confirmation biased politically left one would stop here, thinking he is smart, because he considered one causal connection more then the neoliberal)<br>3. a third variable not measured causes both the minimum wage and the poorness (for example governments that have a certain set of ideology install the minimum wage together with other measures that couse the poorness, here the third variable would be the ideological mindest)<br>4. There is no causal connection between poorness and minimum wage, their correlation is just chance. <br><br>At this point none of the four can be dismissed. Our scientist can use these four possible links to properly plan his further research. he can collect addditoal data, search for possible thrid variables or have a closer look at the countries that are outliers to his statistic, meaning countries that both rich and have a minimum wage or are poor and have non. <br><br>Proper knowledge about proper argumentational logic and scientific method could prevent many misunderstandings and dogfights among discussing individuals. Unfortunately, pointing out and explaining and argumentational mistake in a claim takes always much more effort then just claiming.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c924136109716708647 title="comment permalink">3/19/14, 11:40 PM</a><br><br>

But when it's aimed at a more general "people with apocalyptic thinking" (or some other such group), I think some people get defensive because they feel they may be a part of that subset.

I agree with you on the pseudoconservative position of trying to keep up empire forever is slowly choking the life out of us. But alot of people even some on here seem to underestimate just what the end of it would mean.<br><br>While many positive benifits would occur for the rest of the world many people think they would all be positive. For one the real reason the military empire is kept up is of course OUR hyper consuming lifestyles, and many people think said lifestyle can continue after that empire is gone. Many of our goods are manufactured, mined or produced over seas, in countries that just happen to have american troops stationed there or an american fleet off theyre coast. Many pseudoliberals still think we'll continue using 25% of the worlds energy and a third of the worlds resouces after they are gone, not going to happen. <br><br>Its not just Americans iether. For all theyre self righteous talk on the "evil American empire" many foreigners fail to mention theyre countries are allied with said evil empire and they reap the benifits acordingly. Not as much as us but thats because thyre not the imperial center. That abundance may also end or have to be mitigated when our empire finally goes away. Thats one of the tactics weve employed. Part of the reason we have the largest military gdp is to keep our alies relient upon us for military protection and to enforce theyre intrests through military force. While they of course provide us with goods and services. You think Britain will remain the power it is without the military to back the small island nation up? You think Japan wont have to drastically increase its military forces possibly with a draft after our fleet is gone? You think South Korea wont have "problems" with North Korea after the threat of American mililtary might is no longer there? Do you think the US (and possibly other countries) will remain on the UN security council after our military might is gone. As JMG has said before, we have nothing else to offer.<br><br>Then theyres the problem of the 1-2 million or so americanilitary personel that are iether stationed abroad or support those stationed abroad. We'll always need a military but the bloated global one we have now is not nessecary. The problem is thinking we can do it over night. With the troops, option A: We call them all back from everywhere across the globe. The goverment would then be forced to fined "something else" for them to do right here at home. Most people wont like what the something else may be. Option B: call them all back overnight, then subsequently fire them all. Now of course we have millions of jobless, possibly homeless, trained killers who very likely feel betrayed, abandoned and most importantly angry. And thats not including the millions of federal employees who support them, and the millions of civilian employees who suport them. Ill leave it up to the imagination for the "possibilities" that might come about in this situation.<br><br>I agree that we need to scroll back the american empire. But it should be done gradually. And with the acceptance that our and our allies way of life, and the global geopolitical shpere will be NOTHING like it was before. Of course this would happen even if we wernt facing massive energy prdicaments. Is also very likely that many of thes things will happen anyway. Wheather you think theyre good or bad things, or both, im the both position.

I doubt very much that there will be much movement north into Canada from the US.<br><br>My reason for this is because even with a few degrees of global warming, your growing season in Canada will be far too short to support a large population and even then the winters will be too harsh. The fuel requirements will also be too great to support a large population and the trees only grow slowly. Add in variability and extreme weather events (unpredictable frosts and droughts during the growing season come to mind) and I reckon it will be a tough ask for organic agriculture. <br><br>I'm prepared to be shouted down on this one.

A major part of that is because I dropped the subject at schoool in order to concentrate on sciences and languages. Hence I've had no formal historical education since age 12. I managed to ignore the field entirely for three decades, then my interest was re-sparked and I had to start educating myself intensively to fill this massive hole in my worldview.<br><br>My advantage was that I KNEW I was thinly educated. I find I inhabit a world alongside people who do <i>not</i> know how poorly educated they are in this field. They give themselves away by the tribal cry of 'but it's different this time'... ;-))<br><br>A major reason I suspect that it's so difficult for them to see the patterns is that so much of history has been thoroughly mythologized. The patterns have been rewritten. It's most glaring when people start to equate having watched <i>'Spartacus'</i> and <i>'300'</i> with being classically educated, but similar forces pervade more recent history too. <br><br>Here in the UK (so I'm told by friends with kids in school) 'history' is basically reduced to 'The Romans - The Tudors - WWII'. Japanese schools' teaching of the history of the 1930s and 1940s is notoriously laughable. I'm sure most regimes add their own kaleidoscopic lens to their national history. The US may call their lens 'Disney' or 'Pixar' but it's a distorting lens nonetheless, and one must ask Parsifal's question. Little wonder people believe 'it's different this time'. It's different <i>every</i> time if you don't understand what 'it' is in the first place.<br><br>There's a giant clash of competing mythologies taking place right now. Crimea, of course. The Russian myth is not in sympathy with the Ukrainian myth - nor the German, British or American myths of what Crimea is. I still stand by my previous prediction - no war, but Russia will keep Crimea.... however, time will tell.<br><br>Slightly off topic - I'm now reading up on the causes of WWI, just to give the centenary due reverance really, and am shocked how little it matches our myths.

She took me to the basement stacks where she used to do research for her papers at school (in the pre-internet days). One rack we passed contained three shelves full of small printed pamphlets, about the size of a standard sheet of paper folded in half. Curious, I untied one bundle and thumbed through the title sheets. Here in my hand were the "voluntary" guidelines issued by the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Recovery_Administration rel=nofollow>National Recovery Administration</a> to a whole host of retail enterprises. The rules included price controls, hours and wages of workers, hours of operation, and the conditions of discounting items "on sale." Participating shops could display a banner in the window proclaiming "doing our part" or somesuch. Many stores without the banners would face boycotts. <br><br>After perusing a couple pamphlets, I randomly picked up bundles and skimmed the industries affected by these "Code of Fair Competition" rules. Among them were oil and chemical refineries, industrial equipment suppliers, tractor factories, lumber mills, paper mills, grocers, butchers, barbers, clothing stores, etc. Judging by the sheer volume of 10-12 page pamphlets, it seems nearly no corner of the economy of the early 1930s escaped the reach of the (later found unconstitutional) National Industrial Recovery Act. <br><br>Such action would be substantially more complex today in the US, but there's no reason to think that the winner in the ongoing struggle for supremacy in the cycle of <a href=../../2012/05/democracys-arc.html rel=nofollow>anacyclosis</a> shouldn't be able to use political power to similarly transform a more dysfunctional economy (while in turn using such an economic stabilization to build political power).<br><br>On another note, I like to have a good laugh at the phrase "American exceptionalism" by tweaking its intended meaning just a bit. As in, "Everyone on Earth agrees that the US is the greatest threat to world peace, except Americans." A bit more edgy might be, "Every citizen of an industrial country can go to the hospital without worrying about bankruptcy, except Americans."<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c6455838152808537317 title="comment permalink">3/20/14, 7:47 AM</a><br><br>

There are an awful lot of us. At least a few will carry on no matter what happens.<br><br>I'm inclined to think failure to honour national debts is the most likely mode of failure of the global financial system. If we look at sovereign debt, there are three time honoured ways of not paying it off (and it is never paid off ... ever). The nation in question can devalue it currency, it can default, or it can die. The last option reminds me of my uncle's line to his creditors: “I'd rather owe you that money till the day I die than see you out of it.” <br><br>There is a long history of counties defaulting on their debts in the last 250 years, many several times, and often in concert with other nations. In almost all cases the country survived through an initial period of hardship immediately after default and then thrived not long after. Credit was not long denied to a county that defaulted.<br><br>What is different this time is the extent to which the entire financial system is interconnected (though it was interconnected before … hence the tendency for clusters of defaults). So much so that when one country (or even a large bank) defaults, the entire global credit system may go down. It has already come close several time following the last oil price spike. We can expect another such spike if the global economy can gather enough steam. For the sake of argument, lets say the global credit system does collapse as a consequence of that spike or some subsequent one. <br><br>An interruption in global credit would result in an interruption in global trade. It wouldn't be the end of the world, but it sure would look like it at the time. Analogous to the consequences of national default, after a period of extreme hardship, the global credit system would reset. With the reset of global credit, global trade would resume … but at a lower volume than before due to resource depletion. <br><br>What would also be different is that, subsequent to a global credit failure, affected nations would not eventually thrive. We would not be in a period of overall global economic growth. Things would get better, but not better than the state before default. Things would get better than the period immediately after default. So an interruption in global credit could well be the proximate cause of a significant step down in the complexity of the nations affected and an overall reduction in global trade. The ultimate cause, of course, is resource depletion. We can expect some climate change events as well just to keep things interesting.<br><br>So a sudden financial collapse would not crash the global economy once and for all as you indicated, but it certainly would be catastrophic nonetheless. One further point worth mentioning is that there has been a global economy of sorts since at least the Neolithic age. It will continue, just at much lower volumes.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c1469994896709366943 title="comment permalink">3/20/14, 8:30 AM</a><br><br>

The scientific method itself, in the final analysis, is simply a collection of useful gimmicks that help you sidestep confirmation bias. That’s why competent scientists, when they come up with a hypothesis to explain something in nature, promptly sit down and try to think up as many ways as possible to disprove the hypothesis. Those potentials for disproof are the raw materials from which experiments are designed, and only if the hypothesis survives all experimental attempts to disprove it does it take its first step toward scientific respectability.<br><br>It’s not exactly easy to run controlled double-blind experiments on entire societies, but historical comparison offers the same sort of counterweight to confirmation bias. Any present or future set of events, however unique it may be in terms of the fine details, has points of similarity with events in the past, and those points of similarity allow the past events to be taken as a guide to the present and future. This works best if you’ve got a series of past events, as different from each other as any one of them is from the present or future situation you’re trying to predict; if you can find common patterns in the whole range of past parallels, it’s usually a safe bet that the same pattern will recur again."<br><br>What an insightful comparison.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c530487299076853485 title="comment permalink">3/20/14, 8:50 AM</a><br><br>

Those who don't collapse now and beat the rush won't have that advantage, and will probably be busy instead pushing up daisies. Yes, the situation really is that grim.” I think this is the most (dare I use the term) apocalyptic response I've seen you write. Granted it was in response to Hombre's comment about the situation late this century. Still, you used the word “now”. By “pushing up daisies” I assume you mean death by starvation. <br><br>Sorry for being a week late again. But perhaps, in keeping with this week's dual themes of economics and using the past as a guide for the future, you will allow me to sneak this in. <br><br>I thought it might be useful to look at how mass starvation often occurs. Amartya Sen's “Poverty and Famines” is a helpful guide when looking at the causes of mass starvation. Parts of it are written in the wonderfully opaque style fashionable among professional economists; nonetheless I think it yields some useful insights even if you skip the math. It reviews the causes of some of the more spectacular famines of last century. Sen offers the conclusion that people don't generally starve to death because there is not enough food to go around. They die because they can't afford what food there is. <br><br> Sen's study indicates people starve to death for lack of calories. People do not starve to death for lack of protein, vitamins, or minerals. Its not the lack of greens or meat on the plate that leads to starvation. Yes, a person would be malnourished due to lack of these and so possibly eventually die of disease … but not starve to death. What prevented the Inuit from starving on an all meat diet was the enormous amount of fat (and so calories) associated with Arctic marine mammals. Try an all meat diet further south and a person may die of “rabbit starvation”. <br><br>Two strategies present themselves to anyone wishing to avoid starvation: 1) be rich enough to buy the needed calories or 2) grow them yourself. For those whom wealth has evaded, here's a quick look at growing your own calories.<br><br>Roots and grains are what produce the highest yields in carbohydrate calories. Potatoes are king for calories per space required of all roots and grains. They are also very easy to harvest, process, and store (http://homeplaceearth.wordpress.com/2012/10/16/growing-calories/). I've heard some people (not me) can produce 1 lb of potatoes per square foot (sqft). A potato produces 350 calories/lb and so yields about 350 calories per sqft max. Compare this against the next best contender, corn, at about half that i.e. about 180 calories per sqft. Wheat gives roughly half again at about 84 calories per sqft<br><br>A family of five like mine requires 11,400 calories per day (3000 adult male + 2400 adult female + 3x2000 kids). Thus the absolute minimum space required to produce all the calorie requirements of such a family is about 12,000 sqft (11,400 x 365/350). To put this in context, this is over 7 times the space I actually devote to potatoes and assumes 4 times the yield I normally get.<br><br>Just a few sober thoughts for those planning their gardens for this year and the years to come. <br><br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c1802055580162622977 title="comment permalink">3/20/14, 8:57 AM</a><br><br>

Now cachexia begins, but the cancer envisions geoengineering to maintain the near-corpse in a sufficient state for further consumption. What will death of the ecosystem mean from a human perspective? A loss of concentrated energy gradients such as fossil fuels, loss of soils and monocrops, loss of schooling ocean fish that could be hauled out in nets with high EROEI, loss of large herbivores that sustained us early on. There is no reason to believe that remaining humans will not still be growth oriented, feeding upon any resource providing an EROEI high enough to justify the tools, information and behavior necessary to capture it. Eventually nothing remains but diffuse life too small or too sparsely distributed to justify human existence. Anything that can provide net energy will be utilized.

In my opinion, the people who insist that a massive financial crash will be the end of human civilization are simply making the common error of projecting a specific trend out towards infinity, without taking into account the forces that would be there to push back against that trend. In this case it's the trend of the global elites towards neoliberal policies, the belief in which seems to have reached a religious level within policy circles. Of course, many of the things on your list are absolutely forbidden by neoliberal orthodoxy, which leads people into a logical trap:<br><br>Price controls, wage controls, nationalization of industry, etc, are necessary to save the economy from collapse in the event of a financial crash.

I have one quibble about the Holocene hypsithermal/climactic optimum. The temperature effects appear to have been mostly a Northern Hemisphere high-latitude phenomenon - there were temperatures locally up to 4 C/7 F warmer in some spots in the Arctic (although generally more like 2-3 C), but the temperature effect dies down to virtually nothing by the time you reach the subtropics. Reconstructions of the global temperature usually show no temperature increase (or at most a very slight one of ~1 C) averaged across the world.<br><br>The best theories on this involve two of the Milankovitch cycles: around 9000 years ago, axial tilt was at its maximum 24 degrees, and the sun reached perihelion during the Northern summer, causing higher NH temperatures.

The third extinction was again terrestrial and resulted from methane hydrate release from the oceans following another 5 degree spike in temperatures. I do wonder if we are not again experiencing something similar, where anthropogenic warming is replicating the Siberian Traps eruptions.

It has only recently been acknowledged by nutritionists that cooking food makes more calories available. Prior work was mostly based on chemical analysis that assumed "a protein is a protein is a protein", at 4 kcal per gram (same as any carbohydrate). In a world where you have to make every calorie count, it seems to me that one would use fuel only for cooking, use solar cooking when you can (or to pre-heat ingredients before topping up with wood). With well-insulated occupants of a well-insulated home (of minimum volume and surface area), human metabolism may be the space heating system of our future; fuel for space heating may be an unsustainable luxury. (And before you light a fire in the fireplace, find out how wretchedly inefficient they are.) Make sure that your cooking fuel wood has had a year to dry, so none of its energy is wasted driving out moisture as it burns. That requires foresight, to lay up green wood to carry through the next year, and calculation, to know how much that is. Hang on to that slide-rule.<br><br>According to my favorite book on nutrition ("Eat Better, Live Better", Reader's Digest, 1982), the average American male needs 2900 kcal/day at age 25, declining to 2005 kcal/day at 75. In a crisis, we'll probably want to cut back a little, so it's good to have a kitchen scale to weigh portions. As postage rates have changed, obsolete postage scales are very cheap at garage sales!<br><br>I've read that by growing pototoes on a 1/4 acre lot, an Irish family could provide the calories it needed.

The Saker had a great post from earlier today on the latest events in the current crisis. When it comes to broken promises and reneging on treaty commitments, the US government has treated the Russians since the end of the Cold War in much the same manner as it treated the Native American nations back in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the Russians will not tolerate any more bullying from America. The US will find that the Russians are a much tougher enemy than even the strongest Native American tribes ever were. Just ask the Turks, the French, the Germans, the Japanese or the Chechens about that one.<br><br>http://vineyardsaker.blogspot.com/2014/03/are-us-elites-finally-coming-back-to.html<br><br>The comments (both from the author and the readers) about the American ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, are spot on, while the Russian ambassador to the UN had every right to take offense at her petulant and juvenile tirade and warn that there will be further consequences if the Obama administration continues to behave like a bunch of spoiled, badly brought-up children. As we have seen, the Russians don’t go around making empty threats, unlike many Western governments. Ambassador Churkin and the Russian government mean business.<br><br>If the likes of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, John Kerry, Susan Rice and Samantha Power are the best America can do for political and diplomatic leadership, then America is well and truly fracked. I never cease to be amazed at how clueless, incompetent and mind-numbingly stupid the American political class has become. Just when you think these people can’t get any more moronic and self-destructive, they surprise us with yet another example of jaw dropping asininity. David Goldman (AKA Spengler) had a great essay on this very topic several years back towards the end of the Bush administration, and his observations are even more true today than when he wrote these words. <br><br>http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/JH19Ag04.html<br><br>I think we can see the end of the American Empire clearly in sight. This may turn out to be one of the fastest imperial declines in history, and much of it will have been due to the sheer folly of both the American elites and the masses. <br><br>Oswald Spengler believed that the next great civilization would come out of Russia. Many of the leading thinkers of the 19th and early 20th centuries believed the same thing as well. I wonder if part of what we are seeing is the eclipse of the West and the rise of the Russian/Orthodox civilization that Spengler predicted? With the rise of China as a super power, the re-emergence of Russia as a great power, the resurgence of Islam as a force to reckoned with and the internal decay and decadence of the West itself, America and Europe are in much more serious trouble then most people realize.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c216744079967083806 title="comment permalink">3/20/14, 7:18 PM</a><br><br>

If there is a .1% chance of it going off in any one year, and temperatures continue to go up making it more likely year after year, can it be ignored forever?

I really like your approach of using paleoclimate to get a handle on what we can expect, and that's the way I tend to think too.<br><br>I'm reading a good review paper by Hansen et al saying that, based on a large number of proxies worldwide, Holocene hypsithermal temperatures seemed to be hotter by about 0.7 C above preindustrial levels on a global average. There was then a slight cooling trend ending in the Little Ice Age, and then an anthropogenic warming of about 0.8 C starting around 1850.<br><br>So at this stage I think it's fair to say that we've essentially returned to the Holocene hypsithermal, at least using the crude measure of average global temperature. As temperatures keep rising, within 40-80 years we'll hit the peak of the Eemian (2 C above preindustrial or ~1.2 above now, sea level 6-8 m higher). As warming continues, we leave the ice age and move on to the late Pliocene warm period at 3.3-3.0 Ma (about 3.5 C above preindustrial, sea level ~20 m higher, Greenland unglaciated). Going even further will lead to conditions not seen since the Earth entered its current icehouse state. <br><br>Due to lack of enough viable fossil fuels, I strongly doubt we'll manage to jostle the system all the way into Eocene-style hothouse conditions. Even if so, obviously there would still be a variety of survivors ready to undergo adaptive radiation and recolonize the niches left empty by the resulting extinction event. But it would be a very traumatic extinction event while it lasted.<br><br>One of the things I fear about rapid climate change to humans is that we're not sure what the long-term climate requirements of agriculture are. It strikes me as very interesting that agriculture developed, independently and nearly simultaneously, in at least a half-dozen places starting right around the time the climate entered an unusually stable period starting about 10000 years ago. Modern Homo sapiens did exist in the Eemian (which was warm but quite variable with no plateau of stable temperatures), and the ensuing glacial period was full of wild swings up and down until the present interglacial began with the abrupt end of the Younger Dryas. <br><br>Given all this, I wonder if relative long-term climate stability may be critical to the existence of agricultural civilization. If one thing is certain about the future, it's that the Holocene stable phase is over and we will be subject to erratic temperature changes of several degrees, along with rapidly shifting precipitation patterns, for millennia to come. Whether agriculture can survive this is an open question - the history of agriculture is short enough that there really is no historical precedent for climate change this rapid and severe, and it doesn't give me any comfort to know that much smaller local changes have done in civilizations numerous times even during the relative stability of the Holocene.<br><br>I think it's important to note that this time really is different from the short time perspective of agrarian civilization, and its survival isn't guaranteed. Of course it won't fail entirely in the short run (especially with FF-based inputs), but I don't know that this form of human civilization will be viable a millennium or two down the line.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c5096142905077936249 title="comment permalink">3/20/14, 11:00 PM</a><br><br>

I'll look into it as time permits. <br><br>Grebulocities, it's important not to treat agriculture as a single phenomenon. As Colin Tudge points out in <i>Neanderthals, Bandits, and Farmers</i>, agriculture by some standards was already being practiced in 40,000 BCE -- the spread of hazel nuts into deglaciated northern Europe, to name only one example, can only be explained if people were deliberately planting thickets to give themselves a more stable food supply. <br><br>Certain kinds of agriculture are highly vulnerable to climate change; other kinds aren't -- and it's crucial to remember that the tropics suffer very little variation in temperature during climate cycles, so that tropical agriculture will almost certainly go on as the viability of agriculture in the temperate and subarctic regions varies drastically due to changes in temperature and rainfall. Once again, though, I'd encourage you to ask yourself why it's so important for you to be able to insist that it really is different this time...<br><br>Boddah, now factor in large-scale forest dieoff driven by severe droughts that run for centuries, and a general drying out even of parts of the country that don't face drought as such.

The last massive one ~8000 BP in the sea off Norway sent down a huge tsunami. (Inundation by the North Sea was ongoing because of general northern hemisphere ice melt.) A similar tsunami in our next few hundred years would cause enormous loss of life and immense damage. So far six submarine landslides have been identified as occurring during the last 20K years in the northern seas, but not all seem to have generated tsunamis, and not all tsunamis will have reached Britain. <br> You are right that the question has been raised as to whether another bout of rapid melting of ice i.e. Greenland, increases the likelihood of a mega slide. Britain is still tilting because of ‘rebound’ after the weight of kilometres thick ice was removed those 8-10 thousand years ago. There is more to come. <br> I am slightly reassured that there is much less ice in the north than there was back when. Greenland has enough if melted to raise ocean level about 7 metres. This compares with a total de-glaciation melt (mostly in the northern hemisphere) that pretty quickly raised the ocean 120m. The seismic action / landslip potential could be proportionately less, and we might get away with it in the next hundred years or so.<br>I found this informative http://projects.noc.ac.uk/landslide-tsunami/project-information <br>best<br>Phil H<br>PS I think Britain can probably defend against the first one metre rise in sea level. Eventually though after perhaps a century or more, (sure, it could happen much more quickly) we will lose a lot of London and presumably most of London’s sub-ground infrastructure. All our reclaimed farmland will revert to salt marsh (swamp) and we will abandon many historic towns. Tidal surges will overwhelm and remove sea defences. The Eemian interglacial was about 2degC warmer than now and the ocean raised ~7m, although Greenland ice did not melt totally back then. A similar scene appears baked in the cake as some kind of ‘minimum’ over perhaps (we hope) several centuries. I think this account covers facts and conjectures fairly well http://www.aip.org/history/climate/floods.htm <br>Personally, our heritable 2 acres is well above danger as is vast majority of high quality land hereabouts. In my lifetime, that is before 1930 (ahem)? Not a chance!:)<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c8717035431181394947 title="comment permalink">3/21/14, 3:14 AM</a><br><br>

I had no idea how powerfully it would draw on oxygen; not that I would play with (budget) attempting any transmutation experiment without much more research, right now I only have a few brief bursts of Internet each week, so only more modest projects get throughly investigated. Maintaining an inert environment vastly increases the already steep difficulty level! Also, I think that Tom Bannister's metaphor of scrabble for economic viability vs technological feasibility has real merit!<br><br>I eagerly await your report on potential climate disruptions, I am highly invested in Colorado, which is of course vulnerable to water disruption. The tree farm where I am working is being decommissioned, as its owner is looking to retire from that business, and turn the fields into a small farm. The place has excellent water rights (water law in Colorado is a complex, yet surprisingly sensible legal construct) but I am trying to encourage some modifications in how the place is going to be transformed into a farm which will make it more competitive in drought prone conditions, which mostly means preventing the wind from pulling humidity out of the soil. My suggestion is to use the equipment that exists and runs well now to create earthen wind breaks, and experiment with drought tolerant desert shrub based hedges. Wind is such a dominant factor in this area, more than is generally discussed. <br><br>When the gravy train does run out here it will be harsh because SO MUCH of the economy is phony, even by American standards. I estimate that this place will get hit very hard during the next couple disruptions, but I really hope to be able to support myself, even if most of the population has to exodus to uncertainty. Its a gamble, but I don't have to out run the bear, so to speak. I love this place, but it is remarkably over populated relative to natural resource base. So I build relationships with the best people I can find, learn from then whatever they will share, and help them when I can.<br><br>But I am doing better at producing much of my own food, and hopefully enough food to give a lot away this year, barter some too. And I have lots of friend who I work together with to support several different little garden projects, including surveying for a raised bed for my lodge this Saturday! <br><br>I think it was latefall who suggested high value small mass goods be added to the 'list'. Well there is a lot to say for it, but also consider in all matters how tempting your projects would be to thieves, pirates, and thugs. There is no way to completely avoid this danger of course, but if you make things that are easy to carry off and sell that might be a liability. Not to say that it shouldn't be tried, in fact the low survival rate suggests that many should try any worthy project. As far as the 'last man standing' goes, I think that those folks are already in their game of musical chairs, and it is too late to join that game for all but a couple players, and if you are trying to preserve something dependent of that last stand, it is best to be eagerly working on an alternative, either a different way to do the same thing, or more likely a second line of work. <br><br>One factor about the coming time is how unprecedentedly common metals have become, it very much upsets the 'balance of power' concerning what strategies are dominant, and I think offers some optimism to the pneumatic punk, or what ever technology works out. Any body who can make life easier for farmers by working metal, or retrofitting existing technology, into things that aid with food raising will be in a good spot. Small engine repair means that field work which once took a horse's appetite of precious biomass to support can be replaced by a few hours of fueling a 2 hp engine running a wince plow, at that usage and treated with respect a half decent engine will out last any one of us, unless it gets locked in a warlord's flooded basement one winter :/<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c2668800654571620604 title="comment permalink">3/21/14, 8:33 AM</a><br><br>

And ignoring the blights, beetles, and other impacts on the forests, nor the costs to the soil of trying to replicate such fast growing trees year over year. Might be nice to have the passenger pigeon to help fertilize—oh, whoops! In short, simple math falls well short of the long-term realities of trying to burn that much wood for that many people over that much land.<br><br>Poop-based heating is very unlikely; I am familiar with it, as in Pakistan they use it as a cooking fuel, leaving cow-dung patties with bits of straw to dry like dalek bulges on the walls of their huts. But that was for cooking, not heating; those in the Himalaya instead walk around at night when it is cold out. Hence the survivors smiling while they ascend a path at 13,000 feet carrying thrice the load you bear. The Pakistani are also presently gnawing their way through what remains of the trees and scrub, lacking other heating material.

Unfortunate, but not unexpected...<br><br>Orwellian, oh, granted. My guess, though, is that future empires won't be limited to Roman standards -- a Spanish or Chinese empire circa 1500 is wholly within reach of future societies, and no doubt plenty of clever technologies will be invented to make the most of what energy sources exist once it's become finally, brutally clear that the heyday of fossil fuels is never coming back. <br><br>Quos Ego, exactly -- this is what extreme climate change looks like. As for self-hatred, I'm coming to the uneasy and reluctant conclusion that I'm going to have to spend some time exploring the festering mess at the dark heart of the American dream, because that bizarre concatenation of entitlement, self-loathing, hubris and apocalyptic despair seems peculiarly American to me. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Phil, to get ahead of things a bit, you have three main causes of tsunamis in the oceans right next to a deglaciating region: earthquakes due to isostatic rebound, underwater landslips due to unstable terrain left behind by melting ice sheets, and methane hydrate "burps" due to the relatively rapid warming of the shallow sea floor. Those can act individually as well as together. In this case, I don't expect anything as extreme as the <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12244964 rel=nofollow>tsunami that dug the English channel</a>, but ordinary tsunamis are quite bad enough when combined with rising sea levels.<br><br>JP, before the 20th century it was normal for rural areas to have fertility rates well above breakeven, and cities to have rates well below breakeven -- thus the constant flow of rural people into the city.

There hasn't been the collapse of a continental glacier since records started to be kept, so we're flying blind.

By contrast, if you embrace the "it's different this time" narrative, you're normally wrong. <br><br>Ray, if you're learning how to work salvaged metal, you're getting in on the ground floor of a trade that's going to keep a lot of people gainfully employed and socially valued for many centuries to come...<br><br>Max, thanks -- yes, I've seen it!<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c7686305124306589212 title="comment permalink">3/21/14, 2:41 PM</a><br><br>

I've ordered it and look forward to reading it.<br><br>If I had to guess about his thesis without having read his book, it would be that so-called hunter-gatherer societies engage in substantial manipulation of their environment to encourage the growth of useful organisms, such as hazels, and that they've been doing this since long before what we think of as agriculture, possibly as long as there have been modern Homo sapiens.<br><br>I wouldn't dispute that, but I'm more concerned with the independent development of intensive agriculture in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, China, at least one site in sub-Saharan Africa, Mesoamerica, the Andes highlands, and the New Guinea highlands, plus anywhere else we don't know about. These all developed in the time frame 10000-5000 BP, and given that most of these sites were inhabited well before this, it seems reasonable to believe that intensive agriculture (of the sort that supports population densities higher than hunter-gatherers and horticulturalists can) required the relatively stable climate of the Holocene to develop. This is true even in tropical regions, which experience major precipitation changes with global climate even as local temperatures stay fairly constant.<br><br>I've spent quite a while trying to convince myself that this time wasn't very different on a long-term basis, but I've come to the conclusion that this is largely incorrect, at least from the perspective of modern Homo sapiens. Although I doubt we'll reach Eocene level hothouse conditions, a rapid temperature spike to 3-5 C above preindustrial levels over the next couple centuries would be far outside the range that humans have experienced since intensive agriculture developed; it would also represent conditions the Earth hasn't seen for several million years. We have no idea how modern Homo sapiens will deal with this environment, although I certainly do expect some humans will make it - we're a remarkably weedy species relative to all the other apes.<br><br>I like your comparison of the formation of large igneous provinces to our current situation. Our abrupt rise in greenhouse gases along with particulates does generally match the outcome of a quick flood-basalt eruption. I will note though that the most severe one in known geological history, the Siberian traps, were likely the trigger of the Permian-Triassic extinction, and the events you mentioned besides the Columbian eruption are all associated with minor extinction events. The combination of climate change and human predation could easily turn the Holocene/Anthropocene extinction event into the sixth major extinction, albeit probably not quite as bad as the P-T extinction.<br><br>In short, I really don't want to believe this time is different, but based on the evidence I'm forced to conclude it is at the least different from anything humans have experienced since H. sapiens evolved. Agriculture may survive or it may not, but either way we are going to enter a climate regime totally outside the experience of H. sapiens. Of course NTE is a joke, but I think we have some reason to fear for the long-term survival of human civilization.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c485401140120828186 title="comment permalink">3/21/14, 9:59 PM</a><br><br>

They're stuck between America's empire and a resurgent Russia, and nothing they can possibly do can satisfy both. It's not going to be pretty, whatever happens. <br><br>Mr. Geronimo, the native peoples of the tropical belt worldwide had wholly functional ways of doing agriculture, and some of those -- especially in the Old World -- remain solidly in place. Too many pests is usually a good sign that what you're doing isn't yet in balance with the local ecology. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, I'm not sure what the current state of science is about the time scale of the beginning of a glaciation, but last I heard it was a fairly slow process. My working guess, based on that and other paleoclimatological data, is that we've simply delayed the process a bit, and after a millennium or so of unusually warm temperatures, Milankovich forcing will bring on the next round of continental glaciers. Still, that's something I need to research!<br><br>Cathy, in your place I'd relocate at least one state further east, and I'd do it now. I mean that in all seriousness. I'd hate to see your comments stop suddenly, and hear maybe years later that you were one of the hundreds of thousands who died in the big Cascadia quake. <br><br>Boddah Meep, I think you're quite wrong. Forests across much of the Third World have been devastated in recent decades by people trying to rely on wood for heat, and the ecological consequences have been severe. I wish it would get through more people's heads that natural systems are not just sitting there waiting for human beings to exploit them!<br><br>LatheChuck, excellent! And it's exactly the vitamins etc. that a small backyard garden is well suited to supply. Famine in the absolute sense -- that is, sheer lack of calories -- is another matter, and fortunately not one that's likely to be an issue in the US; as the price of food spikes, there's a lot of vacant acreage in regions not suited to corporate megafarms that can very easily be (and in some cases already is being) turned over to potato growing and the like. Malnutrition in protein, vitamins, and other noncaloric needs is a significant source of illness in hard times, and your victory garden will help mightily with that -- especially with cold frames. <br><br>Janet, that's probably a good idea. I've been spending a lot of time recently, while prepping garden beds and doing other useful chores, thinking about the politics of despair in contemporary America, and relating it to such things as our death-fetish for vampires and zombies. It's a complex issue, and one that is going to need much research and pondering. <br><br>Onething, the western Roman empire and the classic lowland Maya are two very good examples. I'll be talking about the depopulation explosion in our future at some length in the upcoming series of posts. <br><br>Grebulocities, you're still missing the whole point of my post. Historical events aren't "different" or "the same" in absolute terms. In every present or future situation, without exception, there are differences from past examples, and there are similarities to past examples. Why are you fixating on the differences, rather than being willing to learn from the similarities? <br><br>Anselmo, well, many varieties of Christianity have very little to do with the teachings of that guy from Nazareth, but we still use the phrase "devout Christian" to describe believers in them!<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c5761887151286041269 title="comment permalink">3/22/14, 9:57 AM</a><br><br>

Places where the government is responsive to the needs of its people don't have famines.<br><br>Some famines are political, used by rulers to starve their opponents. Some are economic; there is food in the markets but the poor have no money to buy it. Landowners force farmers to grow export crops instead of food for their families. And of course war drives people off the land, destroys crops, and prevents them from getting to market. <br><br>I think a totalitarian regime capable of stopping large populations from having access to food isn't likely to arise domestically, though it could be imposed by foreign conquest.

Besides the West coast, there have been serious quakes in Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Wyoming, etc. Then there's the New Madrid zone around Memphis, South Carolina, and some issues in New England from Canada. Not to forget Alaska and the Southern Hawaiian Islands.<br><br>Check out your local hazards at:<br><a href=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/ rel=nofollow>http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/</a><br><br>Many other state/nation geology/mapping/emergency preparedness agencies have similar hazard maps.<br><br>Moving from Oregon to Idaho may be "from the frying pan into the fire".<br><br>The real hazards come from immediate location: what kind of ground is your house built on, how steep is the terrain? Northern California, Oregon and Washington coasts will be in for more nasty tsunamis in due time, living on the coast seems to be a bad idea - we're talking huge waves + land subsidence. The Seattle area (and some of Portland, OR and Vancouver, BC) in particular is toast, since it's mostly soft land that will undergo "liquefaction" under shaking, like the Marina district in San Francisco during the '89 quake. <br><br>Building construction details matter greatly. Some buildings in the Marina with lots of garage doors on the first floor just pancaked, anybody on the first floor or two got smushed. And often people got trapped on upper floors and couldn't get out - some burned. Fires after quakes are a big issue - do you have automatic gas shutoff valves, water heaters, etc. securely braced? Un-reinforced masonry walls (including foundation walls), un-braced cripple walls, heavy roof tiles without adequate shear bracing, hmmm - even add-on solar systems on the roof could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Masonry chimneys? Look nice, bad if they topple onto you/through the roof. etc. etc. etc.<br><br>Details in Yanev's book.<br><br>I'd be concerned about water availability, and somewhat about being downwind of volcanic eruptions in Idaho, and if you go further East in Idaho, you get into another bad quake zone and the whole Yellowstone Caldera thing.<br><br>But if Cathy's on the coast or along a river valley leading inland, anywhere within reach of a 100' tsunami (e.g. below 100-200' above sea level depending on distance inland), or built on soft sediments, or beneath a questionable dam or slidable hillside, etc. - yes, moving should be considered.<br>The <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_subduction_zone#Forecasts_of_the_next_major_earthquake rel=nofollow>Cascadia Subduction Zone</a> has a 37% chance of going off in the next 50 years.

We're remarkably difficult to exterminate. If you'd like to suggest that industrial civilization is toast and the human population of this planet a few centuries from now is going to be a lot smaller than it is today, due to anthropogenic climate change among other factors, I won't argue for a moment, but extinction? It'll take a good deal more than one millennium of chaotic climate to do us in. <br><br>Glenn, where you are, I wouldn't worry -- the Puget Sound islands are made of compact glacial till, which is nearly as sturdy as rock under seismic stress. (I rode out the 1965 and 2001 earthquakes on ridges of glacial till in the Seattle area, with minimal effects in both cases.) Urban zones are quite another matter, even where they're not built on uncompacted fill subject to liquefaction -- and of course you'll be able to get supplies by sea after the first few days, where the mouth of the Columbia is expected to be impassable until dredged. As for Deesee, sure -- why do you think I'm a couple of hundred miles abd a mountain range inland?<br><br>Unknown Deborah, that seems realistic enough. <br><br>Grebulocities, you might want to read through the last two sentences of your comment, and notice that they flatly contradict each other. Either we can use the past as a guide to the future, with appropriate adjustments to deal with the unique features of the situation under discussion, or we can't. It's been utterly fascinating to me to watch people -- you're far from the only one -- go into a mental spasm over this point, repeating "but it's different this time, but it's different this time" over and over again as though it's their mantra.<br><br>Shane, well, I've talked about cultural senility, so we may be on the same page. <br><br>Sunseeker, I grew up in Seattle, so am very familiar with earthquake issues. If there's reason to think that the Cascadia subduction zone is about to let go, Idaho is a much better place to be; even if you get an earthquake there, it's not going to be 9 point something on the Richter scale -- that's the base scenario for most studies of the next Cascadia quake -- and you're not going to be left without water, power, or functional roads for three months, which is what Oregon's saying will happen even if all goes well. <br><br>The tsunamis are another matter. Public safety officials are publicly admitting that there will be no way to get anybody out of a whole line of vulnerable coastal towns during the 20 minutes or so between the earthquake and the first tsunami impact -- the roads will be impassable due to earthquake damage -- and so, barring a few very lucky individuals, the entire populations of all those towns will die. It's really a very grim prospect.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c3139296305892713845 title="comment permalink">3/22/14, 4:35 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not trying to argue that the current situation is so unlike the past that we can't make use of it at all. All I am trying to say is that the unique features of our current predicament are far enough outside Holocene conditions that using the past to predict the future may result in more error than we would usually expect to see. I'm making a fairly "moderate" argument: this time has some important differences that may make using the past to model the future a worse approximation than it usually would be. I'm not saying that "this time is different" in such a way as to make the past irrelevant, and it's certainly no mantra of mine.<br><br>The reason I'm saying all this is that I've spent quite a while over the past year reading climatological literature, and I'm struck by both the similarities and differences from past events. There have been carbon spikes before, and there have also been ice ages. But a carbon spike on the order of a moderate flood basalt eruption, during an ice age interglacial, is something we don't really have any good analogues for in the paleoclimate record. The climate has also been unusually unstable over the past few million years, oscillating wildly between glacial and interglacial phases with very small forcing changes. We're giving the climate system a huge shove towards warmer temperatures, which hasn't happened during this ice age, and it's really hard to say how the system will respond. The current ice age has also featured the lowest CO2 concentrations ever recorded during its glacial phases, at ~180 ppm, and since the climate response to GHGs is a logarithmic function of their concentration, there's reason to believe that an increase from the interglacial 280 ppm to 600 ppm over the course of a couple centuries would have an effect far larger than, say, a spike from ~1500 ppm to ~2000 ppm as happened several times during the Jurassic and Cretaceous. <br><br>The past can give us some general information (e.g. large parts if not all of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are going to collapse over the next several centuries), but the details of what will happen and the effects on human civilization are really hard to guess because the sort of climate we're likely to see by 2050-2100 hasn't happened in the history of modern humans.<br><br>That doesn't mean the past is useless as a guide to what may happen, but it does mean that the differences are large enough to introduce a large amount of uncertainty, above and beyond the considerable level of uncertainty we have in predicting the future in general.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c4543742848481712589 title="comment permalink">3/22/14, 8:50 PM</a><br><br>

Did I mention that I have grand plans for thornless blackberries as well as expanding the strawberry production next season? I’ve dug so much soil and relocated so many plants, I’m a bit tired…<br><br>The good <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_von_Mueller rel=nofollow>Baron Sir Ferdinand Jacob Heinrich von Mueller</a> would approve given that he planted so many blackberries about the state. He was quite busy up here in the mountain range with plants (as well as the rest of the state) with the now historic hill station gardens and he had quite a lot of supporters. It was a shame that society moved past his scientific concepts and worldview and eventually gave it to him in the neck. He is an historical inspiration to me, but also an object lesson about learning to bend with the winds.<br><br>Anyway, back to the main point which is that I'm attempting to vertically integrate my production here. One of my suppliers for fruit has become a bit erratic and I wish to minimise my dependency on them. However, it requires both effort and infrastructure. There really is no point feeding ripe and juicy blackberries (fruit, leaves and canes) to stumpy the wallaby...<br><br>I got some great night time video footage of fatso the wombat cruising the herbage too last night and will post it to youtube over the next week!<br><br>I'm not sure whether it just my devious brain, but if I was in authority in Russia, I'd wait for a cold snap in Europe and have an industrial accident on the gas supply lines. Oh yeah, I'd probably insure the facilities through a Western European insurance under writer too, just for good measure. No one can possibly get upset about an industrial accident eliminating gas supplies to Europe, could they? Anyway, that's how I'd make a statement about who has the upper hand.<br><br>As an interesting side note, I managed for the second time to get the wood fire here lit without matches this evening using steel and flint. By the time that it got started, I was so warm myself, I'm not sure I needed the heat... Matches are good... Mmmm matches...<br><br>Stumpy and co have been busy eating some of my edibles because of the lack of rain here. I even caught a rosella (bird), ripping chunks off an elderberry this afternoon and having a good old snack. It has left me thinking about the very real benefits of hedgerows as a natural fence as I'm observing what plants the animals and birds don't like eating. It is all interesting stuff. They do however completely surprise me from time to time. Oh well.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c7285488791293680532 title="comment permalink">3/23/14, 2:54 AM</a><br><br>

Furthermore, sometimes, a difference in scale does produce a difference in kind. If you start out with 40C water and decrease the temperature by 35C, you'll move from warm water to really cold water. Decrease the temperature by another 10C, and you get solid ice. Difference in scale produced a difference in kind (liquid vs. solid). <br><br>Anyway, I don't feel any need (emotional or otherwise) to claim that "it's different this time." I just think it's important to find correct parallels. If you want to know what happens when a city gets hit by an M9 earthquake, then you need to look what happened the last few times when cities were hit by M9 earthquakes. Studying the aftermath of M6 earthquakes is more likely to mislead you than to elucidate the matter. <br><br>Will human population decrease 20-fold in the next 100-300 years, as you claim it will? I don't know. But assuming you are right, the correct parallels are those where human population decreased at least 10-fold. (And we're talking 10-fold population decrease over a large - or at least isolated - territory, and not just in this or that city. After all, any given urban area can become heavily depopulated due to migration to surrounding rural areas.) <br><br>So has human population ever experienced something like a 20-fold decrease over a relatively large territory before? I don't have the numbers, and I'm willing to learn from those who know more than I do, but I was under the impression that the population of the Western Roman Empire didn't decline anywhere close to that. However, unless I'm very much mistaken, Easter Island collapse, Mayan collapse, as well as the collapse of the North American Indian tribes (due to both disease and warfare) entailed population losses of roughly that magnitude, and so those collapses might offer a more useful guide for us. And if these are our guides, then chances are that the cultural discontinuity between us and our descendants (of course, I realize that the majority of us will not have any biological descendants; I certainly won't: I have no children and don't plan to) will be far greater than the discontinuity between the Roman civilization and the Christian Europe that succeeded it. <br><br>More to the point, if this is the sort of population decrease that we're looking at, then I think that attempts at cultural conservation are basically a waste of time. The survivors are unlikely to conserve any skills that aren't essential (and I mean essential, not merely useful) for keeping body and soul together, and perhaps a few folk songs and popular beliefs, too. Geology? Ecology? Literacy and numeracy? Forget about it! <br><br>None of which is to say that our descendants won't eventually develop rich and complex cultures. I'm sure they will. I'm just saying that, if we're looking at a 20-fold population decrease, those complex cultures are likely to have almost nothing to do with ours, they'll be built pretty much from scratch.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c4383179025954403800 title="comment permalink">3/23/14, 3:08 AM</a><br><br>

I love your blog, and I find it very informative, but I get the sense that you're not very careful with numbers. Concerning the collapse of the industrial civilization, I find that your qualitative and quantitative predictions contradict each other. You spend much of your time arguing that the so-called fast collapse proponents are wrong. And yet, according to your very own scenario, the global population could undergo a 20-fold decrease in 100 years. I ask you to give me a qualitative description of a 20-fold population decrease in 100 years. (Not a 2-fold decrease, or 3-fold, or 4-fold. I mean a 20-fold global population decrease in 100 years. You said you expected the global population to decrease to about 5% of what it currently is in one to three centuries, so a 20-fold decrease in 100 years is within the range of what you predicted.) <br><br>For comparison, black death decreased the population of Europe "only" by about one third (so it wasn't even a 2-fold decrease). The Holocaust wiped out "only" about two-thirds (a 3-fold decrease) of European Jews. So what might bring about a 20-fold global population decrease in 100 years? Plague followed by genocide followed by plague followed by genocide, and all that of global proportions. During the black plague, the worst hit localities saw about 80% of their population wiped out. If the global population undergoes a 20-fold decrease in 100 years, then those communities that decrease in size by "only" 80% (a 5-fold decrease) will be the "lucky" ones. The "unlucky" ones will be completely wiped out. <br><br>The qualitative description of collapse that you give is consistent with a 2-fold, or maybe even 3-fold or 4-fold population decrease (it depends on whether one takes your best or worst case scenario) in 100 years. But it isn't consistent with a 20-fold population decrease in 100 years. If the global human population decreases 20-fold in 100 years, then anybody living through that (and that would include most readers of your blog) will experience it as apocalypse. If you don't want to call it apocalypse, then that's just quibbling about terminology.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c3272182230311821087 title="comment permalink">3/23/14, 5:10 AM</a><br><br>

I think fetishizing apocalypse fills the role that fetishizing war did for early 20th century Europe. They got their war(s) alright, but the effect once the dust settled after WWII , was hardly the effect they were going for at the outset of WWI . I imagine we'll try just as hard for apocalypse, to bring down the curtain on it all, but I imagine once the dust has settled, the effect will be somewhat less than what the apocalypse fetishists are hoping for. It won't be for lack of trying. I think the whole, "but it's different this time" , is just another expression of the oversized American ego. <br>Regarding Russia and the West, I simply can't imagine western Europe not occupying a privileged place as a preferred client state in a future Russian empire. The West would simply be too coveted a prize for Russia, and Russia values western Europe too much on a cultural level, containing both Rome, Greece, and historical Christendom. Russia values western Europe as much, if not more, than the U.S., and even though being a privileged Russian client state will be a step down from being a privileged American client state, that's more to do with the age of extravagance coming to an end rather than Russia's value of the West.

I was completely unaware of the good Baron. An interesting figure. I'll look forward to seeing Fatso on video.<br><br>Isis, I'm using the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and that of the classic Lowland Maya as my main parallels here, and in both cases population levels dropped to rather less than 10% of precollapse levels. In neither case were literacy, numeracy, or some degree of cultural continuity lost. I'll save a detailed study of collapse demographics for the upcoming series of posts, but the very short form is that it's not the big flashy catastrophes that contribute the most to population decline -- it's the simple excess of deaths over births that you get in a declining civilization due to decreased public health, poor nutrition, and economic troubles. <br><br>The easiest way to understand this is to put it in personal terms. Let's say your circle of acquaintance -- the people you know well enough to keep track of, including family and friends -- has a hundred people in it. According to the CDC, the crude death rate in America these days averages out to <a href=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm rel=nofollow>0.799% per year</a>, so you might expect to attend one funeral most years. The crude birth rate is <a href=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/births.htm rel=nofollow>12.6 per 1000 population</a>, so you might get one birth announcement in an average year, and two every so often. <br><br>That birth rate, by the way, has been <a href=http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/06/news/economy/birth-rate-low/ rel=nofollow>dropping precipitously for the last few years</a>, which is standard; in hard times, fewer babies are born. Now imagine that over the years ahead, the crude birth rate drops steadily and the death rate rises. Ten years from now, you're getting a birth announcement every three years, since most people you know can't afford more kids (or any at all), and you're attending three funerals a year. Life goes on, and your circle of acquaintance may stay the same size as new people enter it to replace the dead, but it doesn't take many decades of this before you've got a population that's a very small fraction of the original. (I encourage you to crunch the numbers yourself -- crude birth rate of 4 per thousand, crude death rate 2.4% per year, which are by no means uncommon in such situations -- and watch how it plays out.)<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c322885137494149752 title="comment permalink">3/23/14, 10:54 AM</a><br><br>

Unfortunately they'll be full of radioactive waste, and nobody will be able to get close to them for a quarter of a million years, which will limit the tourism possibilities somewhat. <br><br>Shane, it's a good parallel. As for western Europe, that's still an open question. It would be just as practical for them to orient themselves toward China and India, secure their near abroad in eastern Europe, and chuckle as western Europe descends into Third World status. <br><br>Pintada, you're engaging in the standard rhetorical tricks of climate apocalyptics here: that is, listing the positive feedback loops while ignoring all the negative ones, and laboriously cherrypicking the peer reviewed literature for the most extreme scenarios while ignoring all the others. This is why, to return to the point of this week's post, it's necessary to check your reasoning against the evidence of history -- in this case, paleoclimatological studies of previous greenhouse and super-greenhouse events -- to see what actually happens. This approach points out, among other things, that the absurd conclusions you mention are, in fact, absurd, and the interplay of positive and negative feedback loops tends to produce a sigmoid (S-shaped) curve -- rather like the temperature curve we've actually seen in recent years, with warming slowing down sharply of late. Mind you, it'll go up again as greenhouse forcing continues; as each threshold is passed, we'll likely see a burst of warming, followed by stabilization at a hotter level as the negative feedback looks kick in -- which is, again, what the paleoclimatological data suggest is normal.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c8398000621868298519 title="comment permalink">3/23/14, 11:10 AM</a><br><br>

Let's see, pie are squared, so around 2.83e+05 square feet so 8.48e+13 square feet for the American population of 3.00e+08, or converting to square miles, 3.04e+06. Then from wolframalpha.com we find that America has 1.17 million square miles of forest, or 1.17e+06 in scientific notation. So no, it is not viable for 300 million Americans to each have a 300 foot radius or so clearcut—the break-even point (where no forest remains) would be for families of about seven. Pakistan has an average household size of 6.8 (per the Census Report of Pakistan 1998) and lo, they are busy destroying the woods. Actually leaving any forest behind would require some combination of lowered population, extended families, and smaller clearcuts, though those numbers would greatly depend on the percentage of the forest that could be clearcut, how much forest can be grown, and how this state would be maintained over time. Otherwise, I am sorry, but your numbers do not appear viable for current population levels and extant forest stocks.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c1585586075838461375 title="comment permalink">3/23/14, 11:17 AM</a><br><br>

(We now know that male pattern baldness is caused by testosterone and has nothing to do with how you brush your hair.)<br><br>My plea is that, since "shibboleth" does not actually mean what Samuelson and others want it to mean... we need a word to express that latter meaning. "Old wives' tale" is the closest I can think of, but even that is not precise, because there is the possibility that an old wives' tale can be true, such as "Chamomile tea relaxes you". It also seems silly to blame vast societal misunderstandings upon old grandmothers when young virile pundits spout them constantly.<br><br>I should think this is very relevant to the Archdruid Report, since JMG is constantly discussing fallacies in conventional wisdom. He just named another one "American Delusionism" today. What is the name of the class of delusions to which American Delusionism belongs?<br><br>Anyone got a word they know of which suits this purpose, or can anyone make up a clever new word or turn of phrase??<br><br>Thanks!<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c716880688994174996 title="comment permalink">3/23/14, 12:13 PM</a><br><br>

For example, "2+2=5" is a falsehood and a fallacy, and "Trout live in trees" a delusion, but the number of people who make decisions and take action on those ideas is vanishingly small. On the other hand, delusions such as JMG's "American Delusionalism" shape the history and policies of huge nations and wars; and, millions of people probably still brush their hair a certain way because their Gramma told them to.<br><br>The more I think about our lack of a pat word for this concept, the more it fascinates me. It might be marginally easier to fight these widespread delusions if we had a word for them which explicitly illuminates the aspect of social and cultural approval behind the fallacy in question. For example, various racist 'shibboleths' such as, members of X ethnicity are genetically less intelligent -- at one time, a time which is arguably not over with yet, these were the conventional wisdom despite little objective proof. Or, even in the case of brushing one's hair: the delusion carries with it the hidden social judgment that it's better not to be bald even though there is little one can do to control it, high-tech medicines aside. Plenty of past societies thought that being bald was attractive, yet again reinforcing my plea that a mere logical fallacy or delusion is not the same as a "shibboleth" in Samuelson's meaning. A "shibboleth" in this sense carries with it the momentum of widespread societal approval.<br><br>Also fascinating... the two meanings (Samuelson's modern meaning, and the dictionary meaning) are very different yet closely related. Almost anywhere I could use Samuelson's meaning, I could also substitute the official dictionary meaning, and my discourse would still make sense.

Still, I wonder where you got those numbers. The death rate doesn't seem outrageous, but that birth rate seems very, very low. It's very low under any circumstances, but I'll grant you that it doesn't seem outlandishly low if your population is rather old (think Japan), you're in the midst of a major crisis, and contraception and/or abortion is readily available. However, after a few decades of collapsing public health, one would expect old people to become relatively few and far between. For a population made up mostly of people of reproductive age (high death rate means people generally die before reaching old age, and low birth rate means there aren't many children), 4 per thousand birth rate is very, very low. It means that most women never give birth (not merely that none of their children survive to adulthood - under those circumstances, the death rate should be much higher - but that they never give birth in the first place), which is quite an assumption even in worst of times, and it's hard to imagine it could be sustained for a century plus some. So how did you come up with those numbers? <br><br>(Blogger is misbehaving, so this might be a double - or triple? - post.

Your question was: "as you are right in the firing line, does it ring bells with you?"<br><br>Yes, well, I'm right in the firing line. The forest here has a history of wildfires on about a 40 year basis and time is running out before the next one is due. It doesn’t have to be that way though and this is a source of frustration for me.<br><br>The author described the linguistics problems surrounding the descriptive: "climate change". My perspective is that this is an ambiguous term at best and somehow a few years back was introduced in place of "global warming". Change is an ambiguous term, whilst the earlier descriptive was pointing in a certain direction. That change always interested me as I felt that the narrative was hijacked and something else was inserted into its place. Dunno.<br><br>As you asked for my perspective, I can only tell you that during the fires in February, when I noted that members of the local fire brigade evacuated the area, then I too got out. People are social animals and look for confirmation bias to support their point of view.<br><br>I also note that the author himself can't seem to make the connection between his own actions and climate change. He boasted about travelling up and down the east coast of the US interviewing people. Has he no idea that such an activity contributes to climate change? There seemed to be no acknowledgement of that fact, which seems weird to me. I spoke with someone locally who was telling me how they were writing a letter to the Greens (local political party) (whilst on an aircraft to Hobart) about climate change and how they felt very passionately about the subject. The lack of connection between their actions and consequences was just odd. No disrespect to them, but I just don't get it.<br><br>As to reinvesting in lives, well that is something I do know about. However, the essay made the assumption that insurance funds would be available to rebuild lives. I question this assumption, but perhaps that is just me. The Black Saturday bushfires of February 2009 destroyed 2,000 houses and burnt about 450,000 hectares. The Queensland floods two years ago took out 40,000 houses. I read that the insurance council of Australia was pretty annoyed because most home owners took the payouts from the floods and upgraded kitchens and bathrooms whilst ignoring flood prevention works. On the other hand 173 people died in one night during the fires, so I had to build one of the few fire retardant houses on the continent because the building codes changed. The people who were actually burnt out received exemptions because of the circumstances. Now they just put a blanket ban on permits for living in these locations. Just sayin...<br><br>Last weeks discussion about solar electricity also made the very big assumption that the grid would be operational and no one questioned this.<br><br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c7154171241329194479 title="comment permalink">3/24/14, 1:20 AM</a><br><br>

The author has links to transition towns. Right. Both groups that I am involved in are part of the Transition town movement. I will point out that I am one of the younger members of both groups and am slowly working with them to reframe their focus into practical responses. My gut feel is that the Transition town movement is just feel good noise. It is not even close to being enough.<br><br>I take issue with the author’s dismissal of individual asset protection / response. Mostly because I'm actively trying to minimise the risk of the inevitable happening here. His call for a collective response is lazy and only serves to reinforce the status quo and is typical of an activist. Someone has to provide for an anchor around which others can seek assistance. You cannot provide assistance if you are also seeking it at the same time. Community arises around the anchors.<br><br>Nick Minchin (pity it wasn’t Tim Minchin!) is a politician and he merely reflects the will of the party and community that support him. I expect nothing better.<br><br>The difficulty is that scientists are actually asking for funds with which to study the impacts of climate change. This is a difficult bind and not a terribly good look. In effect they are shilling it for the man and there is no easy way around for them. If theoretically you were a scientist, how do you propose the theory that manmade actions are causing global warming without also sucking at the teat of industrial surplus, for that is what they are doing?<br><br>Apologies if this is a bit full on, but I get what the author is trying to say, but he is essentially asking someone else to pay the price and lose access to their perquisites.

Although, in all honesty, I reckon he'd be breaking me about some of the methods employed here, kind of like your nonna might, but worse because of his unrelenting adherence to the scientific method. hehe! Mind you, he would be very much of the old school scientist variety and not unhappy at all about getting out into the field and observing nature.<br><br>I had an interesting thought yesterday as I came across an article about biochar in a gardening catalogue. It occurred to me that perhaps some people may really like the concept of biochar because it completely disregards the whole messy nature thing about having to deal with manures (ie. the yuk factor). It also tends to not be a process that you'd see in nature (except maybe as a by-product of repeated cool burns over a long period of time) and provides a role for people in natural systems? Dunno.<br><br>Hi Glenn. I use about 2 to 3 trees a year here for firewood. They do need to season for about 24 months (in comparison to your experience) because they are incredibly dense hardwood. They do have the benefit of being very fast growing and as such there are literally tens of thousands of them here just on my block. The birds and animals primarily live on only the oldest trees as they have hollows where branches have fallen off, so I only select from those that will never become prime specimens and are mostly less than 30 years old. I wouldn't want to have to supply an entire town with firewood, but there is little no chance of me keeping ahead of the growth here, even when there are repeated droughts.<br><br>The funny thing about timber harvesting is that no one seems to consider that in taking the timber out of the forest, a huge chunk of the fertility of that area disappears.

It seems to be paywalled and I don't remember the headline so I can't link to it, but here are points that I recall.<br><br>1. India, Indonesia and the Philippines have birthrates above replacement level, though nowhere as high as the birthrates in parts of Africa. One major country, I forget which, is right at replacement level, which is 2.1 births per woman. The other listed countries, about half a dozen including China, Japan, Vietnam, and Singapore, are well below replacement levels.<br><br>2. The drop in birthrates seems to be driven by urbanization. One section of the article contained quotes from young city dwellers answering the question of why they were having fewer children. The universal answer was the high cost of city living and the desire to educate what children they have. Education is expensive.<br><br>3. In many parts of Asia, most young people have migrated to cities, leaving the rural elderly to fend for themselves, without adequate remittances or any government support. Several national governments have initiated programs to make the rural elderly more economically self sufficient, by teaching them how to grow or make things that they can sell. <br><br>The article also quoted a U.N. population study that has low and mid-range estimates as to how large the world population will grow in this century. Unfortunately I didn't take notes, but IIRC the low estimate tops out in the low 8 billions some time in the middle of this century, followed by population decline. <br><br>The article didn't say so, but since the rapid drop in Asian birthrates is mostly (though not entirely) the outcome of young people moving to cities to get work, if jobs are not available in the cities, birth rates might not continue their rapid drop. OTOH, if and when the economies of these countries begin to contract, death rates will probably rise.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c5118275590413829454 title="comment permalink">3/24/14, 11:02 AM</a><br><br>

W-P discusses evidence for population decline. <br><br>There is a telling pair of 'before and after' maps of a large area north of Rome City. The traces of people and settlements, (mapped by showing what they left behind,) go from densely populated to almost zero. Of course, as W-P says, I paraphrase, the follow-on people might have lived in wood and straw structures and eaten from wooden plates and drunk from leather mugs, and we would not know they had been there. (In Britain, the follow-on Anglo-Saxons did just that, and their remains are few to discover.) However, W-P does a comparison with Syria (there you go, eh?) where substantial Roman economy persisted across the Eastern Mediterranean, and the evidence of prosperity is on the ground. A substantial population with resources built substantial churches and dwellings. <br><br>Across early mediaeval Europe, however, the bones of cattle tell a story of diminished agriculture. The cattle got even smaller than domestic cattle in the earlier Iron Age and were very different from those in the Roman period.

The memory of aching muscles from my misspent youth still reminds me that that's a fair amount of hardpan to get through!<br><br>Isis, you're confusing the Western Roman Empire (which I specified) with the Roman Empire as a whole. The eastern half of the empire suffered fairly modest population declines; the western half underwent demographic collapse. I recomment Bryabn Ward-Perkins' <i>The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization</i> as a readable introduction to the subject. <br><br>Shane, well, we'll see. I'm not half so sanguine as you are. <br><br>Quos Ego, granted -- it's getting there, with the rising sea levels, unstable climate, etc., that's the bear. <br><br>Thomas, thank you for a very cogent point. I'm going to have to mull over that one -- for reasons that will be known to some of my readers, I tend to give the word "shibboleth" its original meaning. The interesting point in its modern usage is that a false belief very often does serve as a shibboleth, i.e., a sign of identity in a subculture or movement, these days. <br><br>Sunseeker, spot on. I recently found Tobis' blog, and find it well worth reading. <br><br>Isis, the figures are arbitrary, of course -- I increased the current death rate and decreased the current birth rate, each by a factor of three, to show you how simple demographic shifts can do what you thought it would take an apocalypse to do. We don't actually know what happened to birth and death rates during, say, the collapse of the western Roman Empire or the classic lowland Maya, as they didn't keep modern vital statistics; it's probably a safe bet that both rates varied widely during the decline in both cases. Still, since population declines on the order of 90-95% over one to three centuries are fairly common in such situations, it's pretty clear that some such divergence between births and deaths is involved.<br><br>Your assumptions about the demographics of a declining society may also need a second look. Collapsing public health has a greater impact on infants and children than on mature adults -- one of the reasons that population contracts so quickly in such situations is that child mortality spikes, and a much larger proportion of children don't live to have children of their own -- and since each generation is smaller than the ones that came before it, on average, you have a larger proportion of adults past prime reproductive age, not a smaller one, as you've suggested. That effect seems to more than cancel out the shortening of average lifespans that comes with declining health among the very old. <br><br>Redneck, exactly. I don't think anybody really has any sense of just how bad it's likely to be. You might have heard the news of the landslide in Washington State, which flattened 30 houses and may have killed more than a hundred people; imagine that repeated and amplified across the most populous parts of two entire states, and that begins to get in the general vicinity of it. <br><br>WVJohn, thanks for the links.

I'm still unconvinced that the population of the Western Roman Empire declined by 90% or more. (I'll change my mind if I see some convincing arguments - backed by good evidence - to the contrary. We'll see what Ward-Perkins' book says.) The city of Rome did see its population decline by some 95% (according to what I've been able to find on the Internet), but the city of Rome is about as representative of the Western Roman Empire as New York City and Hong Kong are of the global industrial civilization. Our population will shrink, yes. How much and how fast? I don't know. But by whatever factor the global population shrinks, I'll bet that the population of New York and Hong Kong will shrink by a factor far larger than that. (It's also entirely possible that the human population of those two cities in particular will drop to zero, while their fish population dramatically increases...) <br><br>Anyway, understood: your birth and death rates were arbitrary. Still, my point stands: you'll never see a global 4 per thousand per year crude birth rate. It might possibly happen in some restricted localities for a limited amount of time, but globally, it will never happen, not even for a very limited amount of time. If we do see a global population decline of 2% per year, it won't be because birth rates dropped to 4 per thousand, it will be because death rates increased a lot more than you suggested. <br><br>One of my worries is that Sharon Astyk was right when she suggested that as contraception becomes less available due to deindustrialization, birth rates will go up rather than down. What she didn't say (but the conclusion is inescapable) is that this would entail skyrocketing infant mortality rates, and so most people would be attending quite a few funerals of babies and very small children. The conclusion is inescapable even if population were to decline (and decline it will) by a mere 0.2% per year, rather than 2% per year. If a typical woman gives birth to three children (say), and yet the population size isn't going up, then on average, at least one of her children must die before reaching maturity. It could get far worse than that, too. <br><br>You're certainly right to point our that infectious disease is more likely to kill an infant than an adult (even of a relatively advanced age). But that's kind of the point: it claims infants and young children first, then the elderly, and only then adolescents and adults of reproductive age. (Exception: STDs.) If you assume a minuscule birth rate, then that relatively large death rate will mostly be killing older adults.

We placed different levels of emphasis on the differences vs. the similarities with past experience, and you focused more on the similarities. But it all turned out to just be a matter of emphasis; there were no substantive disagreements. <br><br>That seems to be one of the hazards of Internet discourse - most arguments actually consist of people talking past each other without necessarily disagreeing at all, even on the best-moderated forums. Of course, it is probably true of newspaper editorials and any other written format too. I bet that if we were chatting in person over a good microbrew, we wouldn't have even thought there was a disagreement in the first place!<br><br>I'd also like to back up your numbers on population decline, at least for the 300-year timespan. Some basic math can show that a growth rate of -1% leads to a population drop of 95% in almost exactly 300 years. That's about the speed I imagine a decline would occur, over time spans long enough to average out rapid falls from war, pandemics, famine, etc. and rises based on partial recovery from such events.<br><br>I will say that I doubt that a birth rate of 0.4% against a death rate of 2.4% is unlikely to last long; more than likely the birth rate will climb again as childhood death becomes more common again. <br><br>One of the fascinating things about the Limits to Growth models is that the crude death rate falls until sometime around now, begins to slowly rise for a while, and then shoots way up a few decades later when food and industrial output per capita falls below a critical level while pollution rises. The birth rate then lags behind it, but eventually it also rises dramatically after about 30-40 years of high death rates.<br><br>They only reported to model year 2100 or so, but the model is still nowhere near an equilibrium. The Club of Rome later released what a refined version of their model extended to the 22nd century. The final outcome is that by model year 2200 or so the pre-industrial "normal" human situation of high birth rates and high death rates has reestablished itself and human population is fairly stable again at a much lower level than today, oscillating around some carrying capacity.<br><br>Of course they'd be the first to admit that their model is only designed to show the rough qualitative shape of the future and isn't a prediction per se. But I found their general pattern interesting and more or less in agreement with what I know about ecology.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c7194514289794621991 title="comment permalink">3/24/14, 8:22 PM</a><br><br>

Tropical reefs tend to show temperature increases of less than 1 °C; the tropical ocean surface at the Great Barrier Reef ~5350 years ago was 1 °C warmer and enriched in 18O by 0.5 per mil relative to modern seawater.[3] In terms of the global average, temperatures were probably colder than present day (depending on estimates of latitude dependence and seasonality in response patterns). While temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere were warmer than average during the summers, the tropics and areas of the Southern Hemisphere were colder than average.[4]<br><br>Of 140 sites across the western Arctic, there is clear evidence for warmer-than-present conditions at 120 sites. At 16 sites where quantitative estimates have been obtained, local HTM temperatures were on average 1.6±0.8 °C higher than present. Northwestern North America had peak warmth first, from 11,000 to 9,000 years ago, while the Laurentide ice sheet still chilled the continent. Northeastern North America experienced peak warming 4,000 years later.

The 7 minutes is the total duration of fault rupture as it spreads for 500-800 miles or so.<br><br>The fault rupturing areas, which generate the earthquake waves, are moving toward/away from the "observer". So the shaking perceivable from any one location is limited in time, since the intensity fades as the rupturing zone recedes.<br><br>I first heard this from a USGS scientist at one of their public lectures in Menlo Park, California, when I was living in the San Francisco Bay Area.<br><br>From a surviving a quake standpoint, only the 2-4 minutes is relevant. Yes, it is much longer than smaller quakes, due to the size of the expected quake. And more damaging as you say - thus it behooves anyone living in the area to take great precautions - or move!<br><br>Typical mag. 7 is only about 30 seconds of shaking, but that's because a mag. 7 quake is physically a much shorter length of fault rupture. It takes a long fault to generate a mag. 9, and there are very few slip-strike faults that long (many subduction faults though). The San Andreas is 810 miles long, but only 296 miles ruptured in the 7.8 1906 San Francisco quake.<br><br>And subduction quakes give a double whammy because they usually cause a big tsunami, so much of the coast is toast.

Every location has some hazard - and I agree that "Will Valley" (as we affectionately call it) has a good water supply, and I'm working on putting in other supplies and building up the local network. I almost wish we'd get a small earthquake, just to release some of the tension.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c9183927738833814819 title="comment permalink">3/25/14, 2:45 PM</a><br><br>

Dave1941 articulates a "true believer's" ideas about economics (read Austrian school, or libertarian economics, or tea party I guess). The Archdruid responds with the assertion that before central banking and government intervention, we had a boom-bust economy with longer, far more destructive depressions than 1933-1990.<br><br>Two points. The first is more of an observation. Yes, center-left economists (the mainstream) say 1933-90 was calm b/c of central banking, sensible regulation, etc. I'm not discounting this, but saying that this ignores some other differences: an empire, a global wealth pump, and surging production of the world's most concentrated and versatile energy source. I dunno, seems important. Like even downturns could seem like upturns. But maybe the government just got it right.<br><br>Now second. Econometric data from the 19th c. is sparse by modern standards, so all the claims you hear (obviously including mine) should be taken with a dose of skepticism. That said, it does appear there was a broad, 9yr long contraction in per-capita GNP from about 1857 to 1868. But this era of internecine warfare, hyperinflation (confederate money), wholesale capital stock destruction (Atlanta), the annihilation and re-constitution of whole sectors of the economy (slave-based agriculture), and workforce contraction (due to slaughter) is probably a bad comparison to post WWII US.<br><br>(Continued)<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c7829944598714919363 title="comment permalink">3/25/14, 5:07 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_61fc40" id=c2647013770172224426></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/00534310268639228068 rel=nofollow>Brian Weber</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>(Continued from above)<br><br>So how about the Long Depression? Some date it 1873-1896, and some (like the official source, the NBER) date it 1873-1879 (5 years of contraction! It's like we're Greece!). But with data being spotty (the Gov had no GDP measure then), how did the NBER come up with those dates? Well their methodology is not public, but we can surmise it's because 1873 was the start of a financial crisis, and late 1878 saw two things: the return of large-scale investment in the railroad sector, and the stabilization of aggregate prices which had been falling since the crisis. Also corporate profits were terrible all the way until about '93 actually (the stock market was barely higher in '93 than in '73).<br><br>Definitely solid data points. On the other hand, proxy indicators make it seem likely employment stabilized by '75 (unemployment seemed to have topped out at ~10% in '75), and was actually very low by 1879 (could have been ~2-4%, despite lots of immigration and large families). But maybe proxy employment indicators are unreliable. Data on prices and wages are much more certain---just a check of the era's daily newspapers. Aggregate prices did indeed fall right through to 1879, but wages stopped falling by '75 and then stabilized. Other hard data, such as steel production (which was much higher in '79 than '73, despite much lower prices), indicate that industrial production had long returned and was booming hard, just not in the railroad sector.<br><br>So what kind of "depression" sees pitiful corporate profits, falling prices, stable wages, and expanding employment? The kind that hurts owners of capital and benefits wage-earners. That's right. The "depression" of 1873-78, after an initial contractionary stage that was harmful to all, appears to have been a large-scale wealth transfer from the industrialist class to the working class.<br><br>Sound impossible? By modern economic thinking, it is. The modern theory of economic contraction is based on one data point, the experience of 1929-33, and everything else from the past (yes, including Dave1941's 1920-21 depression) is flat ignored. But contrary to conventional economic wisdom, in an inelastic (hard currency) monetary regime, the dynamic of 1875-78 can actually happen: competition and improving industrial techniques reduce prices, and sticky (stagnant) wages lead to greater consumption and higher living standards for wage-earners. (Sorry Keynesians, deflation doesn't lead to deferred consumption. It leads to deferred investment. Price deflation stimulates aggregate consumption if wages aren't falling faster.) Meanwhile debts in the financial system, and the size of the financial system itself, remain constrained----businesses don't want to pay back loans in scarcer, more valuable dollars and banks don't want to loan. That is unless there are really superior investments available (and there will be in an age of expanding energy supplies like the 1870s).<br><br>Before you jump on me about things I've left out, like the Guilded Age, well I can't describe everything. The point is that a study of actual the data shows that the industrial revolution simply wasn't all chaotic boom-bust, nor was it all Dickensian nightmare and working-class exploitation (obviously there was that too). The story is much, much more complex. Yes, from the 1880's wealth inequalities rose sharply, as other factors were also at play. I'd go into it but it'll be a miracle already if this "comment" makes it past the Archdruid's filters.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c2647013770172224426 title="comment permalink">3/25/14, 5:08 PM</a><br><br>

The past offers the only real data we have, so we certainly do have to rely on it for any serious scientific or historical analysis.

Aside from times of great acute and perhaps relatively local crises, it seems quite possible that we can put to use some basic knowledge of nutrition, birth control, and sanitation. I suspect that high infant mortality often had to do with too frequent childbearing and miserable sanitation. It is also somewhat shocking to think about, but I also suspect that a fair number of infants in the past were not well cared for because their existence was such a burden. To really care well for a human infant requires nonstop dedication of at least one bigger human at all times for a couple of years, and that includes breastfeeding. <br><br>Something I've wondered about is the emotions involved. If half your babies will die in the first five years, it stands to reason that often enough the parents will remain a bit aloof, trying not to get too attached to avoid grief.<br><br>I've been convinced for most of my life that lack of birth control is the single biggest cause of human misery. Not only does it lead to anger and exhaustion and neglected babies with higher mortality, it most certainly must cause women to choose between a happy sex life and the misery of the ensuing pregnancy. I know it would me. <br><br>People may think that they must have modern manufactured methods of birth control or nothing at all, but it isn't true. Rhythm method and coitus interruptus work reasonably well, esp the latter, even though they are not fool proof, one can face a life with one or two unplanned extra pregnancies, but not 16 pregnancies. There must have been many marriages in which the woman simply said that she did not want to bear any more children and feared that even one indulgence could ruin that.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c1503931497254076119 title="comment permalink">3/25/14, 7:45 PM</a><br><br>

I wonder though whether the odds of the big event occurring in “the next 10 years” will have changed at all since your apartment was built in the 1970s? This is a geological risk.<br><br> It will be decades at least before any large enough weight of ice is removed to increase action on the tectonic plate margins and change the odds?

(JMG presumably was looking at his next 60 or 70 years when he made the decision to relocate? smile)<br><br> I do not live in an earthquake zone, but as a child in London in the 1940s experienced bombing and attack by the drones of those days. In our case, sudden lethal damage was restricted to at most a few dozen suburban houses in any one local strike, but there were preparations that made a difference. The safest instant refuge was the cupboard under the stair. Later we were provided with an easily erected crawl-in space – angle steel, bolted together and panelled with weld-mesh, where bedding was placed. <br><br>These worked, although we were not living in high-rise or had to deal with collapsed concrete platforms. Of course you would need to have enough room in your apartment and be able to get your friend into such a structure. An emergency 10 days of drinking water and whole-nutrition long-storage biscuits might be an idea, as well. I guess the right quality of plastic bags could take care of sewage for a few days.<br> <br>On a happier note, it was surprising how a few able-bodied middle-age men ‘amateurs’ (not so many young men available) could deal with local search and rescue. Their skill was needed many times and there were few machinery aides in those days. Even when there was widespread area damage, basic services and shelter were provided. Community response was organised at a meta-level for a complex environment like the London area. (Post-war Germany experienced near famine conditions at times with many cities reduced to rubble, huge refugee populations and not exactly plentiful inputs coming in from abroad.)<br><br>The horse sounds magnificent and the animals and quality of life generally sound worth staying in-place for!<br> <br>Good luck<br>Phil H<br><br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c2628301563327284666 title="comment permalink">3/26/14, 5:44 AM</a><br><br>

My working guess is that as food starts getting tight, we're going to see "victory gardens" being adopted and expanded at an even faster rate than at present, and a great deal of small-scale farming in those areas (and there are a fair number of them -- I live in one) where geography doesn't favor corporate monoculture. If that doesn't happen, you could be right. <br><br>Sunseeker, the Cascade Region Earthquake Workgroup's recent study takes <a href=http://geology.about.com/od/quake_preparedness/a/aa_cascadiaEQ.htm rel=nofollow> four minutes of <i>strong</i> shaking</a> as likely at any given place; seven minutes for the whole duration of shaking thus is fairly plausible. Remember that the last example, in 1700, involved a fault rupture extending over 1000 km -- the shockwaves from each point of that rupture would arrive at any given point at different times, thus the prolonged shaking. <br><br>Ruben, thanks for the link!<br><br>Cathy, good question -- we're still getting a bit of snow here, but I've got the sunnier garden beds dug and peas, radishes and turnips planted. <br><br>Brian, that's an interesting hypothesis; I'm not at all sure that contemporary accounts of the serious poverty of the era support your claim that wealth flowed to the working class, though. <br><br>Grebulocities, the past contains climate changes far more drastic than anything but the most extreme NTE people are predicting. Why not use those to bound the upper end? <br><br>Onething, true enough.

Slip strike faults and subduction zone quakes are different. The slip strikes (San Andreas up to the Gorda Fault) tend to produce more localized quakes. Subduction zone quakes tend to be regional, in addition to lasting longer and being less frequent. The last one here in Cascadia was 314 years ago, and the entire fault from Northern Vancouver Island to Northern California went. Aside from the severity of the damage, which will take out all the unreinforced masonry (old brick) buildings, any structure not bolted to foundations, most freeway overpasses, bridges and powerlines; the major problem will be the vast area covered. This won't be a few hundred thousand or one or two million people in one or two counties that the State or adjacent counties can assist. This will be 10 million people in a 3,000 to 6,000 square mile area with destroyed infrastructure that will take decades to repair in the best of circumstances. In a country such as the U.S. with a crumbling infrastructure and diminished means, much of it may never be rebuilt. There will be a huge loss of life from thirst, hunger, disease and untreated injuries among the survivors due to the huge population and vast area involved.<br><br>The tsunami will affect the coast, but little of the population lives there. Some coastal communities will be totally destroyed with all killed though. Most of the deaths will be in the liquifaction areas in the large cities; i.e. the Seattle downtown waterfront, Portland along the river. The Straits of Juan de Fuca are deep enough that Port Angeles, Port Townsend and Victoria will probably suffer little damage. But the middle of Whidbey Island may be overtopped and the Naval Air Station and the town of Oak Harbor destroyed.<br><br>In the last few thousand years the interval for Cascadia has been as little as 390 years and as long as 570. The last one was 26 January 1700, 314 years ago. So, we're almost due, and anytime between now and 250 years from now are certainly possible.<br><br>We are on the Northeast corner of the Olympic Peninsula. We expect to lose our well to salt water intrusion, and all electrical, telephone and internet connection for months or years. As well, we expect to lose Hwy 101 along Hood's Canal, the coast, and various other slide prone areas and all bridge connections between the Olympic Peninsula and the east side of Puget Sound. We will have to live without refrigeration, hot running water, electricity and long distance communication. After the first two months, more or less, we will be out of propane as well.<br><br>There will be an immediate local population drop. A few in this area will be killed in the quake. Many of those who can, will flee to undamaged areas by sea, air or foot. Few will get far by land using any form of transportation. The back country trail riders, both equestrian and mountain bikers will fare best, if they carry tools to clear deadfall. Most of our large population of retirees will either leave or die; in either case due to lack of medical care or drugs in the area for a prolonged time. Many of all ages will succumb to death by psychological aftershock.<br><br>Barring bad luck, such as a tree landing on me, we expect to survive. It won't be easy though, and there are one or two preparations we haven't made yet that are a good idea.

And, of course, the ocean went through a number of anoxic events since then, again with relatively few extinctions.<br><br>We don't really know what we're going to get. My best guess is similar to yours: the global industrial machine runs out of fuel at peak CO2 concentrations around 550-600 ppm, we get a 3-4 C temperature spike with all the usual effects that entails, which are nasty but survivable for a generalist species like us. Eventually the excess carbon weathers out and glacial conditions return.<br><br>But way out on the right tail of the probability distribution is something truly horrendous. Substantially perturbing a very complex system does sometimes lead to behavior that is very different from what similar perturbations have caused in the past.<br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c4595158846384127930 title="comment permalink">3/26/14, 2:30 PM</a><br><br>

"<br><br>Thanks JMG--- When looking at economics, statistics, etc, the human realities tend to get overlooked. There was absolutely tons of poverty then, much more than now.<br><br>But I would point out that poverty being ameliorated is not the same as poverty going away. That the 1870's had enormous areas of poverty, though extremely sad and unfortunate, isn't really an objection to the view that the broad social trend at that moment was toward those poor gradually becoming less poor.<br><br>If wage-earners, as a class, are 4-5% better per annum (and not evenly distributed) and the industrial millionaires are -2% or -6% per annum, then it's a de facto transfer of wealth, yes, but obviously poverty isn't cured.<br><br>Also consider what else was going on in the 1870's. The South was in reconstruction. Newly freed black people knew nothing but poverty and marginalization. Immigrants by the 10's, maybe 100's of thousands were streaming into the cities and onto the prairies, and these newcomers were mostly from parts of the world that were far poorer still. A climate that's generally favorable for wage-earners and generally unfavorable for capitalists won't just make all this go away.<br><br><br><a href=american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html#c5465680743303481862 title="comment permalink">3/26/14, 5:48 PM</a><br><br>
