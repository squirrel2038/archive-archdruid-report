<div dir=ltr style="text-align: left">
One of the things I’ve noticed repeatedly, over the nearly eight years I’ve been writing this blog, is that I’m the last person to ask which of these weekly essays is most likely to find an audience or hit a nerve. Posts I think will be met with a shrug of the shoulders stir up a storm of protest, while those I expect to be controversial get calm approval instead. Nor do I find it any easier to guess which posts will have readers once the next week rolls around and a new essay goes up. <br>
<br>
My favorite example just now, not least because it’s so close to the far end of the improbability curve, is <a href=../../2011/09/glass-bead-game.html>a post that appeared here</a> back in 2011, discussing Hermann Hesse's novel <i>The Glass Bead Game</i> as a work of deindustrial science fiction. If ever a post of mine seemed destined for oblivion, that was it; next to nobody reads Hesse nowadays, and even in the days when every other college student had a battered paperback copy of <i>Siddhartha</i> or <i>Steppenwolf</i> on hand, not that many people wrestled with the ironic ambiguities of Hesse's last and longest novel. More than three years after that post appeared, though, the site stats here at Blogger show me that there are still people reading it most evenings. Has it gotten onto the recommended-reading list of the League of Journeyers to the East, the mysterious fellowship that features in several Hesse stories? If so, nobody's yet given me the secret handshake. <br>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
There are other posts of mine that have gone on to have that sort of persistent afterlife. What interests me just now, though, is that one of my recent posts appears to be doing the same: the essay I posted just a month ago <a href=../../2014/02/the-steampunk-future.html>proposing the steampunk subculture</a> as a potential model for future technology on the far side of the Long Descent. While steampunk isn't anything like as obscure as <i>The Glass Bead Game</i>, it's not exactly a massive cultural presence, either, and it interests me that a month after the post appeared, it's still getting read and discussed. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<a href=../../img/penny-farthing-c4fc86-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=200 src=../../img/penny-farthing-c4fc86-123x200-g95.jpg width=123></a>Courtesy of one of my regular readers, it's also appeared in an Australian newsletter for fans of penny farthing bicycles. Those of my readers who don't speak bicyclese may want to know that those are the old-fashioned cycles with a big wheel in front and a small one in back; the old British penny was about the size of a US quarter, the farthing about the size of a US dime, and if you put the two coins side by side you have a pretty fair image of the bicycle in question. I wasn't aware that anyone had revived the penny farthing cycle, and I was glad to hear it: they're much simpler than today's bicycles, requiring neither gears nor chains, and many penny farthing riders these days simply build their own cycles—a capacity well worth learning and preserving. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
Mind you, there were plenty of people who took issue with the post, and I want to talk about some of those objections here, because they cast a useful light on the blind spots of the imagination I've been exploring in recent posts. My favorite example is the commenter who insisted with some heat that an advanced technology couldn't be based on the mechanical and pneumatic systems of the Victorian era. As an example, he pointed out that without electronics, there was no way to build a FMRI machine—that's "functional magnetic resonance imaging" for those of my readers who don't speak medicalese, one of the latest pieces of high-priced medical hardware currently bankrupting patients and their families across America. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
He's quite correct, of course, but his choice of an example says much more about the limitations of his thinking than it does about anything else. Of course a steampunk-style technology wouldn't produce FMRI machines, or for that matter most of the electronic gimmickry that fills contemporary life in the industrial world, from video games to weather radar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It would take advantage of the very different possibilities inherent in mechanical and pneumatic technology to do different things. It's only from within the tunnel vision of contemporary culture that the only conceivable kind of advanced technology is the kind that happens to produce FMRI machines, video games and weather radars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>An inhabitant of some alternate world where the petroleum and electronics revolutions never got around to happening, and something like steampunk technology became standard, could insist with equal force that a technology couldn't possibly be called advanced unless it featured funicular-morphoteny machines and photodyne nebulometers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
The same sort of thinking expressed in a slightly different way drove the claim, which appeared repeatedly in the comments page here as well as elsewhere, that a neo-Victorian technology by definition meant Victorian customs such as child labor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A very large number of people in the contemporary industrial world, that is, can't imagine a future that isn't either just like the present or just like some corner of the past. It should be obvious that a technology using mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic power transfer can be applied to the needs of many different cultural forms, not merely those that were common in one corner of the late 19th century world. That this is far from obvious shows just how rigidly limited our imagination of the future has become. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
That would be a serious difficulty even if we weren't picking up speed down the bumpy slope that leads toward the deindustrial dark ages of the not so distant future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Given that that's where we are just now, it could very well turn into a fruitful source of disasters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The economic arrangements that make it possible to build, maintain, and use FMRI machines in American hospitals are already coming apart around us; so are the equivalent arrangements that prop up most other advanced technological systems in today's industrial world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the absence of those arrangements, a good many simpler technological systems could be put in their places and used to take up some of the slack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If enough of us are convinced that without FMRI machines we might as well just bring on the blood-sucking leeches, though, those steps will not be taken. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
With this in mind, I want to circle back around to the neo-Victorian technology imagined by steampunk aficionados, and look at it from another angle. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
It's not often remembered that paved roads of the modern type were not originally put there for automobiles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In America, and I believe in other countries as well, the first generation of what were called "Macadamized" roads—the kind with a smooth surface rather than bare bricks or cobblestones—were built in response to lobbying by bicyclists. Here in the United States, the lobbying organization was the League of American Wheelmen. (There were plenty of wheelwomen as well, but the masculine gender still had collective force in the English of that time.) Their advocacy had a recreational side, but there was more to it than that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A few people—among them the redoubtable Sir James Jeavons—were already pointing out in the 19th century that exponential growth in coal consumption could not be maintained forever; a great many more had begun to work out the practical implications of the soaring population of big cities in America and elsewhere, in terms of such homely but real problems as the disposal of horse manure, and these concerns fed into the emergence of the bicycle as the hot new personal transport technology of the age. </div>

Similar concerns guided the career of a figure who has appeared in these essays more than once already, the brilliant French inventor Augustin Mouchot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Noting that his native country had very limited coal reserves, and colonial possessions in North Africa with vast amounts of sunlight on offer, Mouchot devoted two decades of pioneering work to harnessing solar energy. His initial efforts focused on solar cookers, stills and water pumps, and his success at these challenges encouraged him to tackle a challenge no previous inventor had managed: a working solar steam engine. His first successful model was tested in 1866, and the Paris Exhibition of 1878 featured his masterpiece, a huge engine with a sun-tracking conical reflector focusing sunlight on tubes of blackened copper; the solar engine pumped water, cooked food, distilled first-rate brandy, and ran a refrigerator. A similar model exhibited in Paris in 1880 ran a steam-driven printing press, which obligingly turned out 500 copies of
<i>Le Journal Solaire</i>. </div>

Two other technologies I've discussed repeatedly in these essays came out of the same era. The first commercial solar water heater hit the market in 1891 and very quickly became a common sight over much of the United States; the colder regions used them in the summertime, the Sun Belt year round, in either case with very substantial savings in energy costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The fireless cooker or haybox was another successful and widely adopted technology of the age:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>a box full of insulation with a well in the center for a cooking pot, it was the slow cooker of its time, but without the electrical cord.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Bring food to a boil on the stove and then pop the pot into the fireless cooker, and it finishes cooking by residual heat, again with substantial energy savings. </div>

<a href=../../img/fireless-cooker-aeec2b-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=143 src=../../img/fireless-cooker-aeec2b-200x143-g95.jpg srcset="../../img/fireless-cooker-aeec2b-400x286-g92.jpg 2x" width=200></a></div>
Such projects were on many minds in the last decades of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th. There was good reason for that; the technology and prosperity of the Victorian era were alike utterly dependent on the extraction and consumption of nonrenewable resources, and for those who had eyes to see, the limits to growth were coming into sight. That’s the thinking that lay behind sociologist Max Weber’s eerie 1905 prediction of the future of the industrial economy:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>“This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which today determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisiton, with irresistible force. Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt.”</div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
It so happened that a temporary event pushed those limits back out of sight for three quarters of a century. The invention of the internal combustion engine, which turned gasoline from a waste product of lamp fuel refining to one of the most eagerly sought products of the age, allowed the industrial societies of that time to put off the day of reckoning for a while. It wasn't just that petroleum replaced coal in many applications, though of course this happened; coal production was also propped up by an energy subsidy from petroleum—the machines that mined coal and the trains that shipped it were converted to petroleum, so that energy-rich petroleum could subsidize the extraction of low-grade coal reserves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>If the petroleum revolution had not been an option, the 20th century would have witnessed the sort of scenes we're seeing now: rising energy costs and economic contraction leading to decreasing energy use per capita in leading industrial nations, as an earlier and more gradual Long Descent got under way. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
Those of my readers who have been following this blog for a while may be feeling a bit of deja vu at this point, and they're not wrong to do so. We’ve talked here many times about the appropriate-tech movement of the 1970s, which made so many promising first steps toward sustainability before it was crushed by the Reagan-Thatcher counterrevolution and the reckless drawdown of the North Slope and North Sea oil fields. What I'd like to suggest, though, is that the conservation and ecology movement of the 1970s wasn’t the first attempt to face the limits of growth in modern times; it was the second. The first such attempt was in the late 19th century, and Augustin Mouchot, as well as the dozens of other solar and wind pioneers of that time—not to mention bicylists on penny farthing cycles!—were the original green wizards, the first wave of sustainability pioneers, whose work deserves to be revived as much as that of the 1970s does.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
Their work was made temporarily obsolete by the torrent of cheap petroleum energy that arrived around the beginning of the 20th century. One interesting consequence of taking their existence into account is that it’s easy to watch the law of diminishing returns at work in the can-kicking exercises made possible by petroleum. The first wave of petroleum energy pushed back the limits to growth for just over seventy years, from 1900 or so to 1972.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The second did the same trick for around twenty-five years, from 1980 to 2005. The third—well, we're still in it, but it started in 2010 or so and isn’t holding up very well just now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A few more cycles of the same kind, and the latest loudly ballyhooed new petroleum bonanza that disproves peak oil might keep the media distracted for a week. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
As a thought experiment, though, I encourage my readers to imagine what might have followed if that first great distraction never happened—if, let's say, due to some chance mutation among plankton back in the Cambrian period, carbon compounds stashed away in deepwater sediments turned into a waxy, chemically inert goo rather than into petroleum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The internal combustion engine would still have been invented, but without some immensely abundant source of liquid fuel to burn, it would have become, like the Stirling engine, an elegant curiosity useful only for a few specialized purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>As coal reserves depleted, governments, industrial firms, and serious men of affairs doubtless would have become ever more fixated on seizing control of untapped coal mines wherever they could be found, and the twentieth century in this alternate world would likely have been ravaged by wars as destructive as the ones in our world. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
At the same time, the pioneering work of Mouchot and his many peers would have become increasingly hard to ignore. Solar power was unquestionably less economical than coal, while there was coal, but as coal reserves dwindled—remember, there would be no huge diesel machines burning oceans of cheap petroleum, so no mountaintop removal mining, nor any of the other extreme coal-extraction methods so common today—pointing a conical mirror toward the Sun would rapidly become the better bet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As wars and power shifts deprived entire nations of access to what was left of the world's dwindling coal production, the same principle would have applied with even more force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Solar cookers and stills, solar pumps and engines, wind turbines and other renewable-energy technologies would have been the only viable options. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
This alternate world would have had advantages that ours doesn't share. To begin with, energy use per capita in 1900 was a small fraction of current levels even in the most heavily industrialized nations, and whole categories of work currently done directly or indirectly by fossil fuels were still being done by human beings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Agriculture hadn't been mechanized, so the food supply wouldn't have been at risk; square-rigged sailing vessels were still hauling cargoes on the seas, so as the price of coal soared and steamboats stopped being economical, maritime trade and travel could readily downshift to familiar sail technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the new renewable-energy technologies became more widely distributed and more efficient, getting by with the energy supplied by sun and wind would have become second nature to everybody. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
Perhaps, dear reader, you can imagine yourself sitting comfortably this afternoon in a caf<span style='mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"'>é</span>
in this alternate world, about to read my weekly essay. No, it isn’t on a glowing screen; it’s in the pages of a weekly newspaper printed, as of course everything is printed these days, by a solar-powered press. Before you get to my latest piece, you read with some interest that a Brazilian inventor has been awarded the prestigious Mouchot Prize for a solar steam engine that’s far better suited to provide auxiliary power to sailing ships than existing models. You skim over the latest news from the war between Austria and Italy, in which bicycle-mounted Italian troops have broken the siege of Gemona del Friuli, and a report from Iceland, which is rapidly parlaying its abundant supply of volcanic steam into a place as one of the 21st century’s industrial powerhouses. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
It’s a cool, clear, perfectly seasonable day—remember, most of the gigatons of carbon we spent the 20th century dumping into the atmosphere stayed buried in this alternate world—and the proprietor of the café is beaming as he watches sunlight streaming through the windows. He knows that every hour of sunlight falling on the solar collectors on the roof is saving him plenty of money in expensive fuel the kitchen won’t have to burn. Outside the café, the sun gleams on a row of bicycles, yours among them: they’re the normal personal transport of the 21st century, after all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Solar water heaters gleam on every roof, and great conical collectors track the sun atop the factory down the road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>High overhead, a dirigible soars silently past; we’ll assume, for the sake of today’s steampunk sensibility, that lacking the extravagant fuel supplies needed to make airplanes more than an exotic fad, the bugs got worked out of dirigible technology instead. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
Back in the cafe, you begin to read the latest
<i>Archdruid Report</i>—and my imagination fails me at this point, because that essay wouldn’t be about the subjects that have filled these posts for most of eight years now. A society of the kind I’ve very roughly sketched out wouldn’t be in the early stages of a long ragged slide into ecological failure, political disintegration, economic breakdown, and population collapse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It would have made the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy when its energy consumption per capita was an order of magnitude smaller than ours, and thus would have had a much easier time of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of course a more or less stable planetary climate, and an environment littered with far fewer of the ugly end products of human chemical and nuclear tinkering, would be important advantages as well.
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left">
It’s far from impossible that our descendants, some centuries from now, could have a society and a technology something like the one I’ve outlined here, though we have a long rough road to travel before that becomes possible. In the alternate world I’ve sketched, though, that would be no concern of mine. Since ecology would be simple common sense and the unwelcome future waiting for us in this world would have gone wherever might-have-beens spend their time, I’d have many fewer worries about the future, and would probably have to talk about Hermann Hesse’s <i>The Glass Bead Game</i> instead. Maybe then the League of Journeyers to the East would show up to give me the secret handshake!</div>

The funny thing is that I don't have to imagine that future very hard as it is here with off grid solar electric and solar hot water! Mind you, all of those have a massive fossil fuel subsidy behind them. In the long run, they'll generate more energy than they took to produce but it is nothing like the returns from fossil fuels.<br><br>One thing that worries me about our current society that perhaps the steampunk fictional future could address is that we spend so much fossil fuel energy mining and transporting nutrients around the planet only to then dump them as manures into our oceans. It isn't a really smart move and is a wasted (pun intended) opportunity to build top soils.<br><br>Even thinking of our own manures as a waste product is just weird.<br><br>As a disclaimer, my own manure is recycled back into the soil via an ingenious worm farm which uses very little energy (it only uses gravity and a small wind driven turbine to move air into the chamber).<br><br>Historically, the Chinese used to use recyclable clay pots and there was quite the trade in human manure which was composted into soil fertilisers. Very clever and elegant.<br><br>On a positive note regarding global warming. I'm now experimenting again with coffee plants and babaco. I had to spend a couple of hours this morning though putting some water down (solar powered of course) in the orchard as there is another short spell of heat coming up this weekend. The trees look tired.<br><br>Perhaps the steampunk people would have elegant cast iron framed glass houses to grow their fruits and vegetables in out of season. Some of the old Victorian era hill stations around these parts have these and they are truly a work of beautiful engineering. Much more attractive, repairable and longer lasting than the average hoop house.<br><br>That coffee in the cafe had to come from somewhere. Although I read that in the Victorian era here, they used to cut real coffee with roasted chicory roots.<br><br>Did you ever get a tea camellia? Mine died here again in the extreme heat, so I'm thinking of growing it in future in the complete shade.<br><br>PS: I was thinking that one benefit of this essay ever moving to a print format is that it will pretty much eliminate the haters in one swoop! Just sayin… It would be a more civil discourse than at present because of the slower pace.<br><br>Seriously, I can’t for the life of me understand why your blog would attract haters. Do they not understand that you are sounding the alarm because of the love of your country, history and society? It reflects very poorly on those people.

In the absence of those arrangements, a good many simpler technological systems could be put in their places and used to take up some of the slack."<br><br>At least one team of researchers in the University of Michigan's School of Business are already proposing what they call "reverse innovation," which involves developing simpler technologies for developing markets and then importing them into advanced economies like ours. One of the areas they think is ripe for this is health care. As an example, they cite a cheap electrocardiogram devised for "Third World" hospitals but is now used by first responders around the world.<br><br>Another area they think this will work is in urban transportation. Here's what the authors of the study say about it.<br><br><i>For new mobility, companies and cities in developed countries should look at how entrepreneurs in emerging markets work around the lack of infrastructure, congested roads, lack of subsidies, and the varying types of mobile devices people use.<br><br>"Budgets are being pushed to the maximum here in the West, and without subsidies the scale of adoption for most new mobility ideas or mass transit isn't going to happen. It won't cross the chasm," Adriaens said. "That's why more and more global corporations are looking to entrepreneurs in developing economies to see what kind of product or service could or would work here."</i><br><br>I have links and quotes to that research as well as to a press release about an electricity-free portable milk cooler that uses evaporative cooling developed by the University of Georgia at Crazy Eddie's Motie News.<br><br>http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2014/03/technology-for-developing-world.html<br><br>A few months ago, you mentioned that the press releases from the front lines of progress would proclaim glorious victories in already conquered territories that are in danger of being lost.

Low Tech Magazine is pretty much required reading for aspiring green wizards. <br><br>Cherokee, I didn't plant a tea camellia, no -- the space went for a couple of dwarf apple trees and a quince bush instead. As for the trolls, remember that I'm telling them that they don't get to have the bright shiny future that Santa's supposed to bring them for Christmas; of course they're going to be upset! Letters to the Editor columns, back in the day, used to be just as full of diatribes as any blog comments page is today. <br><br>Geoff, glad to hear it! <br><br>Kutamun, of course we're not leaving this planet. Does a plant achieve anything by pulling itself up by the roots? Would your fingers be happier if you chopped them off and threw them out the window? One of the crucial mental tasks of the present age is coming to terms with the realization that <i>humanity is part of Earth's biosphere</i>, as integral a part of nature as trees and winds and stones -- and to take the myths that insist that we don't belong here and chuck 'em in the compost. <br><br>Ruben, that's why I've talked at such length of the necessity for religious structures as a way to maintain essential technologies during the Long Descent. In a contracting economy, the invisible hand of the market is guaranteed to give you the finger; making decisions on the basis of short term profitability is a guarantee of long term suicide. The skills that survive will be those that are preserved for reasons other than the purely pragmatic -- and religion provides those more reliably than any other human institution. <br><br>Ventriloquist, you mean the guy that <a href=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/how-vladimir-putin-made-chuck-norris-look-amateur/story-fn907478-1226760779016 rel=nofollow>makes Chuck Norris look second rate</a>? ;-)<br><br>Robert, got it. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, "reverse innovation" may be the funniest phrase I've heard in weeks. It reminds me forcefully of radio broadcasts from Berlin in 1944 and 1945, announcing that the Wehrmacht was advancing against the enemy from Moscow, to Minsk, to Warsaw, to... That said, many thanks for the tip -- the fact that anybody's thinking in those terms is very promising indeed. <br><br>M, a lot depends on whether people -- as in, individuals like you, not some notional person somewhere else -- figure out how to build their own bicycles from locally available scrap and raw materials. If that happens, and the penny farthing brigade gives me some hope that it might, there may well be bicycles all through the Long Descent; if not, well, you know the song as well as I do. If enough people get to work trying to find a viable alternative to rubber tires...<br><br>Onething, true -- I think the blood-sucking leeches have all been put to work in medical billing, so are not available on the clinical side of things. ;-)<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c116149802248418968 title="comment permalink">3/5/14, 9:31 PM</a><br><br>

Even with your arrangement, the fact that the Center of Gravity of the rider is practically on top of the big wheel, and quite high up is what caused all the face plants. The rider can't be any farther back or lower because of where the steering has to be. The addition of the chain and sprockets is obviously not a deal breaker; as I said the Safety Bicycle was an rapid success in the 1880's (from introduction in 1879 to dominance in 1890). There are other advantages, such as having wheels the same size with interchangable spares, and simpler ways to carry cargo and baggage which also make the Safety configuration more utilitarian.<br><br>There are lots of ways in which fossil fuel technology has changed bicycles, but the basic form was worked out quite well a century ago by our Victorian forebears.

The scientfic breakthroughs of the nineteenth centruy where not only in mechanical areas, but also in electrical ones. Most basics for electric applications throughout the 20th century, as generators/motors, batteries and lightsources where ready available at the turn of the century. The idea that electromagnetic waves are reflected by items (radar) was already two decades old. <br><br>If you look at the last years of the 19th century, you will find already the third generation of generators used in power plants driven by water or steam, while wind mills where still around. The dwindling resource of whale fat, that once powered lanterns enforces the well under way shift to electric light. Intercontinental communication is electric using the telegraph network and mechanical wind mills are still a common sight all over the world. So a shift towards a wind powered electric grid is not a big step, but combines proven technology. <br><br>Besides that in the early era of the automobile electric and gasoline vehicles where equal competitors in the early market. A major breakthrough for usability and convenience of the gasoline car was the electric startermotor. <br><br>Any alternative history based on the industrial age will always use electric technology due to its availability. And once you apply electric systems, it is just a question of time to get to electronics. By the way, the first computers where based on either relays (invented in 1830s) or cathode ray tubes (invented 1890s).<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c5357490239626932031 title="comment permalink">3/5/14, 11:16 PM</a><br><br>

And, by chance, I happened to be re-reading it this week.<br><br>I view it as a classic book, by which I mean it will be read many times (at least by myself), and each reading will reveal something new. This time around I am struck by the revival of monasticism following the collapse of the Age of Feuilleton. I also note how rigorous their monasticism was. For example, when Knecht visits a Benedictine monastery he refuses the abbot’s offers of a glass of red wine. And the repugnance that his friend Tegularius feels about the monastery seems to do with it worldly nature.<br><br>I write a blog for process safety professionals (those who work in the oil, chemical and refining businesses). One of my themes is that our discipline, which is already quite eclectic, needs to become more so. For example, my latest post — <i>How to Read and Why</i> based on Harold Bloom’s work — drew a reasonably strong response given the background of the audience that I am addressing. There is an opportunity and maybe a need to better integrate the liberal and technical professions. And it is the integration of different disciplines is largely what the Glass Bead Game is about (although they do not incorporate technology or scientific concepts such as the Laws of Thermodynamics — a major weakness of the Game structure in my judgment).<br><br>Regarding Penny-Farthings, I recently went on a group bicycle ride around town. One person was riding one of these contraptions. I asked him how he stops at Stop Signs. His response was that he doesn’t. And, based on the tension in his face, I don’t think that he was enjoying the ride all that much.<br><br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c5410824027651719060 title="comment permalink">3/6/14, 1:36 AM</a><br><br>

I've designed and built some small parabolic reflectors, and believe I could make much larger and more powerful ones, given sufficiently robust materials. There's a great deal that could be done using Mouchot's ideas as a starting point, and those of Frank Shuman and others. <br><br>But my training is that of an artist, not a mechanic or machinist. I don't have the skills to assemble steam engines or plumbing or chain drives. I'd have to collaborate with someone who does. If anyone's interested in teaming up, I'd be glad to hear of it. Maybe I should check into the local Burning Man community..? Some of those folks seem to have mechanical skills. <br><br>Clearly to develop and sustain this technology for the long term it will be essential to maintain the craft of mirror-making, or of making highly reflective metallic surfaces. For the time being scavenged materials may serve. I think it may be possible to make quite a powerful reflector using the humblest of materials, such as paperboard and the silvered interiors of plastic food wrappers. It might not hold up long, but it would work for a while. <br><br>I'd like to have a look at Mouchot's design for a solar water pump. I gather there's more than one way to recuperate the energy of water stored in a water tower.

I very much appreciate the principles of simplicity, but must caution against over-glorifying the penny-farthing. The advantages achieved by introducing the chain and free wheel were considerable, making the bicycle much more accessible to the less than extremely athletic public. The penny-farthing is a fascinating curiosity, but fraught with the inherent danger of flipping forward. It was known to seriously injure and kill some very athletic young men by the simple act of stopping. In point of fact, it was the safety bicycle that those early advocates of smooth roads were riding.<br>If it's simplicity you're after, I recommend the fixed-gear one-speed--historically the penny -farthing 's immediate successor. In the big picture, the chain, for all its intricacy, is still pretty simple. The benefits of having the gear ratio offered, as well as the improved centre of balance far outweigh the drawbacks. If the fixed gear is too demanding (it tends to stress the knees), the freewheel is another simple addition, which then necessitates additional breaking mechanisms not necessarily necessary on the “fixie” although at least one “fail safe” break is recommended…<br>Lastly, when you say:<br>“I'd say let's see many different kinds of bicycles, and let Darwinian evolution sort 'em out. “<br>I must object, in the sense that, well, that is exactly what history has done. The perfectly adapted bike (and there are many, for every conceivable need) exists. Are there a plethora of ridiculous, overly-complex bikes out there? Of course. But the happy medium exists…and In almost no instance can I imagine that the penny-farthing is that bicycle.

Of less concern are things like lubricants and materials for accessories, as these things can be improvised with animal by-products (fat, leather, etc.).<br>The supply of steel should be no problem as scavenging will surely become a serious industry, by-passing the need for mining scarce resources. Maintaining the hands-on knowledge of processing that steel is conceivable, though certainly a challenge not to be taken lightly (producing strong cable for brakes and gears, machining all kinds of parts, including chains and bearings especially – more on that below). All of this requires significant energy input, to be sure (at some point you have to melt the stuff, right?) Similarly, welding the parts together is not only dependent on specific materials, and energy, but also considerable skill. <br>Rubber is a bit outside of my knowledge. The stuff we use today is a petroleum product, and to whatever extent it is recyclable, we may have an extraordinary supply in the form of used car tires. But I suspect it is not, otherwise we’d be recycling them already. (Perhaps someone can shed some light on this question?) Plant-based rubber may have to suffice, which introduces its own set of challenges regarding international trade…<br>All that to say, whether you’re making penny-farthings or “safety bicycles” (thanks Glenn, I had forgotten that) you’ll be relying on some form of residual industrial know-how, and at least some fossil fuel input.<br>As for bearings, of all the technological requirements, it may be our ability to produce quality bearings that is the lynchpin of the whole system. (At least according to my machinist friend they represent the keystone of industrial mechanisation.) And if you can produce quality bearings needed to make a penny-farthing, you’ll surely be capable of producing a bicycle chain, so you may as well produce the bicycle instead. ;-)<br><br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c3556724757938181480 title="comment permalink">3/6/14, 9:21 AM</a><br><br>

I was one of the ones pointing out that electronics are likely to stay with us for quite a while. Steam clearly will too. Maybe not superconducting MRI. (Although you can do MRI even with the earth's magnetic field, at much lower cost and at much lower resolution). <br><br>It seems that because we figured out basic steam technology in the 18th and early 19th century and electronic technology in the mid to late 19th century, JMG thinks steam is more likely to be dominant in a deindustrial future. It takes fairly advanced materials processing to build boilers strong enough to make efficient steam engines. Solar thermal (steam) is a useful technology that will stay with us, particularly for providing heat. For providing power, it is not clear whether electric power or steam power will be more important. The problem with steampunk is that modest scale electric power generation, electric motors, and electronics are not all that resource intensive. They required more complex theoretical comprehension to build so they came a little later in the scientific/industrial revolution, but in a resource starved future, my bet for small technology is that electric power and information processing (maybe much simpler than current technology) will stay with us at least as long as steam power technology stays with us. It is very hard to imagine how scientifically literate societies will cope with resource shortages. JMG is consistently right both that they will not repeat the past and that the best hope we have of imagining the future is to understand the past. But here he seems to be missing some of the more likely possible evolutionary paths of modern electric power and electronic gadgets.<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c3367886814362799463 title="comment permalink">3/6/14, 11:15 AM</a><br><br>

Rubber grows in trees. Sure, it'll run into the general scarcity problem like everything else as the world becomes big and bleak. <br><br>But the "relative value" of it seems pretty high as long as there are bike paths. <br>Sure you may want to stretch out its life a lot by UV shielding, adding more carbon black or silica (will come at the cost of some wet grip).<br><br>Alternatively you can use EVA. The price hike will be considerably more on it but you could recycle it. Also IIRC hydrolysis should be much less of an issue for the stuff. Its "relative value" should be very high though - it lends itself very well to decentralized tinkering (anything from hot melt adhesive, over wire and electronics (PV cells) encapsulation, drug release, implants, sleeping pads, and rubber boots). It's just really nice stuff to work with. I'd miss it.<br><br>If we all get desperate enough one can try sticky pine resin/leather as damping material. <br><br>What I'd really like to see is that (especially consumer) products shift to more long lasting designs. My guess is that on most everyday stuff a factor of 2 (last 4 times as long - cost 2 times the money) is not difficult. The curve will look quite different for different products, and upfront cost is an issue of course. Unfortunately I'd assume most established and important things are already close to optimum - with electronics as a big exception.<br>If you make them maintenance friendly and modular that can get much more value for the money (especially if IT-tech plateaus). I'd assume the technologically really tricky bits can last well over 60 years rather than 3-5 today. There's an old army field manual that has some (old) statistics on this. If your notebook keyboard, or a bunch of capacitors die - you could hook up another keyboard, or pull out a separate circuit board with all the "perishable" elements on it.<br>Also technical support and repair could be taken seriously. In Germany there's laws for designing stuff so you can change the battery I was told. The problem is the attitude (or system that rewards such attitudes).<br>Once we well and truly go past the point where people start to assume "new" means "worse" the marketing and design should start to adapt to this- though I am not saying I want to wait for that.<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c8138236070765219616 title="comment permalink">3/6/14, 11:36 AM</a><br><br>

Again, I think it was from the infamous Brad that I first heard this, and I'm quite likely remembering it wrong, but apparently you can run a perfectly good civilization, at least by 1970s standards, on renewable energy. You just can't run a modern standing army and the attendant military-industrial complex on anything but fossil fuel (it's a heck of a drug), and our leadership caste at the time felt that they needed such an army; that's part of what I meant by "we had a Cold War to win." Another part is what our host has been saying in some of his recent posts, about how any alternative to the capitalist-industrialist system was presented as objectively pro-Communist and thus good only for making the Baby Jesus cry.<br><br><i>And once you apply electric systems, it is just a question of time to get to electronics.</i><br><br>And once you invent electronics, there's a significant risk that you'll invent television, the other drug that's killing us all.

Imagine a shower that spouts foam and not water. Now forget all but the shower curtain. Now imagine a hose that feeds really hot soapy water onto a piece of cloth installed in an air-blower kind of thing. The blower makes warm (and insulating) foam that gets pushed through a large diameter tube and falls on your head. Next to you is your buddy working up a sweat while impatiently powering the blower with a bicycle. You look down the shower curtain tube that is pulled tight around your ankles and say: "Cmon, 5 more minutes - we're aren't even in the third liter!"<br><br>2. You're out in the bushes. Again. Picking berries, like every day the last three weeks. The only thing that keeps you going really is that you get to listen to the lectures on your in-ear, talking about cool stuff like glass fiber making and on the clean room way of life. You feel immensely fortunate that you have the chance to take the theoretical pre-test (when the atmosphere is willing and the trader's radio works) after next year's harvest. Afterwards you'll get instructions to build a set of tools and train the motions. The one thing nagging you is that the rumor is you won't be able to get around reading and maths much longer if you do go to Iceland. Someone even said it is compulsory in such high energy density places. Crazy world.<br><br>The lectures have pretty high potential I'd say, especially in a transition time. Losing one ear isn't a big issue for doing the menial tasks waiting for us. Also an mp3-player uses very little energy, runs at night, doesn't need lengthy preliminary education, and can hold enough material for 10 professions. Also, if you can make a mic, you can make an in-ear.<br><br>Glass fibers is another thing that is pretty versatile (composites, insulation, optical fibers/lasers). If you want really, really long lasting (and light) materials you really won't get around them easily. Also they are far more theft proof than copper for communication. Carbon fibers are nice but I'd say too expensive and less versatile. They could survive in transportation and some niches, but even today they are really energy intensive.<br>By the way - the ground work for this is being laid you could argue: http://www.sglgroup.com/cms/international/press-lounge/news/2010/04/04062010_p.html?__locale=en<br><br>The "musical chairs or future energy density" is well underway...<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c2043365196649288801 title="comment permalink">3/6/14, 12:49 PM</a><br><br>

Of course a wide range of other technologies might be involved. I was trying to make a specific point, not trying to sketch out all the possible technological wrinkles available to a future ecotechnic society, you know. <br><br>Sackerson, a lot of them needed horses, and if bikes can be provided instead, that could free up a lot of arable ground for uses other than pasturage and horse fodder. <br><br>Grebulocities, it's a heartbreaking challenge to try to write satire in today's society -- what shows up in the media is sillier than any comedy routine. The article you linked to reminds me forcefully of a certain discussion about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8IBnfkcrsM" rel=nofollow>whether Hy Brasil is sinking</a>...<br><br>Fly, not a joke at all. Before petroleum warfare became standard, a number of nations experimented, with quite some success, with bicycle-mounted troops; I knew about the Italian example, thus the choice of war. Many thanks for the link!<br><br>Stream, well, there you go. Our steampunk future can have bicycles -- if, that is, enough people get experience making rubber from dandelion latex that the trick doesn't get lost. <br><br>ChemEng, excellent, and I'm delighted to hear that you're finding some interest in a fusion of technical and humane learning, if I may use some <i>very</i> old terms. <br><br>Kevin, I'd also suggest checking out your local Maker Faire, if there is such a beast near you, and you might even consider picking up some technical skills...<br><br>Robo, granted. If we'd taken the alternative path I've sketched out, human population probably would have peaked around 1 billion, and then declined gradually from there. As it is, there are going to be some very ugly scenes in the future. <br><br>Doug, more people had a clue in those days. He was quite right, of course. <br><br>Zach, excellent.

I'm fond of electricity, no question; it has many advantages, but you know, a warm house in winter, hot meals, hot water, and a solar greenhouse full of ripe vegetables, but no laptop, beats a laptop and none of these other things three falls out of three. <br><br>Crowandsheep, thank you! I figured somebody would work out the mathematics. I'm rather fond of the idea that the tenth iteration of "no, no, we have plenty of energy!" will rely on armpit farting, too -- it makes at least as much sense as the current round of giddy nonsense coming out of the mainstream media. <br><br>Raven, have you checked out Dmitry Orlov's blog? He also has some very cogent remarks on the situation in the Ukraine. <br><br>Jld, I was wondering when the roving hordes of zombie marauders were going to show up. Inevitably, whenever I mention things that individuals might, ahem, do to make the future a better place, somebody brings up the roving hordes as an excuse for inaction. I'll be discussing that copout in the upcoming series of posts about the postpetroleum dark ages. <br><br>Goog, you're welcome. <br><br>RPC, now check how much of the feedstock came from fossil fuels. <br><br>Wall, excellent! You get today's gold star for cutting straight to the point. That's why I consider a revival of the basic skills of democratic process so essential just now. <br><br>Bruce, good. That's all worth knowing. <br><br>Thyme, I expect to see quite a few things like that as the Long Descent picks up speed.

It's simply that rather more than half the time, when somebody on this blog's comments page starts claiming that a given technology will surely be viable in the deindustrial world, the person who makes that claim is doing nothing to see to it that anything of the sort happens. <br><br>Lw, okay, now go back and read the post, and notice all the references to solar steam engines.

My guess is they probably don't, but I've deprogrammed myself enough from the cult to no longer trust my instincts on that. Assuming they don't, that'd imply to me an underlying belief that scientific/technical achievement is the driver of social change.

I doubt miniaturization would have gone anything like so far, but it would have been interesting to have seen what fine clockwork could have done...<br><br>Zach, "embarrassing" is the word that comes to my mind. For a species that claims to be sentient, we're doing a very poor job of following through on the claim. <br><br>Mac, you're most welcome. <br><br>Nastarana, the fungus is the reason I'm not simply advocating turning the southern states over to rubber plantations -- not that many years from now, the climate may be right. If the problems with the fungus can be overcome, natural rubber would be a good cash crop in warm damp regions. <br><br>Refarmer, the novels by Ellis Peters on which the TV show was based are also very good -- and the old medieval herbal lore is still quite readily accessible, by the way. <br><br>Kyoto, neither steel nor fine machining requires fossil fuels -- you might have a look at Japanese sword blades, for example, which are traditionally made using wood-derived charcoal as the heat source, and the very fine metalwork that was common before industrial machining came in.

It has become a thursday (time zones plus work) evening highlight for me. Except when I know the article of the week before will be continued, it usually comes as a surprise what the current one will contain - as if the Archdruid wanted to reciproke his own surprise factor mentioned in the first paragraph of the article.<br><br>I like some articles more than others, but I read each from beginning to end because there are always interesting ideas in them.<br><br>Concerning the bicycles, an interesting point: The first proto-bicycle (the walking-bicycle, dandy horse) was invented by Karl Drais in 1818 because the 1815 vulcano eruption in the south sea brought a year without summer (1816). The result were misharvests and thus lack of resources to feed all the horses in Europe with its relatively high population density (compared to the US of that era).<br><br>Given that our current world population cannot be sustained after the oil age anyway, the incentive for using bicycles will be the same in the future as it was in Europe in the early 19th century.<br><br>As for the war side, even right in the petroleum age, huge amounts of supply, ammo and weapons were transported by bicycle along the Ho-Chi-Minh path during the Vietnam war. The Suiss had bicycle troops until 2003. The reason why they were abanoned was not only that motorised troups are faster and can carry more stuff, but also the lousy protection against shrapnels when moving.<br><br><br>@ dave1941:<br><br>The wealthy may use aircrafts, albeit just small ones like Cessnas - without mass sales of journey by aircraft, there will be no industry producing A380s nor big airports. Cars need roads built for cars, and if next to nobody has a car, there will be no highways to drive on.<br><br>As for the solar calculator: The point is how long the industrial infrastructure plus its supply chain needed to produce solar calculators will be around. As long as the existing calculators last, they will be used, of course. But no product lasts forever. You don't seriously believe that a calculator produced today will last for a 100 years?<br><br><br>@ Kevin: Things like solar parabol mirrors made of cardboard and tinfoil (for cooking) already exist, they are used in the 3rd World.<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c3290537158571236746 title="comment permalink">3/6/14, 3:19 PM</a><br><br>

The idea's been out there for a long time -- it's not original to me, I picked it up in appropriate tech circles in the late 1970s -- but it's good to see it getting more attention. <br><br>K&amp;C, true enough. As usual, we claim we've eliminated something and we've just offshored it. <br><br>Cathy, a good fresnel lens won't give you a cooker, it'll give you an incinerator -- I plan on doing some experiments with one for spagyric herbalism this summer, time permitting. As for the forum, sorry to hear that. <br><br>Autumn, exactly. Faith in progress used to be based on a whole series of things that were supposedly getting better; nowadays, when life for most people even in the industrial world is getting measurably worse with each passing year, technological progress is the only thing left for believers to point to, and they simply accept on faith that everything must be better now because, well, because we've <i>progressed</i>. That we might be progressing down a steepening slope into a very grim future is not something they can even imagine.<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c915195517724648084 title="comment permalink">3/6/14, 3:24 PM</a><br><br>

Maybe someday.<br>Another neat solar-power idea you can add to the list is Buckminster Fuller's self-cooled half-dome. A metal half-dome, with a vent at the apex and openings around the bottom uses the Bernoulli effect to cool itself in hot climates and on hot days. The dome heats up, causes air to rise. This causes a low-pressure area around the structure, which draws air inside the structure out the lower vents. That, in turn, draws air down into the structure through the opening at the apex. This air must expand to fill the larger void, which results in cooling.<br>So many interesting low-tech, low-energy means of accomplishing the same things we do with "High" technology... direct-power via ropes and overhead drive-shafts, belts and gears from water and wind mills to run machine shops... I read about a metal shop in Germany that was built in the 12th century and powered by water.<br>I personally, wish for a mind-set that uses all the labour-saving knowledge we have acquired, but without the need to continually increase production of goods, instead merely replacing parts as they wear out.

Also dirigibles :-) There's a strain in Japanese animeigo that's strongly steampunk, too, as reflected in, oh, Laputa just to name one film. Steam engines and dirigibles abound.<br><br>Solar Stirling is a current technology (you can google it and find plenty of articles -- and pictures too).

Call it cleverness on the level of some birds or primates on one end of the scale, and engineering at the other end as practiced by us bipeds. Where exactly on this spectrum it turns in to engineering is probably just a matter of opinion. <br><br>Last fall, I worked up a submittal for John Michael's Krampus challenge for engineers to come up with some "descent engineering" solutions. I did not quite finish mine by the deadline, but since the topic of solar concentration has come up, with speculations and questions, I thought some of you might be interested in the information I had assembled. My blog entry from October 26, 2013 has the relevent links and info.<br><br>A couple observations relevant to the current discussion: I came to realize that even at the large scale solar technology I was exploring, the limitations of the diurnal cycle necessarily forces one to observe a batch process, as opposed to the continuous processes most modern fossil fueled technology uses. This will definitely alter the directions that technology might go. Another observation was that in many cases, practice and trial and error can replace high tech methods. Think Wootz steel or damascus steel. <br><br>Regarding steam, I learned that the collector is the easy part. A heat transfer receiver ( boiler), the condenser section, the actual turbine or piston engine will be the hard parts as they require some pretty exacting metallurgy and machining.

Yes, I'm not surprised they've been using parabolic cookers in the 3rd world. I've seen some of the vids on youtube. I'd like to improve on existing designs for cookers if I can. As JMG has often pointed out, the type of country that we're accustomed to calling "3rd world" is just the sort that the United States is well on its way to becoming. <br><br>Also, there are other potential uses. For instance, it has often been argued on this blog that photovoltaic panels are likely to eventually become unavailable, due to resource supply issues and other variables associated with collapse. When that time comes, it might be very useful to have a solar steam-driven (or stirling-driven) generator, especially in places with more sun than wind or hydro. Electrical power may not be the most efficient way to use a solar concentrator - direct mechanical transference of energy would probably be much more so - but it sure comes in handy for things like lighting and refrigeration.<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c9001490301556370835 title="comment permalink">3/6/14, 6:08 PM</a><br><br>

The designers are focusing on sturdy, low maintenance design that can be maintained in third world conditions.some of the bikes they are replacing were made of wood.I have some close friends who are very involved with this movement.<br>The synthetic rubber that was used in WWII was fine for most things except landing large planes.I would assume the capability of manufacturing bicycle gears, chains,etc. would be available quite a ways down the decline curve. If not, the best preparation might involve developing the yogic flexibility to kiss one's posterior goodby because we will be on a very steep slope.<br>I love bikes, so maybe I should recuse myself, but unless we are supposing a much more rapid descent then is the general assumption on this site, I think they will serve us well quite far down the slope, perhaps a long time if we pull our heads out.<br>Boy oh boy,With my bad foot, they sure give me a range of freedom that I would not otherwise have as I go down the slope of my own long descent.<br>Regards, Steve<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c2961782701122538975 title="comment permalink">3/7/14, 12:02 AM</a><br><br>

Did I mention that it is almost quince season here? YUM! Poached quinces... YUM! You brought the subject up! hehe!<br><br>I spent all day continuing to prepare the blackberry and strawberry bed expansion for next summer. The council has been up to its old trick of spraying the blackberry canes. All that happens after spraying is that the canes die, they then dry off and form outstanding kindling and then new canes form the next season. It is a complete waste of rate payers funds.<br><br>One year they tried something new and grubbed the canes and new canes simply formed the following season. Meanwhile, they are tooling with part of my jam supply so I have to become independent of the councils failure to observe natures response to their actions. The fancy description for my actions is vertical integration.<br><br>Oh well.<br><br>Hi Michelle,<br><br>Thanks for the link. I had to check several times just to make sure that I wasn't reading an article on the Onion. Surely that proposal isn't serious? That was a really wacky proposal. Whoever wrote that legislation possibly spent at least a minute contemplating the realities of an organic farm and then went, "nooo, too dirty, they're not quite applying the right amount of antibiotics and fungicides to the soil. There certainly shouldn't be anything alive in it". hehe!<br><br>Please let me know if the FDA are coming my way to inspect the farm as I think I just spotted Stumpy the wallaby taking a dump in the orchard. I'll have to clean it up before the inspector arrives. hehe!<br><br>Hi Kyoto,<br><br>Yeah, I wonder about coffee too. There's a massive coffee culture in Melbourne so places that don't serve a decent cappuccino don't tend to last. The culture was a gift from the Italian migrants from the 1950's onwards.<br><br>You're spot on too as there are a lot of substitutes for coffee.<br><br>In the CBD there are some buildings called <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_Alley rel=nofollow>Banana Alley</a> which was built in the late 1800's alongside the Yarra River to store and ripen imported green bananas. Think about the sailing ships that would have discharged their cargoes on the wharf adjacent to the buildings. Pretty low tech stuff, so I don't worry too much about availability of bananas and coffee which are all produced up North.<br><br>Still, it would be nice to develop some cold adapted varieties here too just to hedge my bets.<br><br>PS: Years ago I saw a truck up north transporting bananas that had caught fire somehow. I suspect the bananas were off gassing somehow? I dunno.

My family does not own a car.<br><br>Much has been said about the prospects of the bike in the future. In my view, it is an absolutely viable and ideal option as long as a decent industrial output continues. On the other hand, even though I am really fond of bikes, I don't believe much it can be produced and repaired locally and non-industrially.<br><br>I have done quite complex calculations lately, and they in fact confirm that the bike may be even under current conditions 20 times cheaper than the car. The calculations also indicate that this ratio would get even better for the bike in times of crisis. Given the fact that it takes about only 5% of the material and energy needed to produce a car to make a bike, and moreover the technology is ridiculously simple *in comparison with the car*, it seems to be clear that the bike will be all right unless the system collapses as a whole. And I would add that the road does not seem to be a problem - the bike does not need much.<br><br>On the other hand, it may be that I am too unexperienced and have too little technical fantasy, but I don't think you can make a usable bike "at home". Those who talk about bamboo should explain how they grow bamboo in North America or Europe (maybe climate change will help?) - and it cannot be any kind of bamboo. It must be robust and firm enough. I haven't seen any bamboo grooves in Prague recently. The same is true of rubber trees. And well, there seem to be a really long way from a dandelion to a tyre (ideally inflatable, with all the stuff in the rubber, including the steel wires). But also, I don't believe that a blacksmith would be able to make quality bearings - the key part of the whole thing. And the chain may be better, it is still not trivial - the distance between the links should be pretty precise etc.<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c9138388644598687997 title="comment permalink">3/7/14, 1:04 AM</a><br><br>

I can't guess how the economics of that will work out as oil-for-fuel runs down: it might become super-cheap for a while as producers turn excess production from fuel (which will be too expensive to burn, and for which there will thus be too little demand) to making rubber (the demand for which will rise as natural rubber-tree latex becomes prohibitively expensive for any of a number of reasons). If so, that's a temporary situation -- in the long run, synthetic rubber from petroleum will not be affordable.<br><br>Dandelions, we've got plenty of (@streamfortyseven commented above that they produce a latex that could become rubber).<br><br>I'm also a bicycler, and we have a great trail system here in Fort Collins, so the car danger is relatively low even now, and will be less so in the future. The one real down side here is ice in the winter, and as cars fade out, I think tricycles may see a bloom, or bicycles with outriggers (training wheels, or sidecarts). I've seen a few trikes around town, and I'm curious how they handle.<br><br>But what works even better in the long run is, as JMG prefers, a good pair of shoes and a redesign of the community space. We're fairly well-off here in that respect: I don't think there are many places in town more than a mile from an existing marketplace, and it takes very little to retask any open space into an open market.<br><br>When I was in college, we'd do laundry once a week, and it was about six blocks to the nearest laundromat, and we didn't own a car. I'd usually balance it on my head. At my age, I'd buy (or cobble up) some kind of hand-pushed cart, and that would work well for groceries, too.<br><br>Large loads will inevitably go back to draft-animal-drawn carts, and the profession of "carter" will return.<br><br>I think the long-term place of bicycles will be as moderate-range, moderate-speed, low-cost transport. When he was young -- 1920's -- my late father biked 300 miles from Manhattan to upstate New York for a summer job on a farm. No trains to get him there, and while he could probably have hitched rides on farm carts, it's very slow. Any other alternative would have been very expensive. Where we used to live, I'd bike about six miles to downtown, and it took about 40 minutes: say ten MPH, and that was an easy jaunt I'd do just to get a hand-crafted heer. So even I could do 300 miles in a week and not complain too much about it, and for someone in better shape, it could be done in three days.<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c5445333729591003563 title="comment permalink">3/7/14, 1:12 AM</a><br><br>

My reasoning is similar but I would break down on a general product basis, which is the thing I ultimately care about. Note that these products don't need to be material. <br>Then there's one more thing that is rather important: The work specific budgets break down into: communicate, think, and do. Powertools can scale work somewhat but need significant upfront, thinking can be scaled somewhat by schooling, slide rules etc., and experience (possibly most important), communication can be scaled immensely through a post system, printing, and modern + user friendly electronics (I think the last point has the potential to dwarf most of the rest). Yet we are only barely scratching the surface, which may be good as the direction we're pushing is really, really scary. And this comes from someone who had been sucked into working close to the pointy end of our current batch of people herding machines.<br><br>@Joseph<br>I would very much want to second what Joseph is saying but ownership is only an important part of it, as JMG says. These things generally do not happen by accident (no, that does not mean things HAVE to be pre-meditated by an "in-group"). Think of a political movement ecosystem (or Mount Olympus) that feeds of the decisions of the masses. Some have gone sedentary with intensive farming of a two party crop rotation. Of course this also requires you to get the right mores into the soil, and now and then the use of pest control. If google translate serves you'll get the picture ("Federal Delete Days"), though it is really only one more variation on a theme: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesl%C3%B6schtage. I have an ugly feeling that many of us may be in for a thorough reset of trust especially in regard to false flag operations.

Chemurgy died the death of a thousand cuts after WWII as petrochemicals became cheaper for most applications; the last vestiges finally vanished in the 1970s.

That solar steam engine circa 1878 is nothing short of amazing. Glad to see you bring it up a second time. (I recently had a conversation about wanting to try out an antique penny farthing bike hanging on the wall of a local bike shop as well, though it mostly centered on the chance of injury that would result.)<br><br>Concerning all of the solar gizmos… as every bill a family faces continues to increase and their pocketbook gets squeezed tighter and tighter (my wife and I call it “the big squeeze” and it shows no signs of stopping), solar may well help ease the transition for the do-it-yourselfer. There are upfront costs and site specific problems to solve, but with a little forward planning and elbow grease, increasing your home’s resiliency by adding solar now could provide some welcome relief to the monthly bills when you <i>really</i> need it at some point in the future. (Though, for most people, banishing the Myth of Progress from their minds and accepting the new reality might be their first big challenge.) I am in the process of adding solar photovoltaic, solar water heat, and possibly solar air heat to our home. The design problems are mostly sorted out, I have inverters selected, and I actually have a pallet of photovoltaic panels on hand. Tackling these projects DIY style cuts their cost by at least half, if not more, which makes them economically viable on a more attractive timescale. (Keep in mind though, that all decisions should not be made purely financially and the projects, while not rocket science, do take some technical knowledge to implement properly on your own.) Through my own calculations, I estimate my break-even points as follows: Photovoltaic, approx. 6 years. Solar Water Heat, approx. 3.5 years. Solar Air Heat, approx. 5 years. Not bad at all, considering the fossil fueled competition. (…and our area’s relatively cheap energy prices.) Better yet, the life spans on all of these DIY projects are 25+ years. The solar water heater and solar air heaters can be built mostly with parts from the local hardware store. Solar photovoltaic is more high tech, and yes, it probably won’t be able to last the long haul… but it can sure help to ease the pain on the way. (Trees are great solar collectors for the long haul by the way. Whether masses of people are capable of harvesting them sustainably in the absence of fossil fuels remains to be seen.)<br><br>It is also important to remember that conservation comes first. If you skip that step, you can waste a lot of money buying extra panels and bigger inverters in an attempt to replace your extravagant energy usage. It frustrates me when I talk to friends/coworkers who are building new houses and give absolutely zero consideration to solar gain (among a multitude of other things). Simply orienting a home correctly, proper window placement, and roof overhangs can drastically reduce heating costs in the winter and cooling costs in the summer, while adding almost nothing to the cost of a cookie-cutter home. “But it must face the road!” they say. <br><br>For anyone interested in DIY solar info, I’ve found www.builditsolar.com extremely useful. Just about anyone could put together a solar water heater on his or her own. (Note: Many folks living in cities may have a harder time with DIY solar projects due to permits, licenses, etc. than I do living in a rural area. That’s a whole separate topic for discussion.)<br><br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c3855705899367639519 title="comment permalink">3/7/14, 9:54 AM</a><br><br>

I then liked to count the km it took to have a near miss (counting instances was too much work) with a car that would've taken me to hospital if I had not reacted. Often it was as little as 10 km, more common it was around 16 km. Fortunately I never had a really serious crash involving a car (did kick off a pedal once - at full speed of course).<br>You can tell if drivers are used to cyclists after a few minutes in a city. Where I am now they did a very smart thing - they put the police on bikes, whom of course ride 3 abreast through shopping streets and (from a bike vet perspective) seem completely oblivious to the world around them - yet they don't get hit. I think that is a very nice way of enforcing some bike awareness. The guardian had a bit on risk distribution in mixed traffic, the comments were nice.<br>As for Pakistan (and similar countries) - my experience in India was similar. The most important part of the car were the brakes. Not surprising if you consider population density, potholes, and all the critters just waiting to catch your bumper (with all the implications for your next round).<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c2137047615781545389 title="comment permalink">3/7/14, 1:27 PM</a><br><br>

The notional economy benefits fewer and fewer of us, excludes more and more of us, and its prime beneficiaries use their money power to influence law to exclude even more of us, and so on.<br><br>Projection: in order to evade prosecution (persecution?) under increasingly draconian laws designed to put the small and/or non-agrichemical producer out of business, growers have to leave no paper or money trail at all. Eaters and growers do business in cash or by barter, quietly, perhaps even clandestinely, keeping no records. Farmers insist officially that everything they grow is for personal consumption; crop areas are broken up and hidden in forest clearings, etc.<br><br>You see where I'm heading of course: att the logical conclusion of the crazy legislative trend, artisanal food becomes a forbidden agronomy, like marijuana cultivation -- and like marijuana cultivation, stubbornly continues to provide a living for many thousands and serve many hundreds of thousands... while official law enforcement fails, despite much bullying and threatening and enormous expense, to make much of a dent in it. Because the rulers and lawmakers are so far out of touch with the desires and priorities of the average person, that their enforcement agents fill the role of agents of an alien occupying power, not defenders of the community; and resistance is ingenious and determined.<br><br>The end result of a really dysfunctional economic regulation/management climate, I suppose, is that the shadow economy eventually challenges the "real" or legally sanctioned economy in size and power (as has already happened in many 3rd world countries). I wonder at what point the official economy/govt becomes irrelevant? (Neal Stephenson goes there, bigtime, in _Snow Crash_, imagining the Fed as an ever-shrinking cultural enclave pretending that it still runs a country that has completely Balkanised on the franchise model of ownership); US currency in his future world is a bit of a joke, a quaint anachronism.<br><br>BTW, iirc J Brunner far earlier foresaw the demonising of "health food" and fresh veggies, in The Sheep Look Up... in which healthy eating was seen by Authority as a subversive tendency :-) oh dear, it seemed like comedy at the time. There was another more recent scifi author -- I think it was N Griffith in _Ammonite_ -- who predicted the criminalisation of growing one's own food plants because *all* edible cultivars had been fully patented and Enclosed. Personally, I predict that collapse, Balkanisation, and breakdown of federal authority will probably happen well before that level of microcontrol.

The earliest riddle I remember being confounded by was magnets. I knew a magnet could magnetize a piece of iron, but how to get the first magnet if you can't find a natural one? An electro-magnet? But every way of getting an electro-magnet I could think of at the time had a regular magnet as a prerequisite. Eventually this knot was solved by a chemical battery... only to leave a half dozen new tangles.<br><br>In retrospect this was likely a better way to spend 6th grade literature than the other options I had, because there are some hundreds of simple little technologies where I looked up their material prerequisites both to make the technology and to make the tools to make the technology. Skill and social prerequisites were far over my head at the time, but it was a good start.<br><br>Still when I have free time I am likely to be figuring out what salvage I need to make different products, and figuring out what products are likely to have demand. Just today I found in my chemistry book that gypsum becomes plaster of Paris if baked slightly warmer boiling point. Testing the claim is on the docket for this week. Figuring out how to filter pollutants out of the drywall will likely be a knot I don't count on untying before garden season overwhelms my craft season. With luck though, I can keep myself supplied with a valuable material for crafts using a scrap material.<br><br>Thinking about what crafts are worth trying to preserve I have three tests so I don't follow an obvious dead end. <br><br>The first test is mass production. Any technology which only makes sense in a context of mass production, only makes sense in the past. There are countless technologies of our time which as they are used can't be sustained, but which make perfect sense in limited runs filling 'key stone niches'. Even very energy intensive things might be justified, so long as what they do is sufficiently useful. But if the technology relies on mass production to make sense it don't jive. Computers (as we now know them) are a perfect example of this, the complexity of setting up a manufacture process is so great that a mass number is required to justify it is huge, and there is the rub. Could there be a kind of computer that makes sense in the catabolis-punk era? Maybe, but it would be very different from my laptop, likely more recognizable to Babbage than Jobs, and it would be doing very serious work that powerful people would bend over backwards to have access to. Ballistics or battlefield logistics come to mind more so than music videos and pictures of funny cats. Mass production is the most distinctive technique of our Civilization, and its prospects are bleak in the extreme.<br><br>The second test is a little bit rougher, but I look up when some technology I might be interested in using was developed to a usable point. The 18th or 19th century is filled with amazing inventions of great power, which were often based on little more than technical skill, but often not put to use for a long time for non technical reasons. In the 18th century innovations in bearing manufacture, chemistry, kiln design, and metallurgy came about much of which are with in reach to a single craftsman with part time enthusiasm and raw materials that can be dug out of a landfill. Thous who can make useful things from such scrap on a cottage scale will have a good shot at keeping beans and mushrooms on the table for most of the winter. <br><br>The third test is a simple material prerequisite check, that either natural elements or a salvage source, can be found in a sensible geographic area. Otherwise I would be wary of presu<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c7905790366141157497 title="comment permalink">3/7/14, 5:09 PM</a><br><br>

They were sold by the thousands in California and Florida until about 1941. By 1941, electricity and natural gas became cheap and copper became scarce (needed for armaments). Maybe the biggest problem, though, was that the first generation of solar water heaters began to wear out! The combination of steel tanks and copper fittings promoted corrosion, and leaks in the attic caused major damage. (In my home, the gas-fired water heater is at the lowest point, near a drain, for just this reason.) It's one thing to build a proof-of-concept system beloved by its builder; it's an entirely different thing to sell a house that depends on hiring a skilled tradesman from time to time to prevent failures. Modern expectations of out-of-sight, out-of-mind domestic systems will have to be scaled back.<br><br>In 1912, Frank Shuman supervised construction of a solar-steam plant in Egypt, with about 1 acre of mirror area, driving a 50 bhp (37 kW) steam engine. It was expected to pay for itself (relative to coal-fired steam) in four years. Here, I quote the dry language of the handbook: "Just 1 yr after the plant had been constructed in Egypt, World War I broke out. Everyone involved in the project returned home to aid in the war effort.... Shuman died before the war ended.

The rubber fungus has so closely co-evolved with the trees that it will be nearly impossible to eradicate. The vast plantations in the Philippines and southeast Asia are all the product of clean clones of highly productive trees - unfortunately, high production goes hand in hand with increased susceptibilities to the fungus. Petro-rubber is used in some applications, but even today no one wants to be in a plane trying to land on synthetic tires, or dependent on a delivery via semi-truck on same. <br>The Harvard ethnobotanist, Dr Wade Davis, has done extensive research into the rubber fungus, and an excellent (if somewhat dated) essay on the subject can be found in his book "Shadows in the Sun" I highly recommend it...<br>Sticking an infected leaf in my luggage near Sao Paolo, and tossing it out of a bus somewhere in Vietnam, has been something of a pet apocalyptic fantasy of mine since I was a child reading those essays on a bus trip through Thailand with my father...it was one of the first things that truly brought home the extreme fragility of our global economy.<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c3990832571568888729 title="comment permalink">3/8/14, 5:28 AM</a><br><br>

Have "they" actually thought of something that could go on after peak oil, or is the manufacturing cost of PV cells going to be the fly in the ointment, despite it going down lately? I suspect also the pipes and pumps and solar trackers are going to go up in price as oil goes up in price. Cogenra claims 50 cents per watt maufacturing cost, but I wonder if that includes everything, or just solar panels.

You burn the wood under anoxic conditions, so basically, you put dry wood in a closed 50-gallon drum with a long coil of copper pipe out the top, and then heat the living frack out of the drum. The methanol escapes in gaseous form via the copper pipe, cools, and turns into liquid methanol, which you draw off at the appropriate point on the pipe. The wood turns into charcoal. I've read that if the wood is wet, it turns into a nasty tar instead of charcoal.<br><br>I think you can also get turpentine out of this, and other higher fractions.<br><br>I've seen pretty clear warnings that if you don't know what you're doing, and aren't careful, it's a good way to blow yourself up.<br><br>Lots of heat applied to closed containers full of wildly flammable, toxic gasses, you get the picture.<br><br>EROEI way under 1.0, of course. You don't do this to produce energy. You use your energy (typically burning wood) to produce otherwise useful substances like methanol and turpentine and charcoal.<br><br>One of the reasons I went with ethanol in my story submission is that it's a lot easier to make, though I believe its useful energy content is slightly lower than methanol, and you can drink your mistakes without going blind. :-)<br><br>I believe there are some fungal and bacterial methods of producing methanol from wood.

Lack of understanding leads to gullibility - either way (denial or acceptance). These guys have a good paper if you can find a free copy: "Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments".<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect<br><br>Secondly, about concentrating solar in general, and combined PV (PhotoVoltaics) and solar hot water systems specifically:<br><br>(a) Any concentrating solar system, thermal or photovoltaic, depends on DNI (Direct Normal Insolation - light coming directly from the sun, "normal" meaning perpendicular to the path to the sun). While some optical systems will grab some of the diffuse light close to the main optical path, the higher the concentration, the more total the dependance on DNI.<br><br>This can be a significant fraction of the total insolation, but often suffers from aerosols, clouds and airborne dust which scatter DNI, in some cases greatly, while often not cutting diffuse radiation much (e.g. DNI is turned into diffuse light).<br><br>This varies greatly depending on the climate at the location. An example on this page at the top:<br>http://solargis.info/doc/103<br><br>You can grab maps of DNI and Global Horizontal (total light falling on a flat plane) here:<br>http://solargis.info/doc/88<br>http://solargis.info/doc/71<br>Unfortunately the scale colors are not the same, but one can see, for example, that South West Saudi Arabia has massive global sun, but not so much DNI (dust in the air).<br><br>This is why Mouchot's solar steam generator works well in North Africa and summertime Paris.<br>But it is not a general solution everywhere.<br><br>(b) Because concentrating systems ignore the diffuse light, they start with a deficit of input power, therefore they must have a larger aperture area than an equivalent flat plate system. (bigger = more expense).<br><br>© Concentrator systems are more affected by dust. Consider a flat plate solar hot water panel or PV panel with a small dust particle on it. If a photon glances off within a rather large angle, it's still collected. For concentrators, a tiny divergence from its path means a photon is lost. So there's a maintenance issue (again climatically dependent) of keeping the dust down enough.<br><br>(d) Concentrator systems are dependent on at least 1-axis tracking. This means more expense/maintenance, and also more loss due to off-tracking and/or over-build to compensate for off-tracking.<br><br>Combined solar hot water and PV systems go back several decades, but Cogenra will be the 1st successful company - assuming they're successful.<br><br>(e) A standard combined module will be tuned to a given fraction of heat vs electrical output, which will vary depending on season and time of day. There will be mis-match between thermal and electrical loads, resulting in waste -&gt; high cost, depending on the load characteristics. They note one can dump the heat via their "simple and low cost" system, but a commodity flat PV module has a no cost heat dissipation system.<br><br>(f) hot water wants to corrode things and leak. Leaking water is incompatible with electrical things.<br><br>(g) They have to pump the fluid - pumps wear out, are a parasitic load.<br><br>(h) PV output degrades with increasing temperature, but thermal efficiency for hot water increases with increasing temperature. The PV is going to suffer mightily at 120 deg. C. From a Kyocera data sheet, -0.45% power decline per deg. C increase, based on 20 deg. C ambient. So the PV will be down 45% in output sitting on a 120 deg. C water pipe. Meaning to get X electricity, the PV part must by over-built significantly vs. a standalone, standard PV module.<br><br>(i) The combined units will never scale to the manufacturing volumes of standard, separate PV and solar hot water modules, so costs will be higher.<br><br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c1549747281556275106 title="comment permalink">3/9/14, 9:08 PM</a><br><br>

In fact, it was never that simple.<br><br>The present boundaries between Russia, Ukraine and Belarus do not align with old, old divisions of this Slavic territory as indicated by boundaries between various Slavic dialects. Rather, they reflect wars and other political developments of the 14th-17th centuries, which imposed new boundaries that cut across very, very old territorial divisions.<br><br>Insofar as a unified identity developed in this region at all, it developed around the organization and hierarchy of the Orthodox Church within those territories. At the head of this hierarchy, in theory, stood a bishop with the title Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus. Originally, this Church was in communion with the Oecumenical Patriarch at Constantinople, and the first several Metropolitans of Kiev were Greeks. This arrangement lasted no more than a couple of centuries.<br><br>After that, there came to be two competing, canonically legitimate Metropolitans who claimed this title, and neither of them was actually in Kiev. One of them lived in Muscovite Russia; the other, in Lithuanian Russia. Each of them controlled about half of the territory of the original Metropolitanate. And the line between the two jurisdictions cut right through the present territory of Ukraine<br><br>In the late 1500s things began to get even more complicated. Each Metropolitanate had originally been aligned with the Orthodox Church, and had been in communion with the Patriarch of Constantinople. In the 1590s, however, the western Metropolitanate abandoned its old alignment and communion. Instead, it aligned itself with the Catholic Church and entered into communion with the Pope of Rome -- while continuing to conduct all its rituals and liturgy according to the Byzantine Rite.<br><br>Great hostility ensued, to put it mildly.<br><br>Eventually, after WW2, Ukraine was annexed by the USSR, and the Byzantine Rite Catholics were compelled (by fiat from Moscow) to realign themselves with Moscow and Constantinople and return to communion with the Orthodox Church in Moscow. This only increased the internal tension within Ukraine.<br><br>Since this time, official Soviet Russian and Ukrainian historians and history textbooks have stressed the essential unity of Ukraine and its people from early times, for political reasons, and insisted that Ukraine's closest historical ties have always been with Russia. It is a myth, but it is still very useful politically. However, the old historical memories die hard, and even now they are not entirely dead.<br><br>As for Crimea, it became part of Ukraine only in 1954. For a century and a half before that, it had been a part of Russia. And before that time, it had been a Muslim land for many centuries, home of the Crimean Tatars, under the protection of the Ottoman Empire.<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c5265928059505470537 title="comment permalink">3/10/14, 11:16 AM</a><br><br>

Too many of those will kill you. But we are also constantly bombarded by X-Rays from solar and high-atmosphere sources, and we're built to take a certain amount of it. If we weren't, we'd all be dead.<br><br>With MRI, you're going to get exposed to intense magnetic fields. Many claims, little hard evidence of potential harm. Of more concern are the dopants and contrasts they give you, usually by injection. A common one is gadolinium (element 64), which is a rare-earth metal; some people have allergic reactions to it. They also use various radioactive isotopes, e.g. tritiated glucose, not because they are radioactive, but because the tritium (heavy hydrogen) in the glucose resonates at a different frequency than ordinary hydrogen, so they can tune the MRI and see the injection move through your body without seeing all the other glucose that's already everywhere. An MRI without contrast isn't very useful. Again, we're built to take a certain amount of chemical and radiation poisoning, else we'd all be dead.<br><br>Computers are not necessary for tomography. There are photographic ways to do it, though it's more mechanically complex, and you have to develop an eye for screening out "artifacts" -- that is, ghost images created by the process itself, not by things being observed. For very low-resolution images, you can even use readings you write down in a lab book, then do some math with a pencil.<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c1443950665194121220 title="comment permalink">3/10/14, 12:06 PM</a><br><br>

I have a long standing interest in naval and maritime history, ships and the sea. When I was a child, I had several books about the Age of Sail, including a book about windjammers. I thought they were some of the coolest ships ever to sail the seven seas! <br><br>The neat thing about windjammers is that since their hulls, masts and much of their rigging was made out of steel, they could be much larger than earlier sailing ships and could carry huge amounts of cargo. They were built for cargo capacity rather than raw speed, but their long, lean hulls, tall masts and huge sail areas made them some of the fastest sailing ships ever built. Some could hit 20 knots or better with a good, stiff wind. Some also had diesel engines that could be used for maneuvering in tight areas like a crowded harbor or providing propulsion when there was no wind (being stuck in the Doldrums for weeks on end is no fun). This would be an excellent technology to revive.<br><br>The fact they were built out of steel means this is a technology that could be revived by a scarcity industrial, salvage or eco-technic society in the near to mid term future. Timber suitable for the construction of large ships is in short supply these days and will be for a long time until the old growth forests have had to time to grow back, but there will be lots of scrap steel and iron available for salvage and recycling for a very long time to come. I could easily see some of the coastal cities of today (or perhaps the ones further inland if the present day coastal cities end up under water) becoming major shipbuilding centers of the eco-technic age as the ruins are dismantled for their steel beams, rebar and junked out cars, providing plenty of work for ruinmen, steel workers and shipbuilders alike.<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c5737764339078821448 title="comment permalink">3/10/14, 1:52 PM</a><br><br>

That hardly means that they persecuted all religions equally: religions viewed as alien or foreign, including Roman Catholicism, were hit much. much harder than religions (like the Orthodox Church) viewed as part of the country's own past. Throughout the entire Soviet Period there was a succession of official heads of the Russian Orthodox Church (Patriarchs), who worked pretty much hand-in-glove with the Soviet state and supported its aims. As for the current Patriarch Kiril, rumor has it that he, like Putin, was a former KGB man, and one of Putin's good buddies. <br><br>In Eastern Europe hardly anything is done the way a Westerner would do it.

Remember that we will only be able to produce a tiny fraction of the liquid fuels that we produce now in the future once the cheap energy bubble ends, something the Archdruid has been pointing out all along. Much of the biofuels production right now is made possible by the large scale use of fossil fuels. Biofuels production in the future will be on a much smaller scale and will be much more expensive than the cheap diesel and gas we have become accustomed to.<br><br>I think a lot of people are not really taking in account just how much the end of cheap oil will affect the world and that a lot of things we take for granted today will either come to an end or be restricted to a very small group of people. How many civilian ship owners will be able to afford the sort of extravagant use of energy we take for granted today, especially when the shipping industry tends to be a low profit margin kind of business to begin with? An engine 50 times bigger with 500 times more fuel? Only if the ship owners can find that much fuel at a price they can afford in a post peak world. As it is, ship owners are already looking for ways to reduce their fuel costs, by ordering captains to cut back cruising speeds and even experimenting with auxiliary sails for diesel powered merchant ships. Sails and muscle power will be much cheaper then biodiesel in a post industrial/post peak world.<br><br>So what happens when the cheap oil runs out? Much, perhaps all, of the present system of industrialized agriculture will go away, and this will reduce the production of both food crops and biofuels greatly. There is also the question of how much land and crops can be diverted to biofuels production before the reduction in food production becomes too severe and food riots and revolutions start breaking out. Tahrir Square or the Bastille, anyone? There will no doubt be some biofuels available, but not enough to run all of the ocean going ships that will be needed. I think we will probably go back to a system of trade in which sailing ships are the main means of international and long distance trade, and the use of biofuels will be largely restricted to those who can afford them and to situations where they are actually needed, especially since the world's navies will probably take up a sizeable fraction of the biodiesel that is produced.<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c3511221656520512709 title="comment permalink">3/11/14, 7:25 PM</a><br><br>

And if I have the technical means for an engine with X horsepower, why can I not have 50X horsepower, and if I can have Y liters of fuel, why can I not have 500Y liters?"<br><br>The short answer is limits. The argument you used is exactly why steamships replaces sailing ships. A 9 knot steamer with 25 man crew was more reliable and cheaper to run than a sailing ship of the same cargo capacity with a 55 man crew and a speed that varied from zero to 22 knots. Throwing in the odd calm, the big square riggers were lucky to average 7 or 8 knots over their working life.<br><br>The longer answer is if you're using biofuel, there's a limit to how much acreage you can devote to growing fuel vs. food. There's only so much arable land, and only so much human and animal muscle, or biofuel to run tractors before you starve the people who work the farm. You could kill whales again, but even for just lamp oil we did that at an unsustainable rate over a century ago.<br><br>My suggestion would be to use tugs in port, as was usual as soon as steam tugs were developed. An electric auxiliary and enough battery capacity to get through the doldrums would improve schedule reliability. Some recharging could be done using the propellor as the generator input on any downwind courses with a stiff enough wind to maintain speed as well.<br><br>Glenn<br><br>in the Bramblepatch<br>Marrowstone Island<br>Salish Sea<br>Cascadia<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c1490219447135466273 title="comment permalink">3/11/14, 7:29 PM</a><br><br>

I was re-considering so many of my perceptions and beliefs about how to 'save the world', and wanted to see what other people were thinking. Your analysis of Stewart's book seemed the most perceptive about the big issues, and I have enjoyed catching up and following your blog since then. This is my first post, and I thought it time to join the discussion, rather than just observing.<br><br>I am sure I am not the only reader to think it is that ironic I can spend a whole evening, online, following the leads and links from your blog and the thoughtful comments, rather than popping in a DVD for a current movie that often seems just fluff compared to the real issues on the table. Tonight I read about Stangenkunst, latex from Russian dandelions, and about Herman Hesse, which prompted me to pull up the quote from the movie ‘Dr. Zhivago’ that seems relevant to your points about revolutions and tyrannies:<br><br>http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Doctor_Zhivago_(film)<br>Yuri: You lay life on a table and you cut out all the tumours of injustice. Marvellous.<br>Yevgraf: "I told him if he felt like that he should join the party."<br>Yuri: Ah, but cutting out the tumours of injustice - that's a deep operation. Someone must keep life alive while you do it. By living. Isn't that right?<br><br>Boris Pasternak was a thoughtful observer of his times. His quote below parallels your cautions about the relative ease of transition to a newer, and falsely appearing shinier new order, from your recent blogs about fascism.<br><br>http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/7902.Boris_Pasternak <br>“No single man makes history. History cannot be seen, just as one cannot see grass growing. Wars and revolutions, kings and Robespierres, are history's organic agents, its yeast. But revolutions are made by fanatical men of action with one-track mind, geniuses in their ability to confine themselves to a limited field. They overturn the old order in a few hours or days, the whole upheaval takes a few weeks or at most years, but the fanatical spirit that inspired the upheavals is worshiped for decades thereafter, for centuries. ” <br>― Boris Pasternak, Doctor Zhivago<br><br>My sons are in their early 20’s, and I have given them both your Green Wizardry book. They are apt pupils, and yet I know it takes time to transition to seeing current events in light of the issues you so clearly describe. I have read many of the books inspired by your blog, and the list continues. I take some comfort in the gradual contraction scenario, which gives me time to re-read Gibbon’s Decline and Fall (of the Roman Empire), while studying Bill Mollison’s Permaculture, and trying to take Permaculture Design classes, and planting seeds.<br><br><a href=the-steampunk-future-revisited.html#c5478868453899841463 title="comment permalink">3/13/14, 11:41 PM</a><br><br>

I think one of the key directions to focus on is the need/benefit of a particular technology, and not the widespread distribution of it. As a good example, you mention fMRI, something dear to my concussed head. We don't need everyone to get an fMRI in order to benefit from it. The research being done provides information that can be applied immediately to people when basic triage tells the doctor they MAY have been injured, without having to scan them at all. Most treatments wouldn't harm a person who didn't have a brain injury, but would tremendously help those who do. A steampunk society could support a contingent of research. The same applies to fossil fuels. A steampunk/solar society could easily support asteroid defense on a fraction of the cost of our present military budgets, which are mostly justified by our unfettered rapacity for resources. The opposite of consumer-capitalism isn't frugality: it's a sales tax. The biggest problem with the current democracy (one dollar, one vote-counted at the cash registers) is that the decision point is blind to the real costs of the purchase. If people really saw the true cost of a prepackaged candy bar or entertainment device, they would be influenced to make their own (steampunk and local foods). <br>You're doing good work, JMG.
