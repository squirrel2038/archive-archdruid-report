I have yet to hear anyone in the peak oil blogosphere mention the name of Captain Gustaf Erikson of the <span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>Å</span>land Islands and his fleet of windjammers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For all I know, he’s been completely forgotten now, his name and accomplishments packed away in the same dustbin of forgotten history as solar steam-engine pioneer Augustin Mouchot, his near contemporary. If so, it’s high time that his footsteps sounded again on the quarterdeck of our collective imagination, because his story—and the core insight that committed him to his lifelong struggle—both have plenty to teach about the realities framing the future of technology in the wake of today’s era of fossil-fueled abundance. </div>
<br>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/erikson-2f0642-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=320 src=../../img/erikson-2f0642-291x320-g95.jpg srcset="../../img/erikson-2f0642-582x640-g92.jpg 2x" width=291></a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Erikson, born in 1872, grew up in a seafaring family and went to sea as a ship’s boy at the age of nine. At 19 he was the skipper of a coastal freighter working the Baltic and North Sea ports; two years later he shipped out as mate on a windjammer for deepwater runs to Chile and Australia, and eight years after that he was captain again, sailing three- and four-masted cargo ships to the far reaches of the planet. A bad fall from the rigging in 1913 left his right leg crippled, and he left the sea to become a shipowner instead, buying the first of what would become the 20th century’s last major fleet of windpowered commercial cargo vessels.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s too rarely remembered these days that the arrival of steam power didn’t make commercial sailing vessels obsolete across the board. The ability to chug along at eight knots or so without benefit of wind was a major advantage in some contexts—naval vessels and passenger transport, for example—but coal was never cheap, and the long stretches between coaling stations on some of the world’s most important trade routes meant that a significant fraction of a steamship’s total tonnage had to be devoted to coal, cutting into the capacity to haul paying cargoes. For bulk cargoes over long distances, in particular, sailing ships were a good deal more economical all through the second half of the 19th century, and some runs remained a paying proposition for sail well into the 20th.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was the niche that the windjammers of the era exploited. They were huge—up to 400 feet from stem to stern—square-sided, steel-hulled ships, fitted out with more than an acre of canvas and miles of steel-wire rigging.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They could be crewed by a few dozen sailors, and hauled prodigious cargoes:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>up to 8,000 tons of Australian grain, Chilean nitrate—or, for that matter, coal; it was among the ironies of the age that the coaling stations that allowed steamships to refuel on long voyages were very often kept stocked by tall ships, which could do the job more economically than steamships themselves could. The markets where wind could outbid steam were lucrative enough that at the beginning of the 20th century, there were still thousands of working windjammers hauling cargoes across the world’s oceans.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That didn’t change until bunker oil refined from petroleum ousted coal as the standard fuel for powered ships. Petroleum products carry much more energy per pound than even the best grade of coal, and the better grades of coal were beginning to run short and rise accordingly in price well before the heyday of the windjammers was over. A diesel-powered vessel had to refuel less often, devote less of its tonnage to fuel, and cost much less to operate than its coal-fired equivalent. That’s why Winston Churchill, as head of Britain’s Admiralty, ordered the entire British Navy converted from coal to oil in the years just before the First World War, and why coal-burning steamships became hard to find anywhere on the seven seas once the petroleum revolution took place. That’s also why most windjammers went out of use around the same time; they could compete against coal, but not against dirt-cheap diesel fuel. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/brochure-f9ab42-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 src=../../img/brochure-f9ab42-g95.jpg></a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Gustav Erikson went into business as a shipowner just as that transformation was getting under way. The rush to diesel power allowed him to buy up windjammers at a fraction of their former price—his first ship, a 1,500-ton bark, cost him less than $10,000, and the pride of his fleet, the four-masted <i>Herzogin Cecilie</i>, set him back only $20,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A tight rein on operating expenses and a careful eye on which routes were profitable kept his firm solidly in the black. The bread and butter of his business came from shipping wheat from southern Australia to Europe; Erikson’s fleet and the few other windjammers still in the running would leave European ports in the northern hemisphere’s autumn and sail for Spencer Gulf on Australia’s southern coast, load up with thousands of tons of wheat, and then race each other home, arriving in the spring—a good skipper with a good crew could make the return trip in less than 100 days, hitting speeds upwards of 15 knots when the winds were right. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There was money to be made that way, but Erikson’s commitment to the windjammers wasn’t just a matter of profit. A sentimental attachment to tall ships was arguably part of the equation, but there was another factor as well. In his latter years, Erikson was fond of telling anyone who would listen that a new golden age for sailing ships was on the horizon:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>sooner or later, he insisted, the world’s supply of coal and oil would run out, steam and diesel engines would become so many lumps of metal fit only for salvage, and those who still knew how to haul freight across the ocean with only the wind for power would have the seas, and the world’s cargoes, all to themselves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those few books that mention Erikson at all like to portray him as the last holdout of a departed age, a man born after his time. On the contrary, he was born before his time, and lived too soon. When he died in 1947, the industrial world’s first round of energy crises were still a quarter century away, and only a few lonely prophets had begun to grasp the absurdity of trying to build an enduring civilization on the ever-accelerating consumption of a finite and irreplaceable fuel supply. He had hoped that his sons would keep the windjammers running, and finish the task of getting the traditions and technology of the tall ships through the age of fossil fuels and into the hands of the seafarers of the future. I’m sorry to say that that didn’t happen; the profits to be made from modern freighters were too tempting, and once the old man was gone, his heirs sold off the windjammers and replaced them with diesel-powered craft.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Erikson’s story is worth remembering, though, and not simply because he was an early prophet of what we now call peak oil. He was also one of the very first people in our age to see past the mythology of technological progress that dominated the collective imagination of his time and ours, and glimpse the potentials of one of the core strategies this blog has been advocating for the last eight years.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We can use the example that would have been dearest to his heart, the old technology of windpowered maritime cargo transport, to explore those potentials. To begin with, it’s crucial to remember that the only thing that made tall ships obsolete as a transport technology was cheap abundant petroleum. The age of coal-powered steamships left plenty of market niches in which windjammers were economically more viable than steamers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The difference, as already noted, was a matter of energy density—that’s the technical term for how much energy you get out of each pound of fuel; the best grades of coal have only about half the energy density of petroleum distillates, and as you go down the scale of coal grades, energy density drops steadily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The brown coal that’s commonly used for fuel these days provides, per pound, rather less than a quarter the heat energy you get from a comparable weight of bunker oil. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As the world’s petroleum reserves keep sliding down the remorseless curve of depletion, in turn, the price of bunker oil—like that of all other petroleum products—will continue to move raggedly upward. If Erikson’s tall ships were still in service, it’s quite possible that they would already be expanding their market share; as it is, it’s going to be a while yet before rising fuel costs will make it economical for shipping firms to start investing in the construction of a new generation of windjammers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nonetheless, as the price of bunker oil keeps rising, it’s eventually going to cross the line at which sail becomes the more profitable option, and when that happens, those firms that invest in tall ships will profit at the expense of their old-fahioned, oil-burning rivals. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yes, I’m aware that this last claim flies in the face of one of the most pervasive superstitions of our time, the faith-based insistence that whatever technology we happen to use today must always and forever be better, in every sense but a purely sentimental one, than whatever technology it replaced. The fact remains that what made diesel-powered maritime transport standard across the world’s oceans was not some abstract superiority of bunker oil over wind and canvas, but the simple reality that for a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>while, during the heyday of cheap abundant petroleum, diesel-powered freighters were more profitable to operate than any of the other options.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was always a matter of economics, and as petroleum depletion tilts the playing field the other way, the economics will change accordingly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All else being equal, if a shipping company can make larger profits moving cargoes by sailing ships than by diesel freighters, coal-burning steamships, or some other option, the sailing ships will get the business and the other options will be left to rust in port. It really is that simple. The point at which sailing vessels become economically viable, in turn, is determined partly by fuel prices and partly by the cost of building and outfitting a new generation of sailing ships. Erikson’s plan was to do an end run around the second half of that equation, by keeping a working fleet of windjammers in operation on niche routes until rising fuel prices made it profitable to expand into other markets. Since that didn’t happen, the lag time will be significantly longer, and bunker fuel may have to price itself entirely out of certain markets—causing significant disruptions to maritime trade and to national and regional economies—before it makes economic sense to start building windjammers again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a source of wry amusement to me that when the prospect of sail transport gets raised, even in the greenest of peak oil circles, the immediate reaction from most people is to try to find some way to smuggle engines back onto the tall ships. Here again, though, the issue that matters is economics, not our current superstitious reverence for loud metal objects. There were plenty of ships in the 19th century that combined steam engines and sails in various combinations, and plenty of ships in the early 20th century that combined diesel engines and sails the same way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Windjammers powered by sails alone were more economical than either of these for long-range bulk transport, because engines and their fuel supplies cost money, they take up tonnage that can otherwise be used for paying cargo, and their fuel costs cut substantially into profits as well. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, I’ve speculated in posts here about the possibility that Augustin Mouchot’s solar steam engines, or something like them, could be used as a backup power source for the windjammers of the deindustrial future. It’s interesting to note that the use of renewable energy sources for shipping in Erikson’s time wasn’t limited to the motive power provided by sails; coastal freighters of the kind Erikson skippered when he was nineteen were called “onkers” in Baltic Sea slang, because their windmill-powered deck pumps made a repetitive “onk-urrr, onk-urrr” noise. Still, the same rule applies; enticing as it might be to imagine sailors on a becalmed windjammer hauling the wooden cover off a solar steam generator, expanding the folding reflector, and sending steam down belowdecks to drive a propeller, whether such a technology came into use would depend on whether the cost of buying and installing a solar steam engine, and the lost earning capacity due to hold space being taken up by the engine, was less than the profit to be made by getting to port a few days sooner. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Are there applications where engines are worth having despite their drawbacks? Of course. Unless the price of biodiesel ends up at astronomical levels, or the disruptions ahead along the curve of the Long Descent cause diesel technology to be lost entirely, tugboats will probably have diesel engines for the imaginable future, and so will naval vessels; the number of major naval battles won or lost in the days of sail because the wind blew one way or another will doubtless be on the minds of many as the age of petroleum winds down. Barring a complete collapse in technology, in turn, naval vessels will no doubt still be made of steel—once cannons started firing explosive shells instead of solid shot, wooden ships became deathtraps in naval combat—but most others won’t be; large-scale steel production requires ample supplies of coke, which is produced by roasting coal, and depletion of coal supplies in a postpetroleum future guarantees that steel will be much more expensive compared to other materials than it is today, or than it was during the heyday of the windjammers.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Note that here again, the limits to technology and resource use are far more likely to be economic than technical. In purely technical terms, a maritime nation could put much of its arable land into oil crops and use that to keep its merchant marine fueled with biodiesel. In economic terms, that’s a nonstarter, since the advantages to be gained by it are much smaller than the social and financial costs that would be imposed by the increase in costs for food, animal fodder, and all other agricultural products. In the same way, the technical ability to build an all-steel merchant fleet will likely still exist straight through the deindustrial future; what won’t exist is the ability to do so without facing prompt bankruptcy. That’s what happens when you have to live on the product of each year’s sunlight, rather than drawing down half a billion years of fossil photosynthesis:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>there are hard economic limits to how much of anything you can produce, and increasing production of one thing pretty consistently requires cutting production of something else. People in today’s industrial world don’t have to think like that, but their descendants in the deindustrial world will either learn how to do so or perish. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This point deserves careful study, as it’s almost always missed by people trying to think their way through the technological consequences of the deindustrial future. One reader of mine who objected to talk about abandoned technologies in a previous post quoted with approval the claim, made on another website, that if a deindustrial society can make one gallon of biodiesel, it can make as many thousands or millions of gallons as it wants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Technically, maybe; economically, not a chance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s as though you made $500 a week and someone claimed you could buy as many bottles of $100-a-bottle scotch as you wanted; in any given week, your ability to buy expensive scotch would be limited by your need to meet other expenses such as food and rent, and some purchase plans would be out of reach even if you ignored all those other expenses and spent your entire paycheck at the liquor store. The same rule applies to societies that don’t have the windfall of fossil fuels at their disposal—and once we finish burning through the fossil fuels we can afford to extract, every human society for the rest of our species’ time on earth will be effectively described in those terms. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The one readily available way around the harsh economic impacts of fossil fuel depletion is the one that Gunnar Erikson tried, but did not live to complete—the strategy of keeping an older technology in use, or bringing a defunct technology back into service, while there’s still enough wealth sloshing across the decks of the industrial economy to make it relatively easy to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve suggested above that if his firm had kept the windjammers sailing, scraping out a living on whatever narrow market niche they could find, the rising cost of bunker oil might already have made it profitable to expand into new niches; there wouldn’t have been the additional challenge of finding the money to build new windjammers from the keel up, train crews to sail them, and get ships and crews through the learning curve that’s inevitably a part of bringing an unfamiliar technology on line. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That same principle has been central to quite a few of this blog’s projects. One small example is the encouragement I’ve tried to give to the rediscovery of the slide rule as an effective calculating device. There are still plenty of people alive today who know how to use slide rules, plenty of books that teach how to crunch numbers with a slipstick, and plenty of slide rules around. A century down the line, when slide rules will almost certainly be much more economically viable than pocket calculators, those helpful conditions might not be in place—but if people take up slide rules now for much the same reasons that Erikson kept the tall ships sailing, and make an effort to pass skills and slipsticks on to another generation, no one will have to revive or reinvent a dead technology in order to have quick accurate calculations for practical tasks such as engineering, salvage, and renewable energy technology. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The collection of sustainable-living skills I somewhat jocularly termed “green wizardry,” which I learned back in the heyday of the appropriate tech movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s, passed on to the readers of this blog in a series of posts a couple of years ago, and have now explored <a href="http://www.newsociety.com/affil.mvc?Affil=ARCH&amp;Page=../Books/G/Green-Wizardry">in book form as well</a>, is another case in point. Some of that knowledge, more of the attitudes that undergirded it, and nearly all the small-scale, hands-on, basement-workshop sensibility of the movement in question has vanished from our collective consciousness in the years since the Reagan-Thatcher counterrevolution foreclosed any hope of a viable future for the industrial world. There are still enough books on appropriate tech gathering dust in used book shops, and enough in the way of living memory among those of us who were there, to make it possible to recover those things; another generation and that hope would have gone out the window. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are plenty of other possibilities along the same lines. For that matter, it’s by no means unreasonable to plan on investing in technologies that may not be able to survive all the way through the decline and fall of the industrial age, if those technologies can help cushion the way down. Whether or not it will still be possible to manufacture PV cells at the bottom of the deindustrial dark ages, <a href=../../2006/08/why-renewable-energy-matters.html>as I’ve been pointing out since the earliest days of this blog</a>, getting them in place now on a home or local community scale is likely to pay off handsomely when grid-based electricity becomes unreliable, as it will.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The modest amounts of electricity you can expect to get from this and other renewable sources can provide critical services (for example, refrigeration and long-distance communication) that will be worth having as the Long Descent unwinds. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
That said, all such strategies depend on having enough economic surplus on hand to get useful technologies in place before the darkness closes in. As things stand right now, as many of my readers will have had opportunity to notice already, that surplus is trickling away. Those of us who want to help make a contribution to the future along those lines had better get a move on. </div>

That included practically every man in my own family up to and including my late grandfather. My father was the one who broke the chain, he went into education and I went into the arts. <br><br>And what amazed me, when I first started to learn about it, was the fact that relatively few of these men (my family and otherwise) were simple fishermen and lobstermen. Mainers have reputations as bumpkins and we like to believe that we are more worldly and sophisticated, but I had my doubts after reading accounts from many of these men, who crewed sailing ships that took them all over the world - the Caribbean and South America (especially Brazil and Cuba), the coast of West Africa, Egypt, Turkey, etc. I happen to have a couple of my great-grandfather's logbooks, with handwritten notations about trips to Iceland, Scotland and Scandinavia. <br><br>What gives some feeling of optimism is the fact that today, in my hometown and in the surrounding area, the skill set necessary to build and operate sailing ships is not completely lost. Sailing - real sailing, as it's not considered sporting to use the inboard motor except for emergencies - is still a popular hobby. There are also still a few people who know and practice the art of building wooden sailing ships. Right now there is even a fundraising effort underway for a documentary about one of them. That's typical of the place, as it has an enormous cottage industry of local historians who are documenting the region's maritime history. They usually do so for reasons that are more nostalgic than practical, but I get the feeling that future generations will be grateful that they managed to preserve and document as much as they have.<br><br><br><a href=#c4455558190539632825 title="comment permalink">3/26/14, 6:00 PM</a><br><br>

My first thoughts turned to a business article I read about fifteen years ago, where investors were being courted to revive dirigibles and a fuel efficient air-cargo fleet. Nothing seems to have come of it, but I always wished that there was some prescience to what I read, and we'd see airships again by now. Who knows, maybe yet... I suppose one major limiting factor would be helium. <br>Thanks again.

Erikson. Linn and Larry Pardey mention him and his struggles in one of their books (Serrafyn's European Adventure). Many of his crews were unpaid "cadets" or even paid him for the privilege of their on deck education. In the end, even he couldn't compete with cheap oil. <br><br>I agree with your analysis though, he just didn't live long enough. In some parts of the non-industrialized world, sail has never gone away. And it is starting to return even in Europe and America. Small ships, carrying expensive cargoes for a niche clientele, but it's a start.<br><br>Any experienced sailor will tell you an auxiliary engine is useful. A run can be dramatically shortened by the ability to motor through the doldrums or the horse latitudes. Still, one needs to do the math; is the increase in cost of engineering, fuel and the personnel to maintain and operate the machinery and the loss of cargo capacity worth the shorter voyage? As calculated over all the voyages a ship might make in it's working life?<br><br>I will note, the Pardey's, modern yachters, have never had an auxiliary on their own boats. And their passage times are no worse, and frequently better than other larger vessels equipped with power. (Their first boat was 24' and about 5 tons, their second 30' and about 10 tons). Their logic was leaving out the motor reduced the initial and maintenance cost by 25% and let them pay for materials and complete building their vessels that much quicker so they could get going.

Though I once wandered across the Åland Islands in some youthful travels, I never heard of Cpt. Erikson. Your post hits on a central tension on all of this - namely the ability to do things that aren't economical. As you note at a kind of macro-level, it's naive to think you can get stuff done if it is too counter-economical. At a more human level we are much less hemmed in by the payoff of any given activity. One of the attractions of your green wizardry is that its mission - working on some skills and technologies that make sense in an imagined future rather than today - is at a scale that motivated individuals can actually have an impact.<br><br><a href=#c8198552528017543061 title="comment permalink">3/26/14, 6:19 PM</a><br><br>

Thank you. I've been enjoying these vignettes of late where you hammer down on an important point that people are having a hard time grasping. I find it helpful for my own thought process.<br><br>I just moved to a new place at the end of January--an old farmhouse on some land, a couple miles down the road from where I was before. I'm renting, didn't buy, but I work for the owners, am on good terms with them, and should be able to settle in and stay awhile. A good situation for me.<br><br>There are plenty of tasks for me to do here (and I'll be utilizing <em>Green Wizardry</em> as one guide) but the most immediate is to get in garden beds. I put in my first small one on Monday, at the end of a three day stretch of sun, when the soil had dried out enough to work. I removed the sod layer with a mattock, loosened the soil with a digging fork and removed a significant number of large rocks (this is going to be quite a task, but at least I can make some nice looking beds by lining them with the excavated rocks) then incorporated in some complete organic with my 3-tooth cultivator. Finished it off by putting in some potatoes. It's a small start--a 3' x 10' bed--but it felt great to be digging in the soil and get a little food in the ground after this winter.<br><br>It was a lot of work for one small bed, though, and as I looked over the lawn and thought about all the beds I ultimately want to dig and amend and plant, I couldn't help but think how nice it will be <em>next</em> year when the beds already exist. Rather than sweating the weather, waiting for a good stretch of sun just so the soil will dry out enough so I can peel up the grass and dig up the beds--before I get around to actually planting--I'll be able to just weed the beds (regardless of rain) and then wait for the soil to dry out to do a quick loosening of the soil, amending, and planting.<br><br>The details are different, but the pattern is the same. Next year, my beds will be my fleet, carried through. This year, I have a very large investment of labor to put in before I'm ready to start growing food.<br><br>I'm excited to be settling. The last few years, I've moved each year, for various reasons. I've only moved a mile or two each time, but every year has been a restart in terms of gardening, which really is a long game and built upon annual investments. I'm glad I won't be moving again for the foreseeable future. The beds will be ready next year. I can finally grow my own garlic. And I'll be working on other infrastructure this year, too (a rebuilt chicken coop, perennials, fruit trees, a solar water batch heater, and more) to make future years easier and more LESS focused.<br><br>Anyway, I just wanted to relate that. This feels to me like perhaps your clearest explanation of the importance of the economic factor in future technology usage and the bit about carrying through a technology really struck me, as my little analogy here hopefully makes clear. Thanks.<br><br><a href=#c1938378040768588617 title="comment permalink">3/26/14, 6:41 PM</a><br><br>

The older I get the more I see parallels between the way dreams unfold and the way humans unfold their societal dramas. Cultures, civilizations, and their various narratives of religion and nation or tribe and its purposes, the way different societies get utterly taken up with a certain worldview with its projects and the efforts to maintain it, all the while being usually oblivious to other civilizations and their very different goals and structures, or when aware of them dismissing them with nary an inward reflection - it is so irrational, so dreamlike. Dreamlike because of the acceptance of all the weirdness without questioning it, as one does in dreams. And dreamlike because as in dreams, we just keep the story-stream running, making it up as we go along. <br>Now, underneath all that there is a bedrock of reality, but because we all know deep in the subconscious that we haven't a clue what's going on, everyone is trying to figure out what is true and actual, but no one quite can. (Except for you of course, JMG.)<br><br>And it occurs to me that much like the way that most people are fairly reasonable on their own but can get swept away in a mob, so is the running of our societies like a mob with little rationality at the helm.<br><br>Anyway, this is what ran through my head as I read this post, with the contents of which I have no argument at all. Seems like switching to sail will be among the easiest and least disruptive of our coming transitions.<br><br><a href=#c8707038109837601404 title="comment permalink">3/26/14, 6:42 PM</a><br><br>

That’s why Winston Churchill, as head of Britain’s Admiralty, ordered the entire British Navy converted from coal to oil in the years just before the First World War, and why coal-burning steamships became hard to find anywhere on the seven seas once the petroleum revolution took place."<br><br>The replacement of coal with oil as a major fuel about the time of Churchill's action had an immediate effect visible in hindsight--the reversal of decades of coal technology making carbon dioxide emissions worse than would be expected from population and affluence alone. Before 1910, the effects of technology amplify impact as signified by carbon dioxide; after 1910, the effects of technology start reducing the impact expected. One can see that change in Figures 16 and 17 at the link below. They're among the graphs I show my students when I explain the I=P*A*T equation, in which population (P) and affluence (A) increase environmental impact (I) as they go up, but technology (T) can work either with or against P and A. I'll be showing my classes these figures and others from the page next week; here's to they're making as big an impression on them as they usually do.<br><br>http://www.ejsd.co/public/journal_article/11<br><br>Of course, the promise of technology decreasing or maintaining impact in the face of higher population and demand for more affluence is what motivates a lot of the "bright green" types you gently mock here. They're the ones you want to make a bargain with, one they might take you up on. Still, appropriate technology will do the same thing, even if it isn't what our society currently considers advanced technology.<br><br>" In purely technical terms, a maritime nation could put much of its arable land into oil crops and use that to keep its merchant marine fueled with biodiesel. In economic terms, that’s a nonstarter, since the advantages to be gained by it are much smaller than the social and financial costs that would be imposed by the increase in costs for food, animal fodder, and all other agricultural products."<br><br>That's not stopping the U.S. when it comes to corn ethanol as fuel. Another graph I show my students is the one at the next link, which displays how every additional bushel and then some of corn grown in the U.S. for the past decade has gone to ethanol production. We're quite content to burn ethanol in our cars instead of feeding it to ourselves or our livestock--so far.<br><br>http://www.marketminder.com/a/fisher-investments-inside-reasing-global-grain-prices/ab321c53-a493-4c7c-94e6-b2ffae6a484a.aspx<br><br>On another note...<br><br>"One small example is the encouragement I’ve tried to give to the rediscovery of the slide rule as an effective calculating device. There are still plenty of people alive today who know how to use slide rules, plenty of books that teach how to crunch numbers with a slipstick, and plenty of slide rules around. A century down the line, when slide rules will almost certainly be much more economically viable than pocket calculators, those helpful conditions might not be in place—but if people take up slide rules now for much the same reasons that Erikson kept the tall ships sailing, and make an effort to pass skills and slipsticks on to another generation, no one will have to revive or reinvent a dead technology in order to have quick accurate calculations for practical tasks such as engineering, salvage, and renewable energy technology."<br><br>Steampunk calculators--how could I forget? I'll see if I can use that example in my class next week, too.

Yes, it's an interesting study, and I'll probably comment on it in a bit. <br><br>Pongo, that's very good to hear. Are you involved in that work at all? <br><br>Paul, it depends wholly on what's cheaper. Once the cost of human labor comes down below that of complex mechanical gadgets -- and in a world of 7 billion people, that's going to happen -- it'll be back to human hands and minds instead. <br><br>Raven, got it. <br><br>Kyoto, I've seen dirigibles discussed now and then in terms of cost savings, but helium's the big challenge at this point, as -- surprise! -- it's been used at an irresponsible rate and the world is running low on it. <br><br>Jose, that's an interesting point, which probably deserves a post of its own one of these days. <br><br>Glenn, I should have known that you'd have heard of Erikson. Your comments on the economics of auxiliary engines are spot on, of course. <br><br>Andrew, exactly. Even for an individual, there's only so far you can go before uneconomic activity starts making it hard to pay the rent, but green wizardry has its payoffs -- lower heating bills and a better diet, for example -- and you're right that there's more wiggle room where the market isn't directly involved. <br><br>Robert, got it. <br><br>Ruben, glad to hear the shanties are being kept alive!

Shame his children treated him like an anachronism and sold off the fleet - probably for scrap too. Cheeky scamps.<br><br>He was spot on too about the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaring_Forties rel=nofollow>Roaring Forties</a> being a source of consistent and plentiful - free - energy! <br><br>If you look at the Clipper trade route on the Wikipedia page it is almost perfectly arranged for wind powered ships to travel from Western Europe to South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, South America and then back to Western Europe.<br><br>It is also a fascinating coincidence that once sailing ships copped it in the neck, so too did our agricultural export markets. People at the time blamed the "tyranny of distance", when it was possibly more accurately described as the "tyranny of oil". They forgot or ignored their recent history of massive agricultural exports.<br><br>Speaking of which, you mentioned a few weeks back that nature does sudden very well. Sudden, doesn't quite explain how the farm here has gone from feeling like an arid zone to the sub tropics. The tail of a cyclone on the north eastern coast dumped another inch here last night and this morning. With temperatures in the high 20C's and low 30C's over the next few days and humidity up around 99%, the place will turn into a jungle... Autumn here is usually another growth phase. I'm begining to suspect that this area has 6 distinct seasons per year and the lean time is actually January and February - which would seem unusual to people in the Northern hemisphere, but not down here.<br><br>This may be a good thing as I'm continuing to experiment with different crops and the coffee, babaco and avocado all seem to be happily growing along nicely. Plus I'm harvesting my first grapefruits too. My thinking is to do something unexpected if you want to create a niche market.<br><br>Speaking of the tyranny of oil, I'm always a bit uncomfortable when I see an image of a farm as it usually involves some bloke on a tractor. Just sayin... Those 8,000 tons of Australian grain were produced and transported without oil. It is worth thinking about. I understand that a lot of plant breeding went into those grain species and at the time we had very undemanding (of water and fertility) species which were abandoned when higher yielding (but fertiliser and water dependant) varieties were foisted upon farmers.<br><br>I spotted a tomato variety here that self-seeded this year and produced a month earlier than every other variety. It also sailed through summer. That’s definitely what I call a keeper!<br><br>Financial products (an oxymoron if ever there was one) often come with a warning.

Someone else still remembers Captain Erikson. I’m impressed, but then again, you seem to be a veritable font of wisdom about history and a great many other things, including long-forgotten technologies. I remember reading his story, including his prediction of a new golden age of sail back when I was a little boy. My parents bought me the Time-Life “Seafarers” series back when I was around 9 or 10 years old and I read all of the books in that series, including the one on windjammers. My father was a naval officer, so it’s in the blood. I was one of those nerdy kids who was reading “Janes Fighting Ships” and stories about pirates, aviators, explorers, submarines and naval battles when all the other kids were reading Dr Seuss or Judy Blume. I used to dream of what it would be like to be an officer or sailor on a windjammer, a sail frigate, a U-Boat, or some other ship from days gone by.<br><br>I also remember Oswald Spengler addressing the young men of his era in the “Decline of the West”. One of the careers that he urged talented young men to consider was seamanship. Captain Erikson was right, just a little ahead of his time. It’s a pity his heirs lacked his vision.<br><br>Incidentally, there is at least one windjammer in service as a cruise ship, the Royal Clipper, and several others as training ships, including the US Coast Guard training ship USCGS Eagle. The Royal Clipper was explicitly modeled after the famous windjammer Preussen, the biggest sailing ship ever built. There is also an effort in France to build a replica of the France II, which was another famous five master and the second largest windjammer after the Preussen, though the efforts don’t seem to have gotten very far.<br><br>http://www.starclippers.com/us-dom/our-fleet/royal-clipper.html<br><br>http://www.hnsa.org/ships/eagle.htm<br><br>http://www.grand-voilier.com/tallship/navigation/france.htm<br><br><a href=#c8993133420572268865 title="comment permalink">3/26/14, 8:31 PM</a><br><br>

Do you mention that increases in affluence per capita result in far higher total CO2 emissions, especially as GDP per capita increases from $1000 to $10000 (the sort of transition we saw so rapidly in China, and also in a variety of other developing countries) even as carbon efficiency per dollar of GDP also improves? An economy growing at 5%/year and improving carbon efficiency at 2%/year will increase its emissions at 3%/year. And physical reality ultimately doesn't care about how rich we are in terms GDP per capita or per ton CO2. The important things to look at are total global emissions (increasing at about 2%/year) and the average EROEI for all energy sources (rapidly falling).<br><br>The article you posted is an excellent example of the sort of economic handwaving that tries to convince us that environmental damage, while a problem, isn't something we need to worry too much about. I'm not sure whether you're trying to defend it or just bring it up, but it is a stellar example of what passes for serious economic discourse on the environment.<br><br>I acquired Technology Will Save Us Syndrome (TWSUS) a while ago and it took me about five years to recover. It's nearly universal among economists and afflicts the majority of natural scientists as well, with the notable exceptions of ecologists, climatologists, and petroleum geologists. Some people never recover from TWSUS, but survivors develop antibodies that render them immune to it, at least for a long time. Reading that article brought back memories of when I was still a TWSUS patient.<br><br><a href=#c6687818888643180561 title="comment permalink">3/26/14, 8:35 PM</a><br><br>

To be blunt it was a brutal existence for those who worked it. it is also worth learning about the coffin ships as an extreme idea on this theme.<br><br>My take on the return to sail is thus. By the time it happens, only a small fraction of a percentage of cargo will cross the oceans, as what does today.<br><br>The first hurdle that needs to be addressed, is regaining the skills to operate a sail powered cargo ship. <br>Let me be very clear here: Those skills do not currently exist, and there is no one to teach them.<br><br>If you wish to know what I am talking about, look into the loss, with all hands of the tall ship Pamir. On that fateful last journey, it was captained by an experienced training sail ship Captain. Unfortunately, his experience was not that of a cargo Captain, which led to some poor decision making, which proved fatal. This was before the complete end to commercial sail.<br><br>To give a bit of context to the problem of switching to sail, while maintaining cargo volume, I would point to the current example given by one of the above commenters. That ship carries a cargo of 35 ton. On a contemporary container ship, one single crane driver will load approximately 30 times that amount, per hour. A typical container ship would contain around 4,000 times the cargo capacity, depending on which ports are being serviced, than that one sailing ship.<br><br>Now consider the amount of cargo shipped across oceans, by air (well and truley less than ten percent) Think of the infrastructure required just to replace that amount.

He combines the story of his charter sailing trip from Ushuaia to Cape Horn &amp; back with the history of ships rounding the tip of S. America from Magellan,Drake,Cooke,Darwin to the windjammers. He only mentions Erickson in passing ( his stinginess which was typical ),but spends quite a bit of time on the story of a boy who shipped on the British Isles in 1905 where they took 71 days to round the horn with the loss of much life. They actually were carrying coal and had a coal auxiliary engine, but the captain didn't want to waste the owners coal, so they didn't use it.<br>With the Panama canal,one wouldn't need to round the horn westwards in a future age of sail. It could make sense eastwards, though they lost a lot of ships that way from broaching in big seas.<br> As long as there is any fossil fuel available, an auxiliary motor sure is nice for seeking a safe haven in a storm, crossing the doldrums, etc. That is the procedure now in the Philippines, Indonesia, a lot of third world countries.<br>Even when I was a kid in the 40s, 50s,60s only certain luxury items were imported: French wine &amp; perfume, English suits, Italian shoes, Asian spices and silk.

I would imagine a future world in decline would revert to that pattern.Sailing ships would be adequate for that trade.<br>I can see the trend starting with many present ships being rigged with down wind sails and progressing to ships being built as primary sailors with auxiliary engines, then on to sailing ships.

I live in the Netherlands and they have a broad netwerk of tramlines here in the city. They are obviously powered by electricity now. What most people don't realise however, is that the tram (streetcar) here precedes electricity. They used to be powered by actual horses. The network is much more expansive then it was back then of course, but the technology behind it is basically the same as in the 19th century. It can imagine the current company going down in a couple of decennia due to a 'never before seen crisis'. Another company might pick up the rails, sell the current trams to a country that still has oil and then restart the horsetram.<br><br>Another thought I had, living here, was regarding your posts about steampunk. They obscure the difference between countries, even when they are both oil-dependent. While the USA gave up bikes after World War 2, in some European countries they where embraced. The entire infrastructure developed along different lines because of that. You find direct bike-paths between cities and towns everywhere. They might be around long after the highways are abandoned. <br><br>And finally an interesting observation about American power these days. President Obama visited the Netherlands for s summit in The Hague. He got enormous coverage and everyone expects (and for the very near future are probably correct) more tourists for the musea he visited. There was incredible enthousiasm for the man. (Obamania is apparantly still a thing in the Netherlands)<br><br>At the same time the Chinese president payed the country a visit.

Many people, of course (as you have mentioned many times) do not adopt a piece of technology purely because of its commercial viability. They do so in part because of emotional attachments. Why do we have so many elaborate fuel inefficient cars around after all? (even in an age where the price of petrol is really starting to bite)<br><br>Just an example from here in New Zealand. One of the responses that is ALWAYS leveled at attempts to restore railway networks here is they are not 'commercially viable' (meanwhile hundreds of millions are spent on completely uneconomical roads... just a fraction of that money would go a long way to restoring railways around NZ). A report for example about the closing down of a particular railway line, talked only of immediate short term commercial viability- with only a small reference to 'volatility in oil prices'. Keeping the railway line open would be a few million dollars, at most! (our government, whoever is in charge are sadly in the pockets of lobby groups who want more roads built. Whatever the cost).<br><br>What of course is almost completely ignored in discussions about transport is the emotional attachment people have to a particular mode of transport. Plenty of people talk about how comfortable rail is. Appeal to peoples emotional sentiment about travailing by rail and there may well be a winner! It wouldn't necessarily take a huge amount of cash after all.<br><br>Of course, this depends whether we are talking about fancy electric trains or steam trains or whatever. Though here in New Zealand we have a plentiful supply of renewable energy and coal/gas (allowing for the oil subsidy these energy sources receive).<br><br>Anyway, perhaps a little off topic.

To his surprise he was accepted and shortly set sail on what would turn out to be the last grain race to Australia. He sailed on the four-masted barque Moshulu, and later wrote a book about it (The Last Grain Race) which is well worth a read for anyone interested in all aspects of sea travel. <br><br>Incidentally, it was not all fun and games aboard these boats. His advice for anyone wishing to undertake such a voyage in the future (paraphrased) was: "The moment you step on board find the biggest, meaning looking crew member aboard and pick a fight with him.

One of the factors that kept Erikson, Villiers and their ilk going was the fact that, for some cargoes, a slow passage was an advantage. The ships also doubled as floating warehouses. If it took 120 or more days for a cargo of wheat to get from Port Lincoln to Portsmouth, then that was potentially a couple or three months that you didn’t have to pay for warehouse storage of the crop (as it was only the first few shiploads that got top price for the cargo).<br><br>In most of these ports, the warehouses have long since been converted to condos, artists’ garrets, restaurants and other sundry tourist traps; while the warehousing has been moved to the urban fringes. It’ll be interesting to see what the cost may be of converting those condos back to warehouses. Sure it’ll be way less than the current condo owners think it should be, but it’ll probably still be a pretty major factor of the economics of going back to sail.<br><br>Small additional detail: your quoted figure of 8,000 tons of cargo applies only to the very largest of the sailing ships (Preussen, et al), which were found by their owners and crews to be pretty much unworkable. The owners of Preussen, F. Laeisz, went back to smaller ships after that experiment. Two to three thousand tons of cargo was more typical of the successful ships.<br><br>@nomadicista: you clearly live nowhere near an historic seaport. The world is crawling with people dedicated to keeping the sailing traditions alive. I’m a farmer and I have met at least 200 people who are capable of sailing a square rigged cargo ship. Admittedly, in a previous life I used to be a bo’s’n on a barquentine (more of a short ship than a tall ship, for sure) and probably taught 100 of them to hand, reef and steer; but there they are… Indeed, at the bicentennial celebrations on Sydney harbour, there were probably two or three thousand such people.<br><br>You may like to ask Dr. Google about “sail training ships” to get a better idea of what is going on in the world.<br><br>I’ll concede your point regarding sail vs container cargo capacities. Do you really think that current capacities are sustainable?<br><br>@JMG: If there was an appropriate technology that could be nominated as “least likely to be thrown out with the bathwater”, from my experience, square rigged sailing would have to be at the top of the list.<br><br>Final point: “modern” square rigs (those in use after 1860 or so) are wonderfully efficient compared to those that preceded them. Where in Nelson’s time you might have needed 100+ sailors to run a largish ship (not including all the gunners, marines and the like), a ship like Peking could get away with 20 or less, if you took your time with manoeuvres.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Les<br><br><a href=#c3994809322429234703 title="comment permalink">3/27/14, 2:45 AM</a><br><br>

Business plans like those, however, as your example points out, tend not to survive generations. But the Ol’ Man’s plan has to be better than footling ‘paying concerns’ like building the world’s tallest buildings?<br><br>Grain from South Australia?<br>Chris @Cherokee made the good point last week that forestry removes a significant chunk of soil fertility: so does exported grain, (exporting wine or olive oil, much less of course). The route goes fertility to grain to city to watercourse to sea. That is OK provided you have a source of replacement soil fertility to spread on the ground – OECD moderns use mostly NPK of course. To replace soil fertility in the old days meant significant areas had to be kept fallow (not cropped), which was very slow, and meant a very small ‘per-unit’ surplus available for shipping. The cultivators had to eat. This method was replaced in temperate countries by increasing the most significant limiting factor - soil nitrogen - by rotating crops with clover/grass or alfalfa that have the bacteria to ‘fix’ nitrogen from the air. This was a much quicker renewal and produced a crop of meat, hide and wool at the same time - and Biofuel for horses! Which system reduced the number of cultivators needed for grain production – horses made more productive use of their share of the combination of grain and grass!<br> <br>So economics worked until they didn’t – and agriculture could not keep up with cities without another revolution. China could manage on its agriculture for a long time, because the urban population kept small compared with the rural hinterland. (Almost all of China’s agriculture supported local productive populations and craft industries.) This was not true of the USA. Yields were drifting down along with soil fertility, especially in areas like the Great Plains. And there was no more ‘frontier’ to plow! But industrially synthetic Nitrogen fertiliser came to the rescue from 1920s onwards. <br><br>My guess is that climate will dictate where the Windjammers will find their high enough value bulk cargo. I guess they will not be fetching grain from South Australia. I am not at all sure either about refrigerated cargo from New Zealand, which provided significant food in my childhood (UK) from NZ’s high yielding grassland!<br><br>best<br>Phil H<br><br><br><a href=#c1938142243334949987 title="comment permalink">3/27/14, 6:51 AM</a><br><br>

At the age of 18, travel author Eric Newby applied personally to Gustav Erikson for a job on one of his ships. Newby subsequently shipped out on the 396 foot barque "Moshulu" in the fall of 1938, outbound to Australia for a cargo of wheat, returning to Britain in the spring of 1939. Newby's experiences eventually became the basis for his book "The Last Grain Race", published in the mid 1950's. <br><br>Even in the hard-bitten 1930's, Erikson was having trouble keeping his vessels crewed because the work was so unrelenting and dangerous. One voyage on "Moshulu" turned out to be enough for Newby.<br><br>Nowadays, with so many people living inside private electronic fantasylands, I imagine it would be even more difficult to encourage young people to embrace the harsh realities of life at sea. Not impossible, though, because deep inside our American culture there's always been a steady undercurrent of interest in traditional seamanship ... and now seawomanship too. This past fall I happened upon a tall ship named "Lynx" while she was docked at Clayton NY on the St. Lawrence River, enroute to the Caribbean for the winter. Half of the crew of about 15 were women.<br><br>Gustav Erikson's "Moshulu" is still afloat, currently serving (somewhat ironically) as an upscale restaurant at Penn's Landing in Philadelphia PA. Hopefully, when the need arises she will still be there to serve as a model for our future merchant ships, and the crewmembers of vessels like "Lynx" will know how to sail them.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c5396484211858623835 title="comment permalink">3/27/14, 7:16 AM</a><br><br>

I would only add that a return to sailing would transform almost every other aspect of life, in ways that are not necessarily obvious, no matter what other changes happen. <br><br>For example, most of us have grown up surrounded by cheap cargo transported from abroad; sailing ships would not transport as much as quickly or easily, forcing a reappearance of local factories and craftsmen. We are accustomed to stores having coffee from Sumatra, fruit from South America and meat from New Zealand, and a return to sailing ships would mean turning our yards back into gardens and our convenience chains back into dry-goods warehouses. <br><br>Sailing ships would require kilometres of rope, and perhaps a revival of the rope-making factories, up to half a kilometre long, that were once seen along coastlines here. Travel would not only be slower, but not necessarily in a straight line – ships between Europe and the Americas had to follow winds and currents in a circle. Sailors might have to carry lemons on board again, and women might once again be considered bad luck on ships. <br><br>Isolated islands and urban harbours might become vital again, and now-closed lighthouses might have to be rebuilt or reopened. Piracy, of course, has already made a comeback. <br><br>Some things have changed since the 19th century, of course – sailors once fed on fish through their voyages, but fishing is scarce these days, and a chaotic climate might deprive future sailors of predictable winds and weather. On the other hand, we know how vitamins and infections work, and we have canals through Panama and the Suez. It would be interesting to see how sailing ships could work with GPS and ham radio, however long those things can be sustained. <br><br>Having never seen the ocean until I was in my 30s, I am not the person to take up this particular endeavour. If some readers are serious about reviving them, however, might I suggest the Great Lakes as an incubator? Fishing tours and other upper-class pastimes might offer enough cash flow to sustain it for decades, or until the need for such skills is rediscovered. <br><br><br><a href=#c5300115469740303252 title="comment permalink">3/27/14, 7:25 AM</a><br><br>

I read this post with more than usual interest. One of my pet peeves is the usual narrative of how, once the steam engine came along, it was "all over" for sail. In fact, as JMG points out, they coexisted quite nicely for over a century. Granted, the owners of the bigger sailing vessels adopted steam "donkey engines" to help with heavy tasks such as heaving up the anchor. Indeed, it was these very devices that made large sailing vessels possible; they became specialized ocean carriers with no cargo space (ie profit potential) taken up by engines or fuel. Many smaller vessels simply did without engines, and still do in places like Haiti (though Youtube videos show how a few outboards have made it aboard Haitian cargo sailing vessels).<br><br>As far as good reads go, check out any of Alan Villiers works, or Eric Newby's "The Last Grain Race". The latter takes place on Moshulu, a huge 4 masted bark sailing from Europe to Australia and back in the 1930s. Moshulu lies in Philadelphia now, a restaurant. Perhaps she and many other museum ships, waits for another chance to sail profitably again?<br><br>Also, check out these guys in Vermont:<br><br>http://www.vermontsailfreightproject.com/<br><br><a href=#c5709087532463346835 title="comment permalink">3/27/14, 8:18 AM</a><br><br>

This is a topic I have tried to follow for a couple of decades. Know that some high tech computer monitored sail configurations have been envisioned for retrofit to conventional merchant vessels. Also, large "kite" sails similar to a spinaker but aloft on a single cable downwind of the ship. <br>On a different note, I must point out that auxiliary power of some sort is going to be a requirement on almost any vessel that enters a major port. As a volunteer for the Schooner Sultana project we had to install Diesel propulsion for safety reasons and that requirement is almost certainly going to prevail. Most of the sailing vessels that foundered throughout history did so because of a lee shore or the inability to steer the ship into heavy weather. <br>One further reality, I cannot imagine a solar powered engine on a sailing vessel large enough to overcome the friction alone of the propulsion system much less power the ship through the water. <br>A sailor and enthusiast of wind power commercial vessels. <br>Jack Davis<br>Sarasota, Florida<br><br><a href=#c5534194315813769313 title="comment permalink">3/27/14, 8:34 AM</a><br><br>

I am not sure that even Ericson could have kept the hulls going for a century. Modern ships seem to be scrapped after 30-40 years hard use. Preserving a few old ships is a really expensive proposition.<br>Even with a heap of scrap steel, it still needs to be remelted and rolled into big sheets for hulls, and rolled into tubes for masts.

It has clarified one of the root issues I've had about this entire project, and that is the urgency you place on "doing something now," as though doing something now will make a difference.<br><br>I still don't get this. Perhaps I just disagree with it.<br><br>We are going to have a population decline. You seem convinced of that, and I am convinced of that. I don't find your numbers or arguments unreasonable. So let's accept 95% global attrition over a long period of time, say 3-5 centuries.<br><br>This means a drastic reduction in "on-line" knowledge, meaning knowledge that is at a society's fingertips because someone has learned it, rather than simply having learned about it. Slide rules are a case in point: it's one thing to know about slide rules, it is another to know how to use one. In-depth knowledge of ancient Roman history is another. Retention of on-line knowledge is as subject to economics as anything else. If the population drops, there is going to be a vast "shake-out" of knowledge that will be triaged out of (on-line) existence, simply because there aren't enough heads to hold it.<br><br>So "doing something" in terms of preserving knowledge is a matter of trying to guess which 5% of our current knowledge is worth keeping on-line, without the benefit of experiencing feedback from the real (future) economic conditions that will drive what is actually going to be retained. It will be much less than 5%, anyway, because it's also likely that much of what will be valuable tomorrow is economically useless today and has (like the knowledge of managing a fleet of windjammers) already been lost, or has not yet been invented.<br><br>It's a fun guessing-game, but I don't understand the urgency, particularly when "doing something" runs counter to <i>current</i> economic conditions that put food on the table.<br><br>Erikson is a case-in-point: he made an attempt at securing future prosperity based on long-term predictions, and he failed: oil did not peak nearly soon enough. Had his children tried to preserve the fleet, it would have ruined any prosperity they had retained. As @jemand points out, it doesn't really take that long to re-develop any truly useful technology, so when windjammers become economically viable, they will be re-invented.<br><br>You've argued broadly that there is a window of opportunity for using current EROI prosperity to springboard into a lower EROI future, making the process less painful. I can see the argument, but I'd call it trying to plan for a poverty-stricken future while living in the lap of luxury, and people just don't do that, even when it comes to the all-but guaranteed personal matter of transitioning to an indefinitely prolonged retirement on a fixed income in an inflating economy. Wind and PV are being developed to service The Grid, so that we can begin to power electric cars. It's dumb, but so is stock trading, or working on ITER. It's how you make a living today.<br><br><a href=#c7052920156382530881 title="comment permalink">3/27/14, 9:16 AM</a><br><br>

As for pirates, well, of course -- we've got 'em now, you know, and piracy is a standard problem during the declines of empires.

With no oceans they won't move, they just have to compress air. I think I can finally afford the parts. Without a place that is really my own I am trying to strengthening I-Thou bonds with folks who had successful businesses during FoCo's boom times, and have the shop space, tools, and scrap mostly just sitting around. So much comes down to the I-Thou, but its a trick path, particular projects get delayed for reasons all too human. So I keep too many irons in the fire, trusting that some will be dropped. Its like pest control with organic meathods 'plant enough for the pests too.<br><br><br>In response to your question last week, the house is not nearly as well insulated as I would like, and much better sealed than it should be. Too much heat loss to conduction vs. convection. Humidity issues came up in a big way from trying to keep the house cool last winter. I hope that insulating the crawl space will help, and a few of the windows need more work, especially one in the basement. I probably only have one more winter here, but I plan to be ready for it. The biggest improvement I want is a south aspect green house to catch these powerful Colorado solar rays, but when my friends and I built the frame for it last fall we upset the ascetic tastes of my landlord's Mother. Ugh, its the petty stuff that really greases the wheels of decline, one little spat at a time. I will try to make a more modernish next time. The County Conservation Corp will be by soon to recommend more improvements. Sadly this is a 90's house in Fort Collins, its like living in a movie set that represents a house. Only one more year here I think.<br><br>p.s. I got the see Paul Stammets in Denver on Monday. Great speech, there is a guy who has set up one of those subsudies salvage operations I was theorizing about! Lots of his companies money comes from middle class people trying to buy immortality with fancy medicinal mushrooms (which are good, but not as a cure for mortality). That money then goes into some very impressive research on mycology. I hope to have my mushroom lab working good enough soon I can comment on how well it really works.<br><br><a href=#c7505350283717171144 title="comment permalink">3/27/14, 11:35 AM</a><br><br>

I know that most of you have had little exposure to draft animals and mostly consider horses dirty, difficult to feed, and dangerous, and while you wouldn't be wrong in all cases, I challenge you to farm more than a few acres without fossil fuels OR a good draft team. I promise you this: you won't like it, or do it very well. As far as the oft-mentioned problem of manure disposal is concerned, it always seemed to me that only folks with a modern urban/suburban sensibility coukd really see manure as anything but the gift of fertility it really is. As an organic grower, I can't possibly get enough of the stuff. Regarding the expense of feed, much of the problem is a result of impractical modern breeding focused on horses as luxuries in age of abundance, with the sacrifice of thriftiness to other traits such as speed or extravagant movement all too common. I think many of you would be shocked how little it takes to feed one of the older, cold blooded work types (less than $300 for my Haflinger last year), which was beyond worth when you consider that he easily replaces a tractor and a car, and generates a constant supply of organic fertilizer. And are horses dangerous? Certainly they can be with improper handling, as can any combustion engine, or bicicle for that matter. I urge all of you to look past your prejudices and remember working animals as part of a partnership that has served our species well for millennia, and one that we ought to consider reprising.<br><br><a href=#c6963661861474657949 title="comment permalink">3/27/14, 11:36 AM</a><br><br>

Sipping brandy with the captain in his oak-panelled dining room, he explained to me how the Italian navy uses ships like these to train their best sea cadets in the art of seafare.

Fits nicely with the book I currently read - Cathedral, Forge and Waterwheel - Technology and inventions of the middle ages by Frances &amp; Joseph Gies. It covers to some extent the inventions in shipbuilding &amp; navigations - mostly copied from the Chinese - and makes one aware how long the road was we had to travel to arrive at Captain Erikson's tall ship era. A personal aha or jaw dropping moment was when I read that the sails being made of linen (or silk!!) - I've been involved in a local "flax to linen" project here (http://flaxtolinenvictoriabc.blogspot.ca/p/blog-page_5.html) and have now a very good sense what it takes to make a square foot of linen. Wowsers! Making a sail would be very difficult given that productive lands need to be taken out of food production (although marginal lands can be used eventually), and are often not used for food production a while afterwards. Not sure how cotton production will fair in a post petroleum world, given the incredible amount of chemical fertilizers &amp; pesticide used in todays cotton industry. My guess is that a lot of sails will be patchworks of salvaged fabric until the economics of sailing will allow for dedicated "fabric farming". Not so sure if I would hold my breath for steel ships, they only seem to survive with expensive regular painting jobs (as do wooden boats). Maybe someone here with more knowledge of boats knows better what are they viable options for boat preservatives in the future.<br><br><a href=#c1968997623165416370 title="comment permalink">3/27/14, 1:34 PM</a><br><br>

Ill be crewing a 80 foot schooner with solar PV equipment as cargo to palmyra atoll next month. For any that dont know, Palmyra is owned jointly by The Nature Conservacy and US fish and wildlife, and used as a research station for (amoung other things) studies on global warming and its impacts on sea life. For years the station has been powered by diesel generators, at huge costs. In the near future, it will be converting to Solar PV, and I'm proud to be part of the transition.<br><br>The cost of hiring a diesel powered cargo ship is substantially higher when the cargo is only 20 tons of equipment and supplies. Today's niche for sailing cargo ships is for small loads that would occupy only a fraction of the tonnage a larger ship could carry.<br><br>I'd imagine that future ships will be designed with sails plus PV panels, wind generators, hefty battery banks and small diesel generators powering an electric drive train. A concentrated solar steam engine is of no use in a storm, which is exactly when auxiliary power is most needed - not as a matter of economy, but one of safety. <br><br>The vessel I will be crewing has a large diesel engine, 2 diesel generators, a well equipped machine shop with welders, compressors, all the tools to repair the boat while underway, and 3000 gallons of fuel. In strong winds she can make 9 knots under sail alone, just as fast as under power in calm seas. But when that storm starts to roll in, I can garuntee the engine will be fired up and we will burn as much diesel as it takes to keep us (and the cargo!) safe. I imagine the cost per gallon could triple or quadruple before any sane captain would even think to forgo the auxiliary diesel aboard a sailing vessel. <br><br>I'm a life-long sailor, and consider myself competent on sailboats, but im far from the level of skill it would take to handle a 400' windjammer loaded with cargo in a storm. I'd imagine there are very few people alive today who would be comfortable in that situation. It would be quite exciting, to say the least.<br><br><a href=#c1960015551423952703 title="comment permalink">3/27/14, 2:04 PM</a><br><br>

I wonder how many people in the world's navies have been talking quietly about the end of the age of oil all along. <br><br>Jan, I hope Botswana does something constructive with the income from that coal. <br><br>Steve, I've heard of the <i>Hokule'a</i>, of course -- a splendid vessel, and a useful reminder that deepwater sailing is possible on a far simpler technological level than Gustav Erikson had to hand. <br><br>Daelach, exactly -- leaving the remaining economically viable cargoes well within the range of what windpowered shipping can carry. <br><br>Joseph, thank you.

For small cargoes -- say, 20 tons -- it's <i>already</i> cheaper to hire a sailing vessel with diesel backup than to ship it by ordinary diesel freighter? Do you happen to have any sense of when that started to be the case, and/or how many sailing vessels are working small-cargo runs at this time? <br><br>Mortal, yes, that's just one of the pleasant little legacies we're leaving for the far future.

Hemp of course! Du Pont managed to kill hemp production because they wanted to corner the market for their nylon rope. The legislation using marijuana as the excuse included hemp. During WW II the restrictions against hemp was lifted for the war effort.<br><br>About horses, one of the nicest horses at the stable is a beautifully compact Spanish Mustang filly, very elegant. I think she would be a perfect Dressage Pony, but she isn't long and lean like those usually are. Mustangs aren't for everyone because they are independently intelligent, they think for themselves and if they're convinced 'YOU' are a moron, they'll dump ya! Or act terminally stupid in regard to what you ask of them. There's another mustang that IS tall and elegant or he would be except for his feet which are quite large for his size. (Caused by the desert environment he came from.) He's a Nevada Remount Mustang likely Arab / Morgan mostly. A tough, thrifty, easy keeper like the filly and the little mare my young friend want's to give me. <br><br>Also in regard to horse manure, all those city dray horses produced a lot of manure which was carried out of the city to the truck farms that surrounded cities in those days. (Which are currently under subdivisions.) Is anyone old enough to remember the craze for those heavy antique glass cloches back in the 70's? Those were used to raise such delicacies as out of season strawberries for the city markets.<br><br>@ S.L. Claire, have you considered a pygmy goat? They're both a meat and diary goat. They usually suggest a pair, (I have a wether and his mother), but if you spend a lot of time caring for them they make funny, wonderful out door pets and very good weed eaters cum fertilizers. They'll even produce mohair for you to learn how to card and spin! (In pygmy amounts!) If you want milk for food, cosmetics or soap, the nanny can literally have a litter, (as many as six!) but usually two to four, each about the size of a domestic cat. My nanny is only 20 inches tall at the shoulder and the wether is 28 inches at the shoulder. Wethers can be trained to harness starting at six months and make good little draft/pack goats if you need help bringing in your backyard groceries.

By numbers it would have been close to half, by tonnage something like 1/7th. But the sailing vessels were very vulnerable to German commerce raiders and U-boat deck guns. The general wreckage and destruction of the war hastened the end.<br><br>The most successful German commerce raider was itself a sailing vessel (disguised to hide its true nature) with an auxiliary motor.<br><br>The auxiliary motors were used to keep the ships off the rocks in storms. Thus the equation of auxiliary yes/no was going to have a lot to do with how valuable the boat/cargo was versus what types of waters it was sailing in. The first major naval campaigns with steam power occurred during the Crimean War. They were large masted vessels with small auxiliary engines to keep them off the rocks. This allowed the British to undertake the Finnish navel campaign (the one that likely is responsible for ending the war when St. Petersburg became threatened) in the tricky waters of the Baltic. The Baltic having also been one of the last hold out areas for oared vessels.<br><br>Solar steam on an auxiliary motor would be problematic if it could not hold the steam through the period of the storm. Once cloud cover sets in your standard irradiance of 1,000w/m2 will drop below 100 and stay there. The auxiliary got you in and out of ports, and kept you off the rocks. It might be perfectly adequate for the first two tasks, but it was the third that was likely to be the deal breaker.<br><br><a href=#c7781135909937808721 title="comment permalink">3/28/14, 2:03 AM</a><br><br>

It didn't take long to discover that all of my model variables did one of two things: exponential decay or exponential growth, often with a sinusoidal ripple. Thus, I learned by experience what I could have learned abstractly, that ALL systems of linear difference equations have only such solutions. (Difference equations are very closely related to differential equations, but easier to model and harder to solve analytically.) It was a valuable lesson!

Ignoring the arguments about whether average birth rates and death rates are historically supported, it seems to me that the core idea has been obscured. A population decline of 3% per year (for whatever reason), if sustained for 100 years, reduces the population by slightly over 95%. This is a very simple calculation, which ignores lifespan, so maybe it would be more accurate to phrase it this way: if 3% fewer babies are born every year, then after 100 years, less than 5% of the original number will be born. In the long run, the result is the same. It doesn't require plagues, warfare, or famine, or anything else so traumatic.<br>(Here's the calculation: x raised to the 100th power = 0.05.

Noncommercial applications have a little more freedom from the economic realities of energy but are still ultimately restrained by them. <br><br>I'd like to look a little closer at the issue of costs. There are always two basic costs for a tool. These are the up front capital costs of making/purchasing the tool and the running costs of maintaining and using it. Both costs are determined by energy source costs to some extent. <br><br>In your example of wind versus coal/bunker/diesel technology to power ships, you did not focus on capital cost much; though you may have implied that these were about the same and then later lower for wind as this technology went out of fashion for short hauls. <br><br>Now wind energy itself is free but diesel fuel energy, even if cheap, is not. So why did diesel power technology trump wind powered technology economically? Certainly there are capital costs for both wind power (sails, rigging, etc) and diesel (engines, gear boxes, shafts, propellers, etc). Of the two I don't know for a fact which was more expensive, but I'll bet diesel technology was significantly more expensive. Higher tech normally is. For small craft, a power boat is far more expensive to buy and to run than an equivalent sized sailboat. Its all the machinery and fuel that costs the extra money.<br><br>So lets assume diesel technology capital costs were in fact more expensive. So again, why did diesel power win out over wind power as it so clearly did? It would have to be that the running costs were significantly lower for diesel on the larger scale. Even if well automated and powered assisted, a wind powered ship requires a much larger crew than a diesel powered ship of the same size. Apparently people cost more than diesel fuel. That's my guess as to why diesel won out economically over wind. <br><br>If people become cheaper than diesel, and the capital costs of retrofit to sail are not prohibitive, perhaps we will see a reversion to wind power. <br><br>My point in the forgoing is to look at where splitting capital and running costs takes us in an analysis. I don't think the prospects for household or local grid PV are as good (see my next comment).<br><br><a href=#c9054234342808695587 title="comment permalink">3/28/14, 1:48 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not talking about FITs here. The only applications that I am aware of where PV currently makes sense economically is when the capital costs of PV are much lower than running a line from the grid (i.e. remote locations). The running costs of grid power for a household is more expensive than PV; nonetheless, on balance right now, grid power is still more economic. <br><br>How does a person determine “on balance”? Take the capital costs (including finance) of a standard household PV system (not FIT) and amortize these over the life of the capital items and determine a monthly average cost. Add this to your average monthly running costs of PV. Then compare the value so determined against the cost of average monthly equivalent grid power. To be really thorough, you should factor in the cost of your own labour for maintenance of the PV system. <br><br>Here's a back of the napkin analysis: Assume a $20,000 PV household installation amortized over 20 years. Keep it simple with no financing and no running costs. This gives $20,000/(20*12) = $83 per month. I currently pay $83 per month for 415 kWh/month (no electric clothes dryer … $0.2/kWh). Will such a $20,000 PV system give me 415 kWh/month. I'm guessing the answer is: “No.” How far would grid costs have to go up, or PV capital costs have to come down, to breakeven. As these changes likely? I'm guessing the answer is: “No.” <br><br>If the preceding is fundamentally wrong, I'd be happy for someone to give me more realistic numbers. <br><br>PV is a mature technology. Capital costs have already come down considerably. Assuming no further order of magnitude reductions in PV capital costs, these costs will still be prohibitive save for those with money to burn for “vanity power” (no offense to those who have it … I'm just jealous). <br><br>As grid electrical power running costs (i.e. household electrical bills) go up due to higher fossil fuel costs, will PV become affordable? I doubt it. Rising grid cost will result in less use … maybe down to the level of standard household PV installation outputs. And grid power will likely become just as intermittent (like it is in the third world today). Even still, PV costs will go up as well for the same reason grid cost did … because fossil fuel costs are hard baked into both. The ratio of costs (PV to grid) will no doubt change, but even if this tilts in favour of PV, it matters little. We will all have less money then so the financing may well gobble up the difference. <br><br>Now there is a price ceiling for all energy relative to GDP. Once this has been reached, grid power producer revenues cannot be increased by raising price. As the producer costs finally exceed revenues, government subsidies will prop producers up (which of course they already have) until these governments can't obtain credit. No government credit is the endgame of a national or regional power grid and much else. <br><br>My basic point: if PV is not economic now, I'm not sure it will be in the future. In the event of the end of a national or regional power grid, one needs to look at what electricity is really needed for. One will see the end coming so there is no panic. There will be years of escalating bills, rotating scheduled blackouts, and rising bond rates before the end. In my case, the only reason I really need electricity is for pumping water. A windmill or small generator pumping to an indoor cistern (which I have already) will do the trick nicely. Failing that, we have a well we can draw water from by hand. Other people will have other priorities.<br><br>Just some thoughts.<br><br><a href=#c2723520752954267448 title="comment permalink">3/28/14, 2:18 PM</a><br><br>

I still beg to differ on electric trains versus sail though. Speed advantage to trains, yes; labour per ton/mile? I don't think so. Building _new_ large sailing ships is not currently competitive with an existing fleet of oil burners. Starting from scratch, they might be. At any rate, costs per ton/mile by ship are still way cheaper than trains using current fuels. I am projecting that the advantage will remain with ships when cheap oil is gone (i.e. no relative change).<br><br>This brings up the time value of money. Current finance models of deficit financing drive speed at all costs; hence factories operate 24/7 even when the process in question doesn't need it (although many chemical and metallurgical processes _are_ more economical if continuous). This disproportionately benefits faster transport modes. In a stable, non expanding economy, not dependent on credit financing, this will change. This is a factor for many other good ideas, such as human and animal powered intracity cargo movement (cargo bikes, animal drawn wagons).

A bottle of wine costs you 35g of sweet crude to get it over the ocean. The last mile from walmart is far worse I assume. Smallest ships (1 kTEU) use about double the fuel of largest ships (11 kTEU). Large ships would not be at good capacity more often though.<br>Sure you have to pay maintenance on the ship - but not the ocean :).<br>I think the relative cost was something like 30 x ship = 2 x rail = 1 x truck = 0.1(?) x car. And I am not sure about air freight. However there's increasing uncertainty in the numbers anyway as they rely on a big tech ecosystem.<br><br>By the way IIRC air travel/transport can combat global warming - if you fly during the day and reflect back more sunlight.

I'd run a very green ship to be sure. I'd take anyone for a contract (minimum about the time it needs to pick up a lethal dose of radiation) with low pay but a high pension!

<div class="avt a_b6373a" id=c4321724147305514255></div><b><a href=http://latefall.wordpress.com/ rel=nofollow>latefall</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Enough of the "good ideas". <br><br>@ Joseph Nemeth, JMG<br>The feasibility/viability thing very often hinges on materials. A lot of technology is limited by the materials (in quality and quantity) available for making it. So if you understand the material (we really still haven't all the way), you get investment together (quantity bottleneck) you generally end up fighting thermodynamics (or pests) on one side and your customers on the other. <br><br>Embodied energy (http://perigordvacance.typepad.com/files/inventoryofcarbonandenergy.pdf) should give you an idea of how hard you have to fight (much fossil fuel goes into each). However you'd really need to break it down into energy per "desired function" e.g. tensile (or compressive, or fatigue) strength, which makes a big difference. And then you'd have to look at the life cycle assessment (corrosion, chemical, UV resistance) to break it down to ROI times. For boats without trees look at http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Ferrocement . <br>It would greatly help design and conception if we had more accessible public databases on this I guess. <br>Recap time, progress in understanding materials (making masts, steels, polymers, composites, silicon), all the stuff going on in the background like finding or not finding more oil, gas etc result in a game with moving target and a staggering drunk shooter. <br>Or possibly "scrabble" (nice one!) with missing pieces. <br><br>If I was one of Erikson's sons or daughters and you'd have wanted a really big fleet of windjammers - why sure I'd invest in motor ships: as an incubation device, only to get the money together to build even more windjammers. A couple of ships still exist as museums or restaurants, biding their time. Also, Erikson did invest in motor ships himself. <br>Is that not the defining quality of most business persons - to view things from a monetary/opportunistic perspective? They would not have a lot of money by letting all the oil underground, or someone else have it. <br>Today the story may play out differently of course. Yet - who knows if the daughters are not investing in SkySails and the like? <br><br>That being said, I wonder if one couldn't do "fair weather blimp logging" pretty soon. I mean if helicopter logging seems viable - why not? Can be done quite sustainable I reckon. Of course it would use hydrogen (maybe really with the N-layer Alan suggested) and go poof once in a while before you get the hang of it. But you'd really only have to make sure it doesn't light up the forest. It could dump an equivalent amount of compost on the way and have a bunch of drones (or people) scout for good specimens to pick up. Then adjust course, anchor, drop crew, attach another anchor to the tree in question in a couple of points, tension line, cut base and hold on to a branch ;). <br>You could even do a down-wind operation where you ship blimps back up wind on ground, or wait till the wind is right to go back. That way you need very little propulsion, etc. You only need to fly from one surface road/rail/stream to the next if you like. Another material thing could help with a gas tight envelope: graphene (or expanded graphite maybe) as polymer additive. <br><br>Another thought I had was improving the intermodal options of the big(gish) container ships. Imagine they have a layer or two of containers with sturdy goods for out of the way places on them. They rendezvous with smallish 1-5 container capacity (sail)boats on the way that pick up a container after it was unceremoniously dumped in the water, and move it into the out of the way port. You might be able to avoid enough of the costly last few miles (also port congestion) to make some slow money. <br><br><br><a href=#c4321724147305514255 title="comment permalink">3/28/14, 4:14 PM</a><br><br>

And I agree with you about their benefits and cost... (I would love to get one but its not time for me yet, curious what sources you would suggest reading as I begin to go down that path). You mentioned a couple things I take issue with.<br><br>1) Is that farming without an animal, or tractor etc must be hard. My argument stems from my interest perennial and tree agriculture, or a more meat based agriculture (where animals harvest a without much man interference. Sure if someone wants to grow 2 acres of tomatoes with a shovel, hoe, basket and sickle then they are not gonna like it. But if you invest the energy for a decade and then do some minor weeding then harvesting is the main work and a horse is not needed. Many perennial crops need more work but the potential already exists and could improve greatly. Its also about what you want to eat. For instance I harvest 4 acres of blueberries and they require absolutely no inputs, they also make maple sugar, acorns, and firewood. They also have filberts, hog peanut, hickory, witch hazel, and winterberry. It can offer much more variety given time and fossil fuels. I think farming needs to be redefined in the coming era. <br><br>2) As for this comment " As far as the oft-mentioned problem of manure disposal is concerned, it always seemed to me that only folks with a modern urban/suburban sensibility coukd really see manure as anything but the gift of fertility it really is" I would only say that there is another drawback. And that is shoveling manure. I would recommend reading Joel Salatin, 'Folks this aint normal' for his opinion of why farmers were so quick to adopt nitrogen fertilizer, (hint shoveling manure). While the farmer might still see manure as a gift, it is also a burden. <br><br>Essentially I agree with what you say tho. Half in jest I have been recommending people get horses (for transportation) for over a decade.<br><br><a href=#c8996460782519578650 title="comment permalink">3/28/14, 8:11 PM</a><br><br>

Didn't we have this conversation about PV (photovoltaic electricity) a few weeks back, then a few weeks before that, and then possibly just for good measure, a couple of weeks even before that (and possibly even earlier than that again)?<br><br>Honestly it is starting to bore me. From a purely cost based perspective, it costs me AU$0.83 per kWh to be off the grid entirely powered by PV. Ask yourself how that compares with your bill and the answer becomes obvious.<br><br>Incidentally, some commenters here suggest that they have consistent supply from their small PV systems all year. Unless they live near the equator, this point of view is pure rubbish and should be ignored.<br><br>Oh yeah, your electricity bill would cost a whole lot more here due to the smaller distributed population and thus more complex (read - more expensive) distribution network. Just sayin - you get cheap electricity.<br><br>Your central argument revolves around the assumption that the grid will exist and be stable in the future. It is not a bet that I'm making. <br><br>Hi everyone,<br><br>There is always a lot of talk about repurposing grid connect PV panels. Well, it may just interest you lot to know that most 72 cell (usually 6 cells x 12 cells) are perfect for 24V off grid solar applications.<br><br>Now, unfortunately most extra low voltage appliances are for 12V and putting in the higher voltage will result in some melted plastic and smoke.<br><br>But you can purchase now DC to DC converters which can take anywhere between say 36V to 19V and convert it to a stable 12V output perfect for those appliances.<br><br>This means you could theoretically power them directly from a solar panel. I'm testing one of these items shortly and will let you all know how it goes.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c2632876487014805292 title="comment permalink">3/29/14, 1:01 AM</a><br><br>

I have been mulling over the possibility of adding a pair of pygmy goats to the property at some point. We eat a lot of cheese so I'd want them for milking primarily, meat secondarily, and for their manure and ability to eat brush. There's a woman in another suburb of St. Louis who keeps goats and offers cheese-making classes. I wish she offered classes on raising goats as well. Maybe someday she will. <br><br>In the meantime, I need to start with a smaller animal, probably bantam chickens, for eggs and secondarily meat, before considering the possibility of adding goats. I hope to begin raising chickens in the next year or two as I read over the info I've collected and plan out the coop and, likely, chicken tractor for them. I've not raised livestock before and only have experience with birds and gerbils as pets, so I have a long learning curve ahead of me.<br><br><a href=#c1270706751894575364 title="comment permalink">3/29/14, 10:19 AM</a><br><br>

Read all you can about harness horses and horses in general. Your best bet is to find as many people as you can who are long time harness horse users and hang on every word and action when they're handling their animals.<br><br>Horses are a very old species, over 50 million years which says they have a LOT of ingrained reactions to their environment and its based on the fact that they are prey animals. They can also be 'accustomed' to otherwise stressful environments or events. Keeping all that in mind with horses, do a lot of observation on their reactions, their body language, that can't be stressed enough! Lean the difference between a horse with a foot cocked in relaxation and one with the muscles tensed to kick!<br><br>If you want to buy a horse for riding and/or harness use I would recommend an old fashioned Morgan, if you can find one. They aren't big horses but they are strong, usually calm with good health and long lives. I make the qualification because there has recently been a lot of effort to convert the breed into larger sport horses.<br><br>There's a lot to be said for a face to face, 'voice with experience' teacher. If you can only find one. If you can, still do a thorough search for online sources and look for harness events near you. I know in some parts of the country they have a lot of regular events. <br><br>As far as manure goes, I have in mind a design for a boarding stable that builds fertility in the soil without ever going off the property. (That's what manure spreaders are for!) My mind works in such a way as to integrate each aspect of the stable to support the next, in a circle. I'm just too broke to do it!<br><br><br>Wadulisi<br><br><a href=#c6951748252348777984 title="comment permalink">3/29/14, 12:53 PM</a><br><br>

This book on on the present state of ocean shipping is a good read. These shipping companies have huge ships with small crews to cut the cost per ton. In a desperate measure to cut costs the food on board has gone from bad to worse.<br><br>As the price of fuel goes up, we will not be able to ship ninety percent of everything around the world. But when will increasingly expensive fuel put a dent in this?<br><br>My "doomer" predictions usually come true but usually much later than I think. When the "dot com" bubble burst, I entertained the notion of surfing the California real estate market. The thought was to sell the house, rent and wait for the prices to go down and then buy at a lower price. Fortunately the thought of moving seemed too arduous for me to seriously consider this course of action. I would have lost my shirt. <br><br>As Joseph pointed out, Captain Erikson was way too far ahead of the curve. But some other investments may be behind the curve. The widening of the Panama Canal may be an idea whose time has come and gone. <br><br>How can we tell when it is time to build sailing ships? The oil companies will tell us the oil will be inexpensive forever. They want us to be locked in to buying oil for a long time to come.<br><br>I though hydro-facking would keep us on this $100 per barrel plateau for another 5 years. Recent declines in investment and drilling by the oil companies, and recent drops in extraction from these fracked oil fields lead me to think that for once my thinking is behind the curve instead of ahead of it.<br><br><a href=#c2825001147667537495 title="comment permalink">3/29/14, 2:16 PM</a><br><br>

I live in the Great Lakes region, and grew up on sail and motor boats, now experimenting with kayaks for both inland lakes and rivers and open sea kayaks for out in the big waters. I can remember sitting out at the big shipping docks up in Marquette, in the upper penninsula of Michigan, watching the storms roll in across Lake Superior and imagining what it must have been like to be on one of those giant cargo ships. That's a mighty big deep lake up there, and those storms are no joke. <br><br>Hemp is the perfect crop for the future of agriculture and industry . Not only can it be used for rope and linen (for sails), it can be planted to leach toxins out of the soil. I have heard of bioneers in urban settings planting sunflowers and other plants to leach out heavy metals, the plant parts are incinerated in kilns, and the metals are able to be disposed of properly. I read that hemp has been planted around Chernobyl with the same intention, to draw the radioactive toxins out of the soil. I'm sorry to say I don't remember what they do with the hemp at that point, burning it doesn't seem like to logical thing to do with radioactivity.<br><br>Back in the early 2000's a friend of mine who used to work at High Times magazine informed me that some of these plant science companies were trying to genetically engineer hemp, and he didn't understand the reason. Of course, I explained that that would be so they could patent the specific gene, which when found in other "wild"cultivated hemp plants could then be claimed as their own. We saw how Monsanto did that with Percy Schmeiser up in Canada. It is my bet that if something has been added in the US Farm Bill about hemp that there is a GMO to be introduced in our future. Plants have really only been genetically engineered to withstand massive doses of chemical pesticides and herbicides, so my guess is that is what they would be genetically engineering hemp for too (follow the money, the same companies make the poisons that make the plants)(that make the drugs to balance out the people whose endocrine system had been disrupted by the poisons sprayed on the plants and produced by the GMO plants themselves), but hemp doesn't need anything to grow, grow, grow. With as many ex-Monsanto executives working in Washington, there is some grease on the GMO wheel.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c1323159055459114775 title="comment permalink">3/29/14, 7:09 PM</a><br><br>

It is amazingly resistant to molds, which is one of the reasons it was perfect to make sails from it. This would also be a benefit in insulating houses, I imagine. I think about insulation a lot- I currently live in a cinder block house on a cement slab- perfect for Florida, but not so good in Michigan. It was built back in the 1950's, when power was cheap. This winter has been a doozy, very long, lots of snow and extreme cold weather for an extended period of months- very expensive. I don't have an electric dishwasher, clothes washer/dryer (I have a wonder wash and clothes line), or much else. Record player/radio and a laptop. Some lamps. A space heater and electric mattress pad for the bedroom. I am not very wasteful, other than living in this cement sieve. <br><br>Living in this part of the Great Lakes region, we have lots of fresh water, which much of the world is lacking. Hopefully the many nuclear power plants on the Lakes can be decommissioned and the wast contained, although I'm not very hopeful that this will happen in a timely manner. Just a few days ago an oil spill happened in Lake Michigan near Chicago. Palisades nuclear power plant has small emissions into the waters of this same Great Lake. And there is close to a dozen or more of these nuclear power plants scattered around most of the Great Lakes- Superior is the only one free from nuclear power. It is also the highest of the # Great Lakes touching Michigan, so I have some hope that the cleanliness can be some what protected if needed by shutting down the locks in Sault St. Marie. <br><br>I don't understand the wanton destruction of the very resources we need to survive.<br><br><a href=#c3183858034262526854 title="comment permalink">3/29/14, 7:09 PM</a><br><br>

I'm sincerely interested in determining if PV is economic here or anywhere else. Call me perverse, but I knew it would call you out to provide some numbers if you could. Thank you for the links and your thoughtful reply. I took a good look at the links as well as your comments.<br><br>Both your comments (3.5 kWp was key) and the links allowed me to do the numbers in more detail. I am persuaded by these that I was correct for my location (southeastern Ontario - I had to use locations in upstate NY, but these would be close enough). By the calculator you linked, PV would come in at about 2 ½ times the cost of grid power here. That answered my first question: Q1) “How far would grid costs have to go up, or PV capital costs have to come down, to breakeven?” <br><br>I suspect the costs assumed in the calculator was conservative: Tax? Regulatory fees? Financing? Plus, one has to factor in your own labour and the “piss off factor” when you have to fix it yourself or the supply is intermittent. Even still, I am persuaded that PV may be economic where the climate and latitude are favourable and local grid rates are very high. <br><br>Nonetheless, neither of these conclusions are my main point. I wrote:<br><br>“My basic point: if PV is not economic now, I'm not sure it will be in the future. In the event of the end of a national or regional power grid, one needs to look at what electricity is really needed for.”<br><br>This relates to my second question: Q2) “Are these changes likely?” <br><br>Here are the numbers: Lets say you are right and grid power is more sensitive to the rise in the price of oil than PV. Lets take the extreme case of: the ratio of PV to grid rates being only 2 ½ for me and no price rise in PV. Lets make this even more extreme by having grid prices rise at the same rate as oil prices. In this very unlikely case, oil prices would rise by a factor of 2 ½ before grid parity. Is this remotely likely. A2: “No”. The world economy would crash due to high oil prices before grid parity occurred in my location. An economic crash would lower oil and so electrical grid prices thus preventing grid parity for me. <br><br>Thanks again,<br><br>Dave Coulter<br><br><br><a href=#c1030875045897274685 title="comment permalink">3/30/14, 6:59 AM</a><br><br>

I knew I was putting my foot in it. It was a deliberate challenge. I wanted the numbers and Sunseeker delivered. Are they good numbers? Well they were is the ballpark of what I guesstimated even if the calculator costs are low as I suspect they are. <br><br>Sorry if you smelled what I stepped in. <br><br>As our dollars are on par, your PV rate is 4 times the rate I pay for grid power. Yes, our power in Ontario is very cheap. I like your point about PV being intermittent anywhere but near the equator. I think another commentator mentioned the impossibility of power always being available with PV alone. Essentially the same point. In my case, I'd have to ask myself why I would pay more for less.<br><br>You indicated: ”Your central argument revolves around the assumption that the grid will exist and be stable in the future. It is not a bet that I'm making.” <br><br>No. I don't make that assumption. In fact I'm quite certain national/regional electrical grids will fail; hence my reference to hauling water by hand in my comment to JMG. That comment was really all about this seeming contradiction: PV is not economic (in most places) now and will not likely be later even up to the point when the grid fails. I gave my reasoning to Sunseeker above using the numbers he made available. <br><br>Lets look a little at how the grid might fail; after all, the end of the electrical grid in a given region might be a convenient point to date the end of industrial civilization in that region. I think we will see the end of a national/regional grid coming a long way off. I expect to see electrical grid rates going up until producer revenues drop of they go higher. The political limit may be reached well before that point. To cut producer costs, we can also expect rolling scheduled blackouts. Finally we will see (more and more) government subsidies to keep the producers solvent until the government itself defaults. Before default we will see (more and more) currency devaluation to keep governments solvent. National/regional grids may even survive multiple sovereign defaults. There need not be a dramatic end, just a gradual withdraw of services. Scheduled blackouts will progress until its always black. Remote rural areas will be permanently blacked out first. Such “no power zones” will grow until finally only the large cities have (intermittent) power. Such is life in parts of the third world today. <br><br>OK, say now I live in one of the black (or brown) zones. Would that I had bought a PV system when they were available! Maybe. Those with such systems will have them working until the first essential component that cannot be replaced fails. The part cannot be replaced not because it does not exist, but because it can't be paid for by anyone who is not very rich. Those who run the national/regional electrical grids have deeper pockets; indeed, they are on intimate terms with the people who print the money. Could national/regional electrical grids outlast many smaller local or household systems? If its matter of financing, I think the answer is yes.<br><br>JMG hinted at a niche market for small 12 volt systems patched together from the castoffs of larger systems now unserviceable. I think he's onto something there. It would be part of the salvage economy. Such simple PV systems probably have a future after the grid.<br><br>So there you have it. Enjoy it while you can while making plans for when you can't.<br><br>Cheers, <br><br>Dave Coulter<br><br><a href=#c7532904253927927739 title="comment permalink">3/30/14, 7:03 AM</a><br><br>

As usual, it'll take all week to go through them all. Although I personally hate sailing, because if you don't get along with everyone on board, you're pretty-much stuck and very miserable. A seven-day sea voyage in a barquentine left me both loving the idea of ships, loving the excitement, and yet absolutely hating the confinement.

You can see it cast in door-knockers, carved as finials on bannisters, &amp;c. It was an expensive commodity that was brought in by ship about once a year, therefore, it became a status symbol. It would be placed as a centrepiece in the dining room before being eaten at a dinner party.<br><br>Second: "That’s why Winston Churchill, as head of Britain’s Admiralty, ordered the entire British Navy converted from coal to oil in the years just before the First World War..."<br><br>That's also why the British Army launched the promptly-forgotten, 1915 Mesopotamia campaign up the Tigris &amp; Euphrates rivers in Iraq against the Ottoman Turks: to secure their access to the BP (orig. British Persian) oil fields in Iran. Already oil was a vital commodity.<br><br>And one footnote: There is a 1927 movie called "The Lost Patrol" -- about a troop of British Cavalry who are massacred by the Bedouin -- set in that campaign. The star of the movie, ironically, served in the British Cavalry in Mesopotamia.<br><br><a href=#c842478433112880305 title="comment permalink">3/30/14, 7:37 AM</a><br><br>

I commend you for your interest in horsepower and while i can't think of any books to recommend offhand, I do suggest you check out Rural Heritage magazine which is a great general source for anyone interested in draft power. For myself, I am very lucky to live adjacent to Ohio's Amish country and to be married to a man who was raised by his Irish immigrant great-grandfather on a farm that still used horsepower. So I'm very blessed to learn from mostly live human resources, at least when it comes to horsepower. I agree with you that ag techniques need to change and transitioning toward a more permacultured approach will be part of that. If I can manage to purchase the farmstead we rent, forest gardening will be a big part of our future approach. At the same time, I am very curious as to whether you get all your calories from perennial or foraged sources, and whether the same applies to your animals. I personally haven't been able to eliminate grain from our diets, and I don't see how my fiber animals or meat rabbits could possibly have made it through a winter as cold and snowy as this one without supplemental hay and grain, even if we had limitless forage access, which we don't. <br>@Sunseekernv...<br>I was't aware of that particular incident.

I've read that the typical warrantee on PV cells is 5 years, but on the controller only 1. The weak point of the charge controller is (IIRC) the electrolytic capacitors, and I was astounded to read in an electronic supply catalog (Mouser) figures such as "Endurance: 1000 hours @ 105 degC" or "Endurance: 2000 hours @ 85 degC". 2000 hours!?! That's just one "work-year" (50 wks * 5 days * 8 hours).<br><br>According to a Panasonic application note, capacitor lifetime doubles with every 10 degree reduction in operating temperature, so: <br><br>Life (actual) = Life (rated) * 2 to the ((t(rate)-t(actua))/10) power.<br><br>So I guess it's important that you minimize the operating temperature of your charge controller! Don't leave it exposed to the sun; don't hide it in a hot and stuffy attic. It's going to generate some heat internally, so don't expect the "actual" temperature to be the ambient temperature around the controller. Now, the guy who installs it is going to get paid when the job is done, wherever he puts it, so it's up to you to decide where it can be kept the coolest to last the longest.<br><br>(Note to self: derive a process for controlling battery charge using only manually-operated switches and resistors. "Charge Controller" may be an occupation of the future.

Yes, it is that simple.<br><br>It is a dead giveaway that the reason that people discuss these grid connected PV systems in terms of payback period is because all those systems can ever achieve is a cost savings on your electricity bill (perhaps some people may be able to earn some cash due to social policy).

Of the means to regulate: law, markets, norms. The Tokugawa Shogunate did very well, though there were also cultural influences: trees managed years in advance for the rebuilding of the Ise shrine. And that was an isolated, closed market. So: strong laws, strong enforcement, norms in favor of preservation, isolation. Now, across the bigger pond, what happened over much those same years? New laws, new markets, and new norms as invaders basically clear-cut the continent as part of a massive population and resource extraction surge. Laws? Not really, and especially weaker out West. Markets? Open for business! Norms? Well, there were cultures with respect for the land, but they were mostly slaughtered, forced into prostitution, or scooted off to reservations, with Ishi being a notable late exception. So: weak laws, open markets in favor of clear-cutting, and weak norms only strengthened almost too late:<br><br> <i>"Uncontrolled logging might have cleared off all the primeval western white pine forests, as had happened with the eastern white pine. Fortunately, the era of conservation intervened"</i> — "Northwest Trees", Stephen Arno &amp; Ramona Hammerly, The Mountaineers Books, 2007, p.7.<br><br>Subsequent paragraphs detail struggles with fire management and the blister rust accidentally imported from abroad. Moving forward, future repeats of the Tokugawa model seem unlikely, though hopefully those generations will err more towards preservation than carrying out bad Albigensian Crusade reenactments with regard to their trees. How to get there? On all fronts: laws, respected laws, enforcement of laws; market regulations, taxes, and consideration of externalities; and most important cultivate a culture of respect for the land. Short-term profit-taking and "well I got mine" attitudes will be key problems.<br><br><a href=#c7165054699393024078 title="comment permalink">3/31/14, 8:30 AM</a><br><br>

Unfortunately, we don't. Economic talk is mostly about getting growth going again. <br>Politicians are not talking about preparing for shrinkage through a gradual planned retooling of the present system into something more in line with available resources. <br>If growth in the face of shrinking resources fails then we have to pretend for a while that growth is still happening. <br>After a while, no one will believe the growth story any more and then what? <br>The easiest way to restyle an economy is to let it collapse and then sift through the rubble to see what is still useful and what people will still want to pay for and rebuild a new economy from that. <br>Whether PV panels or whatever else your favorite technology happens to be will be revived or survive will depend on whether it's worth the bother to resurrect all the other technologies that your favorite product depends on. If your favorite gizmo requires 10 separate processes to manufacture let's say, lack of any one will doom your gizmo to oblivion.<br>This is not to say that industrial processes can't be revived from scavenged materials and machinery left over from the days of oil. It only means that once your legacy x-ray lithography machine stops working you won't be printing integrated circuits any more.<br>Some industries such as the aircraft industry are required by the FAA to maintain stockpiles of parts to maintain airplanes in use for a certain number of years. But there are lots of consumer goods that have no federal agencies mandating that they be kept working into the future.<br>What we would need to devolve into a simpler economy in a non-catastrophic way would be a federal agency such as DARPA that instead of looking at an ever more complex future would study what it would take to keep a simpler set of technologies going in the future.<br>I don't know what the military is doing. Surely they must be aware of future resource and technology shortages, but it seems that they are too enamored of ever more complexity to look at how to do war more simply. <br>In any case, it is fairly easy for each of us on an individual basis to experiment with what sorts of technologies we can go without but things like sail transport need larger groups of people to fund them even though under present conditions they might not be economically competitive.<br>My own favorite outdated technology is the construction of small skin on frame boats, something that I can do without much of a supply chain or complex tools. I have built dozens of these boats and they are both good and useful, but their main shortcoming is that they need a skin which given the shortage of sea mammal hides and the laws against harvesting them mean that I have to use woven cloth of some kind to cover them. If these boats would have to be covered in homespun cloth, would the cost and effort of creating the homespun be low enough to justify the building of this kind of boat? I don't know. For a few decades it might be cheaper to build small boats out of salvaged construction materials.

Just last summer, many ships participated in a reenactment of the Battle of Lake Erie to celebrate its 200th anniversary. Such voluntary enthusiasm should go a long way toward preserving skills and knowledge for sailing and maintaining non-economic vessels for at least some time to come. <br><br>There's a list of participating vessels (including some along the Great Lakes @Adrian) at www.sailtraining.org I've had the pleasure of cruising on Lake Michigan on one for an hour or so, including the obligatory stint at the helm. It was quite something to physically feel the power of that many square feet of canvas in the gentle breeze!<br><br>As to the question of how to deal with sea level rise swamping ports and causing difficulties with on- and off-loading cargo, it seems like <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Bulltop_Stormalong rel=nofollow>Old Stormalong</a> solved that problem long ago: just unload the cargo onto smaller boats with a shallower draft. Of course that will require more human effort than offloading multi-modal containers from giant stack ships, but it ought to give people something useful to do.<br><br>---<br><br>@Agent, Chris, etc. about PV<br><br>The grid-tie vs. off-grid debate has its place, but I just want to point out a hybrid that some might find of interest. At least one company is offering a <a href=https://www.anapode.com/products/SB3000TL_MOD1 rel=nofollow>typical grid-tied PV system</a> with an adjusted inverter. With just a bit of extra wiring, it seems they after-market converted a very common inverter with an auxiliary output for when the grid is down. The nameplate output takes a big hit, but the system still cranks out 120V AC power whenever the sun shines. While it's not a silver bullet or anything, it looks like a relatively affordable and useful middle ground between the "grid or nothing" typical PV system and the $0.83/kWh admittedly vulnerable battery backup systems with byzantine electronic complexity.<br><br>@Chris re 12VDC<br><br>"Therefore, I will endeavour to write an article (or series of articles) showing exactly how to do what you are asking."<br><br>Please do.

Out of all the possibilities, what we actually used it for was occasional task lighting, to run a few motorized tools for a few precious seconds at a time (when doing the same job by hand would have taken a significant portion of an hour; for instance, pureeing with a kitchen blender), to recharge a cell phone, and for a few minutes (total, not per day) of Internet time. That, plus a few Watt-hours of conventional batteries to run a radio and some small LED lights, made the evenings a lot more manageable. <br><br>This was a learning exercise. We had other options (including a fully fueled car) but chose to stick it out. Cooking and what little heat we had was from previously gathered deadwood dug out of the snow from my forested backyard, sawed and split by hand. Unfortunately our fireplace, while usable and actually well-constructed, was designed as decorative. Fortunately, we didn't have to worry about our frozen and refrigerated food thawing or spoiling. And fortunately, we were already invested in good warm bedding.<br><br>Anyhow, the point is that a small PV system (say, one square meter, sub-optimally oriented, and the deep cycle storage battery equivalent of two average car batteries) that yielded an average of a half a kWh per day (conservatively) instead, would have meant a luxurious half hour of Internet time every day, more kitchen tools, lighting one room, and recharging NiMH batteries for small devices instead of using up alkalines.<br><br>I don't own or want a grid PV system because my house is surrounded by forest so it's not economical while the grid is up. But as a recourse when the grid isn't there, small-scale PV would be more than worthwhile, tree shadows and all. Over time, I can phase out the inverter by making/converting my own 12v devices, as long as I can power my soldering iron. (Unlike Unknown Deborah, I love to tinker.)<br><br>Battery durability appears to be the most troubling issue.<br><br><a href=#c2711402229687334775 title="comment permalink">3/31/14, 1:07 PM</a><br><br>

First, as appropriate to this blog, inverters come in more than two flavors.There are Grid only inverters, which shut down if the grid is not there, and the standalone versions, commonly thought of as "off grid", which do not use the grid at all. There is a third category,that are a hybrid. The system cost is more, because they require both batteries and higher tech to interface with the grid. The ones I have, Outback and Xantrex brands, can run their own outputs if the grid is not there (islanding) or synchronize with the grid and sell back, or buy from the grid and charge the batteries. The next issue is what happens if my charge controller dies? You bypass it with a switch, and somebody has to walk by occasionally and see if the batteries are bubbling. If so, turn something on to use the surplus power (pump water/heat water if nothing else) or just shut them off. If your inverter fails, many things can be converted to run on 12 volts,if you don't have scrap automobiles to scavenge from (LED bulbs contain circuit to drop the mains voltage down to 12volts DC typically). The actual panels are just a fancy diode, I have some from the early 70's that are still functioning, and have seen articles on panels that had been shot with a high power rifle and still functioned (not as well mind you)<br><br><a href=#c1685632463580644749 title="comment permalink">3/31/14, 1:23 PM</a><br><br>

I have immense respect for what you are doing and your way of telling us about it is delightful. I'm looking forward to what you write.<br><br>A point of disagreement. Large parts of the southwestern and eastern US get most of their electricity from coal burning. Coal burning has adverse environmental effects beyond CO2: release of soot that causes asthma and heart attacks, acid rain, mountaintop removal, accumulation of huge ponds of coal ash full of heavy metals that leach or are deliberately dumped into rivers. Several major incidents of the latter from a single company, Duke Energy, occurred within the last six months.<br> <br>Some environmental benefits from cutting back on coal burning are immediate. To the extent that grid-connected PV replaces coal, it probably helps the environment. I say probably because most PV manufacture takes place outside the US and I don't know what damage that causes.<br><br><a href=#c8671426326469225733 title="comment permalink">3/31/14, 1:43 PM</a><br><br>

That may stick up significantly above a roof plane at high latitudes. This also means, in this case another 3cents/kWh just to have a bit more winter power.<br><br>The 3.5kWp 2-axis tracker will just net you out over the course of a year.<br><br>You are correct that if PV is 2.5x grid power cost, it will never become competitive solely on oil price rises, or at least if/when oil rises 2.5x in price - you're right again, the economy is in ruins. My point was that oil costs don't affect PV that much - note that in 2004 Brent oil was $40/bbl and PV modules were around/above $4/Wp, now Brent is $100+/bbl, and PV modules are sub-$1/Wp.<br><br>But check out figure 12 on page 19 in the LBL <a href=http://emp.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/lbnl-6350e.pdf rel=nofollow>Tracking the Sun VI</a>, small systems in Germany are half the cost of US systems. Some of that is scale/experience, some is politics/policy. That already cuts way into the 2.5x factor, at least in those places where it's relevant. My comment about module prices having another 20% drop needs to be seen against Germany's $2/Wp system prices.<br><br>US prices vary significantly by state, see Fig. 19 on pg. 25 for small systems. Maybe Ontario or Canada has some data more specific to you.<br><br>PVWatts' assumptions can be seem by the circles with an "i" to the right of the entry fields. "System Type:" says 25 year, 7.5% loan. "Initial cost:" adds $0.02/WpDC/year for maintenance.<br><br>It's real usefulness is that it accesses the actual weather data for the specified site, specifically the sunlight data, and does the math based on system specs (size, derate, tilt, azimuth) to give the expected power output.<br><br>Latitude is a big factor:<br>A 3.5 kWp, .8 DC-AC, latitude+15 degrees fixed tilt system in Buffalo NY gives 3700 kWh/year, the same specs in Honolulu gives 5000 kWh/year.<br>5000/3700 = 1.35x more power, for the same cost.<br><br>It's not just latitude: Hilo (on the Big Island) is farther south than Honolulu, but is only good for 4300 kWh/year. Kona, on the other side of the Big Island at about the same 19.6N latitude is good for 5000 kWh/year. Guess which one gets more rain/clouds? San Diego is latitude 33 N, but has even better sun, 5300 kWh/yr.<br><br>So, using 20 cents/kWh in Ontario vs. 40 cents in Hawaii (2x) times 1.35x more sun, still gives PV beating grid parity in Hawaii, even at (high-ish) $5.70/Wp system prices.<br><br>Oahu (Honolulu Hawaii) 2012 average rates were 35 cents/kWh, Hawaii (Big Island) 42 cents, and Lanai 46 cents - for residential - commercial is higher in Hawaii.<br><a href=http://www.hawaiianelectric.com/heco/Residential/Electric-Rates/Average-Electricity-Prices-for-Hawaiian-Electric,-Maui-Electric,-and-Hawaii-Electric-Light-Company rel=nofollow>Hawaii average rates</a><br><br><a href=#c5248091493535841258 title="comment permalink">3/31/14, 1:57 PM</a><br><br>

It was an interesting experience for reasons I suspect you may appreciate. The 225m diesel-powered ship was capable of cruising at about 15 knots and passed a number of cargo ships that appear to have been going 13-14 knots.<br><br>Those numbers struck me for reasons I suspect you may appreciate. 15 knots was probably the speed of the fastest Viking 100ft warships when under sail (the Viking warships, not the clipper ships, now can be seen as the fastest sailing ships of all time), and the Viking cargo ships were capable of 13-14 knots if of similar size. Being on the sea and experiencing the speeds of the sailing ships from around the 10th century was an interesting experience. In terms of length to speed ratio, no older sailing ships (and few ships today) could match the numbers the Viking ships put out. They were truly marvels of engineering.<br><br>If you care about the mathematics, the ratio that matters is the square root of waterlength to speed. Usually this is feet to knots. The Viking ships were capable of 1.3-1.5 (feet to knots), while the cruise ship came in at about 0.5, and historical clipper ships came in at about 1.<br><br>The second interesting point is that the US navy appears to agree with you regarding bunker oil. In WWII, Japan's fate was decided when they lost the largest naval battle in the war (perhaps of all time), the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which cut them off from oilfields in Indonesia (where I am currently living btw). The US Navy maintains a large fleet of nuclear-powered ships specifically because of this historical lesson: they don't want to be dependent on oil.<br><br>There is no chance that civilian nuclear transports are going to ever happen and for good reasons.

I reckon that (in the future, as JMG has alluded) there won't be storage, and we'll just make use of the electricity while the sun is shining.<br><br>Eg. don't store power, store what it can do. refrigeration: one can make/buy a phase-change fridge that uses electricity only when it's there, and stores it as "coldness" to be "released" when there's no power. Essentially, think of it as a coldness-battery. The low tech solution is to put several 2 L plastic bottles of water in a 12 V freezer connected directly to a PV panel, then transfer those to a well insulated box where one keeps one's food.<br><br>eg 2. If you want to have pump-pressurised rainwater, have a raised storage tank that gravity feeds, and fill it from a PV-tied pump that runs when the sun's shining.<br><br>I'm not (yet) doing this, and have a grid-tied PV system, but I am planning these things..<br><br>I do think that off-gridders can be a bit too quick to dismiss grid-tied PV systems.

My take is that the core issue is what I've elsewhere termed complexity costs, i.e., how complex of a system do you have to maintain in order to keep manufacturing, maintaining, and using the technology in question? The higher those costs are, the less the likelihood that the technology will survive the radical decomplexification that comes with the fall of a civilization. <br><br>Glenn, that seems reasonable. <br><br>Latefall, I'll have to go digging for the details when I have the time.

As for GMOs, of course -- much of what passes for regulation these days in DC is a feverish attempt to help companies and industries hold onto monopolistic control of markets.

The reason for the compliment is that rather than telling me how things should work, you took the novel approach (well, for the Internet anyway) and actually asked what is feasibly and economically possible.

As a disclaimer, we burn brown coal down here - which is the worst of the worst. The recent bushfires got into the open cut coal mine. Two years before that it flooded.

However, they still utilise the grid at night, during cloudy weather, whenever the household uses more energy than they are generating, over winter etc. etc. If people used less energy in their households, then respect to them, but grid connect PV is to my mind merely a display of wealth and status.<br><br>I'm a great fan of PV, but, people install them primarily for economic and social reasons, environmental – not so much.

Vacuuming here over winter involves waiting for the sun to shine. Pumping water over summer involves waiting for a sunny day.

Yes, intermittency sucks, but it was kind of normal until very recently. _If_ I remember right Max Weber had something to say on this (possibility of industrialization due to work time as standardized commodity). I'm not sure he spent a lot of time discussing non-renewable energy. That underlines how bad it may suck, but also that it is not the end of the world.<br><br>Why don't people focus more on exploiting the natural cycles/ups and downs instead of fighting them? I think wall0159 has a good point with his "phase change batteries". Someone else mentioned this as well a while ago: you might just view PV panels as a kind of very high capacity energy storage (that is somewhat erratic). Steel, aluminum, or carbon fiber - will probably save a bunch of energy down the line. You can just make it in summer when you have a surplus from PV, or hydro, or whatever and sit on it or sell it to energy poor areas. There's of cause an issue when run up times of your stuff is longer than "the sun is up". But as we scale down and localize this will not necessarily be such a problem. If you scrape enough money together and have biomass to burn through there's (steam engine) power plants that can deal quite well with varying demand (e.g. 100 - 1000 kW http://www.spilling.info/applications-steam/biomass-power.html).

Talk about simplicity! Each drop captures a tiny bit of gas under it and moves it down with gravity. Extremely good vacuum (yay tubes!) achievable with very little stuff and not much time. <br>But I was really looking for another nice thing which needs a vacuum: a flywheel. I just saw Joseph wrote a bit on this point a while ago. He was looking mostly at steel flywheels - which indeed a somewhat limited in their storage cap - and to a smaller degree in their bearing life. But IF bearings are available it isn't a big problem. They are pretty much the only part with irreparable wear. And the rest lasts three magnitudes (1000x) longer than batteries (probably even more). If you like you can skip conversion and use the mechanical energy straight out of the bucket. And you can use a LOT. If you have a low tech/smartly designed flywheel you may also use it as centrifuge for all kinds of good stuff (oil mill, apple juice, sorting of all kinds of junk) but only to that in a deep hole - otherwise you'll end up with your cider slamming through your walls. (Fun fact: What other building is built on the axis the MIT flywheel (needed to the nuclear fusion reactor) may go through when it has a bad day? Hint: yes, the it also starts with nuclear).<br><br>cont...<br><br><a href=#c1304452833851385720 title="comment permalink">4/1/14, 5:39 PM</a><br><br>

Also it is quite likely it would last another 1-3 magnitudes longer than the steel version. And you don't need much heavy machinery to build this thing at the site (making the carbon fibers is another story - but SGL is already in a good "last man standing position" if there's no catastrophe at the site or where they get the feedstock). The only thing with the composite ones is that they loose their energy quite quickly if they are not spinning in vacuum. Which is no big problem to maintain with proper seals (rubber), a steam engine (some are directly convertible to a vacuum pump) and a couple of Sprengel pumps. This may actually give my beloved composites a reason to exist in the future!<br>Why is that so great? Not only can you make all kinds of high end stuff from a handful of ingredients (rotor blades, turbine blades, pressure vessels, transportation, satellites, etc.), you need very, very little except some practice to do it well (we can't calculate much with composites - they are too complex). Satellite components, helicopter rotor blades, etc. today are handmade. And well made components can last for a looong time (not well made stuff as well unfortunately). Theoretically a carbon fiber flywheel can attain a similar capacity as a LiPo battery. The stuff is also light enough to be shipped.<br><br><a href=#c4025688477859739645 title="comment permalink">4/1/14, 5:41 PM</a><br><br>

Apart from that I am not in a good position to pull this stuff off at the moment. Yes, I am not sure if that'll improve ever. I would very much hope so though. At the moment it seems prudent to collect some of those ideas, run some numbers, check current and projected technical feasibility, and maybe make a business plan*. And bounce this off other peoples heads. I am (most people are, I believe) terribly inefficient when thinking or working alone. I am currently at about two dozen such ideas, but there's maybe a quarter to a half of them already being worked on by other people. Also I am still getting my bearings how to prioritize them, and how to go about them - which is possibly the most important part from my perspective. Helping the people who work on them already is of course easy, even though it rarely pays off for the so called "individual" doing the work (me). If things go exceptionally well (but not too well) in the next couple of months I may want to contact you (and possibly Joseph Nemeth) about one or two of these things. The pitch may eventually end up in front of a possible mutual acquaintance of ours (cool congregations). <br><br>*one problem is under the "current system" the most economically viable business plans tend to end up being predatory and damaging rather than empowering. Which is part of the reason I left my last job and took a bit of a plunge, scaled down and take time for the ADR (thanks a lot for this opportunity!)<br><br>I have run some numbers on the blimps, browsed a few papers on logging and promptly ran into the JHL 40 Skyhook (the big business approach to aerial logging). I would be really tempted to do a shameless low-tec attempt at this. I'd need a good partner or two for this though. And of course we'd almost completely disregard FAA rules etc. for this to get off the ground - not necessarily a problem from this blog's perspective. From an investor's perspective it probably is (unless I team up with the mafia). So what currently strikes me as sensible is making some hot air and ephemeral key strokes about it until the stars align a little better. The numbers look good though as far as I can tell - though I am not the logging expert here. <br>How much can I sell a cord of very high quality wood (possibly cut and Boucherie treated) for at an out of the way train station or barque? <br>I reckon the Amazon area, or some really rough but not terrible windy area would be candidates. <br>I am currently thinking it would be useful to anchor a few steel cables and lift them with (parts of) the blimp, then run the logs down the cables to a central processing station. That could use a (steam) engine (inefficiently wood or coal fired of course) to cut the lumber, heat blimp gas, draw vacuum out of a spaceframe tent, possibly even produce hydrogen in an emergency. The chainsaw motors could double for maneuvering the blimps when not deployed. When all the ballast water is used up (and compost is distributed) you could either leap frog/relay the boards along a cable or tie everything under the blimp(s) and head off. You could leave the steam engines behind, and come back later with more compost and water. In the meantime a skeleton crew can cut up the remaining logs, prepare extra fuel and plant some seedlings so there's something to come back for. As you can easily do stuff along the cable - one could prepare some fire barriers where necessary. <br>If I am not mistaking you can build something that can fly and lift stuff pretty cheap with hydrogen - making a blimp go where you want and not blow up are the two tricky bits. I assume the latter is manageable (e.g. with "life rafts"), the former may turn out to be a business opportunity for good weathermen.<br><br>On the cargo ship container dumping, I'll talk to the intermodal people I know. I assume it takes a while to clue them in on the assumptions though...<br><br><a href=#c6533179861829421041 title="comment permalink">4/1/14, 5:44 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not Alan, but the answer at the domestic scale varies between ten and forty percent, depending on how much money you want to spend on efficiency. The lower of these figures is in the running with solid-state inverters, but of course now you've got bearings and brushes with which to contend! Extremely large motor-generator sets, such as those formerly used to provide DC or low-frequency AC for electric railways, could be in the 95-97% efficient range."<br><br>Roger that.<br><br>From 1976 to 2005, I was employed as a transit vehicle electronics technician for BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit), a public transit system. For most of that period I did maintenance and repair on the transit vehicles (rail cars). All the operating systems on BART cars are powered directly or indirectly from a 1000V third rail. (Not typical; most electric light rail runs on 800V.) First generation traction motors (motors that turn the wheels and dump regenerative braking power back into the third rail) were AC; third generation traction motors are DC. Control systems on the first gen BART cars were circuit boards loaded with ICs and discrete components; current gen uses microprocessors.<br><br>Other electrical systems on the cars are 220V AC to power ventilation and heating systems and DC battery voltage for the interior lighting, communications and electronic control systems. The original BART cars produced these from a big motor alternator which required frequent maintenance by the mechanics and occasional troubleshooting and repair by the TVETs. Once reliable high power diodes and microprocessors became available, the MAs were scrapped in favor of inverters generating pseudo sine waves out of high frequency switched square waves. These units required less field maintenance. If they went wrong, the mechanics would unbolt them and ship the entire malfunctioning unit to a shop for the bench techs to fix.<br><br>The first generation of BART cars were little different in design from a 1940s vintage electric train except that they had primary radio electronic controls for speed and braking with manual backup. (They had to add a couple of things for the train operators to do to keep them from dozing off on the mainline). By the time I retired, most of the electromechanical systems had been replaced by solid state components with fewer moving parts; less skilled labor required to keep them in working order.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c3500372198793131292 title="comment permalink">4/1/14, 8:22 PM</a><br><br>
