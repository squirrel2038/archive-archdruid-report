<div class=MsoNormal>
Regular readers of this blog will no doubt recall that, toward the beginning of last month, <a href=../../2014/08/heading-toward-sidewalk.html>I commented on a hostile review</a> of one of my books that had just appeared in the financial blogosphere. At the time, I noted that the mainstream media normally ignore the critics of business as usual, and suggested that my readers might want to watch for similar attacks by more popular pundits, in more mainstream publications, on those critics who have more of a claim to conventional respectability than, say, archdruids. Such attacks, as I pointed out then, normally happen in the weeks immediately before business as usual slams face first into a brick wall of its own making</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Well, it’s happened. Brace yourself for the impact. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The pundit in question was no less a figure than Paul Krugman, who chose the opinion pages of the New York Times for <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/opinion/paul-krugman-could-fighting-global-warming-be-cheap-and-free.html>a shrill and nearly fact-free diatribe</a> lumping Post Carbon Institute together with the Koch brothers as purveyors of “climate despair.” PCI’s crime, in Krugman’s eyes, consists of noticing that the pursuit of limitless economic growth on a finite planet, with or without your choice of green spraypaint, is a recipe for disaster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Instead of paying attention to such notions, he insists, we ought to believe the IMF and a panel of economists when they claim that replacing trillions of dollars of fossil fuel-specific infrastructure with some unnamed set of sustainable replacements will somehow cost nothing, and that we can have all the economic growth we want because, well, because we can, just you wait and see!</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
PCI’s Richard Heinberg responded with <a href=http://www.postcarbon.org/blog-post/2362632/paul-krugman-s-errors-and-omissions>a crisp and tautly reasoned rebuttal</a> pointing out the gaping logical and factual holes in Krugman’s screed, so there’s no need for me to cover the same ground here. Mind you, Heinberg was too gentlemanly to point out that the authorities Krugman cites aren’t exactly known for their predictive accuracy—the IMF in particular has become notorious in recent decades for insisting that austerity policies that have brought ruin to every country that has ever tried them are the one sure ticket to prosperity—but we can let that pass, too. What I want to talk about here is what Krugman’s diatribe implies for the immediate future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Under normal circumstances, dissident groups such as Post Carbon Institute and dissident intellectuals such as Richard Heinberg never, but never, get air time in the mainstream media. At most, a cheap shot or two might be aimed at unnamed straw men while passing from one bit of conventional wisdom to the next. It’s been one of the most interesting details of the last few years that peak oil has actually been mentioned by name repeatedly by mainstream pundits: always, to be sure, in tones of contempt, and always in the context of one more supposed proof that a finite planet can
<i>too</i> cough up infinite quantities of oil, but it’s been named. The kind of total suppression that happened between the mid-1980s and the turn of the millennium, when the entire subject vanished from the collective conversation of our society, somehow didn’t happen this time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That says to me that a great many of those who were busy denouncing peak oil and the limits to growth were far less confident than they wanted to appear. You don’t keep on trying to disprove something that nobody believes, and of course the mere fact that oil prices and other quantitative measures kept on behaving the way peak oil theory said they would behave, rather than trotting obediently the way peak oil critics such as Bjorn Lomborg and Daniel Yergin told them to go, didn’t help matters much. The cognitive dissonance between the ongoing proclamations of coming prosperity via fracking and the soaring debt load and grim financial figures of the fracking industry has added to the burden. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even so, it’s only <i>in extremis</i> that denunciations of this kind shift from attacks on ideas to attacks on individuals. As I noted in the earlier post, one swallow does not a summer make, and one ineptly written book review by an obscure blogger on an obscure website denouncing an archdruid, of all people, might indicate nothing more than a bout of dyspepsia or a disappointing evening at the local singles bar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When a significant media figure uses one of the world’s major newspapers of record to lash out at a particular band of economic heretics by name, on the other hand, we’ve reached the kind of behavior that only happens, historically speaking, when crunch time is very, very close. Given that we’ve also got a wildly overvalued stock market, falling commodity prices, and a great many other symptoms of drastic economic trouble bearing down on us right now, not to mention the inevitable unraveling of the fracking bubble, there’s a definite chance that the next month or two could see the start of a really spectacular financial crash. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
While we wait for financiers to start raining down on Wall Street sidewalks, though, it’s far from inappropriate to continue with the current sequence of posts about the end of industrial civilization—especially as the next topic in line is the way that the elites of a falling civilization destroy themselves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the persistent tropes in current speculations on the future of our civilization revolves around the notion that the current holders of wealth and influence will entrench themselves even more firmly in their positions as things fall apart. <a href=../../2007/11/fascism-feudalism-and-future.html>A post here back in 2007</a> criticized what was then a popular form of that trope, the claim that the elites planned to impose a “feudal-fascist” regime on the deindustrial world. That critique still applies; that said, it’s worth discussing what tends to happen to elite classes in the decline and fall of a civilization, and seeing what that has to say about the probable fate of the industrial world’s elite class as our civilization follows the familiar path. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably necessary to say up front that we’re not talking about the evil space lizards that haunt David Icke’s paranoid delusions, or for that matter the faux-Nietzschean supermen who play a parallel role in Ayn Rand’s dreary novels and even drearier pseudophilosophical rants. What we’re talking about, rather, is something far simpler, which all of my readers will have experienced in their own lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Every group of social primates has an inner core of members who have more access to the resources controlled by the group, and more influence over the decisions made by the group, than other members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How individuals enter that core and maintain themselves there against their rivals varies from one set of social primates to another—baboons settle such matters with threat displays backed up with violence, church ladies do the same thing with social maneuvering and gossip, and so on—but the effect is the same: a few enter the inner core, the rest are excluded from it. That process, many times amplified, gives rise to the ruling elite of a civilization. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I don’t happen to know much about the changing patterns of leadership in baboon troops, but among human beings, there’s a predictable shift over time in the way that individuals gain access to the elite. When institutions are new and relatively fragile, it’s fairly easy for a gifted and ambitious outsider to bluff and bully his way into the elite. As any given institution becomes older and more firmly settled in its role, that possibility fades. What happens instead in a mature institution is that the existing members of the elite group select, from the pool of available candidates, those individuals who will be allowed to advance into the elite.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The church ladies just mentioned are a good example of this process in action; if any of my readers are doctoral candidates in sociology looking for a dissertation topic, I encourage them to consider joining a local church, and tracking the way the elderly women who run most of its social functions groom their own replacements and exclude those they consider unfit for that role. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That process is a miniature version of the way the ruling elite of the world’s industrial nations select new additions to their number. There, as among church ladies, there are basically two routes in. You can be born into the family of a member of the inner circle, and if you don’t run off the rails too drastically, you can count on a place in the inner circle yourself in due time. Alternatively, you can work your way in from outside by being suitably deferential and supportive to the inner circle, meeting all of its expectations and conforming to its opinions and decisions, until the senior members of the elite start treating you as a junior member and the junior members have to deal with you as an equal. You can watch that at work, as already mentioned, in your local church—and you can also watch it at work in the innermost circles of power and privilege in American life.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here in America, the top universities are the places where the latter version of the process stands out in all its dubious splendor. To these universities, every autumn, come the children of rich and influential families to begin the traditional four-year rite of passage. It would require something close to a superhuman effort on their part to fail. If they don’t fancy attending lectures, they can hire impecunious classmates as “note takers” to do that for them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If they don’t wish to write papers, the same principle applies, and the classmates are more than ready to help out, since that can be the first step to a career as an executive assistant, speechwriter, or the like. The other requirements of college life can be met in the same manner as needed, and the university inevitably looks the other way, knowing that they can count on a generous donation from the parents as a reward for putting up with Junior’s antics. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who’ve read the novels of Thomas Mann, and recall the satiric portrait of central European minor royalty in
<i>Royal Highness</i>, already know their way around the sort of life I’m discussing here. Those who don’t may want to recall everything they learned about the education and business career of George W. Bush. All the formal requirements are met, every gracious gesture is in place:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the diploma, the prestigious positions in business or politics or the stateside military, maybe a book written by one of those impecunious classmates turned ghostwriter and published to bland and favorable reviews in the newspapers of record:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>it’s all there, and the only detail that nobody sees fit to mention is that the whole thing could be done just as well by a well-trained cockatiel, and much of it is well within the capacities of a department store mannequin—provided, of course, that one of those impecunious classmates stands close by, pulling the strings that make the hand wave and the head nod. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The impecunious classmates, for their part, are aspirants to the second category mentioned above, those who work their way into the elite from outside. They also come to the same top universities every autumn, but they don’t get there because of who their parents happen to be. They get there by devoting every spare second to that goal from middle school on. They take the right classes, get the right grades, play the right sports, pursue the right extracurricular activities, and rehearse for their entrance interviews by the hour; they are bright, earnest, amusing, pleasant, because they know that that’s what they need to be in order to get where they want to go. Scratch that glossy surface and you’ll find an anxious conformist terrified of failing to measure up to expectations, and it’s a reasonable terror—most of them will in fact fail to do that, and never know how or why. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Once in an Ivy League university or the equivalent, they’re pretty much guaranteed passing grades and a diploma unless they go out of their way to avoid them. Most of them, though, will be shunted off to midlevel posts in business, government, or one of the professions. Only the lucky few will catch the eye of someone with elite connections, and be gently nudged out of their usual orbit into a place from which further advancement is possible. Whether the rich kid whose exam papers you ghostwrote takes a liking to you, and arranges to have you hired as his executive assistant when he gets his first job out of school, or the father of a friend of a friend meets you on some social occasion, chats with you, and later on has the friend of a friend mention in passing that you might consider a job with this senator or that congressman, or what have you, it’s not what you know, it’s who you know, not to mention how precisely you conform to the social and intellectual expectations of the people who have the power to give or withhold the prize you crave so desperately. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s how the governing elite of today’s America recruits new members. <i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, it’s how the governing elite of every stable, long-established society recruits new members. That procedure has significant advantages, and not just for the elites. Above all else, it provides stability. Over time, any elite self-selected in this fashion converges asymptotically on the standard model of a mature aristocracy, with an inner core of genial duffers surrounded by an outer circle of rigid conformists—the last people on the planet who are likely to disturb the settled calm of the social order. Like the lead-weighted keel of a deepwater sailboat, their inertia becomes a stabilizing force that only the harshest of tempests can overturn. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Inevitably, though, this advantage comes with certain disadvantages, two of which are of particular importance for our subject. The first is that stability and inertia are not necessarily a good thing in a time of crisis. In particular, if the society governed by an elite of the sort just described happens to depend for its survival on some unsustainable relationship with surrounding societies, the world of nature, or both, the leaden weight of a mature elite can make necessary change impossible until it’s too late for any change at all to matter. One of the most consistent results of the sort of selection process I’ve sketched out is the elimination of any tendency toward original thinking on the part of those selected; “creativity” may be lauded, but what counts as creativity in such a system consists solely of taking some piece of accepted conventional wisdom one very carefully measured step further than anyone else has quite gotten around to going yet. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In a time of drastic change, that sort of limitation is lethal. More deadly still is the other disadvantage I have in mind, which is the curious and consistent habit such elites have of blind faith in their own invincibility. The longer a given elite has been in power, and the more august and formal and well-aged the institutions of its power and wealth become, the easier it seems to be for the very rich to forget that their forefathers established themselves in that position by some form of more or less blatant piracy, and that they themselves could be deprived of it by that same means. Thus elites tend to, shall we say, “misunderestimate” exactly those crises and sources of conflict that pose an existential threat to the survival of their class and its institutions, precisely because they can’t imagine that an existential threat to these things could be posed by anything at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The irony, and it’s a rich one, is that the same conviction tends to become just as widespread outside elite circles as within it. The illusion of invincibility, the conviction that the existing order of things is impervious to any but the most cosmetic changes, tends to be pervasive in any mature society, and remains fixed in place right up to the moment that everything changes and the existing order of things is swept away forever. The intensity of the illusion very often has nothing to do with the real condition of the social order to which it applies; France in 1789 and Russia in 1917 were both brittle, crumbling, jerry-rigged hulks waiting for the push that would send them tumbling into oblivion, which they each received shortly thereafter—but next to no one saw the gaping vulnerabilities at the time. In both cases, even the urban rioters that applied the push were left standing there slack-jawed when they saw how readily the whole thing came crashing down.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The illusion of invincibility is far and away the most important asset a mature ruling elite has, because it discourages deliberate attempts at regime change from within. Everyone in the society, in the elite or outside it, assumes that the existing order is so firmly bolted into place that only the most apocalyptic events would be able to shake its grip. In such a context, most activists either beg for scraps from the tables of the rich or content themselves with futile gestures of hostility at a system they don’t seriously expect to be able to harm, while the members of the elite go their genial way, stumbling from one preventable disaster to another, convinced of the inevitability of their positions, and blissfully unconcerned with the possibility—which normally becomes a reality sooner or later—that their own actions might be sawing away at the old and brittle branch on which they’re seated. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If this doesn’t sound familiar to you, dear reader, you definitely need to get out more. The behavior of the holders of wealth and power in contemporary America, as already suggested, is a textbook example of the way that a mature elite turns senile. Consider the fact that the merry pranksters in the banking industry, having delivered a body blow to the global economy in 2008 and 2009 with worthless mortgage-backed securities, are now busy hawking <a href=http://www.dailyimpact.net/2014/09/15/housing-bubble-ii-deja-vu-again/ >
equally worthless securities backed by income from rental properties</a>. Each round of freewheeling financial fraud, each preventable economic slump, increases the odds that an already brittle, crumbling, and jerry-rigged system will crack under the strain, opening a window of opportunity that hostile foreign powers and domestic demagogues alike will not be slow to exploit. Do such considerations move the supposed defenders of the status quo to rein in the manufacture of worthless financial paper? Surely you jest. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It deserves to be said that at least one corner of the current American ruling elite has recently showed some faint echo of the hard common sense once possessed by its piratical forebears. Now of course the recent announcement that one of the Rockefeller charities is about to move some of its investment funds out of fossil fuel industries doesn’t actually justify the rapturous language lavished on it by activists; the amount of money being moved amounts to one tiny droplet in the overflowing bucket of Rockefeller wealth, after all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For that matter, as the fracking industry founders under a soaring debt load and slumping petroleum prices warn of troubles ahead, pulling investment funds out of fossil fuel companies and putting them in industries that will likely see panic buying when the fracking bubble pops may be motivated by something other than a sudden outburst of environmental sensibility. Even so, it’s worth noting that the Rockefellers, at least, still remember that it’s crucial for elites to play to the audience, to convince those outside elite circles that the holders of wealth and power still have some vague sense of concern for the survival of the society they claim the right to lead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Most members of America’s elite have apparently lost track of that. Even such modest gestures as the Rockefellers have just made seem to be outside the repertory of most of the wealthy and privileged these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Secure in their sense of their own invulnerability, they amble down the familiar road that led so many of their equivalents in past societies to dispossession or annihilation. How that pattern typically plays out will be the subject of next week’s post. </div>

I would posit that our current elites (aside, perhaps, from the one running merc companies like Blackwater- or whatever they call themselves these days) are even less likely to weather the approaching storm, due to the nature of what makes them elite. The virtual nature of so much that passes for wealth and productivity these days has very little application in the non-virtual "real world". Making money gaming the financial system won't even get you a job as bookkeeper for the next warlord that breezes into town.

I just noticed this article this morning, I wanted to bring it to your attention right away rather than posting it on a prior article from last month.<br><br>The anti-immigrant homebaked (half-baked?) militias planned to <a href=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/09/only-5-show-for-militia-border-shutdown-as-organizers-blame-threat-of-mass-blood-shed-by-cartels/ rel=nofollow>block a border crossing in Texas in order to protest</a> the dire existential menace to this country of orphaned children immigrating from Latin America. The organizers claim that they received threats from Mexican cartels, should they carry out the protest. <br><br>The "Liberal media" is basically <a href=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/09/22/1331508/-Vigilantes-Pooping-Their-Shorts# rel=nofollow>laughing at the militias</a>, saying that they're a bunch of big-talking cowards who were scared away by a growl from the US Border Patrol about fines, and don't want to admit it. But on the other hand, is it all that unreasonable to think that Mexican cartels might indeed want to put the kibosh on a plan to cut off their profit route? <br><br>Nobody seems to be taking the militias' claim seriously, (and I can hardly blame them). I find this rather odd, since apparently fundamentalist Muslims halfway across in Syria must urgently be bombed because of the dire threat they pose to U.S. interests, but nobody -- not even the militias making the claim -- seems to bat an eye at the claim that a foreign drug cartel has made threats against U.S. citizens living at home. Either nobody believes there is any slight grain of truth to the militias' story -- or else, nobody wants to admit in public that Mexican drug cartels can act with impunity to protect their interests on U.S. soil.<br><br>But if the militias' claim happens to be true, it would fit well with your theory about the role of Mexican cartels as warlords raiding the Empire from just outside the borders. The drug trade could be considered a "reverse wealth pump" and of course the warlords wouldn't want it to be shut down. <br><br>I don't have any information or any way to verify these news reports, and I am certainly not on the side of the anti-immigrant militias -- I think they're crazy to the point of perhaps being delusional. So the whole thing might just be a fantasy. But if there is any grain of truth to this whole matter, then it fits the pattern you have outlined, JMG.<br><br><a href=#c4455146712080760763 title="comment permalink">9/24/14, 7:10 PM</a><br><br>

But looking back on the late 70s and early 80s, when I was coming out of college, it seems to me that the establishment elites made a conscious decision to open up more opportunity to a broader group and a new generation. That's what I see when I look at that whole yuppie phenomenon, of which I was once a part. Lots of new young professionals and corporate jockeys getting brought into the system, presumably in return for their spending themselves into a fury and adding a new layer to the bottom of the economic pyramid. All part of keeping the system together perhaps. <br><br>Whether that was what actually happened, I don't really know. But something shifted it seems. This time around, though, I don't see the same thing happening. It just feels like the establishment is quietly circling the wagons around the graveyard. Partly I think that the new money that got pumped into the system in the last few decades enabled a greater mobility for some members of this broadened elite to move into the same towns and neighborhoods together. And with that came even more tunnel vision, more faith in the system and more faith in their role within it. Not much that can be done about that now, except perhaps getting out of the way.<br><br><a href=#c9142218033490016484 title="comment permalink">9/24/14, 7:20 PM</a><br><br>

PCI’s crime, in Krugman’s eyes, consists of noticing that the pursuit of limitless economic growth on a finite planet, with or without your choice of green spraypaint, is a recipe for disaster.”<br><br>I mentioned on your blog before in a comment that I recycled into <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2014/01/a-steampunk-calculator-and-six-other.html rel=nofollow>'A Steampunk calculator' and six other sustainable technologies from The Archdruid</a>, that, if any mainstream economist should understand Peak Oil and other resource limits to growth, it's Krugman. In a New York Review of Books article, Krugman revealed that he was the research assistant for William Nordhaus’ landmark paper, “The Allocation of Energy Resources.” He “spent long hours immured in Yale’s Geology Library, poring over Bureau of Mines circulars and the like.” If someone with his experience with the economy of energy doesn’t get Peak Oil, then it’s probably hopeless for most economists to comprehend the issue. Krugman will examine the costs of pollution, but as for the economics of resource depletion, he won't hear of it. That's why I list him among the conventional economists when I lecture about economic schools of thought to my classes, but mention Kunstler and Joel Salatin when I describe the ecological economists. I'd mention you, but I don't think I'd show "The Sproutwood Faerie Festival" to my classes. That's the only film IMDB lists you in.<br><br>Krugman will acknowledge one limit to economic growth--decreased population growth. He recognizes that <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2014/06/the-hipcrime-vocab-why-slowing.html rel=nofollow>population growth is slowing down in the U.S. and it's a problem for economic growth</a>. Escapefromwisconsin, who comments here, did an admirable job of summarizing Krugman and his readers on the issue and I link to his entry from mine. Krugman thinks that a stable or slowly shrinking population would be good for the planet, but the way the economy is currently structured would mean that the economy would be stagnant and not provide enough jobs for everyone. That's one area where he thinks the system needs reform to accommodate this reality. The idea that the system might collapse irreversibly to achieve the same goal in a way more severe than the Great Depression seems to be literally unthinkable for him.<br><br><a href=#c5846326698901084758 title="comment permalink">9/24/14, 7:44 PM</a><br><br>

Something to file away to be shared with anyone displaying a mote of awareness of our impending fate. I definitely look forward to next week's!<br>I love your church lady example. It is something I can relate to on a personal level. I never sought out prestige, but it looks like I am being handed it by default right now, because the one (possible psychopath) who was ruthlessly seeking it flubbed it so badly, she offended anyone she thought might rival her, and disappointed anyone who believed in her invincibility. Withstanding her attacks (Japanese lady style--all smiles) has been exhausting. I'm nothing but the tallest (or second tallest if I'm lucky) left standing.<br>Years back, Karel Van Wolferen wrote The Enigma of Japanese Power, which criticized Japan for being like a captainless ship, because no one among the elites dared rock the boat, and Japan just keeps going along on the same course until it hits the rocks. One of the benefits of this critique to Japan was that they started seeking out "outside pressure" in order to effect needed changes. Problem is, they are taking that pressure almost exclusively from America and its moribund world view...<br>While Van Wolferen made it seem like Japan was unique in its stubbornness, what you have pointed out suggests that this is not the case at all. It may be more pronounced in Japan. Confucianism values stability. Pressure seems to be borne more equally throughout society, with everyone valuing their own place in the hierarchy, with the possible exception of the outcasts. (I met a man who aims to study Japan's homeless and I look forward tremendously to his results.) The one "genial duffer" I had the fortune of meeting in the upper Shinto hierarchy has a life much much harder than my own. That applies visibly to the Emperor and his family as well, and plays no small part in the stability Japan manages to enjoy, reef ahead notwithstanding.<br><br><a href=#c7998402135813320712 title="comment permalink">9/24/14, 7:55 PM</a><br><br>

There are credible reports that there are considerations that it may be apparently curtailed over the next few months.<br><br>I could be wrong, and this is purely my opinion based on gut feel: Quantitative Easing (QE) programs appear to be the equivalent of knowing at some point in the future you'll have to drink the Kool Aid, but at least you don't have to do it today. On the other, once the QE programs are unleashed, it becomes very difficult to stop them without the equivalent of drinking the Kool Aid. Also, there is the black swan of external powers applying pressure to stop the QE programs, or them starting their own or dumping the currency. <br><br>I've often felt that fancy labels such as QE were intended to complicate otherwise relatively simple processes and are used in society as a sort of smoke screen. Is that a form of magic?<br><br>QE is utilised to sustain asset / paper asset prices after all.<br><br>Oh yeah, that sort of thing goes on in community groups!<br><br>I'll tell you a funny story from many years ago now. My lady entered a cake in a local competition run by the Country Women's Association (CWA). The prizes were awarded by no less than the ex-Premier of the state who owned a farm in the local area.<br><br>My lady's cake won first prize and the ex-Premier said at the presentation ceremony that he liked it so much he went back for a second tasting. (It was an apple lumberjack cake for those that are interested). Anyway, my lady and I were in the crowd watching the ceremony and going, "yeah, we came, we saw, and we kicked the CWA's .....". Well, the head of the CWA group right after the announcement that we'd won, started saying that we broke the rules because we put sultana's in the cake, blah, blah, blah. She even started dismissing the ex-Premier's opinion in front of the crowd. He took it gracefully in his stride though and was firm in his opinion. It was a very unimpressive display on her part. Still, we got the prize, so yeah, whatever. A true story and also a quite fascinating insight into that particular group. Was it inclusive and welcoming? Not really...<br><br>Another descriptive for stability might be the process by novelty is avoided. Stable systems by their nature abhor novelty.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: If anyone is curious about the farm here, there are some cool photos showing how to go about moving large rocks using low tech methods in this week’s blog: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Rock and Roll</a><br><br><a href=#c8312764492162695267 title="comment permalink">9/24/14, 8:07 PM</a><br><br>

I used to play a game called "Kingmaker," which simulated the Wars of the Roses. Plague was an important random event in that game. When it struck a city or town, any royal heirs there, along with any player-controlled nobles, were killed. The nobles would respawn back at their castles the next turn, but the royal heir was gone forever. We players took the loss of the heirs in stride; there were so many that there was almost always another to capture and crown king or queen when the time was right. That written, we made sure to stay out of the cities as much as possible. They were bad for our nobles' health!<br><br>On the subject of collapse, I use this game as an example of how a plague that hits a society on its way up that manages to keep its system of government intact has very different effects than on one that is in the middle of collapse. Yes, the population went down, but the English monarchy keep right on going and the lives of the survivors were better after the plague than before it. That's not how the plagues that hit the collapsing Roman Empire played out. The Eastern Empire shrunk (the Western Empire was already long gone), the population shrank, and the survivors were worse off than before.<br><br><a href=#c8601837672222088530 title="comment permalink">9/24/14, 8:51 PM</a><br><br>

As for the elites, those who don't head for the exits in short order are likely to end up decorating lampposts a little further down the road. I'll discuss how that happens next week. <br><br>Rabtter, bingo!<br><br>William, as I've pointed out dozens of times already this year, the kind of collapse I'm talking about is the kind that takes place in the real world -- in this case, a major economic crisis, lots of bankruptcies and layoffs, widespread social unrest, and quite probably the unraveling of another round of political systems into autocracy or failed-state chaos: that is to say, one more roadbump along the route of the Long Descent. It's a source of wry amusement to me that so many people literally can't hear that, and fall into the knee-jerk habit of thought that says the only alternative to business as usual is total catastrophe. <br><br>Radoje, excellent. Yes, I'll be talking at length about the radical simplification of the mechanisms of power that always accompanies the end of a civilization and the beginning of a dark age. <br><br>Thomas, exactly. If a bunch of Roman local magnates were to decide to block a border crossing being used by Alaric the Visigoth or Attila the Hun, what kind of response do you think they'd have gotten? <br><br>Kyoto, thank you. As for art, it's an embarrassing reality these days that the social function of art is the manufacture of collectibles for the clueless rich: basically, upscale Hummel figurines with an inflated price tag. <br><br>Yupped, my sense is that the yuppie phenomenon was a deliberate attempt to gut the radical youth movements of the time by drawing as much talent as possible into the defense of the existing order. It worked, too -- it's just that the funds needed to keep that running aren't so easy to find any more. <br><br>Liam, no argument there -- but I've had some practice.

One thing that has frequently caught my interest is the belief that the elite is invincible, that it could never find itself at the business end of a guillotine.<br><br>What makes this belief doubly intriguing is that it isn't shared across the board. By and large the most vocal proponents are middle class, middle aged men. Even when I present persuasive reasoning and thought experiments they will not budge from their rhetorical position. Instead they grow silent. The conversation is over.<br><br>Younger women, especially those who have a basic historical understanding of European history, usually have already thought about how the unravelling of the elites could play out. Older ladies also usually “get it”. I've seen young men sometimes comprehending the vulnerability of the elites, but just as often arguing for the invincibility of the world order, but almost always with considerably less brittleness than older guys. Perhaps women are more flexible in their thinking? Dmitry Orlov noted that most of the people who died from alcoholism and suicide after the fall of the USSR were recently unemployed middle-aged men.<br><br>I consider the “invincibility of the elite” as little more than a thought-stopper.

I was raised, possibly even hot-housed, in a highly-academic family to be one of your second category; throughout my schooling, first in state, then in “public” school, I was always “the girl most likely to”… who, in the end, didn’t. Perhaps, couldn’t. Even now, in my mid-50s, I am still made aware quite frequently how much of a disappointment I am to them; I should have been running the country by now! Or, at least, a multi-millionaire like one of my cousins. But you have just laid out the mechanics of the current system so clearly that I’ve realised that my offbeat way of thinking and lack of insecurity would never have let me fit into a system that will act to preserve itself at all costs. That said, I’m happy enough to have carved out a small niche for myself in a semi-alternative world that runs alongside the mainstream economy, where I (and mine) at least stand a chance of surviving the long-delayed crash and not adorning a lamp-post.<br><br>Your thought-provoking post has struck some sparks in my head about our education system. My family value our UK dual state &amp; public school education system far above all other things in public life (and I will always agree that a good education is a prize beyond compare) yet it seems to me that this particular Emperor lost his clothes some time ago. It no longer teaches people how to think, and now merely teaches them what to think; any attempts to reason things out for oneself will result in zero marks in the all-important universal exams, without which you will never get to the right universities or into jobs within that system. In a sense, this has always been the case, up to a point, the point at which most people left school to get on with real life; first 14, then 16, now 18. Further education was originally only for intellectuals or for those destined to lead, but has now been dumbed-down to keep our young people off the unemployment figures. Youngsters (and sadly, also teachers &amp; governors) who do attempt to think for themselves now find themselves firmly rejected &amp; excluded, and many end up damaged by this. But at the end of the day, surely it will be the system itself that suffers the most damage, as it has ruthlessly removed all obstacles to business as usual &amp; silenced the voices of dissent who might have alerted it to its own failings. The means by which people could educate themselves outside the school system - evening classes, public libraries, the Open University, which is now no longer free or even open - have steadily been eroded away by lack of funding; after all, it’s all out there on the Web, isn’t it? If you have the skills &amp; will to find it… A complete lack of intellectual rigour, plus plenty of bread &amp; circuses, in the upcoming generations may serve to keep the juggernaut rolling along for a few years yet, but I do wonder how angry people will get when they realise how they have been cheated. Though maybe that’s an If, given a generation so thoroughly trained NOT to think. But surely even Celebrity Come Dancing can’t pull the wool over people’s eyes indefinitely?<br><br>In short, it seems to me that our various education systems have evolved away from their stated purpose and now only serve the interests of those at the top of the tree. Whether they were originally designed to do that or not, I cannot help wondering why those who serve in them are so completely unable to see that they are no longer doing the job that they wanted to do?<br><br><a href=#c4939067692657311997 title="comment permalink">9/25/14, 4:23 AM</a><br><br>

With the rise of mass migration to australia , the Squattocracy has been largely forced into the background , but nonetheless it remains , as any plebian who attempts to enter the hallowed halls of corporate business and finance will quickly find out .. <br>People i have met from U.K who are recent arrivals are stunned and dismayed to hear of the existence of this fossilised but still powerful structure , and some have even become angry at the suggestion ( moreso when they hear the full horror of indigenous genocide in this country ) .. <br>I suppose they are remnant Romans , these Aristocrats , originally drawn from far flung country estates all over the U.K ..

It explains clearly why change cannot come from the top and why the system itself cannot be changed from within. No one with that stated goal would be allowed in and even if someone could possibly bluff their way into the elite, they would quickly find themselves in the position of a virus surrounded by white blood cells once they try anything. So, thank you for yet another article that explains what many of us understand, but can't quite articulate. <br><br>In our own little corner of the Old World, until recently the elites were made up of opportunists that in the nineties attached themselves like ticks to the decaying communist infrastructure. Now, almost everything worth privatizing (read: stealing with impunity) is long gone, so there is a readjustment going on. Those elites that have been legitimized one way or another are eliminating those that have not, and society as a whole is moving to the model of the European Union, which, from my limited point of view, resembles what you described in the US. <br><br>Meanwhile, the various local mafias are steadily gaining power, influence and acceptance, because they offer one of the main ways for the lower class to gain any kind of prosperity, the other being trying their luck west. They are made up of gypsy clans and the urban poor and share the combined cultures of those two groups. They have been fascinating to watch and could potentially gain some dominance in the far future, if not for the fact that, historically, external influences have been more often than not more important than any internal movement in shaping the society of Romania. The current powers might even adapt and stay in place if there is no outside pressure, but that's obviously not going to happen. Essentially, any prediction regarding to whom I'll be paying taxes in my old age seems useless.<br><br>To end in a funny note about George W. Bush and the cultivation of new elites, a quote form the late and great Robin Williams seems appropriate: <br><br>“Some are born great. Some achieve greatness. Some get it as a graduation gift.”<br><br><a href=#c7273129913525776450 title="comment permalink">9/25/14, 6:28 AM</a><br><br>

Well, when I lived in the DC area about 10/12 years ago, there were a number of preschools where there were LONG wait lists (e.g. when your child was born, you had to put him/her on the wait list for the preschool, otherwise forget it) AND pass the entrance "exams"/tests to gain admission. I won't even go into the private schools where first graders had at least 1-2 hours of homework a night, plus assignments such as having to give a 5-minute oral presentation by the end of the year. The whole system was (&amp; still is) undergirded by the belief that your child had to be "ahead" of others, and if he/she got into the 'right' preschool, then they could enter the right' grade school, and so on. The pressure was enormous. A couple of our teen babysitters only slept 4-5 hours per night due to the amount of school + extracurriculars they were carrying. All to potentially become part of the 'elite'.<br><br>We got out of there fast and have largely homeschooled our two kids (9 &amp; 12) out West, who, amazingly, score in the 95%+ on all exams with only 3 hours of school time per day (plus numerous outside skill-based activities).

S. Lewis's excellent talk on the topic <a href=http://www.lewissociety.org/innerring.php rel=nofollow>The Inner Ring</a>:<br><br><i>In the passage I have just read from Tolstoy, the young second lieutenant Boris Dubretskoi discovers that there exist in the army two different systems or hierarchies. The one is printed in some little red book and anyone can easily read it up. It also remains constant. A general is always superior to a colonel, and a colonel to a captain. The other is not printed anywhere. Nor is it even a formally organised secret society with officers and rules which you would be told after you had been admitted. You are never formally and explicitly admitted by anyone. You discover gradually, in almost indefinable ways, that it exists and that you are outside it; and then later, perhaps, that you are inside it...<br><br>People who believe themselves to be free, and indeed are free, from snobbery, and who read satires on snobbery with tranquil superiority, may be devoured by the desire in another form. It may be the very intensity of their desire to enter some quite different Ring which renders them immune from all the allurements of high life. An invitation from a duchess would be very cold comfort to a man smarting under the sense of exclusion from some artistic or communistic côterie. Poor man—it is not large, lighted rooms, or champagne, or even scandals about peers and Cabinet Ministers that he wants: it is the sacred little attic or studio, the heads bent together, the fog of tobacco smoke, and the delicious knowledge that we—we four or five all huddled beside this stove—are the people who know.</i><br><br>Lewis is preaching about the futility of reaching for the Inner Ring, as when it is sought for itself, it will vanish.

Just maybe, he hoped, we could recognize the collapse of the detritivore ‘Homo Colossus’ as a natural progression. Not a plan from the wicked cabal of the rich or the religious or the communists or any other scapegoat of the week. <br><br>You really seem to get it. You made the same point framing the introduction of the elite in primate behavior. That all the basic features are on display among the elderly church ladies brings the point all the way home. How do you deal with the critical intelligence that clearly sees the pain increasing behaviors of those in power, morns the missed opportunities and yet avoids raging at the machine, as it were? The study of history and ecology teaching the events of these times are not as unique as they might appear? <br><br>The context of the Catton quote seems apropos to this week’s discussion as well:<br> “Desired changes entail unwanted changes. Changed human activities involve changes in man’s environment. Environmental change leads to succession; it can threaten human life. Non-competitive human interaction is imperiled by excess numbers and proliferating technology. Ecological antagonism begets social and emotional antagonism. These were the principals people needed to learn to read between the lines of the news in post-exuberant times.<br><br>…Pressure has darkened our future. While we can hardly turn it off, we can somewhat mitigate its insidious impact by learning to understand how and why it has happened.” Catton, Overshoot pg. 208<br><br>More at Mindful Ecology dot com<br><br><a href=#c8653539954427450988 title="comment permalink">9/25/14, 11:08 AM</a><br><br>

JMG has often pointed out that those in charge will do everything in their power to maintain the status quo, or thereabouts, during such times (or be replaced by those who will). At the same time, this urge to maintain the status quo is also the very mechanism that dooms the system in the long run, since this also stands in the way of the necessary reforms that would be required to alter the congenital flaws contributing to overall decline.<br><br>Of course reform is risky business, even for the brilliant statesmen with which we are so blessed today. As mentioned before on this blog, FDR managed to pull it off, albeit with a continent-scale industrial and natural resource base to smooth over any rough patches. Mikhail Gorbachev was not so successful. His reforms removed the negative feedback mechanism that was keeping the soviet system hanging around (and in decline), and without that mechanism, the country descended into rapid collapse.<br><br><a href=#c8552029139115593783 title="comment permalink">9/25/14, 12:08 PM</a><br><br>

I guess I'm expecting more of the same.</i><br><br>I will try to respond to this myself. I believe the tone of this cycle of posts may be a response to the following passages in Warren Johnson's <i>Muddling Towards Frugality</i>:<br><br>p.159: <i>As the economic pie grows smaller, the natural tendency will be for everyone to try to maintain the size of his own piece. Obviously, everyone cannot do this, and to the degree that some are successful, antagonisms and hostilities would be generated. Worst of all, if some coalition of powerful interests were able to take us too far from a reasonable path in which we all shared the burdens of change fairly, it could generate a violent attempt to redress the balance. A situation of this sort would be ripe for the demagogue or the fanatic to capitalize on, and if such an imbalance were created and hardened into permanence, it could divide the country bitterly. What is needed, of course, is not a rigid defense of self-interest, but free-flowing adaption.</i><br><br>And the point you're making is his suggested solution on pp.167-8: <i>Rather than try to bring about fundamental changes in our political system (changes that never get far anyway), the trick will be to maintain the proven resilience of the system we have. How can this be done? I would refer back to the difference between the comic and tragic perspective described in Chapter I. ¶ If we maintain our sense of humor, and accept the world as it is and endeavor to make the most of it, then I would say that we should have no fears about the future. * * * The political process will be a good indicator of how sensible we are and what kind of public temperament we create. There will inevitably be intemperate language, and self-righteous demands hurled in all directions. If we shrug them off and go about our lives, our elected representatives will do the same. There is no single group powerful enough to bend this country to its evil will, no single leader strong enough to lead millions of people somewhere they do not want to go, and no way to blame politicians for the ills of the country.</i><br><br>I believe what JMG has been saying recently is that the vision described on pp.167-8 of this book has failed; for some occult reason, America has lost its collective sense of humor and has been divided into two hostile, bitter sides endlessly throwing barbs at each other (and yes, this is almost certainly because of all the lying and manipulations by the side you are opposed to, and has nothing to do with you and your friends). The chance for America to take on the role of the comic hero has failed.<br><br>Now, I see comic heroes on the streets every day. One is sitting next to me at the Boston Public Library right now as I read the library copy of <i>Muddling Towards Frugality</i>; he is, as Johnson puts it (p. 23), of the type whose "goal is simply to survive and to enjoy himself as best he can. He is unwilling to fight; instead, he tries to outwit his enemies and the authorities." But these people will never become leaders in the political system, for the exact reasons this week's post outlines. Several generations from now, their children will become heroic leaders of a different kind of imagined community -- their own neighborhoods, most likely -- when the welfare system fails. But that's not what's needed to run the nation. Our country right now is in the sway of muddlers who are slowly losing the humility needed to admit they are muddling; against Johnson's hopes, our national reserve of humility and humor is slowly trickling away at the grassroots level. Eventually, when we are totally fed up with muddlers, they will be replaced with tragic heroes (i.e. fanatics), or the secession some are hoping for will take place, or both.<br><br><a href=#c3595415370945624410 title="comment permalink">9/25/14, 12:54 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not going to pass judgment on her decision; it's not the one I'd make, but the call isn't mine to make. I've suggested here more than once, though, that it's going to be crucially important to create a new framework for adult education that can survive the coming financial implosion of the academic industry -- and that's going to be the focus of a series of posts down the road a bit. <br><br>YJV, that's not my interpretation of Gorbachev, or for that matter of his fall from power. There are always people in the managerial class who fantasize about turning against the system that they serve, but it rarely comes to anything, since they'd have to give up their privileges to do that, and that's something they're by and large utterly unwilling to do. <br><br>Kylie, nicely done!

Reading about the reign of Emperor Gracian, and his relationship with the priests of the Old Religion (and the old power elites). It's fascinating seeing the old Roman aritocracy trying to tell an emperor who is the model of an early medieval ruler that he still has duties to serve them. Then, seeing those old pagan aristocrats deifying him in the classic sense even after he gives up all of his traces to the old power structures. All against a backdrop of invading Huns and Goths. It's unsettling how normal everything looks on one end and how completely strange on the other... but it's the middle ground, the pagan senators and priests clinging desparately to the old system that really shows how strange of a time it was.<br><br><a href=#c1101706323521760752 title="comment permalink">9/25/14, 2:58 PM</a><br><br>

At least 2008, and possibly all the way to 1932 -- it's impossible to say in advance, since so much depends on who decides what and who has what financial toxc waste squirrelled away in whose balance sheet. As for what to do about it, that's probably a subject for a post all its own; the very short form is that you should minimize your dependence on the money economy as much as you possibly can. <br><br>Kaitain, I wasn't a Star Trek fan, but I certainly read <i>Omni</i> and played D&amp;D, and come to think of it, I remember that cartoon!<br><br>DaShui, of course! The same process works at all levels from the zenith of the system all the way down to local church ladies, very much including all those groups that want to change the system, no matter how much they think they've gotten away from hierarchy. <br><br>Rita, thank you!<br><br>Scotlyn, well, there you go. I have a sister-in-law who did the Ivy League thing a little before you did, and I think she's still bitter about not having broken through the invisible ceiling. Your approach was the more sensible!<br><br>Ben, you'll want to read up on Ebola, because both your comments are incorrect -- its early symptoms resemble flu, it can stay latent for up to three weeks, and it spreads from person to person quite well -- right now, the number of cases in Africa is doubling every 20 days, which is not the profile of an easily contained virus. Current estimates are that if things continue as they're going, 1.4 million people will be infected by January 1, 2015; at that rate, we get 2.8 million by January 20, 5.6 million by February 9, 11.2 million by March 1, 22.4 million by March 21, and so on. It doesn't take all that many more doublings -- I'll leave the number for you as a math exercise -- before the total number of infected people passes the total population of the planet. <br><br>Now of course it's not going to infect everyone on the planet; there are geographical barriers to get past, and odds are that the currently very high rate of transmission is being driven by extreme poverty, overcrowding, and poor sanitation. That said, unless something happens fairly quickly, Ebola will spread to East Africa; once it's there, stopping it from getting to the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent will be a very difficult thing; and if that happens, it's probably a safe bet that over the next five years or so, it's going to hit the Third World globally and make forays into the more developed countries as well. We are potentially looking at the Black Death of the 21st century, and the easy assurance with which people in the developed world insist, inaccurately, that it's not something they have to worry about is among the major factors that are driving Ebola toward pandemic status. <br><br>Dammerung, or holing up in the basement and waiting for the financial rubble to stop bouncing, take your pick. <br><br>Mister R., exactly.<br><br><a href=#c795006588397295382 title="comment permalink">9/25/14, 5:34 PM</a><br><br>

Currently, my understanding is that it's not quite as easily transmissible as you make it sound - for example, the 3 week latency is also supposedly a period when it's not transmissible at all. Nonetheless, I think it may well become a problem even here in the U.S., as there are some interesting signs about this epidemic that remind me of what you write about early in the post. Perhaps the most important was the editorial written by Michael Osterholm in the New York Times. Osterholm, btw, is one of the most highly respected authorities in public health. <br><br>After warning that this epidemic might be a history changer, he points out, "we are in totally uncharted waters and that Mother Nature is the only force in charge of the crisis at this time." He postulates two possibilities - the first, like you suggest, migration into the larger geographical area, but second, the possibility that the virus becomes airborne - that is, transmissible like the flu.<br><br>Right now, ebola is somewhat difficult to catch because it requires that you get an infected person's bodily fluids into your own body. But Osterholm's second scenario might do some very 1918 things to its transmission rate, and good sanitation, less crowding and relative wealth won't make much difference.<br><br>For such a powerful voice in public health to make this type of warning in a venue as large as the NY Times... that's very disturbing indeed.<br><br>(Full story here: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/12/opinion/what-were-afraid-to-say-about-ebola.html)<br><br><a href=#c8496565255461604002 title="comment permalink">9/25/14, 6:15 PM</a><br><br>

In middle school. I've studied immunology and biology at the college level. Am I a doctor? No. But I worked full time in the medical field for seven years and I am not blithely ignorant about the topic of infectious diseases. Yes, under the scenario you sketched out, Ebola could come soon to a city near you. <br>That said, I still contend that Ebola will not be one of the major pandemics of this century. If one takes basic contact precautions, the virus is not that likely to spread by simple contact. It is not airborne, so far as we know, and it does not live long outside of the human body. Yes, it can spread rapidly in areas with poor sanitation and lack of education about the virology of the disease. More likely, IMHO, Ebola will continue to spread and take vital health care resources away from other far more widespread diseases like malaria, TB or simple dysentery, thus compounding the crisis in Africa, and possibly, beyond.<br>The industrial world is currently at greater risk from some airborne virus like influenza, which is a disease that most people in the industrial world are familiar with, and thus complacent about. Or, maybe some antibiotic resistant disease, like TB, which modern over-use of antibiotics is making more common and deadly could fill the role of one of the four horsemen for a while.<br>To sum up, I appreciate the math and the lengthy response, but I respectfully disagree that Ebola will be the first major pandemic of the century. As you've pointed out multiple times, declines in basic public heath are plenty deadly without revisiting the worst parts of the long 13th century.<br><br><a href=#c377810919421628295 title="comment permalink">9/25/14, 7:32 PM</a><br><br>

It's as though a dam burst, and you were sitting downstream in the path of the flood saying, "You know, if the concrete chunks from the dam suddenly sprouted wings, they could do a lot of damage."<br><br>Michael, exactly. They're running out of options fast. <br><br>Ben, medical practitioners who are using every possible precaution are still coming down with Ebola. The case load is doubling every twenty days. Those hard facts don't support your easy reassurances, you know. As I noted above, it's frankly weird to watch people engaging in dismissive handwaving and coming up with something else to worry about when we've got a lethal epidemic spreading at an exponential rate, and nobody anywhere is gearing up to do what would be necessary to keep it from becoming a global pandemic. <br><br>Trog, good!<br><br>1ab, I think that sort of thing is endemic in the economic field. So much of modern economic theory makes so little sense when applied to the real world that it's not surprising that the Fed gets lost in its own jargon sometimes. <br><br>Joseph, I'm not a socialist -- I'm a Burkean conservative -- and before you launch into a panegyric about the glorious workers' paradise, I suggest you look up the word "gulag" and think very hard about what it implies.

Luckily for them it didn't end with them dangling from the battlements as the empire was more-or-less peacefully dismantled.<br><br>These days one can be 'upper-class' but poor, whereas many of those born into the 'lower classes' have ended up as the mega-rich.

I trekked for 18 days around the Annapurna mountain range and because it was at the time way off the beaten track, I never saw anyone other than locals for days on end. Local rum and snickers bars quickly became the single indulgence at the end of a long day. Who would have thought that it was possible to walk uphill for an entire day? That thought would be alien to most Australians - as the continent is reasonably flat! hehe! Plus, it had also never occurred to me that: a) clothes could freeze solid overnight; and b) a person could go 18 days without bathing and still wake to see the next sunrise. Ahh, fun times.<br><br>Anyway, as I'm foremost a practical kind of person, I'd noticed that in Kathmandu, they had scheduled brown outs for the electricity grid. This meant that at specific times during the week, the electricity supply would be cut. Before that time, it had never occurred to me that that was a possible situation.<br><br>Yet there it was in front of me and it sort of hard to ignore.<br><br>Roll on a decade and a bit and they now call that arrangement over here: "load shedding".<br><br>There is no sustainable source of base load power using the technology that we currently deploy - except for off grid solar and wind that is and even that has a limited life span. No one wants to pay for the system inefficiencies with such systems either as I scrape through winter only to be over supplied in every other season. Just sayin... There is no such thing as a free lunch!<br><br>PS: I’ve been wondering whether the powers that be really will switch off QE. I can’t see it happening, but I could be wrong. The current overseas shenanigans seem to me to be a smoke screen for domestic issues. People I speak to are genuinely worried here by the threat of terrorism. It seems sort of a weird concern to me, because I’ve read that at least one Australian woman a week is killed by her partner. Just sayin…<br><br>Hi Glenn,<br><br>Yeah, local history and folklore is a really good guide as to what is possible or not.<br><br>Hydro is just not possible here due to the lack of large reservoirs. Interestingly too, I reckon the current grid systems here struggle with the fluctuating demand for electrical energy. It isn't a constant demand and solar and wind are not a constant supply. Most of the large scale generators can generate a reasonably constant supply and this is their main difference - including hydro. However, at the end user, I've read a lot of complaints about fluctuating and extreme voltages on the renewable energy forums.<br><br>Hi Moshe,<br><br>Top point! I use electricity in quantity when it is being generated from the sun. This means adapting your life to the cycles of the sun and weather. It really isn't that different from agriculture.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c8229110159168888270 title="comment permalink">9/26/14, 4:49 AM</a><br><br>

I hope we're not nitpicking the differences between apples and oranges here, because as I said, the statements currently being made in the press by some prominent people in the public health field are plenty of cause for alarm. That said... the fact of the doubling of cases going on currently is an effect of the situation in which ebola has arisen - it won't necessarily behave that way outside of that area. Public health has very effective ways to deal with ebola that only work well when it first appears in an area, not when it's widespread. They also only work in an area with the resources to implement them. <br><br>As to health care workers catching ebola, here's what Dr. Daniel Bausch, a doctor actually working in the epidemic, says about that: "The analogy I've been using, it's like saying, well, you've trained somebody to be a pilot. So there's the plane, go fly the plane, without thinking: What about mechanics? What about the other people who have to guide the plane down the runway? You don't have all the very important supporting personnel that you need for [Ebola], and so it's been a tragic situation." He goes on to explain how two doctors in a ward of 60 patients with no other support (nurses, sanitation workers) can find it almost impossible to implement the necessary precautions. You can read what he has to say here: http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/09/22/349882298/dr-daniel-bausch-knows-the-ebola-virus-all-too-well. He is not as worried as you are, or even as worried as I am, and he offers a very cogent explanation of what is going on with this epidemic.<br><br>The growth in cases right now isn't happening because it's really difficult to contain the disease - it's because the actions that needed to be taken to contain the disease where it's at were not taken. Whether it spreads in such a way outside West Africa will depend on how communities outside that area respond to it. So while your analogy of the dam breaking is correct, the dam is located in a relatively small geographical area where ebola is likely going to have to burn itself out in the local population with those exponential case numbers. What happens elsewhere is going to depend on whether those other places are able to learn from this and contain it immediately when it appears - or whether those concrete blocks grow wings. While the global community is not responding to ebola in West Africa with anything like the urgency they should be showing, that is a tragedy for West Africa. It becomes a tragedy for the rest of us if the massive case numbers there allow the virus to resort and become airborne, or if countries outside of the affected area respond with the same apathy to their own local situation as they've shown to West Africa.<br><br>I hope that makes better sense to you.<br><br><a href=#c107053278976150454 title="comment permalink">9/26/14, 6:23 AM</a><br><br>

And it will take weeks to get that up and running.<br><br>The "not contagious until symptomatic" is somewhat misleading. When the viral load is high enough, it's contagious. That happens on a continuum, not like an on/off switch. Somebody is not safe to touch one minute, and then after noticing they feel feverish, suddenly contagious. And for real world evidence, a co-worker proudly announced to me the other day that she thinks she's been coming to work with a fever for some days. (Well no wonder I've been tired and feeling like I was fighting an illness for some days. I have been.) Yes, people are that stupid and selfish. There are now 2 diplomats, one nurse and one doctor that have known they were ill and helped it spread before they died, violating quarantine and lying.

My obsolete Debian Linux box I patched yesterday, a little crudely, after 14 minutes' Internet searching, and typing, and testing. Linux people elsewhere must be similarly edgy. <br><br>However, it is the twenty-day Ebola doubling that really hits home. By the start of the 2015/2016 northern winter, we will have gone through a further 20 doubling times. At this point, the present Ebola caseload would have under the doubling-time calculation have increased by a factor of just over one million, yielding a hypothetical caseload of over one billion. <br><br>Well before this, I submit, some structures of government, at least in the poor countries, but perhaps also in the richer countries, will be cracking. <br> <br>And if partial mitigation measures extend the doubling time to, say, 50 days, or to 100 days, the situation is still unsustainable. <br><br>An unpleasant feature of exponential growth is that things look pretty normal until you are rather close to the decisive discontinuity.

That is, bank regulators failed to do their jobs properly not because they lacked the tools but because they were discouraged from using them.<br><br>The report quotes Fed employees saying things like, "until I know what my boss thinks I don't want to tell you," and "no one feels individually accountable for financial crisis mistakes because management is through consensus." Beim was himself surprised that what he thought was going to be an investigation of financial failure was actually a story of cultural failure.

This bodily fluids thing just won't wash. People live with the AIDS afflicted and those with hep C and hep B and rarely get infected, and when I say rarely, I might be referring to hep B, the easiest one of the three to catch. Certainly I have taken care of Hep C and AIDS patients with little fear, and minimal precautions. They do not even require a private room. It's best not to splash their blood in your eye, or stick yourself with a needle that has been inside of their body; otherwise you're pretty much in the clear. <br><br>Are the health care workers in Africa going out to bars at night and getting it there? Are they running out of PPE (personal protective equipment)even though we always see it in the pictures? How long can they keep that stuff on in the heat and humidity there? Why do they need that kind of PPE for "bodily fluids?" The stuff they are wearing - I've never seen that level in the hospital, even in negative pressure, rule-out TB rooms. And they're still getting it? Even if it were airborne, that seems strange. I'm guessing that stuff is NOT always worn. I'm suspecting it might be droplet, which is somewhat like airborne but much larger particles that go only short distances of a few feet and don't hang suspended very long.<br><br>Also, I'd like to see some research about how the public gets it. For example, when there is a victim, how many family members contract it and what did those family members do with the sick one? Breathe near their face? Clean their vomit? Just touch and hug them?

There are good Canadian schools but nobody will swoon at a degree from UBC, McMaster or Univ. of Toronto. For one thing the cost is about one tenth that of Harvard. <br><br>There are other roads. One, of course, is via family connections and inherited wealth. But there's also the choice of profession, industry, firm, all of which give varying degrees of access. <br><br>My own family origins were anything but elite but that was no barrier. I did well scholastically, participated in high school athletics, graduated from a good university. Everything about me was plain vanilla. Just what the Establishment wants. <br><br>After graduation I went to work at a large corporation. And that's where they get a good look at you. I had some of the requisite markers: mild mannered demeanor, calm under pressure, monk-like devotion to work (late nights, at your desk by 8 am on Saturdays), on-time delivery of assignments. <br><br>And I was rewarded. I was afforded expensive perqs, high level social contacts, I shook hands and chatted with movers and shakers. It was all fun and interesting. <br><br>And yet. It's the old saying: know thyself. Not only do others assess you. You have to assess yourself. Just as importantly, you have to assess the assessors. They never in a million years would think that the evaluation was a two way street. But it was. <br><br>Because there comes a point where you have to decide: do I go all in? There is a price to pay. Do I drink the bath-water? <br><br>I included myself out. Not by a thundering denunciation of capitalism or of the firm. It was a by a career choice that took me a little bit off the beaten path. <br><br>One colleague that I worked closely with told me over drinks that he thought I was crazy. My bosses were more restrained. We had a few conversations. They asked, why do I want this? I gave an explanation. They gave their approval. That was that. I was out. <br><br>The colleague that told me I was nuts inherited my old office and my old job. Years later he ended up in the c-suite of a very large firm. Could that have been me if I'd played my cards differently? I don't think so. Never mind that life is one astoundingly improbable event after another.

Most of the population of the planet is living in the same conditions that are allowing Ebola to spread explosively through the West African population, and nobody in the industrial world is taking the situation seriously enough to invest the sums that would be necessary to limit the epidemic to West Africa. Once it spreads to East Africa and the trans-Sahara trade routes, Ebola is a global problem, because the sums that would be needed to control it at that point are probably beyond what the industrial nations can afford. Easy assurances of the kind you're offering are the main reason why the necessary actions aren't being taken -- just as easy assurances that it's different this time, we don't need to worry about peak oil, etc., etc. are the main reason we're in the broader predicament we're in.

She doesn't dismiss the epidemic, of course. <br><br>Bear, I could definitely get behind that proposal.<br><br>Steve, excellent. No, I hadn't read the latest Michael Lewis piece, so thanks for the heads up. As for the French Revolution, that's a very useful thing to be reading about just now. I also recommend Alan Moorehead's solid history of the Russian revolution, if you happen to be able to find a copy. <br><br>Ben, you're on. Let's set a specific date -- how does April 1, 2015 work for you? -- and set 1 million as the firm number, so there's no question who wins the bet. I'd be happy to lose, and if the industrial nations shake off their complacency and tackle this thing the way it needs to be done, it could still be stopped -- but the window of time in which that can still happen is getting very narrow. <br><br>Bear, I'd be surprised if we got off as easily as the 1970s, but it's by no means certain that things are going to get as bad as they did in the 1930s. A lot depends on the relative stupidity of the decisions that are made in the next few months.<br><br>Onething, there are detailed studies of how Ebola spreads -- it's been a while, so I don't have references handy. Droplets of sputum are a problem. So is the fact that it's a hemorrhagic fever, and victims start leaking blood through their mucus membranes and skin; there's also vomiting and diarrhea to contend with. Someone with Ebola produces a lot more bodily fluids than the rest of us, basically, and if a drop of any of it comes into contact with any part of your body, you can catch the disease. <br><br>Bear, I'm starting to see the point of the ancient Greek habit of choosing people randomly to sit in the governing assembly. <br><br>Roger, fascinating. I'm sure a fair amount of that happens here as well. <br><br>Rita, yes, I've been thinking about that too. <br><br>Eric, yes, and it's interesting to watch. The next week or two may be decisive -- if the last three days of downward movement accelerate into a full-scale crash, the economic crisis could be on us almost immediately. <br><br>Moshe, granted, but the sanitation here is still enough better than Third World slums that I think it'll make a difference.<br><br>Rita, no argument there.<br><br><a href=#c8072274351746622248 title="comment permalink">9/26/14, 6:15 PM</a><br><br>

So in Guinea, I think you could still have hope that you can recognize the transmission chain, and if you can feel like you have all the contacts, then contact tracing, if you have the personnel and capacity to trace them, it's still a viable response.<br>...<br>If you have a situation where there's thousands of cases of Ebola that represent thousands of different contacts that are spread over a whole country, and you've really lost sight now of what those transmission chains are, it really does no particular good now. If we know that I'm the only person in the room who has Ebola, and you're my only contact, that makes sense [to do contact tracing]. ... If we take a larger scale of this whole building, that there's 60 or 70 people that have a whole bunch of chains of transmission, then at a certain point we just have to say everyone in that building's at risk, right?

Still, I don't bloody like it but he feels it's his duty. <br><br>The great majority of infected US medical personnel have been evacuated back to Emory Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, which is right across the railroad tracks from the Centers for Disease Control. I'd bet they're using the blood and bodily fluids of those recovered patients to develop a vaccine, and I'll bet it's an around the clock effort - the lights at CDC will be on all night every night - and once they get something, they're probably going to be making about 500 million doses for right here at home...<br><br>As for West Africa, my bet is the old-fashioned quarantine, with everything moving past the "dead line" getting shot and killed - Ebola virus does not live long in dead bodies. I don't see the kind of medical aid going in that will be needed to stop the epidemic in time. I'd imagine if the US doesn't implement a "dead line", some of those African countries surrounding those affected most certainly will.

Look, for example, at the social dynamics in the post-Soviet Eastern Europe. Pretty silently, anyone there had huge once-in-centuries opportunities orchestrated by economics professors in Chicago, Harvard. Either informed individually or by sheer luck of timely audacity, new business and political elites rose there soon and set fresh Randian standards even globally. The social pyramid is now well set by the financial food chain of 2008 - either you in the majority dependent on increasingly meager job opportunities or even disastrously fast credit, or you are a comfortable beneficiary of the credit, rent, equity payments. That is the predominant factor of your social welfare now - and both the old and new elites like it that way. The “winner takes all” dynamics of the internet business is another convenient venue for the same game.<br><br>I expect the elites will see a variety of fates under a societal collapse. Some of them will indeed find themselves fooled terribly, but some will see through the real issues sooner or later. For a perspective - not everyone who foresaw the 2008 financial crash were declaring that publicly. As described in Michael Lewis’ “The Big Short” and a few other books, some found it more rational to profit privately from an eminent financial crisis. So I can imagine some powerful dogs seeing but not bothering with mitigating a global disaster, rather looking forward for the long times where any capital is valuable and labor is dirt cheap. It is not even hard to contribute “usefully” to the deluding public stories of invulnerability, cyclical recovery, further progress, to play with perceptions of the public and fellow rich, customize preemptively some crises. The increasingly irrational events and public discourse make most sense from this perspective.<br><br><a href=#c1469014512519933323 title="comment permalink">9/27/14, 3:55 AM</a><br><br>

The problem is that people can be contagious before they are aware they are sick -- the "not contagious until after symptoms appear" is misleading. It's a rule of thumb, not a hard fact. As I have written above, becoming contagious doesn't have an on/off switch; its on a continuum. And it depends in part on the underlying health of the exposed person. The healthcare workers are wreaking havoc with their systems; inside the PPEs the temp climbs to 115 degrees. They can only stay in them for 1 to 1.5 hours. It then takes them 2 hours of rest and fluid intake to rehydrate. Iow, as they wear themselves down physically, they become more susceptible to catching anything because they are less able to respond to exposure. So it's likely that lower levels of exposure to ebola are enough to enable infection. You aren't infected with anything until the pathogen enters a cell where it can reproduce. While it's initially circulating in your blood, your primary immune system (IgM) can still recognize and eliminate it. If your IgM is overwhelmed or misses even a single virion, allowing it to enter a cell where it can begin to reproduce, then you are infected. A single virion may reproduce millions of baby virions, which are wrapped in your own cell membranes when they leave the cell, hiding them in plain sight and freeing them to enter more cells to reproduce. In the case of Ebola, they primarily attack the liver which accounts for the specific symptoms.<br><br>On the state of health care in the US, we will not have W Africa's runaway situation across the US. However, I anticipate the potential for local outbreaks due to our crumbling healthcare system, along with pockets of crowding and poverty. For the last several years, we have been closing hospitals and downsizing staffs. This past Wednesday, I heard the following directly from the lab tech on duty at the hospital in question.<br><br>Monday night, post peak tourist season, pre-flu season, with nothing out of the ordinary, we ran out of ED beds in Maine. One of the biggest Maine hospitals not only had every ED bed filled, and every cot lined up in every hall (yes, we sometimes find ourselves overwhelmed with beds set up in the hallways), there was a line of 27 people waiting to get into their ED. They called all over the state -- there was not a single ED bed available. They ended up having to ship ED patients to Boston just to find an ED bed.<br><br>Mary<br><br><a href=#c5439788993450270508 title="comment permalink">9/27/14, 5:44 AM</a><br><br>

However, it is interesting once in a while to stands things on their head and see what they look like, or alternately, to stand on my own head, and do the same. There is certainly a modern cognitive bias towards liberalism, but this only entails the higher intelligence of liberals if you assume that history is moving in the right direction, and that (further) it is moving in that right direction because of liberal policies and analysis (and not, for example, for a correlated cause or a cause not yet understood). If (for example) liberalism is symptomatic of the late stage decline of civilization (a theory propounded by Oswald Spengler in Der Untergang des Abendlandes), then it's a bit more complicated. Likewise, if history is moving in the wrong direction (what if the reactionaries are right, and neither progressives or conservatives give proper priority to the balance of future/past as against the "now"?). Also, if history has an implicitly sacred meaning (Rene Girard), then neither weak liberalism (conservativism) nor progressivism (robust liberalism) has the tools to analyze it in the first place. What about classical liberalism, favored by Robert Godwin at OneCosmos.blogspot? Well, in this case, I find it hard to distinguish a consistently rigorous classical liberal position from the truly "conservative" wing of that movement (Baron Ledhin, de Tocqueville, Russell Kirk, Edmund Burke).

Even though I visit allot of unconventional and doomy websites. The news gave the impression that it was a slow burning epidemic until a couple of weeks ago in a newspaper I saw a graph with an unmistakable exponential curve doubling every three weeks. It seems to be hard to get up to date figures but a few days ago it was 6000 cases and in August 10% of the cases where admitted to be Health car workers. A quick way to calculate exponentials is to remember that every 10 doubling multiplies by 1024 so 20 doublings multiplies by just over a million thats 400 days for over 6 billion cases if the trend holds but obliviously other factors come into play before then. As the aid workers in Africa get overwhelmed by the size of the epidemic the doubling time may shorten and the lethality rate rise. The new plan to send 300 soldiers only creates an extra 1700 beds which is hardly a dent when the case load is over 6,000 probably 12,000 by the time they get there. It has reached the point where a very extreme effort is required to contain it and even that window is uncertain and closing.<br><br>As this is the Blog where I learned the word egregore I wonder what your opinion is of Ebolachan?<br><br><a href=#c1437059196324946566 title="comment permalink">9/28/14, 6:36 AM</a><br><br>

The pictures are helpful. Note that the biology of the disease is that two cell types are mainly involved — a kind of white cell in the blood (monocytes) and the lining of blood vessels (endothelial cells). The organ affected include liver and kidney prominently, but not brain. There have been several outbreaks since 1975. <br><br>Wikipedia on viral hemorrhagic fevers: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hemorrhagic_fever<br>Ebola is part of a large family of viruses. What they share is activation of the clotting mechanism with deposition of tiny blood clots in capillaries. This removes platelets and clotting proteins so that normal clotting is defective and little hemorrhages appear on the surface of the body. This article has a list of historical outbreaks.<br><br>The general process is disseminated intravascular coagulation (clotting).<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_hemorrhagic_fever<br>There’s a long list of causes, especially if we include mild forms. Rare but informative is reaction to transfusion of incompatible blood, e.g. group A into a group O individual. The patient has potent antibodies to the transfused red cells and the antibody attaches to the cells, which are quickly removed. But the antigen-antibody complexes initiate an intense clotting reaction. Something like this may be happening in Ebola patients. A historical note is that plague bacteria provoke a similar reaction, with hemorrhages in the skin. When the blood breaks down, it darkens. Hence “Black Plague” or “Black Death”. <br><br>About the math of epidemics, try<br>http://aeon.co/magazine/health/how-mathematics-can-make-epidemics-history/<br><br>AFAIK, it isn’t clear why Ebola has taken off exponentially. The history is that there have been several small epidemics. By definition, these were exponential early in the course but died out. The present outbreak my reflect a difference in the virus or simply the bad luck of its occurrence where people under poor conditions of sanitation move around a lot. <br><br>There’s another rule of thumb for exponential curves that’s used in connection with compound interest, called the “rule of 75”. If you want to know the time to doubling of money at an interest rate of n, calculate 75/n. Thus 5% gives a doubling time of 15 years. It doesn’t work for very large or small numbers, but for small integers, say 2-10, it allows a quick guess.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c1353925895212203370 title="comment permalink">9/28/14, 12:36 PM</a><br><br>

But it does seem that the federal leadership has at least some continuing awareness that our imperial status must be maintained to prevent popular revolt. From the U.S.-backed coups throughout the oil-producing world during the post-WWII period through today's oil wars led by Bush/Cheney (pronouncing the "American way of life non-negotiable") and Obama (now cozying up to the Saudi elites to bomb Syria and Iraq into submission), there is at least a persistent dedication to ensuring that the oil flows freely and on favorable terms to Western markets. Of course, these moves will only achieve short-term advantages at best, but the desperation with which any and all such actions are taken speaks to an underlying awareness that the "spice must flow," if you'll pardon my Dune reference.<br><br>Do you think this all represents an incidental alignment between the elites and popular U.S. interest in cheap energy reserves, or could it be that they're painfully aware of the potential for internal beheadings within their own ranks?<br><br>- Pacificus<br><br><a href=#c6583299241082448581 title="comment permalink">9/28/14, 1:11 PM</a><br><br>

I trained as a journalist many, many moons ago, back when the papers were just starting to slide down into the muck. I worked long enough to understand that what is presented is either innocuous or the editor's version of what he (still mostly men) thinks the publisher wanted to have happened, which often bears little resemblance to what the reporter actually saw. Pravda indeed. Meanwhile the important stuff gets missed.<br>To coin a simile, they do not report on the important fact that the brake pads feel a bit off because they may be wearing down and therefore need replacing, they report on (and pundits speculate endlessly about) the crash that happened because the worn-out brake pads, which were not replaced, failed.<br><br>2) Colour revolutions. Unnamed foreign powers don't have to put any funds into a colour revolution to destroy the U.S.<br>13 years ago, a few Arab radicals with some $5 box cutters managed to pretty much wreck the U.S. economy, paralyze its legislature, and get the Land of Freedom and Opportunity for All(TM) to turn itself into a proto-police state complete with extra-judicial concentration camps and torture.<br>The unending 'war' against a nebulous, unidentifiable 'enemy' is, effectively, an ongoing colour revolution and frightened Western powers have been quite prepared to sink an ever larger fraction of resources into suppressing "terrorism".<br>Anyone interested in destabilizing the U.S. just needs to buy oil from ISIL -- and <i>somebody</i> is buying it from them.<br><br>3) Ebola outbreak got serious because, unlike all previous outbreaks, it hasn't burned itself out in the space of a few weeks and because, also unlike previous epidemics, the western doctors who went there to 'save' the local people are dying from the disease. Worse, they are bringing it home and governments are starting to panic, despite the high-profile cures. Maybe if we throw as much resources into fighting this concrete, identifiable, and truly frightening enemy, we might be more successful.<br>It also occurs to me that there are an <i>awful</i> lot of Science Fiction novels and future worlds that reference a global pandemic of some unnamed virus that wipes out a huge portion of the population, beyond Stephen King's "The Stand", viz., LeGuin's "The Lathe of Heaven", Heinlein's future world, Matheson's "I Am Legend", the Star Trek future world, and, of course, the whole plethora of zombie-apocalypse scenarios so popular these days.

The pessimists all insist that the crises we face are greater than ever before; the optimists all insist that our capacity to meet the crises is greater than ever before. I think they're both right, and that their points cancel each other out -- not surprising, as the scale of the crises and the scale of our capacity to respond to them are both functions of the same thing, the physical and energetic scale of industrial civilization. Thus we face the same sort of thing as other civilizations in the past...just spread over more territory.<br><br><a href=#c3441801614742152700 title="comment permalink">9/28/14, 10:57 PM</a><br><br>

It is very likely that the coal fired power stations are possibly nearing the end of their economic lives and are in need of replacement.<br><br>Natural gas power stations are favoured by the generator companies for perhaps the obvious reason that they are cheaper to build and much faster to respond to increases in electricity demand than a coal fired power plant - by a massive margin of time. Thus they are more efficient in their use of fuel and resources - whatever that means ;-)!<br><br>However, I'd speculate that there is a whole lot more low grade coal to be had than natural gas.<br><br>Such things are not obvious to most people because of a prevailing belief that somehow energy sources are interchangeable. Without the infrastructure in place, this is not that easy a task.<br><br>I see this on a day to day basis because I've had to supply all of the infrastructure here and have to somehow incorporate all of the different systems so that there are multiple redundancies built in.<br><br>Take hot water for example. The first choice here is the solar hot water panels, the second is the wet back on the wood fire and third place is the LPG on demand water heater. The first two methods are very slow to heat the water, but the third - Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) - is as good as instantaneous, but by far it is the most expensive method in terms of the fuel. The heater itself was reasonably affordable especially compared to the solar and wood stove.<br><br>Incidentally, I've been mucking around with the solar hot water system here - which works a treat - and found that by increasing the speed of the flow of water through the panels, more heat is being exchanged between the panels and the storage tank. I wouldn't have expected that outcome and originally set it up to have a slower flow of water. It takes a really long time to get your head around all of this stuff.<br><br>Incidentally, I find it to be very interesting that apart from one other person, no one else has remarked on the possibility of foreign powers dabbling in domestic affairs. Maybe people think it is a bit too conspiracy esque?

Basically, the world MUST fall apart if Man stops acending/progressing.<br>JMG's position as a mage and Archdruid who also happens to write about Peak Oil and the predicament of Industrial Society is what sets him apart from the secular humanist Peak Oil writers.

She’s a healer, a protector of children and the poor and downtrodden, a holder of the sands of time, and a psychopomp. In a lot of ways, she’s a figure well suited to a religious sensibility that embraces, rather than shrinks from the natural process of life. Western Christendom has culminated in a culture so afraid of death that we pour millions of gallons of embalming fluid into the ground every year just to spare people from seeing a decaying corpse. A culture that “worships death” is one that truly embraces life, because the two are very much linked. Figures like Santa Muerte, or the Mare Llwyd who is making a resurgence in Welsh culture are, I think necessary and psychologically healthy to have, and I’ve found the psychopomps and death gods of my own religion essential to making sense of the future and maintaining my sanity. As for Santa Muerte’s association with drug gangs: rising gang activity is the result of poverty and displacement in a collapsing world and cuts across religions. Most drug gangs are still made up of Catholics and evangelical protestants, but nobody associates either religion with gang activity. The fact that mere devotion to Santa Muerte is often treated as probable cause even for people who have no ties to gangs says much more about the fears and prejudices of the elites in power than it does about the devotees of the saint, as do media representations and active persecution of her devotees (destruction of shrines, etc.).<br><br><a href=#c8269456324954766529 title="comment permalink">9/30/14, 9:16 AM</a><br><br>

Each is woefully unprepared to deal with a major epidemic, whether it's caused by bioterrorism or by new or reemerging diseases resistant to antibiotics. After the publication of her critically acclaimed The Coming Plague, which looked at the reemergence of infectious diseases, Laurie Garrett decided to turn her highly honed reportorial skills to what she saw as the only solution--not medical technology, but public health. However, what she found in her travels was the collapse of public-health systems around the world, no comfort to a species purportedly sitting on a powder keg of disease. In Betrayal of Trust, Garrett exposes the shocking weaknesses in our medical system and the ramifications of a world suddenly much smaller, yet still far apart when it comes to wealth and attention to health.<br>With globalization, humans are more vulnerable to outbreaks from any part of the world; increasingly, the health of each nation depends on the health of all. Yet public health has been pushed down the list of priorities. In India, an outbreak of bubonic plague created international hysteria, ridiculous in an age when the plague can easily be treated with antibiotics--that is, if you have a public-health system in place. India, busy putting its newfound wealth elsewhere, didn't. In Zaire, the deadly Ebola virus broke out in a filthy and completely unequipped hospital, and would have kept up its rampage if the organization Doctors Without Borders hadn't stepped in, not with high-tech equipment or drugs, but with soap, protective gear, and clean water. Most of the world still doesn't have access to these basic public-health necessities. The 15 states of the former Soviet Union have seen the most astounding collapse in public health in the industrialized world. But during a cholera epidemic, officials refused to use the simple cure public-health workers have long relied on--oral rehydration therapy. Many of the problems in these nations can also be found in one degree or another in the U.S., where medical cures using expensive technology and drugs have been emphasized to the detriment of protecting human health. The result? More than 100,000 Americans die each year from infections caught in hospitals, and America has a disease safety net full of holes."<br><br><a href=#c2319873613889328371 title="comment permalink">9/30/14, 10:26 AM</a><br><br>

With temperature probes at the panels and at the bottom of the storage tank and an adjustable pumping flow rate, you can monitor the amount of heat being absorbed by the water as it passes through the panels. Too much flow and the water won’t have time to absorb all the heat in the panels, too little flow and the water will not transfer the heat properly to the tank. I have to adjust the flow for summer and winter conditions.<br>Of course this could all be automated in a complex algorithm in a “smart” controller, but I follow the KISS principle (keep it simple, stupid).<br><br><br><a href=#c6274681015558656840 title="comment permalink">10/1/14, 3:17 PM</a><br><br>
