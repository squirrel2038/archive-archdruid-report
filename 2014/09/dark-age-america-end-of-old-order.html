Lately I’ve been rereading some of the tales of H.P. Lovecraft. He’s nearly unique among the writers of American horror stories, in that his sense of the terrible was founded squarely on the worldview of modern science. He was a steadfast atheist and materialist, but unlike so many believers in that creed, his attitude toward the cosmos revealed by science was not smug satisfaction but shuddering horror. The first paragraph of his most famous story, “The Call of Cthulhu,” is typical: </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s entirely possible that this insight of Lovecraft’s will turn out to be prophetic, and that a passionate popular revolt against the implications—and even more, the applications—of contemporary science will be one of the forces that propel us into the dark age ahead. Still, that’s a subject for a later post in this series. The point I want to make here is that Lovecraft’s image of people eagerly seeking such peace and safety as a dark age may provide them is not as ironic as it sounds. Outside the elites, which have a different and considerably more gruesome destiny than the other inhabitants of a falling civilization, it’s surprisingly rare for people to have to be forced to trade civilization for barbarism, either by human action or by the pressure of events.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By and large, by the time that choice arrives, the great majority are more than ready to make the exchange, and for good reason. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s start by reviewing some basics. As I pointed out in a paper published online back in 2005—<a href=http://ecoshock.org/transcripts/greer_on_collapse.pdf>a PDF is available here</a>—the process that drives the collapse of civilizations has a surprisingly simple basis: the mismatch between the maintenance costs of capital and the resources that are available to meet those costs. Capital here is meant in the broadest sense of the word, and includes everything in which a civilizations invests its wealth: buildings, roads, imperial expansion, urban infrastructure, information resources, trained personnel, or what have you. Capital of every kind has to be maintained, and as a civilization adds to its stock of capital, the costs of maintenance rise steadily, until the burden they place on the civilization’s available resources can’t be supported any longer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The only way to resolve that conflict is to allow some of the capital to be converted to waste, so that its maintenance costs drop to zero and any useful resources locked up in the capital can be put to other uses. Human beings being what they are, the conversion of capital to waste generally isn’t carried out in a calm, rational manner; instead, kingdoms fall, cities get sacked, ruling elites are torn to pieces by howling mobs, and the like. If a civilization depends on renewable resources, each round of capital destruction is followed by a return to relative stability and the cycle begins all over again; the history of imperial China is a good example of how that works out in practice. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If a civilization depends on nonrenewable resources for essential functions, though, destroying some of its capital yields only a brief reprieve from the crisis of maintenance costs. Once the nonrenewable resource base tips over into depletion, there’s less and less available each year thereafter to meet the remaining maintenance costs, and the result is the stairstep pattern of decline and fall so familiar from history:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>each crisis leads to a round of capital destruction, which leads to renewed stability, which gives way to crisis as the resource base drops further. Here again, human beings being what they are, this process isn’t carried out in a calm, rational manner; the difference here is simply that kingdoms keep falling, cities keep getting sacked, ruling elites are slaughtered one after another in ever more inventive and colorful ways, until finally contraction has proceeded far enough that the remaining capital can be supported on the available stock of renewable resources. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s a thumbnail sketch of the theory of catabolic collapse, the basic model of the decline and fall of civilizations that underlies the overall project of this blog. I’d encourage those who have questions about the details of the theory to go ahead and read the published version linked above; down the road a ways, I hope to publish a much more thoroughly developed version of the theory, but that project is still in the earliest stages just now. What I want to do here is to go a little more deeply into the social implications of the theory. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s common these days to hear people insist that our society is divided into two and only two classes, an elite class that receives all the benefits of the system, and everyone else, who bears all the burdens. The reality, in ours as in every other human society, is a great deal more nuanced. It’s true, of course, that the benefits move toward the top of the ladder of wealth and privilege and the burdens get shoved toward the bottom, but in most cases—ours very much included—you have to go a good long way down the ladder before you find people who receive no benefits at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There have admittedly been a few human societies in which most people receive only such benefits from the system as will enable them to keep working until they drop. The early days of plantation slavery in the United States and the Caribbean islands, when the average lifespan of a slave from purchase to death was under ten years, fell into that category, and so do a few others—for example, Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. These are exceptional cases; they emerge when the cost of unskilled labor drops close to zero and either abundant profits or ideological considerations make the fate of the laborers a matter of complete indifference to their masters. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Under any other set of conditions, such arrangements are uneconomical. It’s more profitable, by and large, to allow such additional benefits to the laboring class as will permit them to survive and raise families, and to motivate them to do more than the bare minimum that will evade the overseer’s lash. That’s what generates the standard peasant economy, for example, in which the rural poor pay landowners in labor and a share of agricultural production for access to arable land. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are any number of similar arrangements, in which the laboring classes do the work, the ruling classes allow them access to productive capital, and the results are divided between the two classes in a proportion that allows the ruling classes to get rich and the laboring classes to get by. If that sounds familiar, it should.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In terms of the distribution of labor, capital, and production, the latest offerings of today’s job market are indistinguishable from the arrangements between an ancient Egyptian landowner and the peasants who planted and harvested his fields. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The more complex a society becomes, the more intricate the caste system that divides it, and the more diverse the changes that are played on this basic scheme. A relatively simple medieval society might get by with four castes—the feudal Japanese model, which divided society into aristocrats, warriors, farmers, and a catchall category of traders, craftspeople, entertainers, and the like, is as good an example as any. A stable society near the end of a long age of expansion, by contrast, might have hundreds or even thousands of distinct castes, each with its own niche in the social and economic ecology of that society. In every case, each caste represents a particular balance between benefits received and burdens exacted, and given a stable economy entirely dependent on renewable resources, such a system can continue intact for a very long time.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Factor in the process of catabolic collapse, though, and an otherwise stable system turns into a fount of cascading instabilities. The point that needs to be grasped here is that social hierarchies are a form of capital, in the broad sense mentioned above. Like the other forms of capital included in the catabolic collapse model, social hierarchies facilitate the production and distribution of goods and services, and they have maintenance costs that have to be met. If the maintenance costs aren’t met, as with any other form of capital, social hierarchies are converted to waste; they stop fulfilling their economic function, and become available for salvage. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That sounds very straightforward. Here as so often, though, it’s the human factor that transforms it from a simple equation to the raw material of history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the maintenance costs of a civilization’s capital begin to mount up toward the point of crisis, corners get cut and malign neglect becomes the order of the day. Among the various forms of capital, though, some benefit people at one point on the ladder of social hierarchy more than people at other levels. As the maintenance budget runs short, people normally try to shield the forms of capital that benefit them directly, and push the cutbacks off onto forms of capital that benefit others instead. Since the ability of any given person to influence where resources go corresponds very precisely to that person’s position in the social hierarchy, this means that the forms of capital that benefit the people at the bottom of the ladder get cut first. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course this isn’t what you hear from Americans today, and it’s not what you hear from people in any society approaching catabolic collapse. When contraction sets in, as I noted here <a href=../../2014/09/dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html>in a post two weeks ago</a>, people tend to pay much more attention to whatever they’re losing than to the even greater losses suffered by others. The middle-class Americans who denounce welfare for the poor at the top of their lungs while demanding that funding for Medicare and Social Security remain intact are par for the course; so, for that matter, are the other middle-class Americans who denounce the admittedly absurd excesses of the so-called 1% while carefully neglecting to note the immense differentials of wealth and privilege that separate them from those still further down the ladder.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This sort of thing is inevitable in a fight over slices of a shrinking pie. Set aside the inevitable partisan rhetoric, though, and a society moving into the penumbra of catabolic collapse is a society in which more and more people are receiving less and less benefit from the existing order of society, while being expected to shoulder an ever-increasing share of the costs of a faltering system. To those who receive little or no benefits in return, the maintenance costs of social capital rapidly become an intolerable burden, and as the supply of benefits still available from a faltering system becomes more and more a perquisite of the upper reaches of the social hierarchy, that burden becomes an explosive political fact. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Every society depends for its survival on the passive acquiescence of the majority of the population and the active support of a large minority. That minority—call them the overseer class—are the people who operate the mechanisms of social hierarchy: the bureaucrats, media personnel, police, soldiers, and other functionaries who are responsible for maintaining social order. They are not drawn from the ruling elite; by and large, they come from the same classes they are expected to control; and if their share of the benefits of the existing order falters, if their share of the burdens increases too noticeably, or if they find other reasons to make common cause with those outside the overseer class against the ruling elite, then the ruling elite can expect to face the brutal choice between flight into exile and a messy death. The mismatch between maintenance costs and available resources, in turn, makes some such turn of events extremely difficult to avoid. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A ruling elite facing a crisis of this kind has at least three available options. The first, and by far the easiest, is to ignore the situation. In the short term, this is actually the most economical option; it requires the least investment of scarce resources and doesn’t require potentially dangerous tinkering with fragile social and political systems. The only drawback is that once the short term runs out, it pretty much guarantees a horrific fate for the members of the ruling elite, and in many cases, this is a less convincing argument than one might think. It’s always easy to find an ideology that insists that things will turn out otherwise, and since members of a ruling elite are generally well insulated from the unpleasant realities of life in the society over which they preside, it’s usually just as easy for them to convince themselves of the validity of whatever ideology they happen to choose. The behavior of the French aristocracy in the years leading up to the French Revolution is worth consulting in this context.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second option is to try to remedy the situation by increased repression. This is the most expensive option, and it’s generally even less effective than the first, but ruling elites with a taste for jackboots tend to fall into the repression trap fairly often. What makes repression a bad choice is that it does nothing to address the sources of the problems it attempts to suppress. Furthermore, it increases the maintenance costs of social hierarchy drastically—secret police, surveillance gear, prison camps, and the like don’t come cheap—and it enforces the lowest common denominator of passive obedience while doing much to discourage active engagement of people outside the elite in the project of saving the society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>A survey of the fate of the Communist dictatorships of Eastern Europe is a good antidote to the delusion that an elite with enough spies and soldiers can stay in power indefinitely. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That leaves the third option, which requires the ruling elite to sacrifice some of its privileges and perquisites so that those further down the social ladder still have good reason to support the existing order of society. That isn’t common, but it does happen; it happened in the United States as recently as the 1930s, when Franklin Roosevelt spearheaded changes that spared the United States the sort of fascist takeover or civil war that occurred in so many other failed democracies in the same era. Roosevelt and his allies among the very rich realized that fairly modest reforms would be enough to comvince most Americans that they had more to gain from supporting the system than they would gain by overthrowing it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>A few job-creation projects and debt-relief measures, a few welfare programs, and a few perp walks by the most blatant of the con artists of the preceding era of high finance, were enough to stop the unraveling of the social hierarchy, and restore a sense of collective unity strong enough to see the United States through a global war in the following decade. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course Roosevelt and his allies had huge advantages that any comparable project would not be able to duplicate today. In 1933, though it was hamstrung by a collapsed financial system and a steep decline in international trade, the economy of the United States still had the world’s largest and most productive industrial plant and some of the world’s richest deposits of petroleum, coal, and many other natural resources. Eighty years later, the industrial plant was abandoned decades ago in an orgy of offshoring motivated by short-term profit-seeking, and nearly every resource the American land once offered in abundance has been mined and pumped right down to the dregs. That means that an attempt to imitate Roosevelt’s feat under current conditions would face much steeper obstacles, and it would also require the ruling elite to relinquish a much greater share of its current perquisites and privileges than they did in Roosevelt’s day. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I could be mistaken, but I don’t think it will even be tried this time around. Just at the moment, the squabbling coterie of competing power centers that constitutes the ruling elite of the United States seems committed to an approach halfway between the first two options I’ve outlined. The militarization of US domestic police forces and the rising spiral of civil rights violations carried out with equal enthusiasm by both mainstream political parties fall on the repressive side of the scale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At the same time, for all these gestures in the direction of repression, the overall attitude of American politicians and financiers seems to be that nothing really that bad can actually happen to them or the system that provides them with their power and their wealth. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They’re wrong, and at this point it’s probably a safe bet that a great many of them will die because of that mistake. Already, a large fraction of Americans—probably a majority—accept the continuation of the existing order of society in the United States only because a viable alternative has yet to emerge. As the United States moves closer to catabolic collapse, and the burden of propping up an increasingly dysfunctional status quo bears down ever more intolerably on more and more people outside the narrowing circle of wealth and privilege, the bar that any alternative has to leap will be set lower and lower. Sooner or later, something will make that leap and convince enough people that there’s a workable alternative to the status quo, and the passive acquiescence on which the system depends for its survival will no longer be something that can be taken for granted. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s not necessary for such an alternative to be more democratic or more humane than the order that it attempts to replace. It can be considerably less so, so long as it imposes fewer costs on the majority of people and distributes benefits more widely than the existing order does. That’s why, in the last years of Rome, so many people of the collapsing empire so readily accepted the rule of barbarian warlords in place of the imperial government. That government had become hopelessly dysfunctional by the time of the barbarian invasions, centralizing authority in distant bureaucratic centers out of touch with current realities and imposing tax burdens on the poor so crushing that many people were forced to sell themselves into slavery or flee to depopulated regions of the countryside to take up the uncertain life of
<i>Bacaudae</i>, half guerrilla and half bandit, hunted by imperial troops whenever those had time to spare from the defense of the frontiers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By contrast, the local barbarian warlord might be brutal and capricious, but he was there on the scene, and thus unlikely to exhibit the serene detachment from reality so common in centralized bureaucratic states at the end of their lives. What’s more, the warlord had good reason to protect the peasants who put bread and meat on his table, and the cost of supporting him and his retinue in the relatively modest style of barbarian kingship was considerably less expensive than the burden of helping to prop up the baroque complexities of the late Roman imperial bureaucracy. That’s why the peasants and agricultural slaves of the late Roman world acquiesced so calmly in the implosion of Rome and its replacement by a patchwork of petty kingdoms. It wasn’t just that it was merely a change of masters; it was that in a great many cases, the new masters were considerably less of a burden than the old ones had been. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
We can expect much the same process to unfold in North America as the United States passes through its own trajectory of decline and fall. Before tracing the ways that process might work out, though, it’s going to be necessary to sort through some common misconceptions, and that requires us to examine the ways that ruling elites destroy themselves. We’ll cover that next week. </div>

I'm not suggesting anything at all along these lines, but it is interesting to note that both the national carriers here Qantas and Virgin - I believe and am happy to be corrected - announced losses recently.<br><br>Yes, "The middle-class Americans who denounce welfare for the poor at the top of their lungs" this rubbish goes on here too. Dole bludgers is the common term here and what fascinates me is that the amount spent on unemployment welfare is only about one sixth or one seventh that of pensions. At the same time it might be worth mentioning that baby boomers have control of the largest chunk of the wealth in this country. It is not a good look.<br><br>They also are some of the biggest recipients of welfare in the form of tax free superannuation and also negative gearing on property benefits. Oh yeah, once you get a glimpse of just how stacked against you the system is as a younger person, the best response is to take your bat and ball and refuse to play. Oh yeah, I'm grumpy about those two issues and outside of a few economics articles no one is mentioning them. But some poor soul who lost their job because the minor amount of subsidies the car manufacturing industry here received (which pales in comparison to the above two examples) is somehow a dole bludger. Oh yeah, it's not going to end well.<br><br>Wasn't there some issue recently in the US regarding reneging on promises for veterans health care costs or am I imagining that? <br><br>The other metric that I've noticing in recent times is that surveillance of domestic populations by governments seems to be on the increase. Truly the Internet is 99.999999% dull stuff. Good luck to them, but it is worth mentioning that such systems don't come cheap. Silly waste of time anyway as all nefarious people will do is simply send a letter or meet up face to face to discuss matters.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c630007266917529473 title="comment permalink">9/17/14, 7:59 PM</a><br><br>

You made the issues of resource depletion and pollution central to your analysis, exactly what I tell my students is the distinguishing feature of ecological economics. In particular, I found the inclusion of waste into your model very interesting. Other models of the economy ignore waste or don't treat it the way you do. It's either theoretically impossible (the supposed efficiency of the invisible hand of the market), an externality ("not my problem"), or an evil inefficiency to be deplored and eliminated. It's not treated as an integral part of the system, even if any environmentally based analysis of an economy as a system includes waste in the form of trash and pollution as an inevitable output of an industrial process.<br><br>The one aspect of the model that I found puzzling is that while you made the cessation of maintenance of capital in order to convert it into waste for the purpose of "balancing the books" an essential part of collapse, I couldn't find the extension of the ecological metaphor that would entail converting the waste from physical capital into resources that I expected from your writings about a salvage economy. Is that something you hadn't considered a decade ago? If so, do you plan on adding to an updated version of the model?<br><br>@Tom Hopkins: We wish Iraq were Gaul. That's a territory conquered when Rome was on the upswing. Instead, I want to point out that the last major addition to the Roman Empire was Mespotamia, almost exactly the same territory as modern Iraq. It was also one of the first territories lost during the contraction of the empire. Ponder that coincidence, if you dare.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c8617421566197826016 title="comment permalink">9/17/14, 8:10 PM</a><br><br>

Let's say you're a Puerto Rican living in the Bronx (this is just an example--I'm not trying to pick on Puerto Ricans). When times get tough, almost anything "Whitey" does is going to be seen as more brutal and capricious than anything done by one of your local leaders. This would apply even to gestures that Whitey thinks are olive branches, or even attempts to help ("humanitarian efforts"). Just ask the people of Iraq whether they perceive Whitey's bungled attempts to "help" as brutal or capricious. <br><br>If the US bureaucracy can bungle things that badly in Iraq now, I can only imagine what they'll be churning out after a few rounds of crisis and collapse. <br><br>Now, as far as my example, lest I be misinterpreted as stating that people will automatically behave like racists (of course some will, but not all), my only point was that people get very tribal, especially in times of stress. It's just human nature. Any other ethnic groups could have been substituted in my example, I just thought "Bronx vs. Whitey" paints a clear picture in our modern American context and thus makes an easy to grasp example. <br><br>What I think is far more likely, in light of the discussion a few posts back regarding the emergence of new ethnic groups, is that when warlords finally do come to the Bronx, the definition of MY PEOPLE will be much more inclusive. I expect that anybody--white, black or brown--who walks around dressed like the "external proletariat" (that saggy garb so despised by Kunstler) and talks like one too will be just fine. In that day it might be a bad idea to walk around in a three-piece suit. Probably just as dangerous as it once was to walk around the barbarian lands speaking perfect Latin in whatever garb the Roman senators wore back then.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c6541646969409846169 title="comment permalink">9/17/14, 8:11 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks. While reading it I was reminded of a piece I copied from a favorite author some years ago which seems appropriate to this weeks post:<br><br> Kennaston searched his pockets. After a moment he produced a dollar bill, and showed her the Eagle on it.<br> “There,” he said gravely, “is the original of the Woods Eagle, Do you remember what shakespeare observes as to this very Eagle?”<br> Miss Hugonin shook her small head till it glittered in the sunlight like a topaz. She cared no more for Shakespeare than does the average woman, and she was never quite comfortable when he was alluded to.<br> “He says,” Mr. Kennaston quoted, solemnly: <br> “The Eagle suffers little birds to sing,<br> And is not careful what they mean thereby,<br> Knowing that with the shadow of his wing<br> He can at pleasure still their melody.”<br><br> “That’s nonsense,” said Margaret. “I haven’t the least idea what your talking about, and I don’t believe you have either.”<br> He waved the dollar bill with a heroical gesture.<br> “Here,” he asserted, “is the Eagle. And by the little birds, I have not a doubt that Shakespeare meant charity and independence and kindliness and truth, and the rest of the standard virtues. That is, anyhow, as plausible as the interpretation of the average commentator. the presence of money chills these little birds, - ah, it’s lamentable, no doubt, but it is true.”<br> “I don’t believe it,” said Margaret, again, because, of course, that fact had always appeared to her quite to establish the worthlessness of any possible contention.<br> But now his hobby, rowelled by opposition, was spurred to Pegasean, flights.<br> “We cringe to the Eagle!” said he. “Eh, well, why not? The Eagle is very powerful and very cruel. In the Far South yonder, the Eagle has penned over a million children in his factories, where day by day he drains youth and health and life itself out of their tired bodies; in sweat shops, men and women are toiling for the Eagle, giving their lives for the pittance that he grudges them; in countless mines and mills, the Eagle is trading human lives for coal and flour; in Wall street yonder, the Eagle is juggling as he elects with all of life’s necessaries. Look whither you may, men die that the Eagle may grow fat. So the Eagle thrives, and daily the rich grow richer and more powerful, and the end ---”<br> Kennaston paused, staring into vacancy:<br> “Eh, well,” said he, with a smile and a snap of his fingers, “the end rest upon the knees of the gods. But there must be and end some day, with a quite glorious smash up all around, and such heroic havoc as will find me , I hope, already snugly tucked into a comfortable coffin. My faith in this revolution’s inevitability, you see, is qualified by my sense of being just the sort of person that revolutionist kill first of all. Yes, very certainly the day will come when every big bank balance will be the owner’s death warrant, and when the Eagle, as the populace elliptically phrase it, will get his. But the day is not yet, and meanwhile, you cannot blame us if we cringe to the Eagle that is master of the world. It is human nature to cringe to its master: And while human nature is not always an admirable thing, it is, I believe, rather widely distributed.”<br><br> “The Eagles Shadow”<br> James Branch Cabell<br> 1904<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c2251940649325375295 title="comment permalink">9/17/14, 10:07 PM</a><br><br>

The general consensus seems to be that we're already at unacceptable levels of militarization and criminalization. I remember Rodney King, and it was divisive (for white people at least) at that time. Nowadays, it seems to me that even most white people think the Ferguson shooting was insane (either that or my circle is more homogenous). Though I must say that "more repression" can work well for a long time IF you have true believers and keep it insulated from the larger world, like North Korea. The USA does not have that, so not gonna happen.<br><br>That said, I think we'd have to have another turn of the wheel for things to get desperate enough for revolution. Another 2008 style drop, in other words. I do think the ground is much more fertile than I ever expected to see it - the references to the guillotine just haven't stopped online. It's in the vein of a dark joke, but 10 years ago it would have been considered tasteless at best to call for their heads, and these jokes tend to get serious when things get rough.<br><br>P.S. I do appreciate that you've pointed out that most jobs are basically peasant jobs. I realized I was a peasant about a year ago. One thing you haven't touched on explicitly that I have noticed - it's not that "wages haven't kept up with productivity", which is the usual news headline (a rather vague complaint, really). It's very specific - RENT. In many places across the US, rent is the worst issue. Medical costs, education costs (great way to cut out the rungs of the ladder, or alternately bind people to bad jobs), those are serious, deep issues. But I think housing costs are THE most serious issue for the lower classes (at least the urban lower class).<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c8870430514573857175 title="comment permalink">9/18/14, 12:29 AM</a><br><br>

Refreshing to the mind:) Mostly because I feel the topics discussed here are really the ones that need to be talked about.<br><br>Just a little addition to today's post:<br>I don't know how much you are familiar with the present and past of Hungary (I'm Hungarian), but for me there really seems to be a similarity between the move of Roosevelt and that of Kádár János, former socialist-communist leader in Hungary - until the collapse of the Soviet Union. He too conciliated the masses and even gained their sympathy by ensuring a relatively good quality of life for the majority of the population - by accumulating a huge debt -, by giving a stop, or considerably lowering the number of prosecutions, executions and any kind of elimination of unwanted people, and maybe even by setting his own 'moderate' lifestyle as an example for other politicians. Of course, he did all that after suppressing the revolution of '56. And it was enough for the people. His slogan was: 'Who's not against us, is with us' Well, this maybe doesn't seem to be a very strong one at first glance, but if we know that the slogan of Rákosi Mátyás, communist leader of the '40s, it sounds rather appealing: 'Who's with us, is against us.' <br>That's why the Hungary of 70s-80's was considered as the 'most liveable barracks of the Soviet camp'<br><br><br>What I want to point out now, is that many people nowadays feel that... to put it simply, life was better at that time. But to be more precise, the 'democracy' of today is far more tyrannic than the 'communism' of that era, and if there were any (public) executions, or imprisonments, or work camps, it would be quite equivalent to the most nightmarish times of dictatorships. Of course it's not the case (for the moment) and maybe I'm exaggerating, but I myself feel and see that tendency in everyday life.<br><br>Ok, thanks for reading this.<br>Lovecraft otherwise is among my favorites too. His short stories are so much built up on the same structure and written in the same style that it bores me after a while, but his imagination and the pure expression of how small and meaningless the whole humanity is catches me from time to time. I can say it's even tranquilizing. <br><br>Looking forward to your other posts<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c2259193945131489136 title="comment permalink">9/18/14, 4:07 AM</a><br><br>

After years of bungled meddling by the US military-bureaucracy, it's not hard for me to see how, if I were an Iraqi citizen, I would welcome ISIS over the US military. I expect I wouldn't feel threatened by beheadings, because I would know they would never be done to me or my family. Those are reserved for "evil" Americans and Westerners, who "deserve it" anyway. <br><br>Lest we feel that we Westerners are not that tribal, to the point of evil, I think it's obvious that we are. Yet we don't notice how ripe our hypocrisy is. By and large, Americans don't care that Obama is killing children with drones (image flashes through mind- Obama playing pick-up basketball: warm and fuzzy). <br><br>He'd never do that to his OWN PEOPLE. It's the bad guys who do that, not us (image flashes through mind- black-garbed swordsman beheading American journalist: cold and prickly). These images are so emotionally potent, its nearly impossible to reverse them. But if I can reverse them, I think then I'd know how the average Iraqi citizen feels about Westerners and ISIS, from within their own shoes. <br><br>And what are we to make of the fact that Obama's Nobel peace prize is still on the books, and the even stranger fact that Westerners are joining ISIS? I think to me, it says that an unrecognized hypocrisy abounds among the Western elite and that this hypocrisy is quite well recognized among the Western lower classes. <br><br>* * *<br>And on another note, getting back to the example in my previous comment, I think "localism" is going to play a much larger role in our future dark age. I think that's almost impossible for us to conceive of as we live in today's hyper-mobile America where nobody is "from" anywhere. Today, the culture of Dallas is indistinguishable from that of Orlando. There was a time, and I think there will be again, when finding out where somebody is from will play a much larger role in sizing them up. We only rely on race so much today because it is plastered on our faces and its historical association with locality.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c3036992906412213891 title="comment permalink">9/18/14, 4:35 AM</a><br><br>

Maybe my parents did, but we owned our modest home mortgage free and there was no debt. As a paperboy, I still collected fees door-to-door, and felt very rich with my $12-20/week, and I remember my mom would check off every item on the grocery bill as she put food away, to make sure it was correct.<br><br>So on my walk, I imagined going back to that world, before everyone was in debt, and poor just meant having little money, rather than having affordable credit card minimum payments.<br><br>But really it would feel like an impoverishment, to lose access to so much knowledge online. I have no interest in a smart phone, but Wikipedia for facts, and Facebook and blogs for politics, I'm sure I wouldn't want to give that up, to go back to the dark ages of pre-electronic communication.<br><br>As bad as much nonsense there is on the internet now, 95% can be fact checked in a google search, or at least given some context. How did people survive without being able to check facts on their own?<br><br>Yes, libraries could be, and can be again, the source of knowledge, and maybe someday when the internet's stability starts failing, a 100 million copies of the last version of Wikipedia will be downloaded to local libraries? Certainly it'll never be printed. I wonder what subset will be most useful to readers of the future? And maybe local intranets and Wiki software will continue to document local history?<br><br>I like the idea of honest dishonesty, that is to say, I know our path is dishonest (unsustainable), but the problem isn't the dishonesty, only forgetting about it.

They won't last. <br><br>Adamatari, exactly -- the US is too fractious, too fractured, and too heavily armed for repression to work well; thus the way that it's mostly focusing on the bottom of the ladder, when several rungs up is where the real challenge is taking shape. <br><br>Primitive, that's an interesting question that I need to research. At a guess, if you can provide necessary goods and services to people under the table, i.e., without the system taking a cut, you'll do fairly well.

Agreed about the zombies -- I suspect one of the reasons I find the whole zombie phenomenon so dreary is that I'm used to grappling with the future we're actually facing. <br><br>Paul, when people in another country are making an important decision about the future, I think it's a great idea for Americans to shut up and let them make that decision themselves. I may not be able to stuff a sock in the collective mouth of my overopinionated countrymen, and I'll be very interested to see how the referendum comes out, but it's up to the people of Scotland to make up their own minds on the matter. <br><br>Ed, what did you expect?

Most of today's rich don't seem to have gotten that message. " <br><br>Quite right! While there's multiple reasons to explain this factor obviously, one in particular I've been pondering lately is the idea increasing amounts of computerization and automation will more or less make labor defunct. It's something I touched on in the last comment thread, but I believe it's increasingly on the mindsets of the rich. It's in fact an increasing obsession with all quarters of life, including a lot of the "liberal" publications I subscribe to who are earnestly talking about the "end of labor" and what we must do to cope with it. You may have noticed the new threat from the business owners is that if you dare take collective action to "raise the price of your labor", they'll just automate your jobs away if it can't be outsourced. This is especially true during the recent fast food strikes/walk outs that hit the nation about a week ago. Perhaps they think in the long run, they don't need the "masses" as computers will be able to generate all the wealth for them without having to give any of it to the pesky poor masses. There's some who take it so far that they think drones, robotic soldiers/cops, etc. will make revolts by the masses impossible. <a href=http://qz.com/185945/drones-are-about-to-upheave-society-in-a-way-we-havent-seen-in-700-years/#/ rel=nofollow>Here</a> is a good example of that type of thinking.

I think the entertainers fit into various classes. I recall, however, a story of a handicapped girl who was sent out to the people living by the river (probably the burakumin outcasts), who wandered around and performed as entertainers, like the Roma are known to do. Many forms of entertainment are seen as low-class here, and with notable exceptions, the movies are rather chintzy.<br>(Please forgive my nitpicking! I'm in awe of the information you put together, and I keep visiting your site because I always gain new insights here.)<br>The Tokugawa rule was a very sophisticated attempt to circumvent corruption by accumulation of capital. It produced a long-lasting peaceful society in which the arts flourished, and it was admirably sustainable. But there were problems. This was a tyrannical, top-down society, and some of the later rulers were downright insane. I recall a story about one who loved dogs so much that anyone who harmed a dog, even to save a child, would be put to death. These kinds of episodes wear down your support base. Moreover, money did accumulate with the merchants at the bottom, and its influence seeped through society in its insidious way. The samurai at the top were poor. They received a stipend of rice, but in the prosperous peaceful era, rice production increased and the price plummeted, and the samurai, who were allowed the privilege of swaggering around with two swords, might have to sell those swords to survive. They found ways to marry merchants into the family to attain the prosperity that eluded them in that system.<br>The hard-working farmers of the second class were pretty well off regarding basic needs, but a trip up Mt. Fuji with a guide, for example, would take one year's worth of their earnings.<br>Apparently, a great deal of frustration built up throughout the society. I don't know the details of the final years of the Tokugawa rule, but it was outside pressure from America to open up to capitalism that seems to have been what caused it to collapse. The Tokugawas had been associated with Buddhism, so during the collapse, a lot of pent-up rage was displayed in lopping off the heads of stone Buddhas. (I was atop Mt. Fuji the other day, and there were a number of stone Buddhas, all headless, but still gathering coins around their feet.) Then they declared the Emperor to be Japan's ruler and Shinto to be supreme over Buddhism. <br>(Thus began the age of State Shinto, in which the ruling elites used it as justification for their actions, but as a Shinto priestess, I must note that as a folk religion, Shinto is much broader and deeper than that.)<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c5269404832526522776 title="comment permalink">9/18/14, 9:19 AM</a><br><br>

Most people were suffering but not, as you might guess, the upper crust and church. Combine that with day-to-day indignities and outrages inflicted on the lower rungs (like routine sexual harrassment of peasant wives and girls by the clergy) and you had a highly combustible situation. <br><br>Abandoned military weapons and ammunition were thick on the ground and so the country folk helped themselves. But informants among them did what informants do. So farms were subject to police inspection, farmers to interrogation and intimidation.<br><br>Predictably, you might say, mayhem wasn't far behind. People had had their fill, they took to the streets and town squares, howling mobs ransacked warehouses and government offices. <br><br>I suppose that the elites had a healthy sense of self preservation because reforms were made, the abuses inflicted by the clergy declined, and all in all, things improved. But it was close. <br><br>Because in the mix there was a flourishing leftist movement. As you might say, an alternative to the status quo had presented itself, taking real risks with police and bully-boys in the employ of the boss-class. <br><br>But I'll bet that if I recounted any of this to any modern business and political leader as a lesson for today, they would scoff.

My Dad was a middle school teacher for 30 years. He gave that book to me. He always posited that slavery would have disappeared of its own accord, due to economics. Owning a slave was much like owing an ox. (Social Justice Bloggers- just chill. No, people are NOT animals) You had to feed it, treat its illnesses, shelter it, deal with its offspring. Buying labor was just far more economically efficient, especially with the influx of immigrants, and there were no social responsibilities.<br><br>"...it happened in the United States as recently as the 1930s, when Franklin Roosevelt spearheaded changes that spared the United States the sort of fascist takeover or civil war that occurred in so many other failed democracies in the same era."<br><br>They say FDR saved Capitalism from itself. I think the greatest threat, domestically, to the old order was not fascism, per se, but socialism. FDR stemmed that impulse. But a repeat, on the downside of the Hubbert curve, seems unlikely, even setting aside the gridlock in Congress (FDR had a compliant House and Senate).<br><br><br>"Already, a large fraction of Americans—probably a majority—accept the continuation of the existing order of society in the United States only because a viable alternative has yet to emerge."<br><br>The Tea Party was accepted, because it could be co-opted by TPTB, and because it did not upset the apple-cart of what the American Project was supposed to be about. Occupy was repressed because it picked the scab off the unresolved question of the concentration of wealth and power. <br><br>A Tea-Partier was likely to question the power of illegitimate "union bosses" in securing public pensions, for example. The Occupier would defend those. But who did the po-po tear-gas and pepper spray? Not those nice, baby boomers in their silly tri-point hats. It was the dirty hippies. Yes, repression is, and will be, in full force.<br><br>You have rightly criticized Occupy's lack of direction and structure. But I think, some day in the future, an alternative from the left may emerge to compete with the Ayn Randian right. There will be no FDR, nor the resources, to chart a middle course, and then "Katie, bar the door!" as we say.<br><br>I look forward to your forthcoming detailed work on the catabolic collapse theory.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c7087118052751534275 title="comment permalink">9/18/14, 10:58 AM</a><br><br>

I suggest to you that, when resource depletion becomes a more serious problem (and it will, you are correct on that), the US and other nations can and likely will take steps to wring a vast amount of waste out of our societies, while also prioritizing the investment of remaining resources and capital into areas most necessary for survival. If that means we roll back our personal consumption to 1950's levels, that will be a lot short of catabolic collapse. based on projections I have read, there is ample margin for such action even now.

Sorry!<br><br>In my line of work, local organic agriculture, I can definitely see the burdens of the current system weighing down on farmers and the various young people (woofers, apprentices) who are looking to continue in this field.<br><br>There are various reasons why so many of the new, small local farms that are popping up now focus on veggies. Veggies don't need much land, and depending on scale, not much equipment, etc. But there is also one other big reason: vegetables are pretty much completely unregulated by the government. <br><br>Get into the domain of animal husbandry, and you're in a whole other world that is drowning in red tape. You want to raise ruminants in a grass fed system, then sell the meat to your neighbors? Nope, sorry, you have to send the animals to a USDA slaughterhouse, (which in many cases, might be more than dozens to even a hundred miles away) and pay steep processing fees to support the staff of that facility and the various government inspectors it employs. The end result is the small farmer has to sell his steak for $16 to $20 a pound just to break even and recoup processing costs. Never mind the sustainability of shipping animals around on highways.<br><br>I myself like dairying a lot. In my part of the world (rainy northeast), it can very ecologically sound, and a very small scale dairy can be a pretty sweet thing. Again though, the problem is the same. There is no scale in the regulations; a 300 cow dairy or a 6 cow dairy have to play by the same rules. I want to hand milk 2 to 6 cows into a bucket, sell some milk or some butter or cream or something? Nope, have to build an inspected milk house/parlor (with equipment, prolly cost somewhere between $12,000 to $20,000), and that would allow me just to sell raw milk, and only from the farm. I want to do value adding with the milk? Ha, forget it, more expensive equipment and a separate creamery room/building. Oh, and all of this fancy equipment sucks up huge amounts of electricity. Great. I could try doing something black market style, selling raw milk and dairy illegally for a bit of cash and keeping it hush hush, but when you're a landless, wandering youngin like me that can be awful hard to setup. <br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c7614032658444070934 title="comment permalink">9/18/14, 11:11 AM</a><br><br>

Problem is, once you scale up sustainability goes out the window, the workload becomes insane, and in general I've learned its just not worth it. Everyone in this line of work is frustrated by all this stuff, and is eager for some change in the system. It really highlights how the system is rigged to work against particular groups. I also find it very interesting the effect it has on the all of the various young people that woof or apprentice on farms; a lot of them come from the liberal/progressive mindset, but after they are exposed to this stuff it rather sours their opinion of the government and current system.<br><br>As for myself, I'm at a crossroads. I finish my apprenticeship at the current dairy I'm at toward the end of this year and I'm faced with an interesting choice; there are various postings for positions on middling sized organic dairies, 20 to 40 cows usually. Even at that scale though, the energy and material inputs needed are great, as is the need for diesel tractors and their various implements. Location is also worrying for a lot of these places are located out in the middle of nowhere and are completely car dependent. Its just not going to end well. Meanwhile, right now I live near a small, walkable city that has a thriving farmers market as well as lots of agriculture going on all around it. I have the skills now, so should I just hunker down there, ditch the car, get whatever work I can, and just wait for something to give? I imagine we are not to far from the point when a lot of the current food regulations regarding small farmers will have to be ignored or discarded out of sheer necessity.<br><br>I guess I could commute from there to a farm job in the countryside, but that doesn't sit well with my conscious, and its bad for the Earth and the future.

Now, as then, people have been disappointed for a long time, and many are despairing. They are becoming more fearful for their long-term economic future. And such fears can have severe consequences."<br><br>"There is a name for the despair that has been driving discontent – and not only in Russia and Ukraine – since the financial crisis. That name is the 'new normal,' referring to long-term diminished prospects for economic growth, a term popularized by Bill Gross, a founder of bond giant PIMCO."<br><br>"The despair felt after 1937 led to the emergence of similar new terms then, too. “Secular stagnation,” referring to long-term economic malaise, is one example. The word secular comes from the Latin saeculum, meaning a generation or a century. The word stagnation suggests a swamp, implying a breeding ground for virulent dangers. In the late 1930s, people were also worrying about discontent in Europe, which had already powered the rise of Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini."<br><br>[...]<br>"Some will doubt the importance of economic growth. Maybe, many say, we are too ambitious and ought to enjoy a higher quality of life with more leisure. Maybe they are right."<br><br>"But the real issue is self-esteem and the social-comparison processes that psychologist Leon Festinger observed as a universal human trait. Though many will deny it, we are always comparing ourselves with others, and hoping to climb the social ladder. People will never be happy with newfound opportunities for leisure if it seems to signal their failure relative to others." </i><br><br>http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/robert-j--shiller-worries-that-too-many-people-are-losing-confidence-in-the-future---and-in-democratic-institutions<br><br>Also, in regards to catabolism, it seems that the hoarding of income by the rich has caused local tax revenues to plummet, no doubt leading to the furloughed workers and dilapidated infrastructure seen around the country (not to mention the police seizures of property that's been getting so much attention). As I recall, this was a problem in the late Roman Empire as well:<br><br><i>The widening gap between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else has been matched by a slowdown in state tax revenue, according to a report being released Monday by Standard &amp; Poor’s.<br><br>Even as income has accelerated for the affluent, it has barely kept pace with inflation for most other people.

People tend to get very annoyed when they undertake risky activities only to have the arrangements changed after the fact. As a strange side - but related - issue, during Melbourne's notorious underworld war when I believe up to 40 crims were shot dead in short order, that was one of the primary drivers.<br><br>Who would have thought that crims would cheat each other? Unfortunately for them it had real world consequences. <br><br>For anyone that is interested in such things it was chronicled by the crime author and journalist John Silvester in his Underbelly books.<br><br>Oh yeah, superannuation funds are already in the stock market - up to their eyeballs.<br><br>What is interesting about it is that the fees being charged are apparently in the order of 1.5 to 2% of the asset value of the fund every year. Many people are witnessing negative returns, but because it so far off in the future, it hasn't dawned on most what is going on.<br><br>Incidentally if I were 60, I could retire today with pension benefits and tax free income (or lump sum) from my superannuation fund. Now because I'm younger than that, they've lifted the retirement age to 70. Me thinks that there won't be any pension or tax free income by then either, but that is just speculation.<br><br>Hi Kylie,<br><br>Yeah, many thanks for the comment. I'm aware of the instalment warrants that they use to achieve gearing in superannuation funds. I can't honestly say that I understand what these are or how they work, but the fees for setting them up are meaty.<br><br>You are quite correct too as I felt the exact same thing when that change happened. Super funds were never meant to have gearing, that was one of the main selling points.<br><br>I probably wasn't very clear in my original comment. I was actually speculating about the possibility of directing those retirement funds into people’s primary residence to prop up the property market. This is not possible under current rules as investment by super funds in property must relate to an arm’s length rental or business real property. Chilling stuff, huh?<br><br>Last recession in the early 1990's - yeah, I copped it in the neck during that one - holiday houses were the first to go. I'm noticing a trend towards the more expensive of these turning over right now.

The Soviet Union has fallen, and now you're free -- free, that is, to starve in the streets while your country's wealth is pumped dry to keep other countries' economies afloat. That sort of thing very easily gives democracy a bad name.<br><br>I am reminded of a great quote from the Saker:<br><br>“I will never forget the words of a Pakistani Ambassador to the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva in 1992 who, addressing an assembly of smug western diplomats, said the following words: ‘you seem to believe that you won the Cold War, but did you ever consider the possibility that what has really happened is that the internal contradictions of communism caught up with communism before the internal contradictions of capitalism could catch up with capitalism?’. <br><br>Needless to say, these prophetic words were greeted by a stunned silence and soon forgotten. But the man was, I believe, absolutely right: capitalism has now reached a crisis as deep as the one affecting the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and there is zero chance to reform or otherwise change it. Regime change is the only possible outcome.”<br><br>The Archdruid’s observation also reminds me of how the failed experiment in plutocracy, crony capitalism and IMF sponsored looting misnomered as democracy during the Yeltsin years has soured the Russian people on democracy, to the point where Russians often refer to democracy (demokratiya in Russian) as dermokratiya (polite translation: “rule by excrement”). One could hear similar sentiments frequently and openly expressed in Weimar Germany, which is one of the reasons why the National Socialists were able to come to power. The incompetent and clueless political establishment of the Weimar Republic, which was already viewed with suspicion because many people believed it had been imposed by hostile foreign powers in the wake of the Great War, had already discredited itself by the late 1920’s. By the early 1930’s, it was merely a question of which totalitarian political movement would win the struggle for power: the Nazis or the Communists, both of which were evil and destructive by their very nature.<br><br>I believe it is only a matter of time before we see the pitchforks come out in earnest, especially since as been pointed out on this blog, the US government has made the appalling stupid mistake of training hundreds of thousands of young men in the latest guerilla warfare and counter-insurgency techniques, then cut them loose while denying them the health care and other benefits they were promised. I personally know several veterans who served in Iraq and/or Afghanistan and who are either homeless or barely making it in low-wage dead end jobs, and many of them are bitter about the way they got screwed over and treated like garbage by the very government that sent them to fight.

You might be able to change overlords (thus giving you the illusion of change), but your status as a glorified serf doesn't really change (do what you're told and make us money or else.....). What's the difference, only that one has the illusion of freedom in our current system. <br>As for rent (for whomever mentioned that above), I do. not. know. how working people live in any city anymore. I cannot believe what rents are - and I'm not talking New York here - I'm talking places that are an hour (or more) outside of a major city. $850 for a crappy 2-bedroom apartment is what a friend of the family is paying - and she is a ferry ride and a 40-minute drive (in no traffic) from Seattle. <br>Finally, I'm glad, JMG, that you mentioned the middle-class who screams about welfare, et al. One of my pet peeves is looking at photos of Tea Party gatherings, of all the white, grey-haired people there (like, 80% or more), and I just want to scream "Let's talk about Social Security and Medicare!" According to the Urban Institute, a non-partisan research institute, a two-earner couple receiving an average wage — $44,600 per spouse in 2012 dollars — and turning 65 in 2010 would have paid $722,000 into Social Security and Medicare and can be expected to take out $966,000 in benefits. So, this couple will be paid about one-third more in benefits than they paid in taxes. The payout on Medicare is estimated to be three times what has been paid in. (The resulting article/summary can be viewed at http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/feb/01/medicare-and-social-security-what-you-paid-what-yo/). I just wish the Tea Party would be honest about these facts when discussing "cutting government spending". ("OK, let's start with you!")<br>My friend teaches at a high school with a very high poverty rate. They can't give homework at her school because 80% of the students have outside jobs that they work (at an average of 20 hours a week) to help their families pay rent and buy food. Yes, there are poor people who scam the system. There are also a lot of middle-class people who get more in benefits than they will ever put in (and I say that as a white, middle-class person). <br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c2989688879553447053 title="comment permalink">9/18/14, 4:23 PM</a><br><br>

Have you (or any of you other JMG fans) heard of Paul Fussell's 1983 book "Class"? Fussell divides Americans into 9 different socio-economic classes. He considers the top 0.1 percent, or maybe even the top 0.01 percent, the "Top Out of Sight" -- they're so wealthy that the general public hardly ever comes face to face with them.

I think we're beginning to see the emergence of a new category, what I call the "Subsistence Class" -- they won't be affluent, but they'll have more education, social connections, and "know-how" than the underclass, maybe even becoming good practitioners of "green wizardry" habits. I still think you will have an affluent "middle-class", though it will likely be much smaller than it was for much of the last 50 years.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c583493800138008568 title="comment permalink">9/18/14, 5:02 PM</a><br><br>

This is a classic Astroturf movement created by right wing media personalities and corporate funded think tanks and bankrolled by the usual suspects (Koch brothers, Grover Norquist, etc). These people have hijacked much of the Republican Party and many Republican politicians who might otherwise disagree with them are nonetheless compelled to kiss up to them if they want to get elected. This helps fuel a pseudoconservative echo chamber on the Right which makes it nearly impossible to reform the Republican Party from within.

However, the mistake is that the US is not, in fact, Rome; rather, the US is Byzantium, playing the part of Byzantium to the British Empire as Byzantium was to Rome. Washington is not Rome; London is the modern Rome, and Washington is Constantinople.<br><br>We are in the early third century of the American Empire; the US is and always has been an Empire from day one. Some date the origins of our Empire to the Louisiana Purchase, or the Mexican Cession, or the Spanish-American War… but in truth, we have been an Empire since the very first. As with Constantinople, the New Rome built from scratch, so too was Washington a New London (though the financial elements of The City remain in New York).<br><br>To cut to the chase, we are potentially in our End Game. As our Phocas, Obama, has sought to be a populist, and sought to brought aid to the groaning masses oppressed by the aristocracy, so the counter-revolution against him, now as then Christian and yet Aristocratic, will bring in our own Heraclius, who will in the end seek to lay the ancient enemy – Russia, our own Persian Empire – low. And in so doing shall bleed both nations dry, leaving us all wide open for the victories of the Arabs, as they had at Yarmouk in 636. Will wee witness Washington being besieged by Arab forces 40 years thereafter? Doubtful, but stranger things have happened. After all, history does not repeat, but it does rhyme.<br><br>I expect the Republicans to hold the House and take the Senate in 2014, and then hold both and go on to take the Presidency in 2016, with their Heraclius, an Aristocratic Christian boldly taking office with his modern Christian icons at the fore, as Heraclius sailed to Constantinople with an icon at the prow.<br><br>I expect the Republicans thereafter will undo everything that Phocas/Obama sought to do to help the Plebes against the Patricians, and their Elite Corporatist allies will be able to run roughshod over the masses. Expect massive social and economic dislocations, with ever widening gap between the haves and the have-nots and the final destruction of a functional middle class.<br><br>War against and the final conquest of Russia will be at the forefront of the Republican movement. The War will of course be used as an excuse to further militarize police forces, and events like Ferguson will become commonplace, as the dispossessed and desperate turn into modern-day bacaudae. The Internet, due to “Russian” interference, will be limited to military, government, and corporate use, with more controls and censorship than today’s China; this is to ensure that social media remains outside of the hands of rebels and malcontents.<br><br>Victory over Russia is a given, provided they do not go for the nuclear option, in which case everyone loses. Operations could take anywhere from four to eight years, depending on how low-grade, brushfire, and proxy level the war is kept. But it will drain all the last wealth of both nations, and the Russians, ever experienced at fighting a hard retreat, will ensure that there is no loot to use, burning and destroying their own factories and fields even as the Americans move forward. Russia may survive in the East, as a rump state, with the West occupied by American and allied forces.<br><br>America will then again be the seeming Unipower the Hawks always hoped to be, but it will be a hollow victory. Financially ruined, with all the remaining treasure held in the hands of an elite corporatist aristocracy beholden to no laws and liable to pay no taxes, the masses of the citizenry beggared and either reduced to wage slavery or banditry, the Empire will be as a vast and once great tree, rotted within to the bark and ready to fall with the least blow.<br><br>And then the Empire will reap the whirlwind it fed in the creation of the Mujahedeen and Al-Qaeda and ISIS… of course, by that time the modern American Heraclius will have retired to some island to enjoy his ill-gotten gains…<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c4623573195801340293 title="comment permalink">9/18/14, 6:22 PM</a><br><br>

Dried foods, fabrics, in the form of blankets and other goods were collected in positioned warehouses against need such as a natural disaster. The services were an annual term of labor, working on the empire's roads or replacing rope suspension bridges, even working on public buildings, religious or the practically mundane like the warehouses. A common exhortation / greeting was something to the effect of "Don't be lazy!" for the industrious Incans.<br><br>Curiously enough the catholic priests that accompanied the conquistadors thought such foresight was a sin since it alleviated the suffering of the populace preventing them from an appreciation of Christ's suffering. <br><br>Can't say I care much for such Christian idiocy.

Interestingly these groups are working together with “pressure tactics” including stickering their vehicles with slogans (police cars, buses, fire trucks are all plastered with them). Coincidentally these signs use a red square design, which ironically recalls the widespread student protest movement of a few years back (les carrés rouges). The students were at considerable odds with the cops at the time; some incidents of mass arrest are still being resolved in the courts today… Now, are the cops possibly fishing for solidarity with the counter-culture 99% types?

Clearly the strategy has been to cut labour costs in an attempt to counter the rising operating costs, keeping in mind that fuel is just one of many stress points. Security has also become far more complex than it used to be. And still, so many people I know, from the point of view of entitlement to abundance, complain with indignation about how expensive it is to fly.

The problem with that, putting aside entirely the stomach-turning moral and spiritual bankruptcy of such a belief, is that our money is entirely a creature of the system that created it. Back in ancient Rome, at least the coinage was actually made from precious metals, however debased as time went on, that would still have some face value once the system collapsed. Our money's value is rather less substantial and entirely dependent on an energy-intensive system that must expand in order to properly maintain the standard of living. Even a very anemic growth-rate between .5-1% <i>per annum</i> is poison to the health of the system.<br><br>So what happens to the money when the economy actually starts actively contracting? While the individual units of currency themselves become more potent, it is only on account of its every-growing scarcity that it becomes so. And why does this happen? Because way too much of our hyper-expanded precious money-supply was pure credit with no real value backing it up. The sheer amount of vapor-money created rose dramatically in order to prevent the crash of six years ago from becoming a system-consuming contagion. But ultimately that only makes the system more unstable because each unit of precious money has even less real material value backing it up. <br><br>So when the system contracts and its time to render accounts, all that vapor-money just goes away into the nothingness from which it emerged. And this is nothing to anticipate with any sort of glee, because when a society based on nothing but money has that money vanish like a phantom in the night, all that's left is...nothing. And it is ghastly to even attempt imagining how a population with nothing in their heads and hearts as a result of a lifetime of worshiping this insubstantial phantom, is going to deal with there suddenly being nothing but...nothing.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c8078331714318658239 title="comment permalink">9/19/14, 6:12 AM</a><br><br>

Spain had provided many of Rome's preeminent generals and emperors but was let go without much of a fuss when Ataulfo the Visigoth was named a foederati of Rome and allowed to marry his captive Gala Placidia, the emperor's daughter. Spain's very civilized Roman population didn't raise much of a fuss about it either and were relieved when the Visigoths adopted Roman law and maintained the infrastructure as best they could. Visigoth and Iberian Roman together resisted the imposition of the authority of the successor of the Roman Empire, the Catholic Church, as long as they could, in some places well into the seventh century. (As late as the tenth century, a fight between bulls was arranged to settle the issue with one bull representing Rome and one bull the native population. The bull named Rome lost but Rome still triumphed)(Of course, the far older cult of the sacred bull never was extinguished and is celebrated on Sundays even today in Spain when the populace roars Ole' (oh God) with each pass of the sacrificial bull) The ferocity of the Inquisition was in no small part directed at the resistance of the local population to external control.<br>You might say that although the Roman imperium fell, Roman culture did not.

Like the other forms of capital included in the catabolic collapse model, social hierarchies facilitate the production and distribution of goods and services, and they have maintenance costs that have to be met. If the maintenance costs aren’t met, as with any other form of capital, social hierarchies are converted to waste; they stop fulfilling their economic function, and become available for salvage."<br><br>What is the maintenance costs? <br><br>For a hierarchy to function people in it need to either accept a roll passively, actively, or actively be looking for a roll in the hierarchy; people that are doing none of those things are not in the hierarchy. Without participants there is no hierarchy at all. Also, at least a portion of the participants need to be active, a purely passive hierarchy cannot respond creatively to changes in external conditions, and will rapidly be swept away by entropy; even aged hierarchies long past their creative phase need an ember of active participation to function at all.<br><br>What portion needs to be active depends on many factors, including the conditions the hierarchy must be able to respond to, the prowess of the active members, the weight of the passive members, the work load of maintaining the hierarchies.<br><br>To survive a hierarchy first needs to be able to do somethings that motivates at least some people to actively participate in it; and if those people cannot do those things alone then the hierarchy needs passive participants sufficient to do those things, which means it also needs to do somethings to motivate sufficient passive people to participate...<br><br>This could go on for a while, but basically a hierarchy needs to be able to motivate behavior. The easiest motivators to double down on are the motivators that build up as a hierarchy ages. Fancy toys are the preferred motivator of our culture.<br><br>If a critical motivator is in short supply, alternative motivators can be found (video games for example are more resource efficient fancy toys than yachts, but still adequately effective). Introducing a new motivator requires a new story, but a culture faces the 'germ resistance' problem using this approach (video games don't work on people who don't accept a couple of simple narrative hooks). Violence is a very effective and seemingly cheap motivator, but it isn't because motivating people to exercise violence is not cheap, not by a long shot.<br><br>If alternative motivators cannot be found, portions of the hierarchy will be insufficiently motivated to play out their rolls and the scope of the hierarchy will have to shrink, including the hierarchy's ability to do things, including (if they are not fortunate) continue providing motivators for remaining participants, until the hierarchy <br>has reduced down to a size that a stable source of motivation exists for.<br><br>Of course the shed members don't (all) just sit around reminiscing about the good old days. Their cost of being motivated by "anyone but those jerks" has dropped into the basement.<br><br>Add a touch of spices to the mix and I think the crazy bubbling pot of contending new born hierarchies that define a dark age is ready to serve.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c6525188299613453506 title="comment permalink">9/19/14, 12:12 PM</a><br><br>

Over here employers are required to put 9.5% of a person’s pre-tax income into these funds every quarter. Mate, I'll tell ya, the sharks are swimming around in that pool for sure.<br><br>Incidentally the system penalises low income earners, because if you earn less than $450 at a specific work place during the month the employer is under no obligation to pay any amounts at all on your behalf. This has consequences for people who may work in many different work places: i.e. the under employed who are overly represented by Gen Y's.<br><br>Also all of those 9.5% employer amounts going into those funds are taxed at a flat 15%. So, if you are an older high income earner you may be able to contribute more of your salary into that fund thus lowering the amount of tax you pay on that salary to the 15% tax. Then, those people may be also able to pull out those earnings tax free because of their age.<br><br>Low income earners on the other hand who for obvious reasons shouldn't really be paying much tax at all, get slugged 15% tax on their retirement savings with no consideration that they are a low income earner.<br><br>It is a grossly unfair system weighted to advantage older and wealthier recipients and they announced recently that I have to work until I'm 70 as the retirement age will be lifted.<br><br>It was originally setup as a fair system, but, bit by bit successive governments have gamed it to provide advantages to their support base. I think the term is called pork barrelling. Shame is we can no longer pay for such antics.<br><br>Round and round the wealth pump goes and where it stops, nobody knows.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c5234526234996562673 title="comment permalink">9/19/14, 4:16 PM</a><br><br>

Recently it came out that there is a maintenance backlog for these buildings that's in the billions of dollars. The dwellings are rotten, falling apart. The Toronto subway system is also falling apart with decades old facilities and and never upgraded technology. <br><br>This maintenance problem has been many years in the making. That's because a housing repair bill that massive takes a long time to rack up. Didn't start with Rob Ford. The lousy hypocrites that run the show, under whose watch this mess happened, and that deride Ford and his supporters (that is lower income people), have a great deal to account for. <br><br>How does this neglect happen? Easy. The city's elites, for all their pious and politically correct posturing, don't give a damn about the poor or the middle class. Especially the poor. The elite (left-wing or right-wing) looks after the elite. They rub shoulders in private schools as youngsters and in private clubs and in corporate offices when they're older. <br><br>This is just one example of how a failure to maintain a society's capital base first hits the poor. Nothing surprising really. This place has been on a long-term downward trajectory. It used to have a burgeoning industrial base which is where today's poor used to work and make decent money in years past. But no more. Never mind the absurd condo boom. Those shining towers are ticking financial time-bombs and the city's future high rise slums. <br><br>Why all this? Because this industrial base, courtesy of our oligarch class, is long gone to China and Mexico. What's left? Financial and real estate scams run by that same oligarch class, sponsored by our central bank via artificially suppressed interest rates. Their touts dangle the prospect of easy money, suckers like you and me place their bets, meanwhile, in the counting rooms, like gangsters of old, the oligarchs pocket the skim. Skim? You know, investment management fees, trading commissions, executive bonuses.

First, the Visigoths were Arian (at least for the first 100 years) and ignored the popes, while the population they ruled were Catholic (or Nicean I guess). This caused friction between ruler and ruled, and was one reason among others that the Visigoths, despite wanting to rule like Romans, were actually very bad at it. They actively suppressed the remnant Roman elite, who did carry on their traditions despite this.... though eventually there was detente. But something took place between the nice Visigoths and the top - down inquisition that wasn't mentioned... too minor? The Umayyad caliphate had some centuries-long activities there. Islamization and subsequent rechristianization would have had some effects on cultural continuity. Or one would think. Also the Catholic Church was hardly a "successor empire" or anything close at this point in time; one reason among others that it was successful was that it spiraled into poverty with the rest of W Europe, and didn't pose a serious challenge to the age's rather brutal new power structures. The age when popes could change out rulers or tax Europe was far in the future (and it never did became powerful enough to make Christendom-wide political decisions at will, despite its ambitions).<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c2940810674546906646 title="comment permalink">9/20/14, 12:33 PM</a><br><br>

I can speak to the vagaries of the airlines industry very specifically, as it is where I work, at least for the moment. I am desperately looking for an escape hatch.<br><br>Actually, the airline industry is a great metaphor for our current predicaments. The first mistake was de-regulation. Where in the past the airlines were considered a public good, the magic of the market came into fashion, and the airlines were free to compete directly. Maximum profit is the main consideration. With the glut of oil in the 90s, they way over-expanded and undercut each other at every opportunity. We lost half our legacy carriers during this period. (Eastern, Frontier, Western, Piedmont, Ozark, Pam Am, etc) as well as startups (Western Pacific).<br><br>Then came a double whammy. 9/11 and all its necessary security regulations AND Peak Oil. The security costs and complexity rose exponentially as did fuel. We lost America West (US Airways merger) TWA (American) Northwest (Delta) Continental (United) and now US Airways (American). There are now three legacy carriers left.<br><br>Even this has not been enough to staunch the bleeding. United lost something like 400 million last quarter.<br><br>They deployed technology (winglets, scimitar winglets -737s-, lithium batteries -787s-, check in kiosks, online check-in, etc.). They attached fees to everything under the sun (snacks, forward coach seats, ticketing fees for the privilege of interacting with a live human, and of course bag fees).<br><br>The hubs we lost: PIT, CLE, STL, MEM, CVG to name a few.<br><br>Then after UAs last big bankruptcy, they split the "flying side" from "groundhandling". Routes are now bid out the the lowest cost option and traditional short-hauls (ORD-DSM, ORD-DTW) are now flown by regionals. Even longer haul flights are (STL-IAD). The routes are rebid every few years to find the lowest bidder among the regionals. Groundhandling at the stations is bid out as well, about every few years. So your agent may wear a Delta or UA uniform, but they may work for DGS, Skywest, Eagle, Swissport, or any number of companies, for about 9/hr. part-time, no bennies. Once a location has been around for several years, and seniority has begun to climb (say 10-15/hr) they are replaced with a new handler and wages are reset to starting levels.<br><br>This bid process has pulled the teeth of Labor and set various work groups against each other. It broke apart any solidarity.<br><br>All the profits of the majors are dependent on fees. They can no longer make money off fares. <br><br>A rational societal response would be to restore the passenger rail system (as JHK promotes), but the public looks on the ability to get from ORD to LAX in a few hours, at $300 round trip, all as a god-given right.<br><br>The airlines are in the final descent, I think.

Background: every month the CEO would invite a number of employees at various levels to eat lunch with him in one of the rooms reserved by the upper execs for business luncheons. You didn't get to submit your own name for this. I think it was the division manager who had to recommend you - mine was three levels above me. Getting an invite was understood as a privilege, an atta-boy or atta-girl, supposed to motivate you to do more for the company. In my case I'd already made the decision to quit but hadn't told anyone, so I figured it was a good opportunity to observe him and how he interacted with us.<br><br>While we were being served the various courses he went around the table, asking each of us a pertinent question about our work. Overall he struck me as competent enough, willing to do what was necessary for the company, such as eating with the plebes and taking the time to memorize a good question to ask each of us. But what I noticed most is that he didn't eat all the same food as the rest of us. In particular he got his own bowl of the breads and crackers that were the first course instead of sharing from common bowls as the rest of us were doing, and he dressed his salad from separate bottles of dressing placed in front of him rather than from the common bowls that the rest of us spooned salad dressing from. This was in the early 1990s. Was he concerned about poisoning? Did he just want to assert his superiority in that petty way? I don't know ... it just seemed odd and noteworthy to me then and still does in light of what we're discussing. <br><br>Something else I learned at the same employer ... the folks in our department were once each given a copy of some then-current management book that department management wanted us to read. I tried but it was painfully boring and in my mind poorly written. I complained about it to my boss, the group leader. He told me that books pitched to upper management were written at a ninth grade level. That explained a lot ...<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c848627230664559539 title="comment permalink">9/21/14, 4:15 PM</a><br><br>

For a short and sharp catastrophe it would be good to have some cash on hand, some water and so on.

Good point. I wouldn't put it ahead of storing some dry goods. Some say don't store anything, but that seems a bit nuts to me. It's pretty easy to put aside some rice and beans.

The ideal would be to have some land to garden, maybe more land for livestock, water that doesn't come from the city, some stored food, and some cash and/or coins.

That 's a big jump to go from there to 'centuries-long societal collapse and its accompanying dark age'.<br><br> Frankly, this reminds me a lot of the Limits to Growth report that came out decades ago and predicted that society would have fallen into a centuries long dark ago some decades ago.

Historically, that isn't want happens. Society changes, it adapts, and it also innovates and looks for ways to meet the problem.

He was talking about the way that science dissolves humanity's sense of meaning and value. <br><br>Dagnarus, there were indeed similar thoughts -- think about the way that Christians used "God is angry because of our sins" as an explanation for the catastrophic unraveling of Roman society. Different narrative, same purpose. <br><br>Wiseman, of course having some gold can be practically useful, under certain circumstances. That doesn't give gold an intrinsic value; it simply means that as long as the fetishism holds, you can manipulate people using it. At the current price of gold, there are better options. <br><br>James, I think it's fair to assume that the Russians are perfectly aware of this, and that they know the necessity of seizing the initiative in wartime rather than remaining on the defensive. I can think of any number of nastily asymmetrical responses the Russians could use in response to this approach that have nothing to do with nukes. Just to mention one possibility: how much damage do you think a thousand well-trained Spetznaz operatives could do to our electricity grid, oil and natural gas pipelines, and other essential infrastructure in such a situation -- and just how much would be left of the US when they were finished? <br><br>William, fascinating. I've been expecting to see jet travel once again a privilege of "the jet set" within my lifetime, for whatever that's worth. <br><br>Dltrammel, why, yes, those do indeed appear to be black swans. More generally, the sky is black with birds coming home to roost...<br><br>Bruno, we could see a messy economic collapse as early as this autumn. Hang on to your hat. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, yes, that does take the cake, doesn't it? <br><br>SLClaire, it reminds me of stories of minor European royalty from the years right before the First World War -- and you know what happened to most of them. <br><br>Onething, if a small stash of precious metals seems sensible to you, by all means. What I find implausible is the insistence that gold will serve as a meaningful store of value, when the entire concept of abstract value detached from actual goods and services is one of the things that will most likely come to bits in the years immediately ahead. <br><br>Ellen, I don't engage in such debates; it's a waste of time. Your opponent has clearly never read <i>The Limits to Growth</i>, and is claiming that it says things that it doesn't say; if you point that out to him, though, he'll just change the subject and come up with some other reason why infinite growth on a finite planet is something other than a prescription for disaster.

As JMG says in response to you, the affairs of our conurbation help illustrate the catabolic-collapse model. <br><br>Readers farther afield might be interested in something apparent to those who use the subway here, namely, that a big part of Toronto's underground train signaling system has been allowed to sit in place, without an upgrade, since at least the 1960s. Only in the last year or so have the engineers started a new installation.<br><br>Toronto-area surface rail is for its part on something of an upswing, with the huge 1920s Union Station now getting its first-ever sweeping upgrade. But here there is something again illustrative of catabolic collapse: the upgrade is proving oddly expensive, coming it at something like 800,000,000 Canadian dollars. (How can a refit of a single big-city railway station come to 800,000,000 CAD? This bill is more than ten times the price of a single new subway station.) <br><br>And when the Catherine Riggall, the "Vice President for Business Affairs" at the University of Toronto (UofT) gave me 25 minutes of her time in 2008, at the start of our ongoing David Dunlap Observatory (DDO) heritage-conservation crisis, she made one good point amid her otherwise unhelpful discourse - namely, that UofT was anxious to sell the DDO to a real-estate developer because UofT had some gigantic deferred-maintenance bill, on its various vast campuses. I now forget the number she gave me, but I am 55% sure that it was either 200 million or 200-and-something million. <br><br>As Roger says, those gleaming new Toronto condo towers are liable to become high-rise slums. I guess the towers (Donald Trump built one of them) will remain standing for quite a while. Eventually,I speculate, it will not be easy to keep their lifts in good working order, and people will get used to climbing twenty or thirty flights of stairs, eventually carrying even their drinking water with them. I imagine that by the year 2150, it will be the strongest and youngest of the poor who will be residing, or at any rate camping, on the higher floors.<br><br>Anyone in the Toronto area who wants to get in touch, do please slip me an e-mail: Toomas dot Karmo at gmail dot com. <br><br>Tom = Toomas Karmo (former DDO employee)<br>www dot metascientia dot com <br><br>PS: <br>The DDO story - itself an illustration of much that JMG has been discussing over the years, being a case study in the cultural decline of Toronto - can be followed by Googling on "dunlap observatory".

There was a study published back in the 1990’s showing how public school textbooks have been steadily dumbed down since the 1930’s, by roughly a grade level per decade. So a typical 12th grade textbook from the 1990’s would be roughly equivalent in reading level to a 6th grade textbook from the 1930’s. Since the educational system in America has been steadily dumbed down over the last several decades, it’s not surprising that the reading level of books intended for the public, including business managers, have followed suit. Nor is it surprising that the level of public discourse and awareness has declined at a corresponding rate.<br><br>My mother is a retired high school teacher who still has a lot of her old textbooks, including textbooks from when she was a high school and then university student. It’s quite sobering to go back and look at the reading and intellectual level of textbooks from the 1950’s and 60’s and compare them to the textbooks that are used in present day high schools and colleges. I have also looked through reprints of the old McGuffey Readers, which are still quite popular with Christian homeschoolers, and again there is no comparison. Why is it that elementary school students in the 19th and early 20th centuries were expected to master material that most high school graduates and many college students of today are incapable of dealing with? There’s no comparison between the two, and no doubt that there has been a huge decline in standards and expectations. My great grandfather only got an 8th grade education and had a part time job working in a sawmill during his last two years in school (he started working part time when he was 12 years old as a steam whistle operator or “whistle punk” as they called it and was working full time as a logger by the age of 14), which was normal for those days, but he was far better educated and probably more intelligent than most high school graduates are these days. George W. Bush once spoke of the “soft bigotry of low expectations” as a cause for the poor performance of many students in the public school system and while I disagreed with him on many fronts, he was spot on with that observation. <br><br>So much for the popular view (the “Flynn Effect” and all that sort of cheerleading) that people are more intelligent today than they were in the past. It’s just another iteration of the Religion of Progress and a form of self-flattery. If anything, people seem to be getting dumber and dumber these days.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c1657183325460792730 title="comment permalink">9/22/14, 5:57 PM</a><br><br>

Thoughtful, detailed, knowledgeable, it is all of these. I would offer two points, one general and one specific. First, generally, it is clear to me that what we have done to ourselves since industrialization is no different than what we have done to ourselves since we became human. It just seems today that with big machines our power is greater and thus the damages perhaps worse. I would imagine though that the misery and pain within any collapsing order, whether the 21st century or thousands of years ago as the water left or the plants died off, is the same. <br>Second, I happen to be someone who believes that we will be faced with cold, not heat, in the next few decades. This places me in what many call the lunatic wingnut climate denier fringe, but I believe the broad rules for glaciation rule, here, not smokestacks, and today we are at the end of the interglacial, the sun's pattern promises cold times ahead, and despite the "consensus" I think it more likely that one year soon the snow won't melt in the northern hemisphere and then watch out. It's one thing, to get a little hotter each year, over decades. It's another to suddenly have two or three years without snow melting. Instant worldwide starvation, people fleeing, mass migrations, battle. Everyone north of 40 degrees north heading south.<br>Yet, think, for at the same time it seems everyone from the tropics will be heading north, to escape Ebola.<br>We are not prepared for Ebola. We are also not prepared, at all, for the cold. The good Lord has a wicked sense of humor and while everyone's in a foaming panic about global warming we'll see it become cold instead, and in the course of weeks and months as food supplies will dwindle the dance will really begin.That's what scares me - not the heating, which will be slow and incremental, but the cold, which will be sudden and deadly.<br>One year, a frigid summer, some will starve. People will wonder. The "alarmists" will talk about how this proves the Polar Vortex promises the heatwaves to come. The next summer will be normally hot and everyone will forget, but the fall will start early and the winter will be cold and then the next two summers after that it will be chilly and the snows will not melt. <br>I guess the good news about this is then we'll be too engaged in survival to be spending time worrying about the Kardashians or ISIS or Ukraine or Alaskan family brawls....<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c9209980237840737391 title="comment permalink">9/22/14, 8:03 PM</a><br><br>

Gold is probably very useful to buy you transportation out of a crises, but it has many drawbacks compared to other (precious) metals. Not the least being on peoples radar. Have a look at Heraeus (especially their history) for alternatives.<br><br>Silver: has loads of applications - mirrors, photography, electric stuff(PV), some bio/desinfect stuff as well - but does not travel well. <br>Platinum: For the scientifically inclined - lots of technical applications, high temperature tools, catalyst, electrochemistry, etc. including some at small scale.<br>Palladium: The little brother of platinum. Does a lot of things just as good at platinum but is lighter and cheaper, also plays well with hydrogen, and as alloy in hard dental fillings<br>Iridium: Has some uses especially with platinum for wear resistant tools (fiber extrusion), as crucible for high purity silicon - if your future has a place for those. Else it'll make a tip for your pen.

Unfortunately in your circle there are precious few people who know this as society is polarized by the necessity of juking the stats, and making entropy roll down the hill.<br>And eventually, when you are perceived as a plutocracy, your ship has sailed.

Restrictions on immigration would be considered an expression of racism, and the Democrats include racial and ethnic minorities in the coalitions, some of whom would be most displeased by an anti-immigrant stance.<br><br>The Libertarians would find restrictions on the banks, outsourcing, and immigration against their principles.

That will allow you to do stuff that you cannot do otherwise, but in very specific and dire situations only.<br><br>If you think that you can buy your way out of troubles in a collapsing society, think again. What is going to happen to you and your family once the word spreads that you are buying stuff with gold? Most likely, you will receive some unwelcome, unsavory visitors that might decide on the spot to take much more than your mere material possessions.<br><br>If you have to have your stash of bright thingies, I recommend you not to buy bullion but jewelery (second hand if possible). That way, if you end up having to trade with it, you will not be perceived as a hoarder with a sweet, sweet stash somewhere to be taken, but as a downward mobile has-been that is scrapping the bottom of the pot to keep the lights on. You will still be taken advantage of, but probably in a more civilized way.<br><br>Personally, I have taken a page out of Dmitri Orlov writtings and keep a modest stash of liquor. You can use it to barter in more day to day types of transactions. You can consume it yourself. You can even use it to make tinctures (if you happen have the skills and know herbal lore). Though I am aware that if the word gets around that I am the booze-man, I better know how to make my own in order to keep the drunkards happy. But this is a low priority project as of now.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c819120696092797386 title="comment permalink">9/24/14, 10:49 AM</a><br><br>

In A Bitter Legacy, you mentioned soil erosion, and projected that topsoils in North America would be more or less gone by 2075. Could you tell me the source of that estimate? I'm writing a post for eclectications.com about soil erosion, initially inspired by that statement. I believe it may be true for a lot of the world, but wide of the mark in the US. There was a similar projection made by an Australian soil scientist in 2012. I'm not writing to "refute" or start an internet fuss, but to develop a better understanding of what could be in store for the US midwest. It would be good to know the source of the 2075 projection and how it was developed.<br>Thanks -- Bob Wise<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c7317646047823867056 title="comment permalink">9/24/14, 1:56 PM</a><br><br>

The same goes for skills. That posse will simply kidnap you and force you to provide your services for free. A good example of this is shown in the film Doctor Zhivago when he is kidnaped by one of the roving army units during the Russian revolution and forced to provide his services at gunpoint. That’s why if you really believe the worst is coming, then you need to forget all this army of one, rugged individualist stuff, and start working on forming some kind of community.

Obscurity may help; if your community is someplace not very exciting, with no spectacular wealth to loot, it may be overlooked in favour of more tempting targets.<br><br>The island of Nauru had rich phosphate deposits and is now a wasteland; the Gilbert Islanders had rich phosphate deposits and had to buy themselves a new home when their island was laid waste by phosphate mining. But Tikopia as far as I know had no big deposits of anything the whitefellas wanted, so as far as I know Tikopia's fields are still green and their orchards fruitful.<br><br>[Let it be said though that Tikopians also had to make some tough choices. When times were tough, the chiefly clan used to instruct each of the other clans as to how many of them could stay. Only as many people could stay as the reduced food supplies would support. The others had to take a canoe and leave -- for good -- which meant basically "I am just going outside and may be some time..." suicide for the collective good.]<br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c2366499816998148673 title="comment permalink">9/24/14, 8:22 PM</a><br><br>

Of course realistically the end goal is a humanity free from dead end jobs (which are all jobs really) and get to focus on science, art, philosophy and space travel. Automation is not amputation. It produces a higher quality of life for *all* humans.<br><br>@Raymond Duckling <br><br>Of course it's about weakening labor in general. This is a good thing (in the long run) as it reduces the amount that humanity has to work. I don't get what you mean that it isn't paying for itself? A business that doesn't need to pay employees wages, health costs, vacation time, etc. is way more profitable than employing inefficient humans. That's why 47% of all jobs will be gone in 20 years and never coming back. The good news is big business will share some of that wealth with the rest of us because it makes sense to keep markets going (which need money to spend).

Other than a few laughs, I didn't find it particularly convincing.<br><br>A few things stand out about it. <br><br>"An optimistic thought frequently offered at this point in the argument is that, even if machines can do everything better than humans, humans will still prefer some things to be done by other humans rather than machines. But I think the growth in the percentage of American meals provided through highly automated fast food franchises puts the lie to this idea. Apparently many people find fast food more appealing on the grounds of at least convenience and cost, and perhaps also quality, compared to meals they could make themselves in the kitchen or consume in a more traditional, labor-intensive restaurant."<br><br>Notice he never actually discusses *why* Americans are preferring fast food (could it be because they're increasingly broke and can't afford better food?) and doesn't actually touch on whether that's good for the country (given it's a major cause for our obesity epidemic...it isn't). I can tell you the quality is always higher at locally owned more labor intensive restaurants. Yes I'm even including the dinky local diners in that statement. The experience is just always better too. I can guarantee if Americans had more money they'd prefer that experience over some dirty McDonalds with those horrible plastic chairs (or the soulless drive through).<br><br>Then the real whopper <br><br>"In the end, business would rather invest first in people in the developing world and then infotech and robots rather than expensive human workers in the developed world. Because of this, wages in the developed countries will fall in competition with the lowest wage human competitors around the world, and then in competition with the increasingly inexpensive robots and expert systems. Jobs will disappear, wages will fall and we will face three choices: Luddism, barbarism or basic income.<br><br>The Luddites might win a temporary battle here and there, delaying one or the other labor-saving device or innovation. But in the end they will lose, and the technologies will come. Then the question will be what happens to the displaced, and to the economy."<br><br>He presents three choices, and simply hand waves away the first one. "In the end they will lose". But why? He never actually details his reasoning behind it, he just expects you to take it as a given. It seems he just dismisses it in favor of the dichotomy he's trying to build so you'll accept his "solution" to the problem. <br><br>Not exactly a convincing argument.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-old-order.html#c4607242433408441409 title="comment permalink">9/26/14, 1:43 PM</a><br><br>
