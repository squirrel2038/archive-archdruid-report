It's one thing to suggest, as I did in last week’s post here, that North America a few centuries from now might have something like five per cent of its current population. It’s quite another thing to talk about exactly whose descendants will comprise that five per cent. That’s what I intend to do this week, and yes, I know that raising that issue is normally a very good way to spark a shouting match in which who-did-what-to-whom rhetoric plays its usual role in drowning out everything else. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course there’s a point to talking about, and learning from, the abuses inflicted by groups of people on other groups of people over the last five centuries or so of North American history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Such discussions, though, have very little to offer the topic of the current series of posts here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>History may be a source of moral lessons but it’s not a moral phenomenon; a glance back over our past shows clearly enough that who won, who lost, who ended up ruling a society, and who ended up enslaved or exterminated by that same society, was not determined by moral virtue or by the justice of one or another cause, but by the crassly pragmatic factors of military, political, and economic power. No doubt most of us would rather live in a world that didn’t work that way, but here we are, and morality remains a matter of individual choices—yours and mine—in the face of a cosmos that seems sublimely unconcerned with our moral beliefs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus we can take it for granted that just as the borders that currently divide North America were put there by force or the threat of force, the dissolution of those borders and their replacement with new lines of division will happen the same way. For that matter, it’s a safe bet that the social divisions—ethnic and otherwise—of the successor cultures that emerge in the aftermath of our downfall will be established and enforced by means no more just or fair than the ones that currently distribute wealth and privilege to the different social and ethnic strata in today’s North American nations. Again, it would be pleasant to live in a world where that isn’t true, but we don’t. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I apologize to any of my readers who are offended or upset by these points. In order to make any kind of sense of the way that civilizations fall—and more to the point, the way that ours is currently falling—it’s essential to get past the belief that history is under any obligation to hand out rewards for good behavior and punishments for the opposite, or for that matter the other way around. Over the years and decades and centuries ahead of us, as industrial civilization crumbles, a great many people who believe with all their hearts that their cause is right and just are going to die anyway, and there will be no shortage of brutal, hateful, vile individuals who claw their way to the top—for a while, at least. One of the reliable features of dark ages is that while they last, the top of the heap is a very unsafe place to be. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
North America being what it is today, a great many people considering the sort of future I’ve just sketched out immediately start thinking about the potential for ethnic conflict, especially but not only in the United States. It’s an issue worth discussing, and not only for the currently obvious reasons. Conflict between ethnic groups is quite often a major issue in the twilight years of a civilization, for reasons we’ll discuss shortly, but it’s also self-terminating, for an interesting reason: traditional ethnic divisions don’t survive dark ages. In an age of political dissolution, economic implosion, social chaos, demographic collapse, and mass migration, the factors that maintain established ethnic divisions in place don’t last long. In their place, new ethnicities emerge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s a commonplace of history that dark ages are the cauldron from which nations are born. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So we have three stages, which overlap to a greater or lesser degree: a stage of ethnic conflict, a stage of ethnic dissolution, and a stage of ethnogenesis. Let’s take them one at a time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The stage of ethnic conflict is one effect of the economic contraction that’s inseparable from the decline of a civilization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If a rising tide lifts all boats, as economists of the trickle-down school used to insist, a falling tide has a much more differentiated effect, since each group in a declining society does its best to see to it that as much as possible of the costs of decline land on someone else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since each group’s access to wealth and privilege determines fairly exactly how much influence it has on the process, it’s one of the constants of decline and fall that the costs and burdens of decline trickle down, landing with most force on those at the bottom of the pyramid. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That heats up animosities across the board: between ethnic groups, between regions, between political and religious divisions, you name it. Since everyone below the uppermost levels of wealth and power loses some of what they’ve come to expect, and since it’s human nature to pay more attention to what you’ve lost than to the difference between what you’ve retained and what someone worse off than you has to make do with, everyone’s aggrieved, and everyone sees any attempt by someone else to better their condition as a threat. That’s by no means entirely inaccurate—if the pie’s shrinking, any attempt to get a wider slice has to come at somebody else’s expense—but it fans the flames of conflict even further, helping to drive the situation toward the inevitable explosions. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One very common and very interesting feature of this process is that the increase in ethnic tensions tend to parallel a process of ethnic consolidation. In the United States a century ago, for example, the division of society by ethnicity wasn’t anything so like as simple as it is today. The uppermost caste in most of the country wasn’t simply white, it was white male Episcopalians whose ancestors got here from northwestern Europe before the Revolutionary War. Irish ranked below Germans but above Italians, who looked down on Jews, and so on down the ladder to the very bottom, which was occupied by either African-Americans or Native Americans depending on locality. Within any given ethnicity, furthermore, steep social divisions existed, microcosms of a hierarchically ordered macrocosm; gender distinctions and a great many other lines of fracture combined with the ethnic divisions just noted to make American society in 1914 as intricately caste-ridden as any culture on the planet. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The partial dissolution of many of these divisions has resulted inevitably in the hardening of those that remain. That’s a common pattern, too: consider the way that the rights of Roman citizenship expanded step by step from the inhabitants of the city of Rome itself, to larger and larger fractions of the people it dominated, until finally every free adult male in the Empire was a Roman citizen by definition. Parallel to that process came a hardening of the major divisions, between free persons and slaves on the one hand, and between citizens of the Empire and the barbarians outside its borders on the other. The result was the same in that case as it is in ours: traditional, parochial jealousies and prejudices focused on people one step higher or lower on the ladder of caste give way to new loyalties and hatreds uniting ever greater fractions of the population into increasingly large and explosive masses. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The way that this interlocks with the standard mechanisms of decline and fall will be a central theme of future posts. The crucial detail, though, is that a society riven by increasingly bitter divisions of the sort just sketched out is very poorly positioned to deal with external pressure or serious crisis. “Divide and conquer,” the Romans liked to say during the centuries of their power:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>splitting up their enemies and crushing them one at a time was the fundamental strategy they used to build their empire. On the way down, though, it was the body of Roman society that did the dividing, tearing itself apart along every available line of schism, and Rome was accordingly conquered in its turn. That’s usual for falling civilizations, and we’re well along the same route in the United States today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Ethnic divisions thus routinely play a significant role in the crash of civilizations. Still, as noted above, the resulting chaos quickly shreds the institutional arrangements that make ethnic divisions endure in a settled society. Charismatic leaders emerge out of the chaos, and those that are capable of envisioning and forming alliances across ethnic lines succeed where their rivals fail; the reliable result is a chaotic melting pot of armed bands and temporary communities drawn from all available sources. When the Huns first came west from the Eurasian steppes around 370 CE, for example, they were apparently a federation of related Central Asian tribes; by the time of Attila, rather less than a century later, his vast armies included warriors from most of the ethnic groups of eastern Europe. We don’t even know what their leader’s actual name was; “Attila” was a nickname—“Daddy”—in Visigothic, the lingua franca among the eastern barbarians at that time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same chaotic reshuffling was just as common on the other side of the collapsing Roman frontiers. The province of Britannia, for instance, had long been divided into ethnic groups with their own distinct religious and cultural traditions. In the wake of the Roman collapse and the Saxon invasions, the survivors who took refuge in the mountains of the west forgot the old divisions, and took to calling themselves by a new name:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Combrogi</i>, “fellow-countrymen” in old Brythonic. Nowadays that’s <i>Cymry</i>, the name the Welsh use for themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Not everyone who ended up as <i>Combrogi</i> was British by ancestry—one of the famous Welsh chieftains in the wars against the Saxons was a Visigoth named Theodoric—nor were all the people on the other side Saxons—one of the leaders of the invaders was a Briton named Caradoc ap Cunorix,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the “Cerdic son of Cynric” of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s almost impossible to overstate the efficiency of the blender into which every political, economic, social, and ethnic manifestation got tossed in the last years of Rome. My favorite example of the raw confusion of that time is the remarkable career of another Saxon leader named Odoacer. He was the son of one of Attila the Hun’s generals, but got involved in Saxon raids on Britain after Attila’s death. Sometime in the 460s, when the struggle between the Britons and the Saxons was more or less stuck in deadlock, Odoacer decided to look for better pickings elsewhere, and led a Saxon fleet that landed at the mouth of the Loire in western France. For the next decade or so, more or less in alliance with Childeric, king of the Franks, he fought the Romans, the Goths, and the Bretons there. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When the Saxon hold on the Loire was finally broken, Odoacer took the remains of his force and joined Childeric in an assault on Italy. No records survive of the fate of that expedition, but it apparently didn’t go well. Odoacer next turned up, without an army, in what’s now Austria and was then the province of Noricum. It took him only a short time to scrape together a following from the random mix of barbarian warriors to be found there, and in 476 he marched on Italy again, and overthrew the equally random mix of barbarians who had recently seized control of the peninsula.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Emperor of the West just then, the heir of the Caesars and titular lord of half the world, was a boy named Romulus Augustulus. In a fine bit of irony, he also happened to be the son of Attila the Hun’s Greek secretary, a sometime ally of Odoacer’s father. This may be why, instead of doing the usual thing and having the boy killed, Odoacer basically told the last Emperor of Rome to run along and play.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That sort of clemency was unusual, and it wasn’t repeated by the next barbarian warlord in line; fourteen years later Odoacer was murdered by order of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, who proceeded to take his place as temporary master of the corpse of imperial Rome. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Soldiers of fortune, or of misfortune for that matter, weren’t the only people engaged in this sort of heavily armed tour of the post-Roman world during those same years. Entire nations were doing the same thing. Those of my readers who have been watching North America’s climate come unhinged may be interested to know that severe droughts in Central Asia may have been the trigger that kickstarted the process, pushing nomadic tribes out of their traditional territories in a desperate quest for survival. Whether or not that’s what pushed the Huns into motion, the westward migration of the Huns forced other barbarian peoples further west to flee for their lives, and the chain of dominoes thus set in motion played a massive role in creating the chaos in which figures like Odoacer rose and fell. It’s a measure of the sheer scale of these migrations that before Rome started to topple, many of the ancestors of today’s Spaniards lived in what’s now the Ukraine. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And afterwards? The migrations slowed and finally stopped, the warlords became kings, and the people who found themselves in some more or less stable kingdom began the slow process by which a random assortment of refugees and military veterans from the far corners of the Roman world became the first draft of a nation. The former province of Britannia, for example, became seven Saxon kingdoms and a varying number of Celtic ones, and then began the slow process of war and coalescence out of which England, Scotland, Wales, and Cornwall gradually emerged. Elsewhere, the same process moved at varying rates; new nations, languages, ethnic groups came into being. The cauldron of nations had come off the boil, and the history of Europe settled down to a somewhat less frenetic rhythm. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve used post-Roman Europe as a convenient and solidly documented example, but transformations of the same kind are commonplace whenever a civilization goes down. The smaller and more isolated the geographical area of the civilization that falls, the less likely mass migrations are—ancient China, Mesopotamia, and central Mexico had plenty of them, while the collapse of the classic Maya and Heian Japan featured a shortage of wandering hordes—but the rest of the story is among the standard features you get with societal collapse. North America is neither small nor isolated, and so it’s a safe bet that we’ll get a tolerably complete version of the usual process right here in the centuries ahead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What does that mean in practice? It means, to begin with, that a rising spiral of conflict along ethnic, cultural, religious, political, regional, and social lines will play an ever larger role in North American life for decades to come. Those of my readers who have been paying attention to events, especially but not only in the United States, will have already seen that spiral getting under way. As the first few rounds of economic contraction have begun to bite, the standard response of every group you care to name has been to try to get the bite taken out of someone else. Listen to the insults being flung around in the political controversies of the present day—the thieving rich, the shiftless poor, and the rest of it—and notice how many of them amount to claims that wealth that ought to belong to one group of people is being unfairly held by another. In those claims, you can hear the first whispers of the battle-cries that will be shouted as the usual internecine wars begin to tear our civilization apart. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As those get under way, for reasons we’ll discuss at length in future posts, governments and the other institutions of civil society will come apart at the seams, and the charismatic leaders already mentioned will rise to fill their place. In response, existing loyalties will begin to dissolve as the normal process of warband formation kicks into overdrive. In such times a strong and gifted leader like Attila the Hun can unite any number of contending factions into a single overwhelming force, but at this stage such things have no permanence; once the warlord dies, ages, or runs out of luck, the forces so briefly united will turn on each other and plunge the continent back into chaos. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There will also be mass migrations, and far more likely than not these will be on a scale that would have impressed Attila himself. That’s one of the ways that the climate change our civilization has unleashed on the planet is a gift that just keeps on giving; until the climate settles back down to some semblance of stability, and sea levels have risen as far as they’re going to rise, people in vulnerable areas are going to be forced out of their homes by one form of unnatural catastrophe or another, and the same desperate quest for survival that may have sent the Huns crashing into Eastern Europe will send new hordes of refugees streaming across the landscape. Some of those hordes will have starting points within the United States—I expect mass migrations from Florida as the seas rise, and from the Southwest as drought finishes tightening its fingers around the Sun Belt’s throat—while others will come from further afield. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Five centuries from now, as a result, it’s entirely possible that most people in the upper Mississippi valley will be of Brazilian ancestry, and the inhabitants of the Hudson’s Bay region sing songs about their long-lost homes in drowned Florida, while languages descended from English may be spoken only in a region extending from New England to the isles of deglaciated Greenland. Nor will these people think of themselves in any of the national and ethnic terms that come so readily to our minds today. It’s by no means impossible that somebody may claim to be Presden of Meriga, Meer of Kanda, or what have you, just as Charlemagne and his successors claimed to be the emperors of Rome. Just as the Holy Roman Empire was proverbially neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire, neither the office nor the nation at that future time is likely to have much of anything to do with its nominal equivalent today—and there will certainly be nations and ethnic groups in that time that have no parallel today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One implication of these points may be worth noting here, as we move deeper into the stage of ethnic conflict. No matter what your ethnic group, dear reader, no matter how privileged or underprivileged it may happen to be in today’s world, it will almost certainly no longer exist as such when industrial civilization on this continent finishes the arc of the Long Descent. Such of your genes as make it through centuries of dieoff and ruthless Darwinian selection will be mixed with genes from many other nationalities and corners of the world, and it’s probably a safe bet that the people who carry those genes won’t call themselves by whatever label you call yourself. When a civilization falls the way ours is falling, that’s how things generally go. </div>

The Crew of these ships were then often forced to integrate themselves into surrounding community / population , often retaining some semblance of their original haute technology , which over time becomes the basis of their own personal power , providing the stuff of myth and legend for the local populations to be in awe of ( perhaps like "archetypes " , " fallen angels " , ) ..crew often works hard at saving the appearances to protect their own position/ authority until The Magician ( doctor who) comes along to debunk it , and often to free them ..<br><br><br>Doctor Who - State of Decay <br><br>After the events of Full Circle, the Doctor, Romana, K-9, and their newest companion/stowaway, Adric, arrive on a planet experiencing what appears to be a feudalperiod. The villagers live under the thrall of three lords—Zargo, Camilla, and Aukon—who dwell in a shadowy Tower, and experience a yearly ritual called "the Selection," in which a sample of young villagers are taken to the tower, never to be seen again. This selection process is enforced by a thuggish band of guards led by Habris.<br><br>The Doctor and Romana discover evidence of technology considerably more advanced than the medieval level of development of the planet, and wonder what happened to cause the planet to devolve to its current rustic condition—to be in a "state of decay." Romana's only suggestion is that there is a powerful force holding the inhabitants back. As the two head out of the village they are seized by cloaked figures. Meanwhile, Adric comes to the village and is caught by the owners of the feeding house. Adric is discovered and captured by Lord Aukon, who sees him as an alien and worthy of becoming one of the 'chosen ones'.<br><br>The cloaked figures, members of a resistance movement, convey the Doctor and Romana to a secret base filled with forbidden technology. Kalmar is a scientist - a heretical role in their society - and is very grateful for the Doctor's help in repairing a computer which proceeds to reveal the names and faces of the original chief officers of the spaceship Hydrax - who look exactly like the Lords of the Tower.<br><br>The Doctor and Romana discover that in fact, the great Tower in which the Lords dwell is itself the spaceship Hydrax, originally from Earth, which also was pulled into E-Space long ago.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Doctor has deduced (by applying principles of consonant shifting) that the current lords' names are a corruption of the original crew names (e.g. "Sharky" becomes "Zargo", "MacMillan" becomes "Camilla", and "O'Connor" becomes "Aukon"). Thus the Doctor realizes that the three lords are not descendants, but members of the original crew themselves, mutated into vampires and the subjects below are the descendants of the other colonists, made dull and primitive by over twenty generations of breeding and oppression. He is reminded of ancient Time Lord stories of the Great Vampires - ancient enemies of the Time Lords. He deduces that the Great Vampire escaped destruction at the hands of the Time Lords by somehow retreating into E-Space, and it managed eventually to gather enough power to pull the old Earth ship into this universe, corrupt the main crew and use the colonists for its own ends.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c6207246876778002568 title="comment permalink">9/3/14, 5:57 PM</a><br><br>

That goes back to 2007's "Fascism, Feudalism, and the Future," in which you brought up the persistent myth of mindless hordes erupting out of the cities to devour the countryside. Your readers turned that into a discussion of zombies in pop culture that eventually metamorphosed into a comment about immigrant hordes. You really were quite sanguine about those, and pointed out that wasn't the fantasy you wished to debunk. However, you did describe an early version of the kind of North America that you projected today, full of climate refugees and others who could better handle the environment of a Dark Age America.

My mind goes to: there are numerous reasons why a television program like <i>All in the Family</i> would never be made today, but surely among them is the fact that the once-common "white ethnic" terms spouted on the show, like "dago," "wop," and "mick," would be unintelligible to so much of the viewing audience today. (You once said you did watch television until some point in the 1970s, so I trust you'll get the reference.) <br><br>Anyone who thinks "white" alone sufficed as a self-descriptor for most of the 20th century in most of the US (I can't speak for the Deep South, where I expect things were different) wasn't there or hasn't read their history carefully enough. It's only in the last several decades that European American, non-recent-immigrant identity in the non-Southern US has solidified into this massive, homogeneously perceived (apart from class differences) bloc that is called simply "white" with no follow-up questions expected.<br><br>My friend in Philadelphia tells me that in his neighborhood, new alliances may be being tentatively formed. He's witnessed black and white neighbors, members of groups of course long antagonistic and generally distant toward each other in the city, grumbling in commiseration about recent Latino and Asian immigrants moving into "their" neighborhood, an image rich with irony. I don't know if that's an outlier, but I was reminded of it when I read your ideas about the unpredictable ethnic alliances of the future.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c7298616848657907960 title="comment permalink">9/3/14, 6:39 PM</a><br><br>

Unable to dream, tired of life, he takes no risks, seeking only comfort and security: “A little poison now and then: that makes for pleasant dreams. And much poison at the end, for a pleasant death.

Even the really Greats eventually fall only to be replaced by someone else.<br><br>Your quote tickles my brain: "does its best to see to it that as much as possible of the costs of decline land on someone else." Incidentally, over the past decade I have seen this cultural shift Down Under. It is expressed here as a weird form of expectational behaviour in individuals. It is weird because over the past few years, I've noticed that people who have no social currency with me are all too happy to ask for me to undertake tasks which will be of benefit to them, cost me and then they offer nothing in return. They can be very free with my time and resources. The old timers Down Under used to say this sort of action had: "More front than Myers" with the emphasis on the word "front". Seriously, it affront's me, but the frequency with which it is occurring is both increasing and staggering.<br><br>Speaking of costs, I received my renewal for house insurance and it was a staggering AU$1,400 for the house only with no farm infrastructure included. Oh boy, is insurance going up and up as the years go on.<br><br>Yes, even the convicts were split along those lines with the Irish at the bottom of the heap within that system. People love caste systems.<br><br>My gut feeling is that the divide and conquer strategy is being wielded along economic lines now. It is ugly to watch.<br><br>Thanks for the book.

When the Romans invaded, they disarmed the various tribes that they conquered. Some tribes were allies, and remained armed (eg the the Dumnonii), and others - in territory too difficult to properly control - may also have kept their weapons. Later, as the borders were consolidated, tribes in the Old North, and possibly in Wales, acted as armed foederatii, keeping the heart of the province safe from the Picts and the Irish. <br><br>Within the main part of Roman Britannia, the situation was different. Regional government was set based on tribal territories, and tribal nobility took most of the important positions in the local bureaucracy. <br><br>In "Britannia: Failed State", Stuart Laycock suggests that inter-tribal hatreds and feuds pre-dating the invasion continued to simmer away with ongoing guerrilla raids, but with the provincial government and the legions keeping the lid on. Laycock's theory, based on archaeological evidence, is that the latter wasn't sufficient, and that the tribes all began to invite in Saxon sub-tribes, and to install them in defensive rings around their borders to keep out incursions from neighouring tribes. Of course, different Saxon raiders were attacking everyone everywhere along the east coast. <br><br>Once the Romans left, the same situation continued, except that now the tribes were responsible for defense, and they couldn't work together; this is the King Arthur context in history. At some point, it all went pear-shaped for the Britons. Laycock, iirc, doesn't explain this. However it seems that in some areas plague wiped out the Britons leaving the mercenaries in charge; in others, the mercenaries joined forces with the offshore raiders, while in others yet, tribe and mercenaries teamed up to attack their neighbours. This would explain the chaotic situation. What is certain is that within the province proper, the Saxons were eventually victorious. The areas which remained under British control were those where the tribes had a) remained armed, and so knew how to protect themselves (and hadn't needed to hire Saxons to do the job), and b) maintained their social structures intact. <br><br>As JMG suggests, this has some interesting lessons for today. (To be continued)<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c1558102571220023398 title="comment permalink">9/3/14, 11:56 PM</a><br><br>

The Roman example provides a more likely development: the return of serfdom, in which those who have land and authority (but no longer the means to practise industrial agriculture) allow refugees to settle in villages and support themselves as none-free serfs, giving up a portion of what they produce to the original, free, inhabitants.<br><br>All of this leads to some questions which, frankly, I shy away from, because answering requires a rather brutal approach (which, of course, is what JMG is telling us).<br><br>- Are you in a community? If not, how do you become a member of one in good time?<br>- Is your community able to defend itself against predation? If not, can it develop this ability? If not, can it hire someone to do the job? If so, who, on what terms, and how are they to be controlled?<br>- Does your community have strong, resilient, internal structures? If not, how can these be built, in a relatively short time?<br>- Is your community economically secure, to at least a subsistence level? If not, how can this be achieved?<br><br>Of course, JMG's discussed all of these topics, but as I look around (and as I've been looking around since I first discovered TADR several years ago), I see very, very few models which tick all those boxes. <br><br>Frankly, the only one I can point to with any confidence is the neo-Cossack movement here in Russia; that's why I came here, though it's not easy for me to get to know them - and current events aren't making that any easier. <br><br>Speaking of which, it's worth noting for this audience that if the US is a society in the process of collapse, contemporary Russia is an example of post-collapse consolidation and revival; as such, consider Putin's Russia as another potential model for future US development. (It also helps to know when you're reading the headlines that a BIG motivator for Russian policy-makers is that they're trying to re-create a society that almost entirely fell apart in the 1990s).<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c3233564180336628384 title="comment permalink">9/4/14, 12:35 AM</a><br><br>

In Sweden I passed through a small village and noticed a very odd thing—most of the inhabitants seemed to be from the Middle East. I asked a local woman about this and she explained (in exasperated terms) that they were Syrian refugees - some 400 of them that the government had 'dumped' on this village of 300 Swedes. The refugees—men, women and children—appeared listless and sat around in groups in the street (a VERY un-Scandinavian thing to do). They are given a place to live, some money and clothes, but are not allowed to earn money and so just fill the days wandering about and sitting smoking.<br><br>Anyway, my point is that all the chaos in the ME is tossing people out at an ever-increasing rate and many of them are ending up in places where the culture can only be described as opposite. Of course, these Islamic settlers want to build places of worship and practice their own culture, much of which is anathema to your average white ethnic Scandinavian (or Anglo). I have a bad feeling about how all of this will end up.<br><br>Talking about Scandinavia in general, people who talk about collapse almost universally claim that it will be a 'great place to be'.

It is worth going beyond logical or stereotypical perceptions of hierarchic interactions, and notice particular influence channels, their implications. For example, to communicate effectively, you cannot avoid an "alpha" posture (be it more subtle than a cliche) - otherwise people just won't listen.<br><br>Implications of deeper hierarchical instincts for the civilization/ecological collapse could be very interesting, if not central. Dawkins might explain everything from the "selfish gene" perspective, but there is a strong ecological implication for hierarchical or territorial species - they are more "protected" from overshots, or potentially have an intrinsic structural resource to "deal" with them. Particularly the primate species are known to hit survival or overshot limits regularly. The ecological effect of hierarchical/territorial dynamics might be a game-theoretic pun of mother Nature, after all. If so, what corrections to the Mad Max scenario could be predicted?

I've always self-identified as English, never British, and much of my sense of identity has been driven by an abhorrence of the toxic mix of racism and nationalism which seemed resurgent here during the 1970s when I was a teenager. This series of posts has shone bit of a light upon one of my unconscious blind-spots, or rather something I have seen but not really understood, and that is that I am a product of a post-imperial society.<br><br>Although I was very aware of growing up in the shadow of the Second World War (my parents were children during that conflict), the hangover of the British Empire was a dimly-seen shade behind the stage curtain, not an actor in the limelight. I guess that's mostly the myopia of youth, but standing back from that with a few extra decades under my belt, I can discern much more of the patterning left behind by Empire, and its fall. In many ways, our Empire declined more gracefully than the Romans', yet without it we would have had far less immigration from former colonies, and we would consequently have had fewer neo-fascists marching on various high streets during the 70s.<br><br>The rhetoric of the racist parties amused me as much as it revolted me: talk of the 'pure British race' being one of the most salient. And to echo earlier references, it is neither pure, British, nor a race, but an ethnogenetic artefact, a simmering cauldron that has had its ingredients constantly added to, stirred and blended over centuries, or even millenia. That the latest touches have been a bit of spice from Asia, some Afro-Caribbean mellowness or even boomerang bloodlines of returning colonials, only underlines rather than threatens the nature of Englishness. For my part, I have a simple definition regarding who is English - someone who lives in England and who speaks English with an English accent (ie any regional accent, not just RP). Their ancestors may have arrived with the Huguenots, the Saxons, the Celts, the Romans or as easily on the Windrush or as refugees from Idi Amin's Ugandan expulsions.<br><br>I can't deny there have been frictions along the way between different ethnic or cultural arrivals, and there are always some ready to exploit that, but generally I am more relaxed about eventual assimilation. To some extent this genius of Englishness has already been tested by imperial decline, but what the future of industrial decline holds is harder to read. It could solidify, it could fracture. Looking from the outside, I believe the USA is much more likely to pull itself apart.<br><br>One other telling fact regarding ethnogenesis - about five or ten years ago a genetic survey of British populations was released, which revealed that at the genetic level the Welsh and the Cornish are totally indistinguishable from the English, despite them seeing themselves as separate nations. This suggests to me that nationhood is predominantly a social construct with linguistic and cultural strata overlaid on, and mostly independent of, ethnicity. Or to put it another way, national identity is more of a narrative than a reality.<br><br>(Captcha: 1914, how apposite :-) )<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c6331410383958631844 title="comment permalink">9/4/14, 4:55 AM</a><br><br>

Trying to imagine the new forms and directions Awen will take lore and language for the peoples who will walk the earth as humanity cycles again into the cauldron of beginnings. But, that process doesn’t begin in our lifetimes, and as you said our age is going to be marked by the much harsher reality of ethnic tension. For those today who value equality, fairness, and civil rights, how can we live by those values in a time where these may be in short supply. It seems the simplest answer, and the one that probably matters the most as we head into the decades ahead is to stop talking about ethnic diversity as an abstract concept divorced from day to day reality and start living it. Learn the human ecology of your area: the languages, ethnicities, cultures, and religions that make it up or will make it up and how they touch on the lives of the people within them in the same way you learn about the soil, weather, and vegetation. And start making some friends outside of your own ethnic circles if you haven’t already. Learn some of the languages and hospitality customs that might define your hometown a hundred years from now and get used to practicing some of them. It’s a way of applying those moral values to present circumstances and as the future comes bearing down it will probably be an adaptive strategy to take, not to mention the value for inner health stepping out of your own cultural tunnel vision has.

It seems like 1000 years of one warlord or another clawing his way to power, holding on for maybe a dozen years of constant battle, only to be killed by his brother/cousin/son or other rival. That's overlaid by various invasion from outside, which caused some consolidation of groups for a short time, until new groupings formed. <br><br>That's left a big impression on me - how many died in those wars, how many young men marched under the banners of those would-be kings, and what did they believe they were fighting for? How many of those warlords believed they were going to consolidate power over the whole land and reign as king?<br><br>I believe this same process played out in the wreckage of the rest of the Western Roman empire too, but perhaps was more extreme and lasted longer in Britain due to isolation and the fact that it fell harder. I can't help but expect something similar here in due time. It's already begun on the southwest border, which will likely expand north as climate and economic collapse deepen.

There's a straightforward reason for that: the arrangements that will be necessary in the coming dark ages aren't economically or politically viable today. That's one of the things that makes descent into a dark age so difficult: the social and economic forms that work in dark age conditions are nearly the opposite of those that work in the eras immediately beforehand.

If it gets out of West Africa, I expect to see scattered cases in the industrial world, but not the sort of self-catalyzing spread that's going on now in Liberia et al. -- the conditions aren't right. The urban Middle East, on the other hand, has nearly perfect conditions for an Ebola pandemic, and the increasing hostility and distrust toward Western medicine among Muslim fundamentalists isn't going to help much. Keep an eye on the major trade routes across the Sahara; if cases start showing up at the entrepots on the southern end of those, that's a warning sign of some importance.<br><br>Rita, thank you.

Not all flowers bloom in the same month.<br><br>I was at a Californian owned coffee shop recently. I was talking with a fellow Rainbow Wwoofer about how much we enjoyed our time in the garden that morning, and discussing if it was reasonable to try scaling up the garden for '15. We discussed decline, being seed bearers, the farms we had worked at, the people meet, and our experiences at recent rainbow gatherings. <br><br>When my Rainbow sister left the Californian addressed me, teasing about how much we liked gardening and dirt. And I joked back at the Californian that I haven't talked with anyone in my own age who isn't interested in sustainability, and gardening, at least in theory, but more and more in practice, and mused that I would be curious to meet some youth who don't care about such things, just to get a pulse on things.<br><br>The Californian says something to the effect "Ray, you live in a bubble, but what is your bubble, you're not hippies, what are you guys?" he was referring to the string of friend I had meet with at various times in his establishment.<br><br><br>Story time's over, because I didn't have much of an answer. But since yesterday I been thinking, it is a bit of ethnogenesis. I figure we are Rainbow Children, identifying more or less as such. And at least in the individuals who are cast off from the binds of privileged I know alot of 'former whites'. They still have white skin, and can pass in a pinch, but they mark themselves and their social persona in a way the excludes them from full inclusion with that ethnicity, and reach out to other ethnicities for meme sharing as new seeds grow fertile.<br><br>I fear that the Rainbow children are like a seed that germinates before a killing frost. But it has many features of ethnogenesis, at least in the cases of individuals who are isolated from white privilege. Even the contrast between 'rainbow' and 'white' I think is symbolically signaficent. The Rainbow culture also has a decent representation from other ethnicities, black and Indigenous American especially. Cultural aspects from South America are coming in fast and heavy thanks to the subcultures inherent alliance with the South American peoples against the methods of USA's control of the Western hemisphere.<br><br>I claim that the final stage is already happening in an immature way.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c2081783401122986415 title="comment permalink">9/4/14, 7:32 AM</a><br><br>

"In one paragraph, what's the strangest yet barely plausible cultural distortion that the readers expect to emerge from the coming Dark Age America." Such things are a sci-fi trope, for example, people worshipping Elvis Presley as a saint, or the underground dwellers in _Planet of the Apes_ worshipping the nuclear bomb and its saint, "Lost Usa".

Adolescent boys where in fact describing their responsibility of defending their neighbourhood against rival gangs .. often getting horrible knife wounds and not being able to go to school at all.<br><br>There is a growing movement in England called "Transition Towns" I interacted with. Laudably, it tries to push people to re-learn skills useful when the economy becomes forcibly local. I do feel, though, that the vision of "local economy" is often seen in a romantic, 1700-style bucolic view.. instead of the brutal affair of constant defence of the little hard-earned food against roaming migrating bands of hungry murderers it is likely to be.<br><br>Middle age society formed gradually during collapse: first almost all forms of organized society nearly failed, to be then protected by ever higher and thicker walls to defend life and the scarce resources from the lawless wilderness which was everywhere. <br><br>Every village fortified and became a "burg" with the richest man building the castle, the ultimate refuge of the people in case of attack. Every narrow passage was guarded and exploited by some making any kind of travel an expensive and life-threatening business.<br><br>The second constant during middle ages is the constant relentless economic competition of localized economies sparkling war and conflict at every level. As in any human societal dis-organization the lack of a strong, credible and effective management is the catalyst of conflict among peers. <br><br><br>Wave after wave of conflict brought aggregation of larger and larger political entitities: city-states, regional powers, nations, empires, then finally superpowers and globalization.. and here we are.<br><br>So my point is that local economy is certainly more natural.. but it won't be a pretty way of living.

With regard to English/British ethnicity a great book on the subject (maybe you have already read it) is Bryan Sykes's 'Blood of the Isles'.

This prompted me, out of curiosity, to get my own DNA analysed. I'd always thought I was '100% English' - which may be true but I have plenty of Saxon genes in the mix (well, my surname is Viking - it means 'the place where rosehips grow') ... but genetically I am most similar to someone from modern day Crimea. Apparently this is quite common in England.<br><br>So, yes, any talk of 'ethnic English' is pure nonsense. We are a mash-up and the result of numerous invasions, tribal alliances and partnerships that occurred through trade (quite a few people in Cornwall have sub-Saharan and Assyrian genes mixed in there, harking back to the tin trade during the bronze age). Saying that, many in the upper classes can easily trace their genetic lineage back to the Norsemen from which they are descended via the Normans.

I work (part-time) as a librarian in a small, poor city in New York state and over the past several years, there have been some pretty profound shifts in the population. According to the latest census data, about 30% of the inhabitants speak Spanish, which is up from about 20% in 2000. Meanwhile, none of the professional librarians speak the language or are directly involved with the community, so we are not serving the Spanish-speaking population *nearly* as well as I think we should. Currently the library board has been more concerned with hiring more security guards and remodeling the bathrooms to discourage illicit goings-on than expanding our library services. It seems like de facto segregation has become a significant factor in shaping the city's current state, with large chasms between the white/Hispanic/black populations; unfortunately those who are in formal leadership positions aren't acknowledging it, let alone doing anything about it.

I foolishly didn't bookmark the page where I saw this, or if I did, I can't find the bookmark in the zoo that is my bookmarks folder, but my understanding is that, to paraphrase G.K. Chesterton on Christianity, integration has not been tried and found wanting; in France and Scandinavia, it has been found difficult and left untried. In Britain, there's individual tolerance and individual intolerance, but official institutions are not working to shut Muslims out, which I hope will have a positive outcome for the British Archipelago in the event of an Arab/Islamic Volkerwanderung.<br><br>(I don't know how things are in present-day Germany, but I'm hopeful, based on an understanding that they've come to terms with their past and are trying to expand their "sense of 'we'", as Violet Cabra paraphrases Spengler in the comment just to the left of the box in which I'm writing this.

I'm not accusing you of this of course, merely noting it. On a long enough timeline, all of humanity is dead.<br><br>It is my hope that, at least for a time, the West will once again find its cultural confidence in the face of existential threats. Our only hope of preserving Western civilization as we know it is to abandon our recently-acquired materialism (an easier prospect when material wealth dissolves before us) and return to the just and merciful ideals of our predecessors. We need a new "we." As you've said, there will likely be several, but it's my hope some of them will survive.<br><br>Rome did not escape collapse, but its ideals did. I don't want to see the ideals of Christendom die, or rather I wish for them to remain as long as possible - rage against the dying of the light and all that. Some of this gets into religious concepts in the future, which I could not expect anyone else to accept, but I think the final loss of that light does not bode well for the world. Of course, transformation and adaptation are all inevitable, and totally fine so long as the core remains. Ethnic Chinese in Missouri speaking Portuguese could still hold to those ideals, after all. And when talking about the far future, our vision becomes increasingly colored by our ideology (which would include materialism, I might note).<br><br>Other civilizations do not face the same crisis of confidence we've recently faced. As many other comments have noted, ISIS represents a manifestation of that confidence within Islam. They do not fret about their many past sins as we do; regret can be a source of good if it prompts change, but it's become paralyzing. No German today, for instance, should feel oppressed by guilt over Nazism, and such crippling guilt in the face of real threats can be suicidal.<br><br>For good or ill, Israel may be an example of the "best case scenario" for the West; through suffering and crisis, a new unity is formed, one whose foundation is self-preservation more than anything. The new "we" needs to be a model that has a fierce survival instinct, or it will fail. That means it must, absolutely must, believe itself worthy of existing. The current Western impulse toward collapse is for many one of "good riddance." That bothers me, no less because I feel it myself. But for anything to survive, we must decide what we want to be and unite around it. This will differ depending on the people, even in the US.

Myers was, perhaps still is, a distinctively opulent department store on one of the poshest streets in Melbourne. Myers was, perhaps still is, noted among other things for its long shop-window frontage. <br><br>I may as well add here, plagiarizing from my own work on another Web site, a small anecdote about Myers and Latin (since we are here pondering a Nova Aetas Obscura). This anecdote I have from the eminent, now-deceased, Monash University classicist Gavin Betts. - As I remarked many months ago on the ADR blog, Betts is the author of a distinctively good, correctly rigorous, intro to Latin, found in almost all large bookstores in cheap paperback, <i>Teach Yourself Latin</i>. His book is the 1980s or 1990s version of <i>Teach Yourself Latin</i> - not to be confused with an inferior, less rigorous, textbook under the same title, from the same publisher, from perhaps the 1930s or 1940s. The inferior book has as one of its early examples "Puer capram amabat": the reading public in the 1930s or 1940 was rather touchingly innocent. So if you see "Puer cabpram amabat", and have quite STOPPED snorting (the imperfect is progressive: "The boy was loving the goat"), note that the book you are holding is not Betts's, but its unhappy predecessor. <br><br>A long time ago, I think before World War II, Myers (so said Betts to us, his 1981 or 1982 Latin class in Australia) held a particularly pretentious sale. The executive responsible, wishing to invest his proceedings with a certain snob value, phoned up a Latinist at the closest university to ask for a motto he might put onto a front-door banner. Easy, said the prof: write 'CAVEAT EMPTOR'. And it was even so. A vast banner, thus inscribed, welcomed shoppers. Now and again, the executive would get odd looks from some Melbournian - some odd comment, asking what the motto meant, or even suggesting that he make inquiries into its exact meaning. Feeling at length uneasy, the manager phoned the academic - here's the part you have to imagine said in broad Strine, in the Cockney of the extreme latitudes - 'Eh, that motto, eh? What's it actually MEAN?' The professor-consultant set his manager-client's unease to rest: 'Ah, yes, that motto. CAVEAT EMPTOR - for, ah, the discerning purchaser.'<br><br><br><br>Hastily,<br>scanning horizon for incoming Goths,<br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br>(near Toronto, Canada) <br><br>www dot metascientia dot com<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c1832876978526913961 title="comment permalink">9/4/14, 11:46 AM</a><br><br>

That question is, who was/is Celtic, and do I have any right to claim myself as a Druid given the usual way I have identified myself ethnically as of mostly German and secondarily English descent? Not only did I need to learn where the people who became the Celtic empire come from and what happened to them as the years went by (something you won't be surprised to find out was not covered in the public schools I attended), but I also had to think about how England and Germany came into being and what it means to think of myself as having those particular ancestries. What was and is the source of these varying ethnic identities and what does it imply about who I am and who I might become? I got a sense of ethnogenesis from that line of thinking and how civilizational rise and decline influenced that process. That helps me understand what you are discussing in this post, which in turn should help me make sense of the process as it plays out during the remainder of my life. It seems that ethnic identity is a good deal more fragile and contingent than my upbringing taught me that it was, but that it can harden rather easily under certain conditions and lead to a lot of conflict.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c6184150128696203319 title="comment permalink">9/4/14, 1:14 PM</a><br><br>

(I realize Ebola has changed recently, but formerly blazed out pretty quickly.) <br>I also wonder who is going to fund large displacements of people from one part of the country to another. The distances in the U.S. are enormous. I watch the occasional trashy movie or TV series about a distopian future. The characters set out in stylish clothing on long journeys with no supplies for themselves, gas for their cars or fodder for their horses. I think air travel has distorted the idea of going from California to Virginia. You could run out of bullets or food. One imagines a lot of dead travelers, both benign and evil since 2000 or 3000 miles is well, far. Of course the pioneers traveled west in their wagons but the industrial revolution was in full swing--plenty of gear for horses, metal fittings by the hundredweight for example--and the U.S. Army paved the way. The Mongols covered ground. I wonder if they were not on the upside of their curve like our pioneers; or perhaps they were traveling through a countryside on the upside with rich pickings. Cultures in trouble, on the downside of their curve are not going to have that much to steal or buy making emigrating or immigrating tougher.<br>The French army routinely starved in Spain during the Napoleonic wars since their practice of living off the land led to the peasantry taking them out one by one while hiding food. Supply lines, so important.

I've been following your posts for a while now, and I do find your posts thought provoking with mostly convincing train of thought and reasonable conclusions. I do have a question though, regarding your last post as you're using the Roman era as an example from time to time. <br><br>While it occurs to me that in America it is a common reference point - from historical parallels to governmental symbols(eagle, fasces etc.)- I get the impression that the rise and fall of the Roman Empire is discussed mostly separately from it's context. <br>I do think that when discussing the fall of the Western Roman Empire one should not forget that the Eastern part, later Byzantium survived almost another millennia after the collaps of the former part. And though those were separate political entities, socially, culturally they were quite similar for a long time, thus the Roman civilization did not collapse entirely after all. And Byzantium might have played a major part in preserving latin literacy through the dark age of North-western Europe.<br><br>So according to that, don't you think that it would worth exploring if such an intermediary civilization could prevail during the oncoming dark age, maybe in America, maybe some other continent at a moderately intact state? Maybe some guesses as where could that happen, and to what extent could that society keep it's existing achievements?<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c6503805572875198749 title="comment permalink">9/4/14, 2:48 PM</a><br><br>

Many groups shifted thousands of miles - but many did not move at all. Because global population is at-least 12-times what it was then, the magnitude of migration will be greater - as you mention. The consequences for certain groups may also be cataclysmic. This is particularly true for Europeans who are not reproducing at even close to replacement levels. In 50-years there could be half as many whites on Earth as there are today, - all the while, mestizos, Arabs, and Africans have been multiplying. Even in Eurasia, Asians are replacing Russian populations rapidly, particularly in East Russia and the former USSR.<br><br>I would expect all the Central American populations to be headed north. Pressures in East Asia could cause a migration of Chinese to western North America by boat. This could easily reach from Alaska/Arctic to Mexico. Already, many of the border signs are in Mandarin awhile Chinese fishermen set up villages in the Aleutians. <br><br>Even after they've spent all their nukes, I doubt the Jews will be able to keep Israel. White South Africa is gone. Asian boat migrations to Oceania with increase tenfold. The ISIS Jihadi-horde will go plowing into Europe sooner or later. Sooner, - in the next year, or later, - in the next generation, as indigenous birthrates continue to plummet awhile offering no resistance to mass colonization. <br><br>Of course we can only speculate what the ethnicity of people in North America may be in 500 years, but if one begins examining current trends with honesty, it does not bode well for Western Civilization or the European race. I would expect it to be dissolved into the Arabs/Asians/mestizos with perhaps some remnant populations in the far north. I don't like this outcome at all, but it seems likely.

Additionally, I suspect you missed this follow-up comment by me:<br><br>"It is a complex issue, and certainly overly simplistic to simply say "failure" or "success" to multiculturalism, but I don't think it's unfair that the vision once held of a unified European set of values combined with myriad diverse cultures living in harmony hasn't turned out as hoped. Rather we are seeing fracturing, "balkanization," resurgent fascism, far-right reactionary movements, and a lack of adoption of European values by many immigrant populations even after two generations. I don't quite get what the flashing red light comment means, but understand that my comments aren't meant to make a value judgment on these things. I'm simply observing them. Humans have always been tribal, and something that was not tribal would in many significant ways not be human as we currently understand it. Any expectations we have of human activity needs to account for it. And if we categorize it as racism, well, then humanity is itself inherently racist (which I don't agree with)."<br><br>To somehow conflate this with a "fantasy" about immigration seems quite ridiculous to me.

We always have been and always will be a mongrel nation, and no-one is 'indigenous' because Britain was totally depopulated in the last glaciation. For most of our history we have been intimately interlinked with continental Europe (even the 'Avebury Archer' came from the Alps), yet we still have this persistent 'island nation' myth, but I guess that's how ethnogenesis works....<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c5090832755876101020 title="comment permalink">9/4/14, 7:06 PM</a><br><br>

Large populations (which almost always live in close proximity) can die exceedingly easily. Also, "large populations" does not necessarily equate to "people with skills to live in a de-industrial world". Once the pillaging is over, what is there to eat?

The process of ethnic dissolution, as I noted in the post, has already dissolved most of the ethnic divisions among Americans of European ancestry; the process of ethnogenesis is always happening on a background level, and simply has to wait until dissolution reaches a critical point before it takes center stage. Whether your Rainbow tribe turns out to be the foundation of an enduring ethnicity or a flash in the pan is another matter, one I'm not prepared to assess yet. <br><br>Greg, no argument there.

The nascent Bacaudae? Check out the number of people who are living in camps in the national forests and other out of the way places, unable to get work or get out of crushing debt.

As for institutional ghosts, absolutely -- my novel <i>Star's Reach</i> has the more or less hereditary monarch of the midwest in the 25th century bearing the title of Presden of Meriga, there's a Congrus that meets ceremonally every four year, and Jennel and Cunnel are the usual titles of the protofeudal military nobility.

I hope that Islamic State isn't the next great centralizing influence, but you never know. <br><br>Raymond, <b>everything in this world dies</b>. If you want to talk about realities that last forever, we need to switch the subject to metaphysics or religion. <br><br>Derv, there were plenty of Romans saying more or less the same thing you are about the traditions of Rome, as the dark ages closed in.

Do you know of any other sites that host it? <br><br>SLClaire, don't fall into the trap of thinking of Druidry as an ethnic category! The modern Druid movement was kickstarted by a random assortment of English, Welsh, and Irish eccentrics, and spread to North America very nearly as soon as it was on its feet in Britain.

If something of the sort endures, it'll probably be in Europe, not in America -- civilization has very shallow roots here -- and it won't be able to preserve much of today's technology, for the simple reason that the resources needed to support such technologies will no longer be available.

If climate change gets as bad as predicted in China, with rivers drying up etc, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see mass emigration from China to Africa. I'm dubious whether in such a fight for survival the local populations would prevail against organised, highly motivated Chinese settlers. One might even wonder whether China's African 'empty city', <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilamba rel=nofollow>Kilamba</a>, wasn't built with this at least partly in mind...

Where shall his like be found now?<br><br>I mentioned a couple of weeks back that bush walking became very vogue during the Great Depression here. It was because the government and other companies made travel on the train network free during weekends during that period of time.

If you dig it I would suggest diving into DOTW Vol I, form and actuality.

It was that dull!! And yet I can recall entire paragraphs of text because it was that fascinating.

Radical faeries, squatter punks, train-riders, homesteaders etc. Many took delight in going to the gatherings and most were into one festival scene or another. Maybe I ran with "vanilla" groups but I always, in the back of my mind, doubted the commitment to freaky living of the majority of the Rainbows I met. Most that I knew are from middle class backgrounds, and most I know eventually get tired of riding trains, squatting and whatever and find a skill or a job and become more conventional. Even some of the people who were the most out there.<br><br>Not that I blame them - I left squats and communes a few months ago to work on an organic farm with people who are way less of ramblers and way more stable.<br><br>The one reason I find myself doubting Rainbows becoming an ethnic group is I haven't seen much of a work ethic amongst the ones I know. Most I've met take drugs, hitchhike and are on food stamps which is to say their lifestyle is as heavily predicated on the industrial infrastructure as anyone else's but they find ways to circumvent work and society. Of course Rainbows could be quite successful as raiders, they have an impressive skillset (constant travel, living in camps etc) for that already in place if they choose to go that route.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c7800084756165746542 title="comment permalink">9/5/14, 10:42 AM</a><br><br>

They do not fret about their many past sins as we do; regret can be a source of good if it prompts change, but it's become paralyzing."<br><br>Is false to facts. I can't imagine where this idea comes from. European domination has been a colossal assault on the self identity of other cultures...China, India, Japan, even Russia have all had to come to terms with the pole position currently occupied by the US/Europe.<br><br>Tamim Ansary in 'Destiny Disrupted' devotes several chapters to the crisis of identity that hit the Islamic World in the 1700s. It is not news in the Middle East that Islam has been in a crisis since that time - the period of European ascension, which put an end to Ottoman expansion, and began to bleed it dry. <br><br>In Ch. 13 of his book Ansary identifies three reform movements:<br><br>1. Wahhabism/fundamentalism (the Faith had been corrupted by accretions, and purity of the original religion must be restored).<br><br>2. Secular modernism (admitting that the west was right, and that the Islamic world had to modernise).<br><br>3. Sayyid Jamaluddin (modernise Islam, but keep Islamic cultural values, keep science, but do NOT westernise).<br><br>These three responses have each taken many forms, and are not elemental or singular. So for example, Deobandi of the Hanafi maddhab of Sunni Islam, and Wahhabis of the Hanbali maddhab, would both be advocates of path #1, though Deobandis originate from modern Pakistan/India, and Wahhabis from modern Saudi Arabia, etc. Aims may overlap, but relations between them are mixed: <br><br>http://www.sunniforum.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-8224.html<br><br>Similarly, secular modernism takes many forms, from Nasserism (RIP), to the Fatah/PLO (soon to RIP), to Ba'ath (Syria and Iraq (RIP)), as well as many others.<br><br>But the idea that the Muslim world (and using a singular to describe it is a dangerous thing) doesn't have a crisis of identiy is simply not true, if not catastrophically wrong.<br><br>Though the decline of secular modernists has allowed a temporary rise of hard line fundamentalists of the AQ/ISIS(daath) stripe, this is not to suggest that these forces will long dominate the scene. Only 40 years ago, Marx was the big thing, and where is that now?<br><br>I'd caution against linear extrapolations based on current events. Ibn Khaldun's muqqadimmah is a better guide to the cycles of Islmaic history, previously alluded to.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c1449320785420084222 title="comment permalink">9/5/14, 11:50 AM</a><br><br>

Dying from the broken heart, indeed. It's almost impossible to conceptualize that feeling into words, but it seems that long decades of anti-religious campaigning broke something in their culture, or in parts of it. Solace of religion and code of conduct it offers are the heart of every civilization, Spengler already thought so. Large percentage of people there bought secular religion offered by socialism, which actually was just mirror image of Western consumerism religion, and now they have landed with nothing. They are like bullied kids in the school who also have insecure home, they just have that touch of despair under thin veil of stability. One bad day and that desperation erupts like some hidden volcano.<br><br>If my understanding is right, religious people with old school views are surviving better there, outbreeding their secularized countrymen... It's not only region in the world where that is happening. Israel is going to be pure theocracy soon, if current demographic trends continue there. I wait with mixed awe how they treat Dome of the Rock when red heifer is born and raised to it's third year, when they can purify remnants of the temple mount and start building Third Temple. Waqf of Jerusalem wouldn't take that turn of events lightly. In France "extreme" native Right and Muslims joined hands and attacked with touching multicultural cooperation rainbow flag demonstration promoting feminist and homosexual agendas, causing death of at least one participant. <br><br>That is the face of future. Future belongs to believers, whatever their creed. They just can roll with the punches better, reproduce , maintain their vitality and group coherence in forthcoming world that is even more cruel, poor and unjust than now. They have hope because they believe, and absence of hope kills in any individual that part of us that makes us humans.<br><br>It's also weird how reliably these "paramilitary wars" of recent decades fought largely by irregular troops have mirror rivalries in sports world years before things escalate from knife/ fist fights into neighborhood cleansing campaigns fought with balaclava , assault rifle and blackest of black hearts. They kind of have Mini-Me version posturing in the stage before actual appearance of Dr. Evil, to use Austin Powers analogy.

I guess it would bring out the chaotic nature of a Völkerwanderung scenario quite well if people posted their approach based on where they are now and a few possible trigger events. Bear in mind that you'd probably not be the charismatic warlord himself, but one of several advisers whose family is held hostage. What are the factors I would base my argumentation on and how would I suggest the actual execution of the plan? Of course that strongly depends on the time and situation (neighbors, size of our group, motivation of leadership/members, our mobility over terrain, and skill set, perceived uncertainty and tolerance of it, e.g. willingness to go through hard times to get reward later).<br><br>From my experience I could envision best a Frisian Wanderung or part of on a Mediterranean Wanderung.<br><br><br>The factors I mentioned would likely be significantly changed over time, but as JMG says it is difficult to predict the sequence for some - but not so much the trend. <br>Neighbors: potential predator or prey - over time this should tend towards predator (globally) but if history is a guide once Völkerwanderung is in full swing it'll tend to be very variable and very important to getting "the stone rolling".<br>Size of our group: could be anything from 100s to several millions. Here I would expect a superposition of bell shaped curves over time. I guess the overall one will be left leaning as the first couple of migrations kick off a cascade while mobility (includes opportunities to "live off the land" so say it euphemistically) is fairly high and the 4 horsemen haven't been through quite as often. This would of course be rather important for considerations such as moving in stealth or plunder mode.<br>Motivation of leadership/members: Note there is generally some tension between those. I am not sure if this tension is greater than today (or people will be more aware of it). I guess the members should be rather more risk averse if not properly propagandized. Here I assume religion to have some influence, though I don't believe it matters much which one as they will often (have to) "go with the flow".<br>Mobility over terrain: ha, this one is a really interesting one especially when there's still some tech differential on the upslope of the Völkerwanderung.<br>Skill set: I assume the general skill set will shift from plunder/reuse, to mobility, to sustenance with a shortage of sustenance skills all along. I assume third world medical skills will be in high demand for quite a while as well. So will be maritime skills once the big boats are gone and you need more skippers. I expect complex skills that you cannot pick up by just watching over the shoulder for a few weeks to diminish rapidly (in line with the hardware necessary for them). E.g. there's the starving power plant operator (who wouldn't leave when hi mates packed up), and eventually left with when the next migration came through to pick up the metal from the transformer cores for horseshoes.<br>willingness to go through hard times to get reward later: this depends on culture, age, etc. Not at all sure if there can be trend extrapolated from that.

They were such fundamentally decent, gracious people, who put family first in everything - their entire lives - who never had a cent of debt, and who wouldn't tell a lie even if it got them in trouble or possibly lessened support for their 'side'. My great aunt was a devout Catholic who was married to a committed agnostic and they made it, pretty happily, for 57 years before she died. There was a respect of others' privacy and a common understanding that the only decent thing to do most of the time was to keep your fat yap shut, especially if you felt you just had to say something NOW. <br><br>When the Band of Brothers mini-series was popular, I remember hearing one of the real soldier/participants interviewed about the show. He said the only thing that bothered him was the swearing, because back in 1940, "no one talked that way", even isolated young men experiencing the hell of war. <br><br>I could go on, but cultural things of great value (such as the idea of personal restraint) have been lost, and it is sad. Based upon my own family, my grandparents were the last generation to have that grounded, internal sense of balance and honesty. Their kids split into various camps of Fox-News-conservatives (with all of the attendant unpleasantness publicly displayed) and irresponsible liberals (who only wanted the conservatives to go away).

Ancient Rome never had our modern malady of "orientation essentialism", and while Orthodox Christianity eventually put restraints on sexual behavior in general, this was not the same as restricting male partnerships. If you'd like to get unpinned from the modern way of looking at the subject, please take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.firstthings.com/article/2014/03/against-heterosexuality&gt;this article in First Things&lt;/a&gt;.<br><br>When we look back on the ancient world, it is through our own lens. We can complain Christianity is "too unrestrained" or "too restrained", that it is "too specific" or "too universal", or indeed all of these things at once. But to know what was actually affecting the thoughts of the people living in that age of decline, we need to go back to primary sources and see what specifically they were saying.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c3894638050808236294 title="comment permalink">9/5/14, 4:12 PM</a><br><br>

I fully understand that, this being a blog focused on peak oil/environmental issues written by a druid, most people here would not share many of my views. But I do feel as though there is an attempt by a few to see me as a "typical repuglican" because I believe a few things they disagree with. I think JMG has made a concerted attempt to "re-humanize" the false political dichotomy that runs American politics. It'd be nice if we could avoid all that on here.<br><br>I think I can note the need for a return to that sort of near-lost Western culture partly because I feel as though I've regained it. I'm part of a group of religious individuals who are very close, who help each other and depend on each other. We care for each others' kids, help each other financially, pray together, read books together. I am certain that they do not lie to me, and I do not lie either. I don't believe I've told a lie for at least ten years now, maybe longer. There has been a recovery of community and identity that I didn't have when I was young. It's strong. It's built on noble ideals. And it gives me hope.<br><br>This is not to toot my own horn, but to note how different the world is from this position. My people and I have forged a new "we," and it's basically the old "we" that the West used to possess. I see a strength and hope in it that I don't find in most people. Most people I know don't have a strong sense of community, or ideals they're willing to die for, or even a positive identity. <br><br>Especially among those who are caught up in modern politics, whatever community exists is one bound together more by hatred of the other side than any positive set of ideals. It's sad. And JMG is right, I think, when he says that there is no shared collective identity among Americans anymore, but a few sets of them. I want others to have what I have, that's all. I want them to rest secure that they are a part of something that matters, their lives have meaning, and their ideals are noble.<br><br>@Unknown, <br>I don't mean to apply sweeping generalities to a group comprising over a billion people; I was speaking in shorthand, much as one might blame "America" for the current situation in Iraq despite the fact that few Americans were involved and millions were opposed to it. Certainly many Muslims have had an identity crisis. But I'd argue that, at least for many in the Middle East today, they've found a "solution" in ISIS (or Wahhabism, or Boko Haram, or etc.). When a group of people can look you in the eye and say without any hesitancy that their cause is righteous and they will overrun your lands, when they can shout "God is great" without any hint of irony or doubt, when they are willing to blow up their OWN shrines to purify their faith, that is a force to be reckoned with. <br><br>Another comment stated here, I can't remember who, that the future belongs to believers. I agree with that. Whether that be one group or a hundred, I want something of the achievements of the West to survive, as it survived the fall of Rome. So we need to find something to believe in. I've found my something and I hope you find yours.<br><br>And to JMG, I would absolutely agree that many said these same things around the fall of Rome; I would simply say that they were correct. The collapse did bode ill for the West, and did bring great suffering. And a few groups did manage to preserve some of Rome's heritage, and it was greatly beneficial. And those who survived, preserving Western culture and ideals, did form a new identity that united their disparate elements, namely the idea of Christendom.<br><br>But I'll stop now. This is a long comment. :)<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c8761250842925349404 title="comment permalink">9/5/14, 5:23 PM</a><br><br>

I'm an anthropologist rather than an historian, but I imagine things similar to your sketch. In the near term, political entrepreneurs will work with the categories at hand, which for a while at least will keep people believing that categories like White, Black, Hispanic, Muslim, are "real" rather than fragile constructions that have outlived their purposes. And people will be especially susceptible to it during times of material contraction, because Othering (that is, defining some set of people as less fully human than you) is a basic technique that humans use to justify taking stuff away from others. It has it's costs however - a county of Whites that drives off the Mexicans loses valuable skill sets, for example, in exchange for coalescing its identity. But the next rising political entrepreneur (whether warlord, prophet, or governor) will draw their circle in a different way for pragmatic reasons. Hence the ethnic blender - or cauldron as you put it. <br><br>I guess that was a long winded way of saying, "Yup."<br><br>I'm curious about your take on ethnogenesis and whether history and anthropology diverge. I assume that the groupings that exist once the political and demographic collisions of the cauldron eventually subside, become the catalysts for more organic and adaptive life ways that can become distinct peoples and cultures. Never free from manipulations by the powerful, but nevertheless developing a more resilient internal coherence.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c5800058698053530062 title="comment permalink">9/5/14, 6:03 PM</a><br><br>

In them, he laid out the ancient, life affirming/celebrating pagan cultures that were gradually overtaken by the heaven/belief focused, ascetic abrahamic religions, particularly Christianity in the West. These religions were heaven/belief focused, in which earth and what happens on it are secondary to the afterlife and what happens in heaven. These religions are particularly sex negative, especially regarding homosexuality. I guess that's where the contrast between those on here grieving Christendom and Western religious sensibility and me comes out. I'm looking forward to the coming new, post-belief, post-heaven, post-abrahamic, nature based religions sensibility. I'm also pretty sanguine that other abrahamic religions like Islam won't survive the coming dark ages without major changes, either. It might initially surge, but it will suffer the same death Nietzsche's Christendom suffered.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c4148213688627044422 title="comment permalink">9/5/14, 7:25 PM</a><br><br>

The proportion of the population that owns guns has declined and is now a minority. However, among gun owners, the number of guns per person has increased. Forty years ago, those guns would have consisted of hunting rifles, shotguns, six-shot revolvers and a few military souvenirs. Now ownership of military-style weapons and pistols with large clips is more common.<br><br>Second thing, small parts of the United States get put under martial law for short periods fairly often. It's called calling out the National Guard. Governors of states and the President have the authority to call out the Guard. It's an available response during natural disasters and for dealing with violent civil unrest when local law enforcement can't get the situation under control or appears to be in sympathy with the lawbreakers. <br><br>The first episode of this I remember was President Eisenhower sending the National Guard to Little Rock, Arkansas to enforce school desegregation. During the antiwar protests and draft riots of the Vietnam era, the Guard was called out in several cities and college towns. <br><br>These episodes of martial law are generally limited to one city or small region at a time and last for days, weeks or a few months. The locals mostly put up with it. When things calm down, normal law enforcement, or lack of same, is restored.<br><br>That's the expectation that Americans have about martial law, that it will be a localized, temporary response to an emergency.

Because the increasing drawdown of capital of all kinds needed to keep energy supplies flowing is starving the rest of the economy, resulting in lost jobs, declining wages, and other symptoms of contraction. It's entirely possible that if that process goes a bit further, we could see a steep economic downturn driving an equally steep drop in the price of oil as those who had no money stopped spending it on petroleum products; the economic shockwaves from that would be spectacular, and not in a pleasant way (though it would destroy the fracking industry, of course.)<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c6866559329288951087 title="comment permalink">9/5/14, 10:17 PM</a><br><br>

In the same way, African-Americans occasionally used to pass themselves off as people from somewhere else on the planet, and got treated as white -- the point of ethnic prejudice is to maintain the internal hierarchy of power and wealth in a society, no matter how thickly it's larded with cultural or pseudoscientific hogwash. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, thanks for the link!<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c4309635744308234481 title="comment permalink">9/5/14, 10:31 PM</a><br><br>

Buying stuff, building identity through it, finding out new needs as old ones are satisfied, that does the trick. Majority of secular people are not very interested about grand ideas behind secular humanism; it is consumerism part of the deal that keeps them rallying behind the flag. Think about medieval Catholicism; myriad peasants and low-level landlords revered images of saints and baby Jesus embraced by Holy Virgin, they didn't care about scholastic nitpicking and disputes about finer theology. <br><br>Masses always have "vulgar" version of any religion, and that vulgar and common version is actually more widespread than elite definitions of same faith. One writer once wrote:<br><br>“The one place gods inarguably exist is in our minds where they are real beyond refute, in all their grandeur and monstrosity.”<br><br>If that is true, vulgar religiosity is actually more true than more sophisticated versions of same faith, because more people share it's vision. <br><br>Economic situation is so bad that individual consuming must shrink, not grow for good. Backbone of secularism shall snap at that very moment. People truly are that shallow, it is not gender equality or minority rights that keeps Western boat floating, it's promise that material needs are satisfied if you play your part like a good boy or girl. After that there shall rise new spiritualities to replace secular humanism, aka consumer religion. That has been one of your points all along, right?<br><br>My question to you: where you base your belief that these new spiritualities shall rise from neo-pagan traditions instead of already existing, Abrahamic ones? My experience about neo-pagans is that they are shopping identity that makes them "stand out"; they think with terms "I" and "me", not in terms "we" and "us". This is no intention to insult, but my limited experience indicates to that direction. That kind of group, which is not actually a group at all, shall disperse into four winds when really hard times begin and protection of liberal state most Westerners take for granted is taken away. It is groups with strong shared identity, who are ready to go through suffering and take casualties, with clear definition between "us" and "them" who shall conquer.<br><br>So is this looking down existing religions and their potent strength during already ongoing crisis result of personal preferences or what? I can understand and to some degree symphatise with those who feel ridiculed or unjustly ostracised by set of rules laid down thousands of years ago in totally different economic and material conditions. But that doesn't matter. If we feel as individuals that something is unjust or just, universe don't care. <br><br>Some loner organic farmers, whose only soulmates are found through internet, won't form backbone of communities that survive through storm. Neither do communities with very weak shared identities. Strong "spiritual" communities already exist, at least in the Old World, and any new communities who want to solidify their existence must go through Darwinian fight for Lebensraum, fought in the near future also with methods not allowed in current liberal democracy. I think their prospects are bleak in that kind of fight. Just my opinion.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c1814044264984039150 title="comment permalink">9/5/14, 11:10 PM</a><br><br>

I was simply indicating the fact that the Welsh, English and Cornish are drawn from essentially the same stock but maintain separate identities based on cultural and linguistic heritages, making it an example of the very dissolution and reformation of nations through the processes of ethnogenesis under discussion here. The fact that this occurred in the twilight of the Roman empire is particularly apposite. The point is that the ethnic lines are blurred to non-existent, and boundaries were redrawn by narrative means instead. I explicitly stated that my own 'Englishness' is a non-ethnic, socio-linguistic construct, so how can you construe any denigration in suggesting that 'Welshness' or 'Cornishness' is similar in nature?<br><br>You've made a very big miss if you think I wish to see an end of Cymraeg (or for that matter Cornish, Manx and Scots Gaelic, Orcadian, Guernesiaise or Jerriaise).

I'd also ask how much of this are you hearing from people under 30, or even 40? Again, my rural hyper-red county also contains a gay male nudist retreat, that everyone knows is here, and they have very little harassment (and reasonable cooperation from county government). At least one out lesbian is a high profile figure in the local community and arts. A bit to our east is the Radical Faerie Mother Lode (aka Short Mountain Sanctuary), and they also have very little trouble with harassment. They have been there for 30 years. When a local TV station tried to do a sensationalist hidden camera piece on them, the local sheriff charged the journalists with trespassing. <br><br>Sure, you hear more anti-gay marriage sloganeering, but that is just media political junk in response to national campaigns.

The first is a simple one, and the complexity increases from there.<br><br>First, there seems to be a meme here at the ADR that "preppers" are over-prepared isolationists - who wouldn't last long without a lot of social help. Of course, this is true for some of those folks. Those featured on the various "prepper" shows on cable TV certainly do seem to fit the stereotype. Do remember, though, that this is a stereotype - and that individual preparation for disaster and/or supply disruptions likely resides on a continuum. I know a fair number of (mostly) men in the police and emergency medical services. Many of them give a very reasonable amount of thought and energy toward disaster preparation for their families. Our own US government recommends that a 3-day supply of food and water for every individual in a household should be maintained at all times. http://www.ready.gov/build-a-kit Forewarned is forearmed, in this regard - and just because one makes preparations for times of need - does not mean that one is a lunatic.<br><br>My second point has to do with lucky mortal's idea that, "...a comparison of immigrant students and "Americans." Among immigrant groups, teachers were given an amazing deal of respect... (snip) Meanwhile, many American students often seemed obsessed with challenging authority, any authority, over any petty thing. <br>Fast forward to this same attitude in our workplaces and organizations and you have a recipe for the constant conflict..." <br><br>YEAH, no kidding, lucky mortal! I've seen this problem in operation. And, I was a rebel myself, in my youth. I think most young people go through some of this. However, it used to be that the "school of hard knocks" would educate enough rebelliousness out of a young person that he or she could learn to function in society, make a living, raise a family, whatever. The school of hard knocks has been forced out of session - temporarily - due to certain permissive predilections in today's America. This is part of why first generation immigrants thrive while the native-born wither. Unfortunately, children of immigrants seem to become fully Americanized, in these non-functional rebellious regards, and very often in a single native-born generation. And someday, the school of hard knocks will go back into session - with a vengeance.<br><br>Third point concerns Christianity. This faith has been around for over two thousand years. It has endured hard times and good times. Honestly, it does far better in hard times, as today's "prosperity gospel" can not really be justified by reference to the literal words of the Bible. Certainly, Christianity can be misapplied and misused - yet there it stands, ready for harder times.<br><br>Personal to Raymond Duckling. Steady, man! Too much time on too many doomer websites is hard on the soul. You indicate you have children who are still reliant on you for physical sustenance. That means they also depend on you for an honest appraisal of a way for them to survive and (maybe!) thrive in a declining future. As best you can, find a middle ground.<br><br>Personal to Juhana. Welcome back! Your hard-edged and tribal view of the present is something ALL of us need to ponder for an uncertain future.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c2101945502808387226 title="comment permalink">9/6/14, 4:50 PM</a><br><br>

I live in what I consider to be the sister state to Bill's, and my experience is similar. Most of the young evangelicals I work with are as gay friendly as any, yet they're as into Jesus as any evangelical. Fairness ordinances, as LGBT civil rights laws are called in our state are migrating down to the smaller communities, and are passing. The statewide Fairness law is gaining traction in the legislature, as well as the law to ban indoor public smoking.<br>I too, want to know the ages of the bigots you're hearing from. My guess is that they're over 50, if not over 60. My impression of the whole tea party thing is that it's a phenomenon of disaffected older white boomers and silents, judging by the photos and the demographics I've seen. For that reason, it's just a bunch of hot air not to be taken seriously. No effective revolution or riot ever comes from the aged, much as older boomers are in denial about their age, they're still old and getting older, and unless they have a death wish and want to die a few years earlier of unnatural causes, they're not going to start a revolution against people half their age.

In it he outlines the rise of the abrahamic religions, how they came to dominate previously nature based pagan religions, often violently, how they require linear time (you have to mark time linearly if you're waiting for the messiah/Mohammed to come/return), how linear time is required for progress, thereby how Christianity is the handmaiden of the secular religion of Progress, or how Progress is Christianity in secular drag. This is just my bastardized summary. Best to read/reread them yourself.

There are several styles of leadership, some more consultative than others.<br><br>A hierarchical structure in which people have to obey commands whether or not they respect the commander can either lead to disaster or save a group from it. You Must Obey is a crutch that allows people who have no leadership ability at all to exercise power. <br><br>In groups that have less formal hierarchy, leaders give a lot of suggestions. They also start projects and make room for others to join in. One part of being a leader is identifying which of the people hanging about want to be involved and then figuring out what they are able to do, willing to do, and won't screw up the master plan by doing. They don't necessarily know what the master plan is; that's one of the things a leader is for. Probably being in charge of small children is good practice for this. <br><br>People who have some area of competence they think is equal or larger than yours won't offer to help unless they think your approach has a chance of working. If they think it does, they will want to know the objective and the schedule and the resources available to them. I really love a leader who gives me something to do that interests me and that I'm good at, and leaves me to get on with it.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c871485006421102482 title="comment permalink">9/6/14, 6:33 PM</a><br><br>

Saw this on resilience.org in a comment by Nigel Williams to the latest article from Heinberg:<br><br>"The Arch Druid pointed out that de-population need not be a hugely significant event for most of us; If the rates of death exceed rates of births by just 3% per annum over the next hundred, then that would see global population decline to just 5% of today's [...]<br><br>Currently the global population is increasing by about 1.2% per year, so an increase in death rate by 4.2 % pa would be enough. So for those of us who have been to 100 funerals so far - this would see us going to 104 funerals instead. Not that dramatic."<br><br>- uh, percentages need a numerator and a denominator, got to keep those straight. The "3% per annum" excess deaths in this example means 3% more of the _total_population_ dying per year, not 3% of the previous death rate. I.e., an increase in death rate _to_, not "by", 4.2% pa. That would be 4 times as many funerals, not 4% more funerals. From 100 funerals to 400, not 104.<br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c1988453916641098970 title="comment permalink">9/6/14, 8:12 PM</a><br><br>

I also sense that countries and ethnicities do not exist as physical entities, and that it is even fairly nonsensical to think in terms of ‘family’.

The empire was approaching its pinnacle of power and prosperity. Britain was conquered a few years after Jesus's death. The next hundred years or so were a time of stability and prosperity in most of the empire.<br><br>I've become more aware, through contemplating some of the more accessible symbols of Eastern philosophies such as the yin-yang symbol and the hexagrams of the I Ching, that when a thing reaches full ripeness, there's a bit of rot within that will spread. <br><br>In Jesus's lifetime, King Herod had the resources for an extensive and magnificent building program, but the poor were still poor. I wouldn't press the comparison too far, but I see parallels to 1950s America, when the established order was questioned only by a few outsiders like the Beatniks, who thought that the postwar peace, economic expansion and social conformity were inauthentic and hollow. Jesus may well have foreseen the decline of Rome, but he didn't witness it in the flesh.<br><br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c8202270971613491273 title="comment permalink">9/7/14, 12:39 AM</a><br><br>

We have been discussing the survival of communities, and what kinds of leaders are successful in times of violence, chaos, and fighting over resources.<br><br>There is a recent historical movie that deals with those questions very directly. It is called Defiance. It came out in 2008 and starred Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber. It is supposed to be based on real people and events. (An older movie and a TV series by the same title are not connected in any way.)<br><br>The background of this movie is that when the Nazis began rounding up Jews in Eastern Europe for extermination, some fled into forests to hide. Many were civilians just trying to survive. Some wanted to fight Nazis. This much is certainly historical fact.<br><br>There were various partisan groups, independent of each other and not under any unified command. Some of them did not welcome Jewish fighters. <br><br>The premise of the movie is that two Jewish brothers escape into the forest in Belorussia and try to join up with a contingent of Russian resistance fighters. One of the brothers wants to help the hundreds of non-combatant Jews who are in the forest. The other brother's priority is assembling a group of fighters and sees all these old people, children and bespectacled clerks as nothing but liabilities.<br><br>The brother who is focused on the survival of all the Jews organizes a clandestine forest village. He figures out ways that all these non-combatants can be useful to each other and to supporting the fighters. Improbable as this sounds, they pull it off and most of the non-combatants survive until the end of the war. (After that, I don't know what Stalin did to them.)

I have noticed curious thing in people: when you visualize with your senses dark, stormy clouds in the horizon and describe them to other people, they tend to say you wish for that storm to rise. Of course person has limited senses; storm clouds can disperse or go to other direction. But as long as they are visible in your horizon, is describing them same thing as wishing for the storm?<br><br>Certain amount of...ahem, let's say "reservations" I have towards Western liberals is that if you describe something you have noticed in the REAL WORLD that doesn't fit their frame, they practically just shoot the messenger and close their eyes and ears from obvious signs. Rise of religiosity is one such thing. <br><br>Before 9/11 attacks that shook the world, discussion with "enlightened" people about this subject went regularly like this:<br><br>"Well, I have actually BEEN in Pakistan. Official administration there is hopelessly corrupt. Clan and blood connections seem to matter a lot for what district gets what. Only persons people seem to trust outside extended family in those big, unsanctioned shag towns are religious figures, who have some leverage at lower levels of local government. I am outsider to their community, so I probably have missed many nuances, but to my eyes they actually RULED those shag towns. They are like protecting their communities, keeping up order and at the same time taking patterns of thought among people they herd towards more strict religiosity."<br><br>"I have met many academic Pakistanis, they were very polite and civilized!"<br><br>"Huh..? What the he...? I just meant that at grass roots level that country is going towards more fundamentalism, and their self image is in growing proportions based on religion. Family ties still matter, but religion as building block of self image is expanding. As that same thing is happening simultaneously in many parts of the world, I believe we are not heading towards secular future but future of rising religiosity outside this small circle of Western academic middle class. At the same time, tensions between major religions shall rise again. Base on things I have seen in Balkans and Asia I honestly believe that world's progress towards ideals set in place during European Enlightenment period is over." <br><br>"You evil, evil man! How can you say such a thing! Third world is just opressed, and when that opression is lifted, they are going to be just like us! Just like us! Our own poor folks shall also be just like us, when they are steered away from football, populist Right and rising superstitions!"<br><br>"Huh... I didn't mean... Well, okay... Let's talk about weather, shall we?"<br><br>There are many peak oil denialists. People who "believe" in peak oil tend to think they are quite stupid and blind. At the same time, at least American peak oilers seem to be on denial about many VERIFIABLE facts about how world has been chancing during last decades. I don't say everyone should make same conclusions about those facts; people never do. But saying that Abrahamic religions are dying away, as their more fundamentalist interpretations are in the REAL WORLD gathering momentum and strength is plain stupid. Do you want to have roleplaying session D&amp;D style or see world as it is? Fundamentalist religiosity is on the rise, not falling. Maybe American TV preachers and their herds are exception, but their religiosity is not actually truly fundamental, "back to the basics"-style breed anyway. See old-school Orthodox sects of Syrian Christians if you want to see "fundamental" aka basic Christianity.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c6237206481018804287 title="comment permalink">9/7/14, 3:15 AM</a><br><br>

For some reason the media likes to take those who take sensible precautions and find the most extreme examples, then state that this is typical. A number of years ago, the defintion of the two was split, with the wannabe Rambos who were primarily gun collectors, and no real plan, other than "I have guns, I will take what I need" from the people who call themselves "preppers".The media is now trying to associate this term with nutcases and hoarders, but it was not the intent. Honest preppers understand that guns are not the entire answer, and devote ten times the resources to living as they do to fighting. The on-line community of preppers I belong to is primarily composed of people who work in regular jobs, and see first hand the vurnuabilities that the current system has. Myself, I work in the electric power generation industry, and see how fragile the system is. I agree that the Rambos will have a very short life span, as bullets are hard to eat. At the same time, the preppers out there are quietly storing food and putting in solar panels so they don't need to get in a firefight for their next meal, and at the same time are not going to be pushovers for a gangbanger and his sideways pistol. If you practice Permaculture, preserve food in your pantry and put up solar panels, you may be a prepper yourself.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c5140851025721391543 title="comment permalink">9/7/14, 9:29 AM</a><br><br>

Not much I can say to that, so I'm sure all we can do is talk past each other. I come from a Confederate part of a border state, and the local cemetery less than a mile from where I live are buried many Confederate veterans who lost their lives for a cause I'm sure they believed in with all their hearts, and were certain God was on their side, but lose they did, which is why it's called the Lost Cause. I don't doubt that what you are saying will come to pass, and indeed is already coming to pass. It still doesn't change my belief that it is futile, but I know I can't convince you of that and won't even try. I mean, the host of this blog is the head of a Druid order and has written a lot of books about his beliefs, it's not like they're a secret or anything, it seems easy enough to understand where he's coming from from a religious perspective. <br>If Christianity and Islam survive the Long Descent, they won't be recognisable to modern day adherents, and indeed will probably be blasphemous to modern day adherents. For one thing, after industrial civilization has collapsed, it will be considered obscene or profane to consider Earth to be Satan's playground or void of any spiritual significance, and the idea of an afterlife in heaven will probably likewise be considered obscene. Salvation would be considered obscene in the deindustrial dark ages. Man, the conqueror/ruler of nature will be particularly obscene. So any surviving Islam or Christianity would be circumspect at best about life after death, and would instead focus on the cycles of the Christian or Muslim calendar. <br>As to how the fall of Christianity or Islam will progress, I'm guessing that after being repeatedly forsaken by God/Allah, most people will stop believing and look for something else that more accurately fits the circumstances. After centuries of decline and collapse, with promises of rapture failing to deliver Christians from the results of industrial decline, how many believers will be left? Likewise, after the Caliphate or whatever fails to bring back Mohammed or create heaven on earth, how many Muslims will be left? A religion can only fail so many times before people look for something else.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c5246830011370667652 title="comment permalink">9/7/14, 2:30 PM</a><br><br>

Every week you can see the progression of the various projects. Most of the work is done by hand so you should be able to get a good feel for how much effort is involved for each of the various projects and how the weather affects them too.<br><br>By the way, you are cheeky! I'm involved in community groups here too, and it is just one of the things I don't really discuss on the Internet. Lone organic farmer, indeed! Thanks for the laugh though.<br><br>Seriously, we are all so far past overshoot that it is not funny. The city of Perth in Western Australia is now - I believe - reliant on desalination plants for its drinking water. They even have one in Melbourne now.<br><br>The summers here may be really hot and dry, but at least things still grow all year around. In Northern Europe however, your winters are a serious problem in relation to food production. Simple discussions of community and politics will not produce food. It may well be one path with which to obtain it via force, but who knows, and the food reserves there may not provide much buffer either? Personally in your circumstances, I'd hedge my bets and pursue both that strategy as well as food preservation strategies. <br><br>Plus energy may be a real problem too. I use firewood here, but winters here are nothing like as cold or as long as yours. How many people can your forests support for how long? As long as ground water is available the trees here grow all year around, so they grow fast, but that isn't the case in your location.<br><br>Imagine transport in your environment too during winter if available energy was low. Dunno, but my thinking is that your actual human carrying capacity is much lower than the present carrying capacity in your area and all options should be on the table.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c1759278087790096333 title="comment permalink">9/7/14, 9:14 PM</a><br><br>

I am just saying that if person has somekind positive legacy he wants to pass to future, like organic farming skills, he should consider world as it is around him, and adapt to it. Utilitarianism is good world view. I believe that majority of US citizens have kind of delusion about how things are progressing in those parts of the world which are only exotic names for them. Your country is so young, so divided, roots of cultural memes are only couple of centuries old. You easily underestimate how peculiar these conditions are when looking Eurasian continent.<br><br>Cultural and religious history of the US is very peculiar; you are the exception to the rule, not the other way around. I have met many cultural specialists and "co-operation professionals" who complain that American companies they engage on the ground just don't get it, just don't get it how deep the roots of local cultures are in areas where unbroken cultural continuity goes back maybe two thousand years. That they stir the pot when it should not be stirred.<br><br>What I have tried to offer into ongoing conversation in this blog is opinion that when talking about Old World, strength of cultural memes and their forthcoming backlash against modernity when modernity fails to deliver it's promises should not be underestimated. That people who believe physical reality of our planet doesn't allow current consumerism continue should take that backlash and it's aftermath very, very seriously. That task is clearly hopeless.<br><br>Your nation has been strong so long. It has sailed through history without having major conflict inside it's own borders after 19th century. There has never been truly scary outside agressor. It is somewhat hermetically sealed. Those extremely unique historical circumstances clearly chance something in the way you look the world, and my skills are inadequate to cross that barrier. I personally feel that if something does not fit the frame over your side of the pond, it's ignored until it blows to the face. It's common privilege of winners in history, so I have no problem with that. But arguing about things after that is useless.<br><br>Just remember: religious empires were there long before industrialism. They thrived and survived in non-industrial world. Your personal view of Christian thinking seems also to be based upon Protestant sects common in US; remember that they are tiny minority among Christians. Visit Church of Holy Sepulchre sometime; get informed about six sects that maintain the tomb and truly feel how alien they are from those Protestant sects you are familiar with.<br><br>Your nations's leaders and armed forces were facing unpleasant surprises in Iraq and Afghanistan, surprises which were accurately foreseen bu many cultural specialists I personally know. So they were no surprises at all for those who actually knew local cultures there. <br><br>Not one of these specialists, who have been right so often, foretell death of current cultural memes in heartlands of Eurasia, not even at long run. I personally believe that US peak oilers betting their chips in that kind of cultural change are facing unpleasant surprises too,like your leaders have so regularly faced. Maybe in your country, but not in here.<br><br>Respect for you and thanks for interesting conversation, let's end it here in good mood :).<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c7899063628820698964 title="comment permalink">9/8/14, 12:45 AM</a><br><br>

One thing not made clear in the books I read when young, was where the various peoples, viz., Goths, Franks, Alans, Vandals, &amp;c. came from (apparently out of nowhere), and where they disappeared to (into the mist one morning?) when they seemingly just vanish from the historical record.<br>Now, from what I understand, the most recent scholarship, which includes DNA investigations, these were all formed and re-formed from the same collection of tribes, with different tribes culturally dominant at different times. Once one entity disintegrated for one reason or another, the people themselves fragmented for a while, then re-grouped under another banner for a couple of hundred years.<br>I saw a recent program on the BBC by a scholar who put forward the hypothesis that the Saxon Conquest was not the violent total displacement of native people by an invading horde, as there is no archaeological evidence to support that history. Of course, there is nothing to disprove it, either, and DNA evidence is inconclusive, but he makes a good case that Bede may be no more historically accurate than Thomas Mallory in "Morte D'Arthur" or Marion Bradley in "Mists of Avalon." The Saxons were, apparently, much fewer in number and came as hired mercenaries and the population adopted their mode of dress, art, &amp;c. out of mimeosis, much the way modern Russians are eagerly adopting and integrating western styles and fashions into their own culture and thus altering it in a very radical way. People kept on living in the same place as before the Romans, but now their tribe and culture was dominated by Saxons.<br>This is pretty much what you are describing.<br>I can see the demoralized surviving remnants of North America's population implosion adopting the vibrant styles and customs of newcomers immigrating from other corners of the globe and fusing them to give rise to new cultures, new peoples, even if the numbers of newcomers per se are not very high.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c6366176776462350871 title="comment permalink">9/8/14, 1:21 AM</a><br><br>

I have no idea what the religious history of Eurasia is going to look like; on this side of the water, I see the existing Abrahamic religious groups doing their level best to dismantle their last hope for a future.

More on this as we proceed!<br><br>Varun, yes, that's something we'll be discussing down the road.

As I said before you're making the mistake of looking at the future through the prism of the present and past. You're looking around the world in 2014, and if it doesn't make sense now, you're dismissing it. You're not really allowing for the possibility of a future that could be radically different from either the past or present. Also, I think you're looking at things from a much narrower time frame than the post is discussing. Sometimes, I wonder if you've read or understand the post. You seem to be setting up a false binary of" ancient tribes" vs" secular humanists" and shoehorning everything into that binary, then beating the secular straw man to death. I mean, it is "the Archdruid Report", not the" secular humanist report". There are plenty of blogs approaching peak oil from a secular humanist point of view. When you rail against secularism, the E.U., the U.S., etc, I'm at a loss as to who that's directed to, because those are all things I don't believe in or identify with, and I don't think a lot of others here do, either. It's factually inaccurate to say that European peoples have occupied their current lands for thousands of years. Most European nations date back to their settlement by barbarian tribes during the last dark ages, which is only 1500 or so years ago, which is not that long ago in the grand scheme of things, particularly when you consider how long China or India have continuously occupied their lands. Also, it depends on how you define ancient as to whether Islam or Christianity are considered ancient. Islam rose after the fall of Rome, and it took a long time for Europe to be fully converted.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c4481700642615836428 title="comment permalink">9/8/14, 7:11 PM</a><br><br>

I also hold you in great respect as a writer and philosopher. You are speaking clearly about very unpleasant things here: if somebody thinks that 95 % population drop is not unpleasant thing for said population, s/he should go to the shrink. So I take it for granted that you also see threats facing those European brothers and sisters in faith of yours, as flames of current problems rise higher? <br><br>I have heard dozens of times from people from Balkans how animosity and fear started to build up before explosion there during 90's. Extremely violent and HUGE riots by French-Algerian fans during football world cup this year are precisely same stuff those people from Balkans described predating their conflict. Football riots around France this summer were only one straw away from open civil war. Throw in couple of AK-47 rifles, and riots of that magnitude morph into insurgency. There was curious silence around Anglo news about these problems, but Russians and Arabs feasted on these news. If morphology as scientific method hold's true, France is facing serious trouble, SOON. You know, those rioters don't have very open-minded opinions about "idolaters" and faiths that are not based "on the Book". At he same time, counter-forces facing wishes of these rioters are rising from Völkish-nationalist pagan traditions and from very strict Christianity among native French. <br><br>So any Green Wizard around old Roman province of Gaul should take THE FACT of future pogroms against his/her ilk into consideration, no matter which mentioned side of conflict wins.

Nor did the Barbarian Invaders wipe the slate clean as they invaded. For the most part, they colored "within the lines" as they imposed themselves on the land.

It is practically badly filmed first-person narrative description of religious/tribal conflict in nascent phase. I felt somewhat awestruck when I first time undestood how deep, significant historical changes are reflected by these seemingly random and unofficial conflicts. Over last years, they have been just intensifying, year after year. There are more ideology and politics involved year by year also. Sporadically they have already erupted into actual news, as former hooligans are recruited to volunteer military forces on all sides. <br><br>Official political speech in Europe has become more and more ossified. It is practically meaningless mumbling of political correctness, totally cut off from actual street level reality, and that is my unpassionate and non-partisan opinion. <br><br>I have noticed that by using intensity of European/Anatolian/North African underground sport rivalries as "weather barometer", it is possible to forecast quite reliably where social pressures are building up big time. It seems to me that journalism and politics are lagging behind, they just shoot wildly into the dark. As "high culture"-circles in Europe have very little guiding power over masses anymore, it is low culture of sports world that reflects in advance what significant amount of people really feel and where this troubled continent is heading. <br><br>Couple of first times I started to notice this symmetry between political eruptions and long-held sports rivalries/animosities, I felt it must be coincidence. But as my own hunches were time after time more accurate than "official" journalistic data to predicate what's going to happen... It feels like irrational, deepest and truest feelings of European nations and people are expressed only through sports loyalties anymore. Like other venues, culture and art, are so stiffened by correctness and political control that only this remains as barometer for future events here.

Here, when two football teams with a longstanding rivalry play a game, fans on both sides sit in the same sports bar and get drunk together and cheer or groan as the case may be, and go home, having had a good time that didn't involve anybody's head being bashed in. We have our problems and ghastly habits, the gods know, but pitched battles between rival gangs of soccer fans aren't among them. <br><br>The same point can be generalized. I wouldn't be in the least surprised if the western half of Eurasia and North Africa were to spend the next five centuries or so embroiled in the kind of vicious religious warfare that you've seen so many times before, and the Abrahamic faiths are the likely culprits there -- though you may see some new contenders as well, to judge by what I'm hearing from Russia and some other places. As the center of global power shifts away from the northern Atlantic basin, the descent of much of Europe into failed-state status not that different from Somalia today is a real possibility -- but that's specific to that part of the world, and once the US has the last shreds of its empire torn out of its hands, it may not concern us over here any more than the current state of Somalia does. <br><br>Shane, Spengler points out that while the political power of a Culture may expand outside of its original home region, it never sets down deep roots, and once things start sliding down the slope of decline and fall, areas that were temporarily conquered go their own way. What he calls Faustian culture is native to Europe west of the Vistula and the Carpathians and east of the Atlantic, and as its era of global dominance finishes winding down, areas temporarily into its orbit -- such as both American continents and Australasia -- will spin off on their own paths, just as Western Europe stopped being Roman in a hurry as Rome crashed and burned. <br><br>Cherokee, okay, that may be the most colorful omen I've heard this month.

That was what my comment was referencing, and from that point of view, I don't see how it's that far off topic. It's my understanding that the barbarian tribes that founded the modern nations of Europe were considered foreign outsiders by Rome, I'm not sure how that is any different than how Arabs are considered in modern Europe.

I could easily see the sorts of rivalries that one sees surrounding European soccer teams developing based on fans of North American rules football. I live in the Pacific Northwest and actually witnessed some of the celebratory rioting that occurred in Seattle after the Seahawks won the Superbowl. I myself am a diehard Seahawks fan who has relatives who are Denver Broncos fans. While there was no violence in my family over the game, I could readily imagine people adopting sports based loyalties as other primary loyalties in America break down. It’s already happening in some areas; the process just hasn’t gone as far as it has in Europe. <br><br>Humans are social and tribal animals by nature and if primary loyalties based on ethnicity, race, religion, region and so on have broken down, people will find other means of expressing this innate tendency. It’s human nature. It’s only in the utopian dreams of post-modern Western intellectuals, bureaucrats and political activists that the conceit could arise that we could have a society based solely on loyalty to such grand but vague abstractions as “equality”, “freedom”, “democracy”, “diversity”, and “free markets”. In this day and age, sports affiliations seem to be one means by which new primary loyalties are emerging. Just look at the mayhem, gang and otherwise, that is often associated with fans of the Oakland Raiders or the Baltimore Ravens.<br><br>Juhana also brings up some good points about the re-emergence of tribalism, not only amongst Christians and Muslims but also among militant neo-Pagans. There is a growing neo-Pagan underground that passionately hates both Christianity and Islam and at least some of these groups are preparing for the civil wars and social unrest that I think we all know are coming. I am reminded of the activities and music of people like Varg Vikernes, as well as the writings of people like Jack Donovan.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIiINg7pNfo<br><br>http://www.jack-donovan.com/axis/2014/06/a-time-for-wolves/<br><br>http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/becoming-the-new-barbarians<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c7539522820949822834 title="comment permalink">9/9/14, 3:02 PM</a><br><br>

I hope other Europeans pay attention to it.<br><br> We have gangs here and most of the gangs have an ethnic or geographical base, but they aren't organized around sports affiliations.<br><br> Professional team sports in the US became racially integrated after WWII. For decades, sports were a unifying influence because people of both sexes, all classes and all ethnic groups attended games and rooted for their local teams. This unifying effect is waning but still fairly strong. A few cities have more than one pro team in the same sport and in those instances the fans of the different teams may sort themselves out. An example would be Chicago, where fans of the perennially losing Cubs baseball team are typically wealthy and everyone else roots for the White Sox, who are winners.<br><br> The most popular professional team sports are basketball and American football. Basketball is dominated by black players but has a large white audience. Most people don't go to professional football games because the tickets are expensive. They watch on TV at home or in sports bars. Because Americans tend to root for the home team but often settle far from home, people watching a game in a bar will not all be cheering for the same side, just as JMG says. There are mixed marriages with respect to team affiliations as well as religion and political party preference; the team loyalties are something to be joked about.<br><br> Organized clubs of team supporters are a very minor part of the American scene. Sports related violence is also not organized. When a team wins a major trophy, there will be citywide celebrations, and often these are followed by late night riots. The Superbowl riots in 1980s San Francisco were apolitical, just drunks looking for a fight. I don't know if that's the case in other cities. Fans attend away games of their teams wearing team colors and sit in the stands surrounded by supporters of the other team and usually nothing happens except a little heckling. However, not too long ago, a San Francisco Giants baseball team fan attended a game with the rival Los Angeles team in LA, was set upon by several Dodgers fans, beaten nearly to death and suffered permanent brain damage. Something similar happened at a Giants home game. Incidents of this kind are still rare enough to be shocking.<br><br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c868364252527485189 title="comment permalink">9/9/14, 3:38 PM</a><br><br>

Muslims also conquered formerly Roman territories such as the Iberian peninsula and the whole of North Africa and made a good run at most of the rest of Christian Europe. The new rulers altered the government structures but (with some exceptions) they didn't burn libraries or destroy churches. <br><br>Medieval Christian Europe was inferior to the Islamic sphere of influence in almost every way, and didn't catch up until the early modern period. The Ottoman Empire was a power into the nineteenth century. <br><br> The long, bitter rivalry between Islamic civilization and much of Christendom is partially responsible for centuries in which history written by European historians exaggerated differences between Christian and Islamic civilization and ignored the achievements of the latter. That's probably not so true now, but there is a lag before revisions in historians' outlook get passed to the general public. <br><br>I got a slightly more balanced view about this growing up. Among Jews, the period when Islam ruled Spain is known as the Golden Age for its prosperity, social and religious tolerance, and flourishing intellectual culture.<br><br> It's an advantage to be taught a different set of heroes, villains and facts at home than you get at school and from mass media, because you learn at an early age to pay attention to the biases of the person telling the story.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c7259122956001219890 title="comment permalink">9/9/14, 5:48 PM</a><br><br>

If you like your religion or ethnicity can be the cup holder or even the bumper. Most likely though all these things will serve another function (scrap metal, compost, source of shadow) as the changes to the rest of the structure are too large to continue their existence in the same role.<br><br>As for HUGE riots by French-Algerians in France this year - I cannot say I fully agree. I am used to twice as much, and that three times a year (when I lived in Germany). But the AKs are already here (though not so much in Paris). Here the Algerian kids had a pretty long party - but what do you expect? They have a couple more kids than most others, and many are poor. I think poor youth is often threatening enough nowadays. You do not NEED confrontational religions or soccer to make them more so. Although I agree that the vulgar things are the ones to look out for most (though team sports are only one among many). And these vulgar things really only channel a frustration that would otherwise find another path. <br>Also, think back to 1968 when there more kids all around (and France had some major issues). This is not a terribly new development. The weakness and corruption of the critical pillars of government are hard to judge for me though.<br><br>Another point is that you may very well get new neighbors if population reduction manages to lag behind a drastic change in climate for long enough.<br><br>@JMG: Sorry for writing such long essays all the time, but I try to stay reasonably anonymous, which makes regular blogging and convenient commenting difficult. <br><br>Please feel free not read or post stuff if it is too much.

My reason, which I haven’t said anything about here, and which I won’t elaborate on unless JMG gives me the go-ahead, is theological in the strict sense of theo-. If the mid-causal entity called “Michael” isn’t talking through their mid-causal hat, what the socio-economic system looks like three or four centuries from now is going to be radically different from what we’re expecting. The transition is not going to be pleasant, and my assessment is that the odds of what JMG is talking about happening are at least 3:2. (I tried to write 2:1, but 3:2 is what came out.

To quote that famous Welshman, Dylan Thomas: "Rage, rage, against the dying of the light". The question is: as the light dies, do you rage, or not?<br><br>"The dying Russians" reminds me of another quote, from the 2005 film <i>Serenity</i>: "There's thirty million people here, and they just let themselves die". It's like the Native American tribesmen who once were warriors and became drunks in the street. Their future, their cosmos, was taken away from them and nothing put in its place, and so they gave themselves up to death.<br><br>In Old Europe, our cities used to have civic pride. They had industries, where working men made things, and gained dignity from their work. Their pride expressed itself in culture, music - and support for their local football team. <br><br>It's no coincidence that the rise of the football 'firms' coincided with the deindustrialisation of the 1980s. With the work gone, where could the men get their self-respect? Brass bands, male voice, all the other cultural expressions often need money and, scarcer, hope. In the irreligious West, there was just the football team. The other alternative was a passive retreat into drugs. Some went one way, some the other. <br><br>There were also, of course, the options of race-based identity, and (in Eastern Europe) religion. Throw those into the mix, and some ugly things came out. <br><br>The general affluence of the past decade seems to have weakened the firms' appeal in the UK and elsewhere; I expect we'll see them again - perhaps, as Juhana and JMG both predict in their various ways, as the early forms of warbands.<br><br>In the US, as other people have pointed out, sport loyalties worked in different ways. Young men who've lost their work as a source of identity will have to find it in other ways. I don't know enough about the US to know.<br><br>Anyway, Juhana, I'm not sure if you saw my reply to you some weeks ago: I'm not sure of the extent to which our worldviews overlap, but if you find yourself in St Petersburg, let's compare notes over a Baltika or two...<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-cauldron-of-nations.html#c2783153770859410321 title="comment permalink">9/9/14, 11:25 PM</a><br><br>
