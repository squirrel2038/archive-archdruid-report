I'd meant to go straight on from last week’s post about
<i>v<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>ö</span>lkerwanderung</i>
and the dissolution and birth of ethnic identities in dark age societies, and start talking about the mechanisms by which societies destroy themselves—with an eye, of course, to the present example. Still, as I’ve noted here more than once, there are certain complexities involved in the project of discussing the decline and fall of civilizations in a civilization that’s hard at work on its own decline and fall, and one of those complexities is the way that tempting examples of the process keep popping up as we go. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The last week or so has been unusually full of those. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa has continued to spread at an exponential rate as hopelessly underfunded attempts to contain it crumple, while the leaders of the world’s industrial nations distract themselves playing geopolitics in blithe disregard of the very real possibility that their inattention may be helping to launch the next great global pandemic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In other news—tip of the archdruidical hat here to <a href=http://www.dailyimpact.net/ >The Daily Impact</a>—companies and investors who have been involved in the fracking bubble <a href=http://www.dailyimpact.net/2014/09/06/rats-start-to-leave-the-fracking-ship/ >are quietly bailing out</a>. If things continue on their current trajectory, as I’ve noted before, this autumn could very well see the fracking boom go bust; it’s anyone’s guess how heavily that will hit the global economy, but fracking-related loans and investments have accounted for a sufficiently large fraction of Wall Street profits in recent years that the crater left by a fracking bust will likely be large and deep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Regular readers of this blog already know, though, that it’s most often the little things that catch my attention, and the subject of this week’s post is no exception. Thus I’m pleased to announce that a coterie of scientists and science fiction writers has figured out what’s wrong with the world today: there are, ahem, too many negative portrayals of the future in popular media. To counter this deluge of unwarranted pessimism, they’ve organized a group called Project Hieroglyph, and published <a href=http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28974943>an anthology of new, cheery, upbeat SF stories</a> about marvelous new technologies that could become realities within the next fifty years. That certainly ought to do the trick!</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course I’m hardly in a position to discourage anyone from putting together a science fiction anthology around an unpopular theme.
<a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2012/10/on-sale-after-oil-sf-visions-of-post.html>After Oil: SF Visions of a Post-Petroleum Future</a>, the anthology that resulted from <a href=../../2011/09/invasion-of-space-bats.html>the first Space Bats challenge</a> here in 2011, is exactly that, and two similar anthologies from this blog’s <a href=../../2014/01/return-of-space-bats.html>second Space Bats challenge</a> are going through the editing and publishing process as I write these words. That said, I’d question the claim that those three anthologies will somehow cause the planet’s oil reserves to run dry any faster than they otherwise will. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same sort of skepticism, I suggest, may be worth applying to Project Hieroglyph and its anthology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The contemporary<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>crisis of industrial society isn’t being caused by a lack of optimism; its roots go deep into the tough subsoil of geological and thermodynamic reality, to the lethal mismatch between fantasies of endless economic growth and the hard limits of a finite planet, and to the less immediately deadly but even more pervasive mismatch between fantasies of perpetual technological progress and that nemesis of all linear thinking, the law of diminishing returns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The failure of optimism that these writers are bemoaning is a symptom rather than a cause, and insisting that the way to solve our problems is to push optimistic notions about the future at people is more than a little like deciding that the best way to deal with flashing red warning lights on the control panel of an airplane is to put little pieces of opaque green tape over them so everything looks fine again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s not as though there’s been a shortage of giddily optimistic visions of a gizmocentric future in recent years, after all. I grant that the most colorful works of imaginative fiction we’ve seen of late have come from those economists and politicians who keep insisting that the only way out of our current economic and social malaise is to do even more of the same things that got us into it. That said, any of my readers who step into a bookstore or a video store and look for something that features interstellar travel or any of the other shibboleths of the contemporary cult of progress won’t have to work hard to find one. What’s happened, rather, is that such things are no longer as popular as they once were, because people find that stories about bleaker futures hedged in with harsh limits are more to their taste.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The question that needs to be asked, then, is why this should be the case. As I see it, there are at least three very good reasons. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
First, those bleaker futures and harsh limits reflect the realities of life in contemporary America. Set aside the top twenty per cent of the population by income, and Americans have on average seen their standard of living slide steadily downhill for more than four decades. In 1970, to note just one measure of how far things have gone, an American family with one working class salary could afford to buy a house, pay all their bills on time, put three square meals on the table every day, and still have enough left over for the occasional vacation or high-ticket luxury item. Now? In much of today’s America, a single working class salary isn’t enough to keep a family off the streets. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That history of relentless economic decline has had a massive impact on attitudes toward the future, toward science, and toward technological progress. In 1969, it was only in the ghettos where America confined its urban poor that any significant number of people responded to the Apollo moon landing with the sort of disgusted alienation that Gil Scott-Heron expressed memorably in his furious ballad “Whitey on the Moon.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nowadays, a much greater number of Americans—quite possibly a majority—see the latest ballyhooed achievements of science and technology as just one more round of pointless stunts from which they won’t benefit in the least. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s easy but inaccurate to insist that they’re mistaken in that assessment. Outside the narrowing circle of the well-to-do, many Americans these days spend more time coping with the problems caused by technologies than they do enjoying the benefits thereof. Most of the jobs eliminated by automation, after all, used to provide gainful employment for the poor; most of the localities that are dumping grounds for toxic waste, similarly, are inhabited by people toward the bottom of the socioeconomic pyramid, and so on down the list of unintended consequences and technological blowback. By and large, the benefits of new technology trickle up the social ladder, while the costs and burdens trickle down; this has a lot to do with the fact that the grandchildren of people who enjoyed <i>The Jetsons</i> now find
<i>The Hunger Games</i> more to their taste. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the first reason. The second is that for decades now, the great majority of the claims made about wonderful new technologies that would inevitably become part of our lives in the next few decades have turned out to be dead wrong. From jetpacks and flying cars to domed cities and vacations on the Moon, from the nuclear power plants that would make electricity too cheap to meter to the conquest of poverty, disease, and death itself, most of the promises offered by the propagandists and publicists of technological progress haven’t happened. That has understandably made people noticeably less impressed by further rounds of promises that likely won’t come true either. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When I was a child, if I may insert a personal reflection here, one of my favorite books was titled <i>You Will Go To The Moon</i>. I suspect most American of my generation remember that book, however dimly, with its glossy portrayal of what space travel would be like in the near future: the great conical rocket with its winged upper stage, the white doughnut-shaped space station turning in orbit, and the rest of it. I honestly expected to make that trip someday, and I was encouraged in that belief by a chorus of authoritative voices for whom permanent space stations, bases on the Moon, and a manned landing on Mars were a done deal by the year 2000. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course in those days the United States still had a manned space program capable of putting bootprints on the Moon. <a href=../../2011/08/elegy-for-age-of-space.html>We don’t have one of those any more</a>. It’s worth talking about why that is, because the same logic applies equally well to most of the other grand technological projects that were proclaimed not so long ago as the inescapable path to a shiny new future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We don’t have a manned space program any more, to begin with, because the United States is effectively bankrupt, having committed itself in the usual manner to the sort of imperial overstretch chronicled by Paul Kennedy in <i>The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers</i>, and cashed in its future for a temporary supremacy over most of the planet. That’s the unmentionable subtext behind the disintegration of America’s infrastructure and built environment, the gutting of its once-mighty industrial plant, and a good deal of the steady decline in standards of living mentioned earlier in this post. Britain dreamed about expansion into space when it still had an empire—the British Interplanetary Society was a major presence in space-travel advocacy in the first half of the twentieth century—and shelved those dreams when its empire went away; the United States is in the process of the same retreat. Still, there’s more going on here than this. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Another reason we don’t have a manned space program any more is that all those decades of giddy rhetoric about New Worlds For Man never got around to discussing the difference between technical feasibility and economic viability. The promoters of space travel fell into the common trap of believing their own hype, and convinced themselves that orbital factories, mines on the Moon, and the like would surely turn out to be paying propositions. What they forgot, of course, is what I’ve called the biosphere dividend:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the vast array of goods and services that the Earth’s natural cycles provide for human beings free of charge, which have to be paid for anywhere else. The best current estimate for the value of that dividend, from a 1997 paper in <i>Science</i> written by a team headed by Richard Constanza, is that it’s something like three times the total value of all goods and services produced by human beings. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As a very rough estimate, in other words, economic activity anywhere in the solar system other than Earth will cost around four times what it costs on Earth, even apart from transportation costs, because the services provided here for free by the biosphere have to be paid for in space or on the solar system’s other worlds. That’s why all the talk about space as a new economic frontier went nowhere; orbital manufacturing was tried—the Skylab program of the 1970s, the Space Shuttle, and the International Space Station in its early days all featured experiments along those lines—and the modest advantages of freefall and ready access to hard vacuum didn’t make enough of a difference to offset the costs. Thus manned space travel, like commercial supersonic aircraft, nuclear power plants, and plenty of other erstwhile waves of the future, turned into a gargantuan white elephant that could only be supported so long as massive and continuing government subsidies were forthcoming. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those are two of the reasons why we don’t have a manned space program any more. The third is less tangible but, I suspect, far and away the most important. It can be tracked by picking up any illustrated book about the solar system that was written before we got there, and comparing what outer space and other worlds were supposed to look like with what was actually waiting for our landers and probes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I have in front of me right now, for example, a painting of a scene on the Moon in a book published the year I was born. It’s a gorgeous, romantic view. Blue earthlight splashes over a crater in the foreground; further off, needle-sharp mountains catch the sunlight; the sky is full of brilliant stars. Too bad that’s not what the Apollo astronauts found when they got there. Nobody told the Moon it was supposed to cater to human notions of scenic grandeur, and so it presented its visitors with vistas of dull gray hillocks and empty plains beneath a flat black sky. To anybody but a selenologist, the one thing worth attention in that dreary scene was the glowing blue sphere of Earth 240,000 miles away. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For an even stronger contrast, consider the pictures beamed back by the first Viking probe from the surface of Mars in 1976, and compare that to the gaudy images of the Sun’s fourth planet that were in circulation in popular culture up to that time. I remember the event tolerably well, and one of the things I remember most clearly is the pervasive sense of disappointment—of “is that all?”—shared by everyone in the room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The images from the lander didn’t look like Barsoom, or the arid but gorgeous setting of Ray Bradbury’s <i>The Martian Chronicles</i>, or any of the other visions of Mars everyone in 1970s America had tucked away in their brains; they looked for all of either world like an unusually dull corner of Nevada that had somehow been denuded of air, water, and life. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here again, the proponents of space travel fell into the trap of believing their own hype, and forgot that science fiction is no more about real futures than romance novels are about real relationships. That isn’t a criticism of science fiction, by the way, though I suspect the members of Project Hieroglyph will take it as one. Science fiction is a literature of ideas, not of crass realities, and it evokes the sense of wonder that is its distinctive literary effect by dissolving the barrier between the realistic and the fantastic. What too often got forgotten, though, is that literary effects don’t guarantee the validity of prophecies—they’re far more likely to hide the flaws of improbable claims behind a haze of emotion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Romance writers don’t seem to have much trouble recognizing that their novels are not about the real world. Science fiction, by contrast, has suffered from an overdeveloped sense of its own importance for many years now. I’m thinking just now of a typical essay by Isaac Asimov that described science fiction writers as scouts for the onward march of humanity. (Note the presuppositions that humanity is going somewhere, that all of it’s going in a single direction, and that this direction just happens to be defined by the literary tastes of an eccentric subcategory of 20th century popular fiction.) That sort of thinking led too many people in the midst of the postwar boom to forget that the universe is under no obligation to conform to our wholly anthropocentric notions of human destiny and provide us with New Worlds for Man just because we happen to want some. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, that’s what happened to most of the other grand visions of transformative technological progress that were proclaimed so enthusiastically over the last century or so. Most of them never happened, and those that did turned out to be far less thrilling and far more problematic than the advance billing insisted they would be. Faced with that repeated realization, a great many Americans decided—and not without reason—that more of the same gosh-wow claims were not of interest. That shifted public taste away from cozy optimism toward a harsher take on our future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The third factor driving that shift in taste, though, may be the most important of all, and it’s also one of the most comprehensively tabooed subjects in contemporary life. Most human phenomena are subject to the law of diminishing returns; the lesson that contemporary industrial societies are trying their level best not to learn just now is that technological progress is one of the phenomena to which this law applies. Thus there can be such a thing as too much technology, and a very strong case can be made that in the world’s industrial nations, we’ve already gotten well past that point. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In <a href=http://steadystate.org/three-limits-to-growth/ >a typically cogent article</a>, economist Herman Daly sorts our the law of diminishing returns into three interacting processes. The first is
<i>diminishing marginal utility</i>—that is, the more of anything you have, the less any additional increment of that thing contributes to your wellbeing. If you’re hungry, one sandwich is a very good thing; two is pleasant; three is a luxury; and somewhere beyond that, when you’ve given sandwiches to all your coworkers, the local street people, and anyone else you can find, more sandwiches stop being any use to you. When more of anything<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>no longers bring any additional benefit, you’ve reached the point of futility, at which further increments are a waste of time and resources. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Well before that happens, though, two other factors come into play. First, it costs you almost nothing to cope with one sandwich, and very little more to cope with two or three. After that you start having to invest time, and quite possibly resources, in dealing with all those sandwiches, and each additional sandwich adds to the total burden. Economists call that <i>increasing marginal disutility</i>—that is, the more of anything you have, the more any additional increment of that thing is going to cost you, in one way or another. Somewhere in there, too, there’s the impact that dealing with those sandwiches has on your ability to deal with other things you need to do; that’s <i>increasing risk of whole-system disruption</i>—the more of anything you have, the more likely it is that an additional increment of that thing is going to disrupt the wider system in which you exist. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Next to nobody wants to talk about the way that technological progress has already passed the point of diminishing returns: that the marginal utility of each new round of technology is dropping fast, the marginal disutility is rising at least as fast, and whole-system disruptions driven by technology are becoming an inescapable presence in everyday life. Still, I’ve come to think that an uncomfortable awareness of that fact is becoming increasingly common these days, however subliminal that awareness may be, and beginning to have an popular culture among many other things. If you’re in a hole, as the saying goes, the first thing to do is stop digging; if a large and growing fraction of your society’s problems are being caused by too much technology applied with too little caution, similarly, it’s not exactly helpful to insist that applying even more technology with even less skepticism about its consequences is the only possible answer to those problems. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
There’s a useful word for something that remains stuck in a culture after the conditions that once made it relevant have passed away, and that word is “superstition.” I’d like to suggest that the faith-based claims that more technology is always better than less, that every problem must have a technological solution, and that technology always solves more problems than it creates, are among the prevailing superstitions of our time. I’d also like to suggest that, comforting and soothing as those superstitions may be, it’s high time we outgrow them and deal with the world as it actually is—a world in which yet another helping of faith-based optimism is far from useful. </div>

You're a bad influence (hehe!) because my mind now skips over all of the tech dream stuff only to focus on the story and character interactions. If you ignore the tech dream stuff, he tells a ripping yarn. Anyway, Peter could be described as a techno cornucopian of the first order. <br><br>What is interest though is that in this most recent novel is that he has: introduced the concept of economic limitations to the story; described that the majority of the human population works to scrape by; introduced the concept that the majority of the population is committing financial fraud of one sort or another just to get by; has described that there is a large under class of citizens eking out an existence; and introduced the concept that energy is not in fact unlimited and that the availability of it comes at the expense of the biosphere.<br><br>I could keep going on, but the story displays a significant departure from his previous works - which I probably can't now re-read...<br><br>One of the things that gets hammered home here is that accepting limits is actually a form of freedom. All the little things that people tie themselves down with are a burden to them. Those burdens have a cost too, which is not insignificant.<br><br>I'll tell you a funny story about a visit to the local bank during the middle of a working day.<br><br>Pleasantries were exchanged and then the teller had the temerity to ask me, "why aren't you at work?". I'm unsure whether they were just being friendly or not, but the question annoyed me greatly, so I after a pause to gather my thoughts, I responded, perhaps a bit ungraciously from hindsight, "Isn't this bank involved in some sort of financial planning scandal?". Well it was uncomfortable all round after that for sure. hehe!<br><br>I've noticed that off shoring of administrative and service type jobs is going ahead full steam with reckless abandon here. Actually, I read recently that Gen Y's have now recorded the highest level of under employment in over 40 years here. Not good.<br><br>PS: I'm not sure, but I wonder whether you had come across this: <a href=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/09/10/347478147/underneath-stonehenge-a-map-of-what-was-there-in-the-past rel=nofollow>Stonehenge a map of what was there in the past</a>.

It is new (January of this year and includes a discussion of the Fukushima Daiichi tragedy). I found it by chance on the shelves of my local small town public library. The book is written in an entertaining style and approaches this very serious topic with a degree of humor. It is remarkable how many accidents have occurred — including a fair number of nuclear bombs that have been dropped accidentally (in the great majority of cases they were not armed so there was never a chance of a nuclear explosion).<br><br>As its title indicates the book focuses more on the immediate effect of accidents rather than on long-term containment and clean-up issues. However the final chapter — Caught in the Rickover Trap — is thought-provoking. The type of nuclear reactor that we use now is based on the highly successful design introduced into the U.S. Navy by Admiral Rickover in the 1950s. But the success of a very small reactor in a submarine does not necessarily scale up to safe operations in much bigger commercial reactors. And, although there are many new ideas for generating nuclear power more economically and safely it is questionable if we will implement them. As the author says,<br><br><i>The real danger is that any engineering discipline can fall into its own Rickover Trap. We do not, for example, necessarily burn gasoline at the rate of 134 billion gallons per year in the United States because it is the best way to power an automobile: we do so because we have been doing it a long time, and the infrastructure is in place. As is the case of pressurized water reactors, it has worked well for us for a long time, but there could be a better way to do it.</i><br><br>In this post, Mr. Greer suggests that new and imaginative technology is not implemented because it is not economic. <br><br><i>. . . New Worlds For Man never got around to discussing the difference between technical feasibility and economic viability . . . </i><br><br>Mahaffey’s book is suggesting another reason: we become comfortable with existing technology and choose not to make the effort to change, even if such change is technically and economically feasible.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c4736374183198483321 title="comment permalink">9/10/14, 6:53 PM</a><br><br>

Starting with the Hubble Space Telescope and moving on to a variety of very successful Mars missions (of about a dozen we launched, we only lost one to unit conversion errors!), the Kepler telescope which catalogued thousands of possible exoplanets while it was operational, MESSENGER's Mercury mission, several missions including Dawn and NEAR to asteroids, Galileo and Cassini to Jupiter and Saturn respectively, and the New Horizons probe which has recently passed Neptune's orbit and should go though the Pluto system in July 2015.<br><br>I'm not under any illusions that we'll be able to keep up this pace of unmanned space exploration forever, but I hope we do manage to get the James Webb telescope up to replace the Hubble, and accomplish however many other interesting projects we can manage before the funding runs dry. <br><br>And then the next phase of the space exploration project will begin, and this one will take centuries: preserving all the knowledge we managed to accumulate about our universe during the brief window we were able to spare that kind of energy. I think it does seem quite possible that lots of data will survive on acid-free paper for periods of up to several centuries if maintained, but it's anybody's guess what future societies will make of it. <br><br>Our durably printed texts (and some still are printed) do have the advantage of being much more widespread worldwide, so that barbarian hordes can't burn the Library of Congress and do damage on the scale of the destruction of the library of Alexandria, the library of Baghdad, and the burning of the Mayan codices.

That hits home in a way that reading about an island somewhere made of discarded plastic, or the destruction of a distant rainforest, does not. <br><br>I suspect that, for every i-moron camped out in line in front of the nearest Apple store, eager to drop $600 he doesn't even have, on yet another gadget that obsolesces before he pays for it, that there are 5 other people who are backing away from advanced tech that they don't understand well enough to protect themselves against the unintended effects thereof.

With a bar in space as icing on the cake? This is supposed to be the inspiring vision of tomorrow? Someone must be having a serious case of Burj al Khalifa envy. How dare those “primitive” A-Rabs build the world’s biggest skyscraper! What about all those O’Neill cylinders, Stanford toruses and other space colonies we were promised? With today’s economic system, how much you wanna bet the steel would be made in China?

Whatever happened to the Jetsons and Star Trek future we were all assured was right around the corner when we were kids?

Truth is, novels like the Lord of the Rings, Dune or the Elric of Melnibone series probably present a more realistic vision of the future anyways.

For example, it seems to be a common occurrence that infrastructure built 50-100 years ago (like water pipes) is crumbling, yet we somehow cannot find the money to fix it. But how can this be when we are, at present, wealthier than our predecessors 50-100 years ago? I don't have the numbers, but I expect per capita energy and other resource use is greater now than 50-100 years ago. We are doing less with more and they did more with less.<br><br>My working theory is that as the economic growth rate declined from what it was 50-100 years ago, the elites decided not to accept a lower growth rate. They arranged the situation politically so that their growth rate was maintained at the expense of the rest of society. If we had a different political situation, the decline could be better managed.<br><br>- Purple Tortoise<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c2466499908812014717 title="comment permalink">9/10/14, 7:26 PM</a><br><br>

Of course the internet is what you make of it, but for many people I think it has become an incredibly destructive addiction. Plumbing the strange depths of the various communities that can be found on sites like Reddit or 4chan (my own sad addiction) I often encounter comments or blog posts where people talk about needing to take a break for a few days or a week, because the stress of whatever tempest in a teapot they've embroiled themselves in has become too great.

Even if some people still entertain fantasies of Mars becoming populated, I doubt anyone would subscribe to this particular visual, where the kid seems to have been given a cheap seat on a moon launch.

I happen to be from the Caribbean, a "developing region" in modern growth finance parlance. I'm not claiming that the sentiment I'm about to describe started with it but since the proliferation of touch screen gizmos of all kinds, there seems to be a general inability at the level of pundits and government to think about serious policy issues without invoking app, smartphone and tablet. For instance, turns out that adequately teaching persons geometry requires tablets in all schools, so dancing triangles can show the compliant persons (the ones who pretend that they haven't yet hacked theirs while the others with no such qualms continue to watch porn) how to find area. Then there are the proposals for crime fighting apps, corruption reporting apps, etc. The connotation is that we can somehow 'tech (tek)' our way out of social problems whose root causes stem from the very lopsided distribution of resources, often done deliberately to maintain an entrenched class and power structure (same as most civilized places). I remember a number of our pundits boasting about how we are a now a technologically advanced society. I brought up the point that using technology and having the means to produce technology are not the same thing. No need to elaborate on how far that got. The other interesting bit is that there is often talk, at official ceremonies (graduations,conferences and the like) that the young people should strive to be like, Gates, or Steve choose your name, and aspire to bring about the next, mega tech company or what have you. There is almost no recognition and or appreciation that the info tech (as with most other high tech fields) industry is largely based in the US because of a massive support system in the form of infrastructure, large numbers of skilled personnel, and wealthy customer base, a large portion of which happens to be government spending tax dollars on what are, in many cases, superfluous products with very marginal utility.

I'll check him out as time permits. <br><br>Tortoise, the maintenance cost of every society's infrastructure rises faster than the production of wealth by that society. We may be wealthier in theory than people a century ago, but we have far more expenses to meet with that wealth than they did; in effect, therefore, we're poorer. <br><br>Moshe, I expect madness, futile violence, and death in too many such cases. It won't be pretty. <br><br>Grebulocities, exactly! That colony on Mars is the Second Coming of the great god Progress, and people cling to it the way Rapture believers cling to their misreading of the Book of Revelation. It's that, or admit that they've thrown away much of their lives on a delusion. <br><br>Donald, I think it's more complex than that. Conspiracy theories are to society roughly what paranoid schizophrenia is to the individual. <br><br>M, good for you. Illich was indeed worth studying, and I'd encourage all my readers to pick up his books and pay close attention. <br><br>GuRan, I'll know that sanity has finally gotten a look in when engineering papers begin by explaining that we're in deep trouble, and here's a way to mitigate one small piece of it. <br><br>Edde, bright gods. I had no idea MacDonald wrote SF at all. I guess it's my day to field such surprises; I also just learned that Tennessee Williams published a pulp-fantasy story in <i>Weird Tales</i>. <br><br>Tim, if SF is going to do anything but rehash the praises of the great god Progress, somebody is going to have to write the stories. I trust you're volunteering!<br><br>Nick, no argument there. Do you ever just turn off your phone and leave it off for a few days, without a Mexican desert to justify the act? I recommend it -- though, to be fair, I don't own a cell phone at all, and my internet access consists of a slow connection from a desktop machine that I use when I need to, and not otherwise. <br><br>Mister R., exactly. It fascinates me that so few people realize just how much social stress could be eliminated in short order by getting rid of the perverse incentives that encourage businesses to replace people with machines.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c8991758093931472480 title="comment permalink">9/10/14, 11:28 PM</a><br><br>

You get tonight's gold star for invoking the unspeakable: limits. (With special credit for mentioning the laws of thermodynamics.) Everything -- <b>everything</b> comes down to the reality of limits, and the gibbering insanity of trying to claim that they don't exist. <br><br>Mark, expect much more of that in the years ahead, as American decline becomes impossible to ignore. <br><br>Tom, I didn't see the movie so didn't think of that, but it's an excellent point. <br><br>Zachary, bingo. I can't think of any sane reason to buy something like that. <br><br>Dylan, compassion is a virtue; if it's the virtue that's most important to you, it's certainly your right and privilege to follow that path. Other people place other virtues at the center of their own journeys. <br><br>Makedoanmend, excellent. If I've given you a theme for contemplation, I'm doing my job. <br><br>Avery, funny. For my part, I think it would be great if the Mars One people were to be able to raise the funds to get to the red planet; listening to their ghastly fate from much too far away to do anything about it would teach a lot of people about the difference between a live planet and a dead one. <br><br>Marba, fascinating.

Since I was working in Library Land then, I found his chapter on libraries interesting.<br><br>Data migration was a big concern. Simply, the information on the software won't play nice with the new hardware. Information is lost or unreadable. <br><br>In our local newspaper today, someone showed up to a County Commissioners meeting to ask if it were true that the $1.1 million dollar computer system for the country, well, just didn't work. And, our county had signed something releasing the software company from liability if it didn't work. The only comment from the Commission was that the query was "politically motivated." The unraveling story ought to be quit interesting. The problem? Data migration. Or, the lack thereof. <br><br>Not a week goes by that some aspect of my life doesn't seem to be negatively impacted by some bit of shoddy technology. What gets me is that it seems your just supposed to shrug it off. Find a patch or a work around or just accept that whatever it is hasn't delivered on it's promise. All of which takes a lot of time and energy on my part.<br><br>As a quick example, my e-mail account wants me to beef up my password. All fine and good. That I did without to much pain. But then they want a mobile device number ... in case I loose my password. My breath is taken away by the sheer crazy making assumption that every one has a mobile device. I'm so far out that there's no reception. Internet yes. Cell phone, no. Landline, here. But not even the courtesy of a "If you don't have a mobile device, click here" button. So every time I sign in, I have to deal with the screen that keeps asking me for my mobile number. <br><br>I actually heard a report on the radio today (NPR?) about the iWatch. Instead of singing the praises of the new gizmo, the reporters were speculating on what it was actually good for. If you had a iPad or iPhone, why did you need something else to strap onto your wrist? Oh, and by the way, the thing doesn't work unless you have an iPhone or iPad in our pocket.

The tone in the video was very different from the starry-eyed enthusiasm you usually see from him.

The video really captures for me what you're describing here.<br><br>I think back to your reflections on the way people responded to "The Next Ten Billion Years." Back then you said that even if you gave us space and a few colonies on other moons and planets, a few asteroid mines and a space station or two it still wouldn't be enough. Also makes me think back to the grey light of morning when you talked about that divorce or move that'll solve everything once you get there.

They look maybe particularly at the issue of climate change.<br>ACKERMAN<br>Yes, that's true. And it's so important that people don't lose hope. We still have a lot of things that we can do. Climate change is absolutely real, it's urgent and we all need to get involved. But we can slow it down. It's not going to happen overnight. It may take several generations. And we can't afford to be complacent, but we're not helpless. We're not powerless. We're not doomed.<br><br>That kind of dismal mindset really isn't going to achieve anything. We can have a big say in designing the kind of planet that we want and that we need to survive. Now, I'm not, by any means, dismissing the risks that we face in the coming decades. But I really derive a lot of hope from stepping back and marveling at the human species, warts and all. We have been imaginative, strong-willed problem solvers.

I've had some positive encouragement and agreement from unexpected sources in the past month or so when I bring up our finite energy resources and the questionable viability of big-ticket "renewable" infrastructure projects. Unfortunately, my next thoughts are usually about myself, circa 2011, and the optimism and conviction I felt whenever I read about mirrors as big as the desert and oceans covered in wind turbines. I feel lucky now to have been disabused of those notions. More people are becoming aware of what's really in front of us, but others remain as convinced as ever that it's all going to be fine, OR that the perfect solutions are right there in front of us, and can't the "wrong" sorts of people would just get out of the way. <br><br>All this is to say that sooner rather than later we're going to have quite the hissing and spitting match going on over technological utopianism, and I think some surprisingly hostile lines are going to be drawn by the utopian-side.

His facts are quite well documented. There is a good summary of his points here:<br><br><a href=http://danwang.co/why-is-peter-thiel-pessimistic-about-technological-innovation/ rel=nofollow>http://danwang.co/why-is-peter-thiel-pessimistic-about-technological-innovation/</a><br><br>Of course the implicit message of Thiel is the polar opposite of yours - that we just aren't innovating <i>hard enough</i>, and that pesky things like regulations, environmental concerns and democracy (which Thiel and most libertarians are openly contemptuous of) are holding it back and need to be eliminated for our own good to keep progress going. The idea that maybe this stagnation is natural and inevitable, and that we should take a different path is anathema to them, especially since it threatens the source of their wealth and power.<br><br>Note that this stagnation has come at a time when innovation has become the most common buzzword today, entrepreneurship is celebrated as an end in itself, digital wizards are feted as demigods, and countless billions of dollars of wealth formally belonging to the wider society (and created by that wider society) have been shoveled at people like Thiel and his ilk. Yet all it has resulted in for eighty percent of us is working harder and harder for less. Most people can barely pay for housing or medical care anymore.<br><br>The first smallpox vaccines were deployed before the 1800's and drastically reduced infant mortality rates. Today, we spend an average of six figures and deploy space-age technology to keep eighty-year-olds alive for a few more months. Diminishing returns indeed.<br><br>But I would suggest it's not superstition. It's a subset of superstition. It's cargo cult thinking - the idea that if we just mimic the behavior of the past, we will engender the same results without looking at the ultimate causes. The lionization of entrepreneurship in particular, with its apotheosis of people like Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and Steve Jobs, seems to me like Melanesian islanders constructing hangars out of palm trees and radio towers of bamboo.<br><br>Also of interest might be this recent article in the Atlantic, which makes many points familiar to readers of the Archdruid Report: "Is Progress Good For Humanity?"<br><br><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/09/the-industrial-revolution-and-its-discontents/379781/?single_page=true" rel=nofollow>http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/09/the-industrial-revolution-and-its-discontents/379781/?single_page=true</a><br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c231535365491304205 title="comment permalink">9/11/14, 8:51 AM</a><br><br>

PublicAffairs.</i><br><br>Of course, they had their grumpy curmudgeons even back then<br><br><i>In 1889, the Spectator, one of the empire’s finest publications, chided the telegraph for causing “a vast diffusion of what is called ‘news,’ the recording of every event, and especially of every crime, everywhere without perceptible interval of time.

Sure, I grew up with Star Trek, but the SF novels I was reading at the same time rarely presented comparably rosy futures. At one extreme were Clarke's <i>Childhood's End</i> and his novelization of <i>2001</i>, both consummate exemplars of the progress narrative. Each ushered humanity "to infinity and beyond" but at the cost of obsoleting human life as we know it. <i>Childhood's End</i>was the second full-length SF novel I ever read. The first was <i>The Andromeda Strain</i> and the third was <i>THX-1138</i>. Overall, a very mixed bag! Mostly, though, the advanced technology in SF novels just went wrong and killed people. <i>Westworld</i> was as doomed to disastrous malfunction as <i>Jurassic Park</i> a generation later.<br><br>Possibly, being willing to do the math insulated me from interpreting fantasies as promises. The closest to the latter I can recall is a song from a Sesame Street album from the early seventies, "Someday, Little Children," whose three verses respectively predicted "living on the moon," "people won't get sick no more," and everyone "living in peace and love." Who would be doing these? As the song says, "it <i>might</i> be you, little children." A regrettable but perhaps useful lesson on the importance of paying attention to qualifiers, such as when you get announcements in the mail that you <i>might</i> have won a sweepstakes. At around the same time, some of the early short SF stories of George R.R. Martin such as <i>Bitterblooms</i>, <i>Starlady</i>, and <i>The Stone City</i> were turning space travel stories into a form of existential horror, merely by taking the times and distances involved in traversing deep space (even if you did have reliable spaceships) seriously.<br><br>But the balance has indeed clearly shifted. As you don't follow television or most recent movies, you might not realize the current pervasiveness of the narrative pessimism the Hieroglyph folks are responding to. (This in no way undermines your explanations of the causes, just emphasizes the degree to which they're acting.)<br><br>In the original Star Trek series, Captain Kirk was often insubordinate because Starfleet's rules, however well-meaning, were too restrictive to let him solve the problem. In the reboot Star Trek movies, Captain Kirk is often insubordinate because Starfleet has been corrupted by some evil faction or another. Instead of arriving from the depths of uncharted space, the giant space amoebas have become home-grown.<br><br>If I turn on the television to a random channel and see a scene of dirty and dissheveled (but still devastatingly attractive) young people wandering through what looks like a sheet-metal shanty-town or refugee camp, with everyone carrying slung assault weapons, it could be any of half a dozen currently running science fiction series set in ruined futures. Defiance, The 100, Revolution, Falling Skies, and The Walking Dead are the titles I can recall at the moment. (Having seen zero to two episodes of each, I find them hard to tell apart, at least until I see which flavor of mutants, aliens, or undead show up to interrupt the beleaguered heroes' inter-personal dramas.) The routine conspicuous bearing of arms puts one in mind of the old TV Westerns, but it occurs to me that in these new Westerns, most of the heroes are in the approximate situations of the natives in the Westerns of a generation or two ago, facing occupying forces of either greater numbers, superior technology, or both.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c1473297586902788100 title="comment permalink">9/11/14, 11:38 AM</a><br><br>

Teens are being oppressed and enslaved and sacrificed everywhere you look.<br><br>There's even a YA Feudal Japanese Steampunk Fantasy series (beginning with <i>Stormdancer</i>, by Jay Kristoff) that directly allegorizes oil dependence and environmental destruction. The eclectic mix of technology in the setting, which includes dirigible airships and powered Samurai armor, runs on a liquid fuel ("chi") that's made from a plant crop ("blood lotus") that poisons the soil where it grows. The pollution from the extensive cultivation and use of the fuel has made most wildlife extinct over most of the Japan-like islands of the setting. It also causes a pervasive black-lung-like disease, and has turned the sky red worldwide. Continued cultivation, in the polluted environment, requires a fertilizer ("inochi") which, unknown initially to most of the populace, is made from the bodies of murdered foreign prisoners, requiring continuous overseas wars of aggression to maintain the supply.<br><br>The rebel heroes are fighting the existing system of government, military, and industrial interests (the Shogunate and the "Lotus Guild") that maintains the blood lotus cultivation. They're not supporting a True King or trying to maintain their (already long-gone) way of life, but trying to stave off complete ecological collapse that the powers that be are too locked into their system to see or escape the inevitability of. The allegory is not subtle. The blood lotus is even, in addition to everything else, an addictive drug.<br><br>Oddly, no online review or discussion of the series I've seen has made mention of that aspect of the books. It's all "ooh, a girl who rides a griffin" and "ooh, chainsaw katanas." Either the allegory is going unnoticed, or its meaning is being simply accepted as a plausible and familiar state of affairs. It's still likely that some sort of (probably magical) Space Bats will save the day in the end (the series is in progress) but still, there it is.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c5708098952055836942 title="comment permalink">9/11/14, 11:40 AM</a><br><br>

You can always tell that you're watching one of those because so many of them begin in the exact same way, with stock footage of atom bombs exploding or V2 rockets taking off, followed by a solemn narrator (either Paul Frees or someone doing their best impression of him) talking about "Since the splitting of the atom blah blah blah". <br><br>At the time I was watching these (the 1990's) these movies seemed very dated not because they were optimistic about the future potential of technology, but because they always seemed to place so much unquestioned faith in the competence and good intentions of military and governmental leaders and in our system of government versus the communists. But the idea of "progress" that they also advanced still seemed blatantly self-evident at the time. The depiction of that progress seemed silly and tacky, but the idea that it was happening and would continue was obvious.<br><br>Recently I've had the opportunity to catch up with a lot of those films, movies like THE PHANTOM PLANET and ROCKETSHIP X-M, and in the past twenty years they have aged worse than they did in the forty years that passed between when they were first made and when I first saw them. Back then they were living dreams in an outdated container.

MacDonald was the very first exposure I had to the themes of peak resource availability. Interestingly, it was in a Travis McGee novel - I <i>think</i> perhaps <i>The Scarlet Ruse</i>, but I really can't recall. Decades ago.<br><br>The presentation of ideas that would be familiar and unremarkable to readers of this blog, but were appalling back then, came in typical backhanded MacDonald fashion. At the beginning of the book, Travis McGee's friend Meyer, and economist who lives aboard a neighboring houseboat, was solemnly, and not without upset, describing an international economics conference he had just attended. At this conference, the presented theme had been that there simply would never be enough resources in the world to bring all of the people on the planet - and remember, this was written in 1973 or so - up to the standard of living enjoyed by Americans and Europeans.<br><br>Travis was shocked and skeptical; but Meyer had been persuaded by the mathematics. It was a distinctly gloomy (and of course beautifully written) scene.<br><br>Later, the two friends went water skiing with a particularly gorgeous and skilled woman... an idylllic, exultant afternoon, which came as a real <i>carpe diem</i> whiplash.<br><br>I was disturbed by the fictional Meyer's recounting of the perhaps fictional conference; and it was obvious even to my young boat-bum stoner self that the issue was very real. Over the years it dwindled away, but now that I recall it, that was the single event that started me on my long strange trip to wherever "here" is...<br><br>John D. MacDonald.

It’s not quite progress or apocalypse, and it seems rooted in some other story, one that’s definitely rooted in a sense of unease about the future. Stories like that are going viral right now, and they’re trickling more and more into real, buzz on the streets fears of the future. Robots, drones, and automated weapons, unlike the soldiers and police officers you’ve mentioned in the past, aren’t subject to mimesis and don’t change loyalties. And it’s entirely possible that some of those suites of technology could remain viable for a long time. It’s a hard image to shake: pockets of civilization living on in plastic, saccharine 21st century luxury and keeping resources flowing in from subsistence peasants in the surrounding countryside who they placate with media entertainments and propaganda, or a totalitarian government using surveillance technology to exercise complete control over information and listen in on even the most privately held conversations.

Something must be afoot for there to be so very many. <br> As for our dystopian zeitgeist, it very much reminds me of the emotions of the world in 1913 and early 1914 when many talked about not being able to bear the strain of the coming cataclysm that everyone could feel approaching. Taylor writes about about how people wept in relief and embraced strangers on the street when the Great War finally broke loose. Few realized that rather than the longed for release the War would result in the death of so many millions.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c3041439324793774456 title="comment permalink">9/11/14, 2:23 PM</a><br><br>

Depends how you use it. I was a long-time holdout, but now have one. It's handy for special occasions or emergencies. And being a "smart" phone I can do other things with it besides communications, e.g., help tune a musical instrument, display a street map (offline!), etc.<br><br>With the right service plan it's cheap ($3/month for me), and the phone itself was only $40 because it was used and two years old when I bought it, i.e., "obsolete". 99% of the time I have it in "airplane mode", i.e., I will not let it take over my life, I prefer being out of reach at times.<br><br>I find the "airplane mode on" nomenclature revealing: it should be called "cellphone service off" mode.

There are an awful lot of people who are glued to their electronic gadgets and not just millennials either. But there are also a surprisingly large number of young people who are into organic gardening, DIY and that sort of thing as well. The still like their gadgets, but understand that things are changing and that they need to make preparations for the Long Descent, even if they don’t consciously understand what is happening and why. The fact that so many young people are being dumped face first into the downside of Hubbert’s Peak is acting as a wake up call for many. Its people like that which give me hope for the future. As for the rest, well, that’s one of the ways Darwinian selection and bottleneck events work. It’s both sobering and scary as hell, but there it is. That train left the station long ago and its barreling down the tracks with no brakes heading for a washed out bridge…<br><br>Among my neighbors are a young couple with a three year old son who live right down the street. They are both devout Christians and are also avid organic gardeners who are making the effort to learn traditional crafts like sewing, canning and woodworking. While they are socially and politically conservative, they are also involved in the anti-GMO and anti-globalization movements. Indeed some of the most dedicated anti-GMO and anti-globalization activists I have ever met are conservative, even traditionalist Christians. Likewise, I have often had greater success discussing issues like Peak Oil and the Long Descent with conservative Christians and Jews than with supposedly “progressive” liberals and leftists.<br><br>Speaking of this and the new religious sensibility that was discussed late last year, I recently met a young lady at my favorite locally owned and operated coffee shop. She is a devout Christian, but she also feels very strongly that our society’s insane ideology of growth and development at all costs and the wholesale ecological destruction that has been the result is an act of sacrilege against God. She asks; why would we so wantonly and selfishly destroy God’s beautiful creations and replace them with a bunch of cheap plastic junk, ugly strip malls and suburban McHouses that look like they all got stamped from the same cookie cutter? I think I can already see some early signs of how the Abrahamic religions will adapt to the emerging religious sensibility, and I think a few of the posters from last weeks essay made the same point as well.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c7609029988030623 title="comment permalink">9/11/14, 3:23 PM</a><br><br>

Yet nowadays everytime I check Ray Kurzweil's futurism website, I can find at least one occurence of the verb Could in every header of every piece of news. When you first find about the website, and you can see it updated more than twice a week with everending news stories about such and such discoveries... But after a while, the pattern becomes pretty clear : it is just a bunch of experimental results that happen to work for a very specific effect in a very specific environment... There is never any thought about how it actually Could streamline onto the economy. When you deal with theoretical science, that is understandable. But with technology... In Ray Kurzweil's world, there is seldom any reflecting on economics, or with the politics of who will get access to what technology. There were some pieces of news about Ebola, which probably go to show how serious of an issue it is.<br>The use of the verb "Could" is part of the incantation. This word is the link between the almost imaginary/dreamlike world of nano/bio-tech labs and the real world. It is the equivalent of the phrases "forecast", "innovation", "futures" and "potential" in the world of economics. I guess a pretty simple counterspell would be the word "actually", but its emotional payload is generally harder to digest.<br><br>Now as for science-fiction's mythos, there is a political dimension to technology : SF stories of the 50's are mostly, if I remember well, about specially trained personnel or scientists using their technology to travel across space or to perform other miracles. There is little consideration of how the technology will change the social dynamics, or how it will be spread across a wider population. That hidden agenda of taking technicalities away from people's grasp probably emanates from the glorification of scientists, and it has been pretty succesfully implemented. A few examples of the obvious : cars you can no longer repair yourself, thanks to embedded electronics and careful specialization of every model's tiny plastic bit's shape... Frozen food, almost 10 US dollars here in Paris for takeaway pasta in a box ! Yeah, boiling pasta is even above the average French executive's culinary skills or time available nowadays.<br>From this standpoint, we now have the opportunity to reclaim all the tech that has gone out of our hands. It will involve a lot of human labour... My parents regularly point to me that when they were young, they had access to a lot of small jobs but that few of the young people nowadays would be willing to take them. But I want to reclaim the right to know how to make fermented foods, etc ! So there will be a lot of technologies in my life, technologies I participate i rather than suffer from.<br><br>That reclaiming will be varyingly agressive as times exert varingly strong pressures on people's abilities to feed themselves.<br>I suspect the decomplexification and reappropriation of tool mastery will turn into one of the hot buttons of politics and cultural change. The repartition of rarefying needs for human labour thanks to rampant automatization is already the biggest challenge we face right now, in times of affluence of the rich Western nations. Redefining what effort/work means will be a bottleneck in our overall adaptation to future circumstances. How fast and accurately we can redefine those concepts could very well determine how fast and safely we adapt to future circumstances.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c2495220273763511682 title="comment permalink">9/11/14, 3:36 PM</a><br><br>

We barely care what happens a 100 years from now, I doubt we'll care what will happen in a 100,000.

I recently went searching for and reread a blog you wrote that dealt with the biosphere dividend. So, this subject has been on my mind lately. The law of diminishing returns has also come up when I try to explain why we can't get enough rare earth metals for all our gadgets and renewables. Someone told me not to worry because they are not rare, just incredibly diffuse. Of course, I compared this to getting rich by extracting gold from seawater. A good example of people trying to create technical solutions while ignoring basic economics. <br><br>I have always found Star Trek intolerably boring. I don't consume a lot of popular media (weening myself off), but I rather enjoyed the first few seasons of the Doctor Who reboot. Some people find it too unbelievable, but I don't find any sci-fi very convincing. I always find myself thinking about things like time dilation etc. So for me the show really hangs a lamp shade on some common sci-fi tropes.

You learn much more by drawing geometrical constructions by hand than you do by generating them on a screen -- I've done both, and taught people to do both, so I can speak from experience here. The human brain is not used to disembodied images disconnected from physical movement, and doesn't process them as well -- at least that's my impression. <br><br>Michael, glad to hear it, and thank you!<br><br>Ursachi, good question. It might just possibly manage a few launches, but I wouldn't advise betting on it. <br><br>Myriad, science fiction used to explore difficult futures all the time. Many of the classic SF stories of the genre's golden age have nothing in common with the sort of airbrushed optimism Project Hieroglyph is trying to promote.

It does seem eerily familiar, doesn't it? As for the for sale signs, remind me where you live. <br><br>Ray, I wonder what it's going to take to get people to give up the fantasy that things have to get better in one way or another. That's far from a universal human belief; it's the specific fetish of industrial humanity, and it's been a fertile source of misery and failure. Social and spiritual progress, to my mind, is just as much of a delusion as any other; the world is what it is, and if you want it to change, <i>you must change it yourself</i> -- and there's no guarantee you will succeed, either. Once we get back to that realization, it might just be possible to accomplish something, but until then...<br><br>Wolf, only because we've neglected that sphere for so long that there's a certain amount of low-hanging fruit. What if we start instead from the recognition that the universe is under no obligation to give us a better <i>anything</i>?<br><br>Kaitain, I've had conversations with devout Christians who are deep into the new sensibility; there just aren't many of them yet. That's one of the reasons I say that the question of which religious forms will be central in dark age America hasn't yet been settled. <br><br>Random Man, true enough -- and that means that much of what stocks the nonrational part of people's heads, the part that determines their tastes and feelings and unthinking assumptions, is as delusory as any lunatic's ravings. <br><br>Hadashi, glad to hear it!<br><br>Nathaniel, that's brilliant -- "Mars is already worse off than Earth would be after a global nuclear war." I don't often give out two gold stars in a night, but that's worth one. <br><br>Ed-M, I've been wondering about that too. I had one half-coherent denunciation last night, but the cornucopian trolls have otherwise been noticeable by their absence so far. <br><br>Cathy, only $400K a year -- oh, how they must be suffering! ;-)<br><br>Rene, I've assumed all along -- based on paleoclimatic analogues -- that we'd get disruptive climate change much faster than the IPCC estimates suggested. Thus my timetable remains in place -- if anything, I'm surprised that things are still moving so slowly on the climate front.<br><br>Bear, excellent!

For a while I was the lone nut, telling this to my coworkers, but recently a nurse practitioner who takes an interest in breast cancer, spoke to some of the women I work with and said the same thing. As for children, not only are they young and growing, their skulls are thinner.<br><br>And here's an interesting teeny tiny thing. I just got back from visiting my two-year-old grandson, to whom I brought a set of wonderful old wooden puzzles of high quality that they don't make anymore (It's not just that I like saving money in thrift stores, it's like a treasure hunt of unexpected bonanzas like puzzles from my childhood that you can't find anyway.). This child was born with a couple of the 7 deadly sins, and becomes frustrated easily. Pudgy little hands try to put the piece in place but it has to line up exactly, and if you try to push it hard when it isn't lined up it only gets skewed, then the little guy decides it wasn't the right piece after all. His mom tells me that his tiny game device has a matching the shapes game, but you know on computers, once you get your thingie rather close, it snaps in place electronically.

Infrastructure is good, rail-based. Memory how to adapt to pre-industrial living in any given environment is not that far away. With radical re-localization programs, by trying to revitalize local small scale workshops, agriculture and community works there would be a lot positive things to help people get through hard times. At individual level that is happening, but institutional level is not only passive towards this trend, it tries to pull the cart to other direction. Localization would demand giving up these grandiose dreams about being "soft superpower" a la European Union. What a bureaucratic monstrosity that thing has become, like some some Lovecraftian monster born out of originally bright dreams.<br><br>It stands on the clay legs, and also from my point of view accelerates dysfunctional political habits among European elites. Now this "looking into great distances"-policy is backlashing, as little people and local communities which could be springboard for more controlled localization in near future, feel abandoned and abused by big politics. People are turning for whatever they have, and what we have no shortage here are local, strong and unfortunately often sectarian identities. Irony of history is that as elites of EU are concerned with Great Game in the east, troubles are brewing right on their own houses. <br><br>Is the path I described only possible one? No. Is probability of that kind of situation rising with current political decision non-making and EU's empire-dreaming?

Somehow they don't seem too delighted by the thought. <br><br>Tom, I've noted more than once that Ferguson is perhaps the most uneven of our current historians; sometimes he's clueless, sometimes he's spot on. This time he's spot on. Thanks for the link!<br><br>Onething, the trick there is that you have to stop. Don't build a new cathedral every twenty years, or a new stone bridge every fifty. Figure out what you can afford to maintain, and don't build anything beyond that.

Rail connections and the other advantages Europe might otherwise have mean nothing if everyone's fighting to the death along ethnic and religious lines. I think you're quite right that this may well be what happens in Europe, but it's worth recalling what typically happens in history to regions that get caught up in internecine warfare: someone else conquers them.

We exchanged pleasantries and it eventually got into a discussion of what our life goals were and our passions. His was artificial intelligence. He then went almost immediately to list out a litany of benefits unprompted to artificial intelligence. One of them was regulation of the stock market. He said with a future artificial intelligence system, it could better detect and regulate the stock market to a point preventing a crash like what occurred in 2008. It never once occurred to him that the problem with the stock market wasn't a lack of competent regulators, it was the fact the rules allowed such risky behavior that caused the crash to begin with! Same spiel with him regarding any social ill. Abusive police officers? Just stick a camera in the back of your car! Poverty? Just give the poor a 3D printer (really...). What was extra odd about that guy was he seemed to have no interest in going to a university, despite having an advanced degree is a necessity to get into those fields. In fact he seemed to live in pretty deprived conditions, living in a dump in Arkansas. This techno optimism seem to fill an almost religious utopianism role for him, rather than just a misguided sociological impulse. He's not the only one like this. You can take sometime and peruse the subreddit /r/futurology and you'll find a crowd of mostly millennials going on and on about some glorious robot future, singularity, yadda yadda.<br><br>On the flipside, there's certainly a lot of millennials who want to move beyond such thinking. Lots of us are rediscovering the joy of actual physical interaction! Physical meetups and organized activities are making a comeback. Though even then you get some "futurist" who says the solution to social isolation is creating more virtual realities, rather than just uh, getting people to do things together.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c1779020170572453359 title="comment permalink">9/12/14, 12:55 AM</a><br><br>

Especially in Western Europe it feels to me that upper and lower echelons of society are nowadays living in parallel dimensions, where two different realities share same physical space. When expectations and values of upper part, practically dominating media, contradict with reality in lower echelon, this "lower" reality is shrugged aside. As a result there are absurd things like current Rotherham child abuse scandal, where over 1400, mostly White working class, children were sexually abused by immigrant gang over period of decade. There seems to have been extensive cover-up by police, because they feared allegations of racism more than they wanted to protect those children. This kind of incidents, and this is trend not exception, have of course reflection in other side of the fence too, among parents and communities of those abused children. Slowly their opinions harden, and they eventually shall turn to some other facet than official police for protection. Who can really blame them? In that kind of situation everyone just have to fight for his/her own group. It's really that simple. <br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal<br><br>So I actually believe like you do that there is high probability for Western Europe to slide slowly towards vicious, low-intensity conflict between religious-ethnic blocks. Opinions and actions on both sides harden as economy continues to decline. It's not my wish, that's just the way I see world. Who is going to collect spoils of war, that's beyond my range of vision. If you believe it's going to be some outsider, maybe, but you should provide some references to back up that hunch. <br><br>You know, believing that peak oil is inescapable reality and that renewables are not going to save us makes one very unpopular person when it comes to his opinions... Believing that seeds of identity conflict are already sowed into soil of Europe is just other unpopular opinion. So should I just change my opinion about peak oil too, to avoid offending anyone's feelings, even if my opinion is based on analyzing events and evidence not in political/religious zealotry..? <br><br>I don't live in Western Europe. I do not see myself as participant in that potential future conflict. I just hope that Eastern Europe shall choose other path than Western part, for it's own sake. I I think West's destiny was forged by very bad decisions made decades ago, and now we are just seeing those decisions bearing bloom. Probably embracing market liberalism and open borders were worst of those mistakes, but these last ones are just value-based opinion of mine. <br><br>I didn't mean to offend anyone with observation about tomorrow's conflicts on display through today's hooliganism. I have no political wish for that observation to be true. Yet I believe there exists certain symmetry between unofficial, intensifying public displays of sectarian loyalism and nature of political challenges that given society is going to face in near-future. If I am proven to be wrong here, that there exists no such symmetry, I gladly change my opinion.<br><br>And this insanity caused by modernism and it's twilight, it shall have it's sibling in New World also. So do not turn august concerning European sectarianism too soon. Group identities and flags they rally around shall not be same, but the behavior shall be familiar from those hooliganism videos. Dark Ages are nasty business and we all are same species after all. Now I truly drop this subject, with gloomy feeling that I unintentionally insulted some readers of this blog ways I don't actually grasp even now by comments I made in last week's post.

The idea of a life without fresh air, sunshine, and all the other things we take for granted planet side was just unappealing. <br><br>Why is it a religion to them?

They all believe that they will be the gods who bring life to dead worlds, crafting that life in their own images. <br><br>On one point I disagree with your other readers. No one on this board is a pessimist. We're all realists that tend toward optimism. We believe that the conversations we are having and the work we are doing will help those that come after, we believe in our legacies. I would argue that we believe with a much firmer conviction that our legacies are important, that caring for the earth and our communities is important, than the true believers of the cult of progress. <br><br>The one trend I've seen in all the peak oil sci-fi that your readers have produced is that they all tend toward acceptance of bad things, but also accept there is continuity.

This is exhibited by the sci-fi authors being able to create whatever wondrous alien world they desire, only being limited by their own imagination. The discoverer however is limited, when the appollo missions go to thet moon the discovering only the barren wasteland which is moon. The discover is limited to only being able to discover that which is already there. <br><br>What is not fully realized in the modern world is that our relationship to technology is not that of the creator of it, but that of it's discoverer. When science fiction writers, writes about say fusion reactors they can simply create such a technology, and then that technology will work. If a nuclear physicist wishes to "create" a fusion reactor however they have to deal with all the vagaries off nuclear physics and everything else which goes into the creation of such a reactor, none of which the nuclear physicist has any control over, the "laws" of physics were not created by him/her, they simply have to deal with the ones given. Their exists a set of possible designs for workable fusion reactors, nothing human being can do is capable of either increasing, nor decreasing that set, the best we can do is to discover a member of it. This of course means that if that set is empty, tough luck.<br><br>I think this is the problem main problem in how people think about technology in the modern world. The assumption seems to be that if we have a problem (say we're driving off an energy cliff) then we can create new technology to deal with that problem. We can't all we can do is discover a possible technology which can help us, if such a thing exists, and then only after looking through a potentially infinite set of designs which don't work.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c8871910165795682387 title="comment permalink">9/12/14, 9:47 AM</a><br><br>

Facing nightfall with a true wizard for guidance is a great comfort.”<br><br>When the dreams that humanity would one day have a life among the stars really gave way to a reality of continual earthly fate for me it brought about a despair but lead eventually to a kind of peace. It was a very confusing and difficult time. Like most of my generation (I am 51) I hold a deeply emotional pride that the U.S. was able to unite its best and brightest engineers and scientists and have them dedicate themselves to an achievement for all mankind, so that one July afternoon they succeed in landing a man on the moon, placing a human footprint on a world other than our own. I learned just how deep the emotion ran when I had the chance to shake hands with an astronaut while visiting the Kennedy Space Center with my family. In that handshake the space program became real and tears rolled down my cheeks for many long minutes from a glow that held our fragile species in a warm embrace. It was a joy in the potential for “goodness” within humankind; this was a feat of peace, not war. My more rational side understands there were mixed motives, plenty of selfish profit seeking and the usual quota of chasing after fame and glory that accompanies any human endeavor in the real world. There was even a war element, as they said, "We basically put a guy on top of a nuclear missile and lit the fuse."<br><br>But, but, it did happen in the real world. Not a SF story but right there on our TV screens. Astonishing. With such a feeling lodged in my breast it is not hard to understand why it is so tempting for some to think that if only the U.S. could get its act together and launch another Apollo-like program to get us off carbon fuels all would be well. I get the allure, but my reason cannot go there.<br><br>I read Catton’s masterpiece ‘Overshoot’ years ago, worked through Derrick Jensen’s writings, ‘The Party’s Over’ by Heinberg the year it was published and have been following our host on this blog almost since inception. When the probability of humans ever traveling among the stars dissolved into empty space, well, it was as if someone had taken the hope and left just the despair.<br> <br>At first. <br><br>Slowly the love for the earth grew stronger, clearer, less confused. Every element of my being is born from the cycle of things right here. Every experience of love and sorrow has all occurred right here. There is a Tibetan Buddhist song to the world that sings, “World we live and die on your lap, on you we experience all our woes and joys, you are our ancestral home of old, forever we cherish and adore you.” I have the power to change some things and can be at peace with the rest. In that surrender I found those things I can change are the very things that matter the most for creating a meaningful life, right in the middle of the horrors of the ecological crises. <br><br>Thank you JMG for your contribution to my little waking up.<br><br>More at – mindfulecology dot com.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c790752252847543159 title="comment permalink">9/12/14, 9:49 AM</a><br><br>

This instrument has 6 finger holes and no keys (levers with pads allowing for more notes). It and its more sonorous big brothers the keyless “Irish” flute and the lower D whistle are just about the lowest technology and lowest cost musical instruments you could conceive of. No strings, slides, valves, or reeds; just a fipple or your lips and some well placed holes in a metal or wooden tube.<br><br>Far from being stuck in one key (D major), one cross fingered note (C natural) allows for 2 major keys (D and G) each with 3 associated modes (tonic on 2nd, 5th, and 6th step of the major scales). This allows for a total of 8 different keys/modes/scales to play tunes on. This is quite sufficient to play an entire genre of richly melodic music. <br><br>Of course you could go higher tech and add some keys to the flute. Doing so provides new notes with some diminished speed and possible different articulations (these being integral to the way the music is currently played) from the simple finger holes. These new notes also come at the cost of more care and maintenance, more to go wrong, vastly increased price, and greater fragility of the instrument. You get more notes (that you mostly don't need) but at a very high cost technically, financially, and in terms of resilience.<br><br>What is true for traditional Irish music I suspect is also true for most traditional (pre-tempered scale) music. The limitations in range (2 octaves tops generally) and scales of the older instruments just forced musical creativity into different (not worse or better) directions. So it will be as we descend Hubbert's Curve. The greater limitations of life will (for those who still have it) “just” force their creativity in other directions. These directions will be the ones that work with the greater limitations of life in the future.<br><br>On an even more tangential note, Irish flute playing is said to have really taken off when the Boehm flute (a fully keyed chromatic instrument capable of playing in three octaves and any musical key) made older system flutes obsolete … and so within the limited financial range of typically impoverished Irish musicians. Thus, ironically, advances in musical instrument technology in the mid 1800s resulted in inexpensive cast offs which helped reinvigorated traditional music just at the time it was expected to die.<br><br>On the other hand, Jazz music would be largely impossible to play on non-chromatic instruments. Greater complexity of instruments did not prove to be a case of diminishing returns for Jazz. Indeed, just the opposite is the case; Jazz is the product of that complexity. And so Jazz may prove to be a genre of music than is shorter lived due to the technical requirements of the necessary instruments making them very expensive in the future. If so, Jazz would be an example of a “progress trap”. Basically it, as well as all electronic and amplified music, would be human activities that prove to be a dead ends due to their dependence on relatively high tech. Music will continue nonetheless.<br><br>Perhaps these examples are trivial, but I think this sort of division between low tech activities that endure and high tech progress traps may be found throughout all the areas of activities in industrial societies.<br><br>And now its time to scythe some rye to thatch the roof of my tool shed.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c4086746687513300460 title="comment permalink">9/12/14, 12:56 PM</a><br><br>

There is a faint memory from my childhood of a map in a post apocalyptic RPG book.<br><br>http://www.gammaworld.us/FourthEdition/images/meriga.jpg<br><br>Behold! With this prompt I have found the long faint image! The city of Troyt in Meriga, I wonder if any similar map might have influenced Star's Reach? This memory has been trying to surface for a couple weeks.<br><br>@JMG<br><br>The Science Fiction farce that is the target of this post speaks ill of our cultures ability to make use of stories for thinking generally. For example when I first started thinking about decline I was hyper focused on the technological limits, this is a caricature of the process thus far. <br><br>The first question was "can solar or thorium fill in for fossil?" It didn't take much research to find that it couldn't. I responded by trying to envision and enact a life that was as rich as possible, sans the technologies that follow from fossil use. This proved to be insufficiently deep, because economic limits quickly shredded those plans. <br><br>Then the second question "What is economically viable during contraction?" Much improved, because with two data points it became a flow rather than an ideal of an ideal life. Focus on trying to enact likely scarcity economic activities followed. Quickly I found that in current conditions it is not economically viable, because there is no demand, and any productivity I have managed has inevitably created 'too many sandwiches'. I received too much praise of the idea of throwing into such projects, and then too little interest in participating. I profited some skills, and experience, and a few veggies, but I found that there is no economy going alone. Also I found any economic productivity requires investment, so often pursuing these activities is a net loss. Today I find that many tasks I can do skillfully are not worth the energy of biking to the place with the tools.<br><br>These questions took into account the Old Church of progress's world view, namely materialism. But they did not confront the issues from the New Denomination. "Why aren't more people moved to try disconnecting from the system that they hate on with every third utterance?" One might focus on the blinder stories that people receive, but more important I believe to notice the lack of other stories. Original thoughts are like original cultivars of a crop; one can't get anywhere with out enough genetic material to breed from. The soothing activities that avoid developing new seed stocks of ideas are very pervasive among tech and spirituals progressives both; we need to sow weeds into those fields!<br><br>The preference for capital intensive stories (movie, video games, albums, even publishing) I think is a core challenge. It tends to support mono-cultures of ideas adapted to the medium. But I think this weekend I will be play testing an RPG I am developing to explore narratives which I am hoping will better represent our circumstances, and hopefully even be inspiring.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c3859919431048814067 title="comment permalink">9/12/14, 1:16 PM</a><br><br>

The rat in question is the company he worked for from 1991 through 2001. Under the terms of the union contract in place when he resigned (the terms under which his pension benefit is calculated and distributed), he would not receive his pension for another four years. However, for a limited time (yes, it used this phrase), he has the opportunity to elect to receive a lump-sum payment of his accrued pension benefit later this fall, rather than taking it as an annuity under the usual rules. After telling him this, the letter goes on to say that he could instead elect to begin receiving the monthly pension benefit this fall, with the same limited time to make the decision. The company has opened a dedicated Pension Service Center to answer any questions he has about this opportunity. When we got the package containing the details and forms for the various options, the order was the same: lump sum first, then start monthly payments this fall, then do nothing.<br><br>The way it reads to us is that the company would very much like for as many of its potential pension recipients as possible to take the money and run, thus allowing it to adjust its pension liability for its remaining potential retirees closer to what it can actually fund. Hence the emphasis on the lump-sum payment and the oh-by-the-way phrasing of the monthly benefit option.

You might want to re-think your celebration of paper checks as opposed to the digital economy. Thanks to a daughter who worked for a bank for eight years, I know that paper checks ARE a part of the digital economy. If you live in a small town, there's a chance your local business might put your check in the till and carry it off to the bank to the deposit - but there's just as much a chance they won't. A growing number of small businesses, and all large business, process your check in the same way they would process your debit/credit card. (I have considered doing this myself - get the machine and process checks at home instead of driving 30 miles into the town where my money lives.)<br><br>Even if you deal with businesses who don't electronically process, their bank, when your check gets there, most certainly does. So ultimately, your paper becomes digital currency. If you want to avoid digital currency - then avoid paper checks.<br><br>I have grown increasingly nostalgic for the days of actual money (I was born the same year as JMG), but there are huge barriers to going back to that use. There would be no way to pay my house payment; paying my utility bill with cash would require a drive of 120 miles. Ditto with other services. Still, I have been gradually working my way back to cash as much as I can.<br><br>To Bill Pulliam - not sure why the popularity, but Newt Gingrich was/is a big proponent of the dangers of a Carrington Event, and he has a lot of influence.<br><br>It appears I left my back door open, so now I need to go shoo the chickens out of the house.<br><br>Trish<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c7957703330809293815 title="comment permalink">9/12/14, 5:01 PM</a><br><br>

I can tell you, the answer is no. A couple of years back I stopped into the locally owned hipster coffee shop, with two college age girls behind the counter. It was a slow day, with storms in the area. I was the only one in the shop. Just as I finished grinding my coffee, the power went out. I sealed my bag and went to the counter and took out my cash. The girls looked at me funny, and said they could not ring me up. Didn't I see the power was out? "We don't know the price of the coffee." I pointed out the price was on the big chalk board behind them.... Long story short, I had to show them how to weigh the bag on the old manual scale, convert the fractional part of the weight to decimal, and multiply by the price on the board for my type of coffee. They had no idea even of a concept of the process! College age! Neither of them! I am afraid a lot of this generation is far too used to having a gizmo do all the work. They were apparently not capable of doing anything beyond plopping a bag on the electronic scale and pushing a number that told the register which type of coffee it was. Not a thought as to how to do it "in real life" ever even crossed their minds. They just expect technology to solve problems for them.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c2316965875785538876 title="comment permalink">9/12/14, 7:04 PM</a><br><br>

To deal with being different, I made some posters with handdrawn illustrations and handwritten quotes related to this. My teacher relunctantly allowed me to decorate the too barren walls with them. One of my posters read: “Optimize your learning capacity. Boycott the graphing calculator. Do it by hand. Or do it by foot.” (with my illustrations of a hand writing out a math problem, and then a foot holding a pencil and doing the same…).

I offered references from real world how splintering of civic society has started to form new, less civil identities in many areas of Europe I have visited. And that it might have some consequences for this Green Wizardry project on said areas. I kind offered proof for my point, nothing else. So I pointed to this ongoing splintering of civic identity and as a result, formation of tribal sense of "we" instead, as fact, not wish. Let's make it clear: I think classical civic society and identity build around ideals of civil society are far better than messy, old-school tribal chaos. But current responses of political/economical elites &amp; suburbian white fencers to these signals are inadequate and harmful. They practically just close their eyes and ears, hoping storm doesn't hit them. That's cowardice, if you ask from me. Whole communities, native &amp; immigrant, are practically abandoned to their own faiths. There are real incentives driving people in one end of spectrum towards sectarian identities. If one wants to steer boat to other direction, s/he should not whine about perfecty logical ways how people in hoods respond to these incentives, but try to change those incentives. <br><br>I honestly believe that energy trap and limits of environmental carrying capacity have ended religion of growth for good. At the same time I honestly believe tightening economic situation shall drive people even more towards sectarianism, because from their point of view, that reaction actually makes sense. That was what I tried to say with that Rotherham example. It makes sense from their point of view, and why should they care about other people's ponts of view?<br><br>So if you have any recommendations how to maintain civic society, please tell them. Maintaining and supporting local cross-community projects is one way, I know that, take my word for that. They just don't reach those who really should be reached. So I am pessimistic and dissapointed, not sheering, while describing situation that is facing many communities from where I know good, honest people, in many different countries. So it's not "my" tribalism; it's accelerating trend among large areas of First/Second World nations, and nobody is doing practically anything to offer different options. So shouldn't I be worried? Shall some "inner goodness" of mankind manifest itself first time in history, so logical endgames shall be totally different this time, with no bigoted raping, pillaging and murdering when shared identities (like religion) finally crack up for good? <br><br>It's just maddening that those in high places really don't care. Current liberal democracies were build upon national and civic identities, which rises not from blood-bounds but from shared civic values and memories. It's not perfect, but far better than other options from real world. Now this shared identity is only fading memory in large areas of so-called cililized world, and they really don't care. "Polyphonia", they call it. "Richness of values". Well, my experience, real personal experience, is that if nothing bounds people together, they behave like in those hooliganism videos. I call it a fact; for someone elese it might be unpleasant opinion.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c2309548761148615390 title="comment permalink">9/12/14, 9:37 PM</a><br><br>

This summer one 68-year old librarian retired. I was sad to see her go, as she was my favorite co-worker. Despite the fact that libraries have become computer and digitally dependent, she was not. The reason for this wasn’t just her age, but a developing neurological condition she has where she has trouble reading words on computer screens (somehow more problematic than on paper). It was impossible for her to become to reliant on computers, despite increasing pressure that she had to in order to fulfill her job requirements. Yet, she was always the most helpful librarian at the reference desk. When someone came in and asked for books of a certain kind, she immediately would have lots of ideas that none of her co-workers would know about. The catalog of her mind was far superior than an online catalog or any computer help. It was hard for her to read email, so she had thousands of unread email in her Inbox. Yet her younger tech-savvy co-workers could never match the warmth of face-to-face connections she had with patrons.<br><br>RE: cell phones<br><br>One of many things I lament about cell phones is how it’s changed the way people plan. It is easier not to have a cell phone when everyone else doesn’t have one than to not have one when those around you do. When I didn’t have a cell phone, when I was arranging to meet people somewhere, I’d have to force them to agree on the exact location and time, and fallback plans if we couldn’t find each other. Nowadays people assume others can call and text to find out details when they arrive. It used to be that if I was running late, people were more understanding if I wasn’t tmmediately able to let them know that. In recent years, people expect that I will call if that’s the case. Another annoyance of mine: apartments with no doorbells.<br><br>I was the last person in my circles to remain cell phone – free. A few years back though, a friend lent me a cheap prepaid cell phone to use for a specific purpose. When I gave it back to her, she said I could just keep it. In a way, I wish that hadn’t happened and I hadn’t agreed to keep it; I had enjoyed the shock when I’d tell people I didn’t own a cell phone (unusual for being in my 20s at the time). I started using it for occasional purposes though – on trips, for example. I primarily use my landline phone, and only give the cell number to a few people. I also try to turn it off most of the time. But still, I miss being able to tell people I am cell phone free.<br> <br><br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c6776615424807054384 title="comment permalink">9/12/14, 10:26 PM</a><br><br>

If you ask from more international-oriented people in Helsinki, they see things other way probably. In Joensuu-Kajaani- Rovaniemi axis, in north and east of the country, they are thinking very locally instead. Yet, I am only individual and cannot speak for others in this matter. <br><br>We are not Slavic, but not Germanic either. Finno-Ugric speakers are splintered around coniferous forest area from Bay of Bothnia to surprisingly distant areas in Siberia. Historically speaking we probably are descendants of minority language group working said area as semi-nomadic slash-and-burn agriculturalists. That method of farming is well remembered and practiced in small scale even today by many people I know here, so it has deep history among this language group. <br><br>Being first part of Sweden, when it was hard core kingdom instead current mess, and then belonging to Russian empire during czars as Grand Duchy of Russian Empire kind of gave taste from both sides I believe, that have mixed uniquely during independence. <br><br>Like I have tried to say, I have no strong political passions. I just believe that European Union as it has emerged to be is horrible mistake, that it's current policies are even more dysfunctional than those of US. There are very good local networks in place around Europe, but now they are forcibly trying to centralize and federalize this continent, as at the same time so called "peak everything" problems make advantages of these policies non-existent. So I think that our nation has hangman's noose around neck, and other end of the rope is attached to sinking sip that is EU. Localization and having strong, peaceful trade relations around Baltic sea and Bothnian Bay-area would be far saner road. And as self reflection concerning your comment: I am sure there are lot I am missing and misunderstanding, and there is always chance to broaden percpective for every member of our species.

The modern history marked by unification with Scotland, however, in my view was less about ending 'internecine warfare' than about negotiating the geopolitics of the more powerful emergent nations and Empires of Continental Europe. Scotland, and to a lesser extent Ireland, was always a potential 'backdoor' for any regime change in England favoured by a larger Continental power.<br><br>I live in an area that experienced centuries of degraded conditions because of this unresolved geo-politics. Think Balkan-like atrocities, and read some bleak Border Ballads in a land that now radiates peace. Even without the old local warfare, the area suffered of course in subsequent centuries much continuing rural poverty and saw its own versions of ubiquitous mass emigrations in the 19thC. <br><br>My point is not to make much of the portents of Scottish independence (referendum) for resumption of local conflict, but to see the larger shapes of history, as JMG asks of us. <br><br>It was clear to me witnessing the recent conflicts in Ireland that the key to even partial resolution was the achievement of quarantining the main force of mainland British politics, and critically at the same time similar drivers within USA politics and those of independent Eire. <br><br>The options for the British Isles seem to me to remain fluid for some time and to depend on resolution of the re-organising of Europe as a whole, and that will necessarily include Russia. The EU seems an unlikely model for future configurations and can only be regarded, at best, as provisional. <br><br>I look for ways of safeguarding personal, familial and communal peace in a beloved land.

Thank you.<br><br>The incongruity of scientists proclaiming a need for faith and alternative religious leaders saying “let's acknowledge reality as it is” seems part and parcel of the major choice that affluent West made in the Reagan/Thatcher years to ignore all limits to growth and instead go on faith in the civil religion of Progress.<br><br>Of course, religions that stand outside of the orbit of Progress will often tend towards countering this civil religion at its most vulnerable point; it's own irreconcilable dogmatic fallacy of claiming the scientific method as the source of its Truth whilst demanding raw faith from its adherents.<br><br>On a personal note: For about two years I've began to have an accelerating crisis of faith. My experiences of the world failed to conform to what was demanded to validate my belief system, essentially Progress as defined by the New Age. During this time I carried a secret seething anger. Just recently I realized that, indeed, I'm angry at the collective choices that were made in the 1980's and are still being made today. Deeper still, I'm angry that reality isn't “progressing”. I'm angry at reality for not being what I thought it should be.<br><br>I'm a pretty mild-mannered, albeit eccentric person. I don't think of myself as “angry,” but there it is, hiding under my sense of self, a fury not too different from what Gil Scott-Heron explores in “Whitey on the Moon” although less realized and less articulate. The collective fallout from progress' death-spasms horrifies me. The ideas of violent ethnic division, tyranny, scapegoating etc as responses to cognitive dissonance are seeming less and less abstract to me.<br><br>On the bright side this week, which had a heavy harvest workload, saw me reading How the Irish Saved Civilization, your book Decline and Fall, and Humblebee Bumblebee which all offered radically different approaches to dealing gracefully with our changing times.

In the past, even social malaise that was wholly generated within England, notably the Civil War, created victims (actually most of its victims) in Scotland and Ireland.<br><br>If Britain is finally going down the economic plughole, there is going to be the same kind of social disruption and violence that there will be everywhere else.

Britain is, after all, a very, very small place.<br><br>Historically, prior to the Union, periodic explosions of extreme violence were the norm in Britain, and the worst ones had very little to do with external geopolitics. Think of the War Of The Roses, for example. That was "our" business as usual and that, I believe, is what we will be going back to, even in the very unlikely event that some fig-leaf of the Union can be preserved. It may be a fair distance in the future, but the process toward it has its own momentum now.<br><br>I personally think the idea that we are moving towards a peaceful Europe of mutually-respecting little states, nestled in the warm embrace of Russia (and using gold-backed currencies!), is simply another End Of History myth, but with a pseudo-benign identity-based nationalism replacing Neoliberalism.

A fair number of our own geo-political blunders are due to that misunderstanding of history and geography.<br><br>First of all, Eastern Europe is by no means wholly Slavic. Hungarians, Romanians and Albanians are not Slavs. The whole northern part of the former Soviet Union is packed full of peoples who are not Slavs. And so on. <br><br>Second, Poles, Czechs, Moravians, Slovaks, Lusatian Sorbs, Slovenes and Croats are Slavs who are not and never have been part of Eastern Europe. The dividing line between Western and Eastern Europe coincides roughly with the line dividing Roman Catholic Christianity from Eastern Orthodox Christianity as it was established in the 11th and 12th centuries. But in the US Slavic countries and languages began to be an object of large-scale academic study only during the Cold War. US School histories of the world still often reflect the old ignorant attitude that Europe ends with Germany and Austria ...<br><br>And third, language/culture and ethnic or genetic background do not line up all that well anywhere in Europe. Any number of people who now speak Scandinavian languages have Saami or Finish ancestors. The ancestors of vast numbers of Russia speakers spoke no Slavic language at all before the 1600s. And so forth. One should take a lesson from Franz Boas's studies of the First Nations in the Pacific Northwest of North America, which showed that boundaries between different language stocks did not line up with boundaries between different cultures, and that neither set of boundaries lined up very well with boundaries between different genetic heritage.

The first is follow your suggestion and collapse now, and use the surplus resources that are still available to learn the necessary skills for the coming hard times. <br>The second is to escalate, double down, go all in. What is really happening with the world is that there is a narrowing frontier instead of an expanding one - every year more people are plunged past the poverty line, and there are less opportunities available for the rest. So, one can simply choose to make the most effort possible to remain inside the narrowing circle. If the borders are contracting, one can avoid the harsher aspects of post-peak oil life by remaining amongst the rich few. <br>I admit that I'm living somewhat mixed between the two - I own a car, use it sparingly; bought and apartment on the third floor, close to where I work; am very fond of the internet and own a lot of gadgets; travel by jet every year; etc. So far, my philosophy is that it is good for me to enjoy these fruits of fortune while they last, and try not to be too attached to them. The extravagancies of the industrial age won't last into my forties, most likely (I'm on my twenties). But they are here now, so I see no reason to forsake them.

It is opposed to the theme of progress, and there already exists a literature about it that is an entire philosophy. Those who frequent poets will recognize in Baudelaire one of the ancestors of this point of view, and one of the creators of the sensibility that it sets in motion. Villiers de l’Isle-Adam continued its spread, and we can see it with little difficulty in the works of Flaubert. Finally, M. Remy de Gourmont summed it up with his law of intellectual constancy. It is this theme that I set myself to culling out from among the biological views of M. Quinton as the one most fertile in philosophical consequences. This theme of the maintenance of a fixed state that unfavorable circumstances have a constant tendency to destroy brings, in fact, if not an absolute proof, at least considerable support to the philosophical concept to which I have attached myself, to wit, that existence doesn’t support any explanations in terms of a moral finalism. In assigning a positive goal – that of a reaction in the face of a threat to organic evolution combined with transformations in the human milieu realized by intellectual play – the biological explanation removes much of the likelihood and probability from those messianic concepts according to which transformations in intelligence and sensibility presage an era of happiness and perfection, or at the very least correspond to a positive amelioration of the human condition. This forward march is no longer anything but a marching in place, if the ground moves in the opposite direction to the steps of the marcher. The belief in progress, in the embrace of happiness and perfection by future humanity, appears now as nothing but an illusion, useful perhaps for the maintenance of the status quo, if it is true that man deploys a greater effort in the hope of an indeterminate happiness than he would for the preservation of a state which he often declares himself dissatisfied with. M. Nordau’s theory of history provides confirmation through this way of seeing things, whose pessimism is only apparent, and which manifests itself only to those to whom it seems that a justification through moral ideas is the sole possible justification for the fact of existence."<br>Our idea of sacred progress was generated in violence like all others, and then the rationale is that it now contains this violence. If we look hard enough, we see that it is the illusion of Progress rather than actual results itself which makes the system run.

We don't really notice these except as displays of the aurora. <br>The threat (frequency) of such disruptive events is low. The risk (cost/damage resulting from such an event) is very high. The product threat x risk gives an idea of the insurance premium to cover such an event. If the premium is too high to contemplate, it is time to install preventative measures that cost less. I am pretty sure that power companies in at risk areas have been quietly installing suitable fuses and overload bypasses as part of normal maintenance, probably under pressure from the large reinsurers, who do not want to carry such a high level of risk. I am also sure that not all companies are doing really enough. If another Carrington event hits, then there will be massive disruption in some areas. The difference between us and the Victorians is our higher level of use of mains electricity grids - hence the very high risk of deep disruption, and the disquiet of some (in this case) savvier politicians (even if it is a fancy bandwagon). The wikipedia article is actually quite good, and contains a link to Carrington's original paper, which is well worth the read.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c6056856624246479153 title="comment permalink">9/14/14, 5:26 AM</a><br><br>

Thanks for the clarification.<br>Regarding Russia and Europe, if I might bring it back to JMG'S idea of catabolic collapse in relation to the collapse of industrial civilization, the 1st stage of collapse will be scarcity industrialism, where access to resources predicates power. Russia is presumed to be a rising power of scarcity industrialism. I think it's reasonable to assume that Russia could put a floor under this stage of collapse for Europe, in the same way that the U.S., and, to a lesser extent, the USSR, provided a floor for Europe in the mid 20th century. It won't negate the very real effects of collapse on Europe, just as a look back at the late 20th century can't deny a very real loss of power for Europe relative to the beginning of the 20th century. To me, this just validates JMG'S theory of stair step collapse, followed by a break at a lower level. The only other option, which is a very real possibility, is for Europe to continue to twist in the wind without Russian intervention until it reaches an even lower equilibrium.<br>I had a very encouraging conversation with a coworker yesterday about the damaging effects of electronic devices, and she was telling me how she prevents here 3 year old daughter from using screens, and how she notices how much more creative her daughter is compared to her screen using nieces. It's really encouraging to see this meme spread among the mainstream, and anything I can do to spread it, I will. Hopefully, "big silicon" can be regarded the same way that "big tobacco" and" big oil" are. Speaking of which, I find it interesting that tobacco companies are demonized for practices that are basically universal among large corporations. There must be something that our collective demonization of the "evil weed" says about our inaction and apathy regarding the very same practices across the board in corporate culture. The more we demonize tobacco, the more corporate corruption metastasizes in all other industries. <br><br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c1157274839614157464 title="comment permalink">9/14/14, 9:07 AM</a><br><br>

I am a retired academic, a philologist specializing in the Orthodox Slavic Middle Ages, and Danish-American by ethnicity. So pretty much everything you have posted to the ADR seems right on target to me as an academic well acquainted with the deep history of that part of Europe.<br><br>But also we have always had a similar sort of world here in Providence, Rhode Island (in New England), where my wife and I moved from California in 1967. When we arrived, the city of Providence was about 95% Roman Catholic, divided among several ethnic groups, chief among which were the Irish and the Italian. Earlier the Irish had been the dominant ethnicity, but by 1967 the Italians had assumed the dominant position in the city and state governments. <br><br>Among the Italians there was a clandestine organization, headed by a most impressive man, Raymond Loredo Salavtore Patriarca Sr. (1908-1984). Although he had served time in prison, he died a free man. You can read about him on Wikipedia.<br><br>This history is merely background to a comment collected by a reporter from an elderly Italian resident for the Providence Journal-Bulletin article about Mr. Patriarca on the occasion of his death. She said (I quote only from memory), "I don;t know why the Police a;ways gave Mr. Patriarca such a hard time. He was a real gentleman. He stopped his car for people crossing the street. He tipped his hat to old ladies. If some people was giving you a hard time, he had them killed for you. He took good care of his own."<br><br>So I, a retired professor at an Ivy League University, have lived cheek-by-jowl with a world rather like the one Juhana describes, only here in New England since 1967. That is also why all his posts makes perfect sense to me. My university, and the students and faculty who belong to it, live largely in a sort of bubble insulated from this "other," more real, city of Providence. Since my own grandparents were completely successful professional criminals for about a decade and a half in the San Francisco Bay Area back around the 1920s, the world outside this bubble here in Providence never seemed as alien, or as shocking, to me as it did to my academic colleagues. I guess I am a realist about such things, not an idealist.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c988149299616971337 title="comment permalink">9/14/14, 1:58 PM</a><br><br>

Of course students and teachers shouldn't over-rely on these tools, of course they must also be able to generate representations of the topics themselves (yes, with pencil and paper, or scissors and crayon, or stylus and clay tablet if you like- all good!), but as long as these tools are available, they can profitably be used to help all students, including those like Deborah Bender, to grasp how math behaves. Just one tool in the toolbox, mind you! But the solid understanding of mathematics is dependent on the student being able to generate and connect and manipulate multiple types of representations of the content. Teachers who can support all different kinds of explorations of the content can help students understand the patterns and make sense of the whys, starting at a very young age. Deborah and Cherokee, it pains me to hear people write themselves off as "not math people", because I believe that with teaching that focused more clearly on the conceptual underpinnings (including lots of different representations) instead of the single focus on the performance of procedures that is sadly typical of many math classrooms (because of course that is how most math teachers were themselves taught!), everyone could gain the deep understanding that Deborah missed in more abstract, upper level math. Digital representations that students can manipulate can be strongly supportive of that development.

On a routine day-to-day basis, away from airports and international borders, we do not see much presence of Federal law enforcement and we do not have any real civilian national police force. The federal law enforcement tends to be charged with specific legal areas, such as Customs and Immigration and the Drug Enforcement Agency. Most routine law enforcement is done by the State officers (called Troupers everywhere but Texas, where they are Rangers), and by county and city police. As centralized government erodes and law enforcement becomes more localized, I expect here in the U.S. we will see official power simply move down the levels of this hierarchy. We already have the county sheriffs and city police systems in place, eager and willing to assume more power in the absence of strong central government. Even where organized crime is firmly established, the crime bosses and police will likely merge together. I think we will see the rise of civilian militias and warlords that are at least superficially working within the existing local law enforcement structure in mot places. <br><br>Not that this can't be just as abusive as any other system, but it could happen in a relatively smooth transition from the present-day situation without revolutionary upheaval.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c6293008948228501370 title="comment permalink">9/14/14, 3:57 PM</a><br><br>

Especially students from Humanist faculties tended to be quite dogmatic in their righteousness. I had surreal conversations in student circles: after describing how black working man in SA had revealed his world view to be, humanist female was denouncing said things with shrill voice as anti-PC. So she was actually accusing Xhosa tribesman was not seeing world as "opressed Third Worlders liberated from Evil White Men (tm)" should see it according her PC-religion. Apparently Xhosa workers should not feel reluctant for Herero immigrant workers moving to their hood, and there should not be vicious ethnic clashes between newcomers and more established tribes.

For a moment, reflect for a moment nature of fighting forces in Ukraine. It's by the way not the only possible example, but said conflict's media coverage is higher than with most other same kind of conflicts:<br><br>Mobilization order that was given after East Ukrainian uprising by Ukraine government failed repeatedly. Conscripts just didn't show up when they were called in. Those who showed up were not too eager to fight. So in the beginning of East Ukrainian conflict performance of official Ukrainian army was abysmal. In March government gave order about formation of volunteer citizen militia. Nucleus of this militia came from ultras of Kiev Dynamo football firm, and from other football firms from that side of tribal divide. They gave whole different spark into the conflict, their fighting spirit and prowess has been very high. On the other side of the divide, local volunteers and volunteers aboard from Russophile places like Serbia showed up also, with equal fervor. Many of them have also been heavily involved in modern tribalism, expressed publicly around football arenas, before joining Ukrainian conflict as volunteer warriors.<br><br>Typical confrontation in this new type of war was played out at 2.5.2014 in the East Ukraine, as 42 demonstrators supporting East Ukrainian independence were killed. There was clash between demonstrators and football ultras from West Ukraine. Demonstrators were forced to retreat into trades union-building, which was burned down, not allowing people to come out from the building. I am not saying that any side has all the blame, by the way. On the other side of the fence there has also been atrocities. I am not taking sides in conflict that does not belong to me. But this kind of very messy confrontations seem to be common in this kind of identity conflicts. Ask from person from Northern Ireland who is over 40 years old, and you probably get better English description of what I am trying to describe with my abysmally inadequate English skills.<br><br>What I try to say here is that volunteer militias only loosely governed by official government have been actually most efficient forces in many recent conflicts. From time to time it seems that fighting formations like Donbass batallion are totally out of official government control. <br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbas_Battalion<br><br>Official army has been quite apathetic and has not achieved a lot. On both sides paramilitary elements have been most efficient of fighting forces. Former football ultras form nucleus of these paramilitary elements, probably on both sides. With this trajectory, modern tribalism has moved to the world stage politics.<br><br>I believe this is the face of future wars in general, because almost all wars are currently insurgency wars. They are not won by official armies, if they don't resort to Mongol tactics. The political price would be too high, so more and more power in actual battle field reverts into hands of modern day tribal militias. As this trend accelerates in many areas around the world, there shall be huge tracts of land where actual, real policing power is in the hands of semi-official paramilitaries, responding at best half-heartedly to demands from central, "official" government.<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c962648288202441774 title="comment permalink">9/15/14, 3:33 AM</a><br><br>

You state you are seeking a history.

Problem is, a lawyer or accountant will see things in conventional terms, through the lens of economic growth and the religion of progress. Since we don't expect economic growth to continue, it's better for us to research the alternatives with an eye to what scenarios might be more likely over the time we might have left. Plus the lawyer or accountant costs money that we'd prefer not to spend in that way, and I have a good guess as to what s/he might suggest which is not anything we'd do.<br><br>I agree that a one-time payment invested in skills or appropriate-tech capital makes sense. In our case, however, we already have most of what we think we'll need in those directions and can likely fund the remainder out of current savings or what we can put aside later from current income. In the case of the entity, it has a good chance of outlasting us, or at least lasting long enough to pay us more than the lump sum, since it deals in one of the few things people actually *need*, rather than just *want*. <br><br>More broadly, we were discussing the issue with friends of ours last weekend. They told us the entity they know best is also acting in a way as to attempt to reduce its underfunded pension liability. I think this economic wind may be blowing the way of more people before too long.

Nice one!<br><br>The effect of dwindling energy supplies is a big question/ issue. Every indication suggests it will be wholly uneven and downright unjust. The poor, and even the present middle class being the first to be priced out of the market. Already we see wars fought asymmetrically, in terms of technology. The imbalance could be even more pronounced if the access to petroleum is all but cut off entirely (i.e. no Toyota pickup trucks hiding in the hills). I suspect the bumpy road ahead will involve at least some time where this disparity is pronounced. Arms, on the other hand, could well be widespread on all sides.

The heroes end up running a victory garden and surviving on one of the partner's job in a retirement home. Not the bright future one would expect for MIT top guns.<br>The only "optimistic" aspects of this story are:<br>- the attitude of the heroes towards life and what it throws at them<br>- the dream of the 30 year old dying from cancer friend coming true<br>That dream, is to let a legacy to our descendants, a probably future civilization recovering from ours, what he considers the best of XXIst century achievements, ie: the cooperative, open-source, share and make spirit: a free lunch for a future civilization able to use his gift and build upon.<br>I understand the strange optimistic aspect of this story as follows:<br>the degradation of climate and the living conditions and standard, the fall of our current civilization, etc are inevitable and you can't do anything to prevent it. It will happen no matter what you do. Nevertheless, you can still live extraordinary lives, so long as you focus on what you can control and make do with all the rest. A funny mix of stoico-epicuriano-maker-punk.<br>In addition, you can also try to produce something that will transcend our current civilization and maybe of helpful legacy to an nacestor in a remote future.<br>It's almost archdruidesque, except for the lack of conscience and will to be as less complicit as possible of the inevitable catastrophe.<br>It's a kind of optimism I can buy, and specially suprising when coming from the author of Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom.<br><br>Regards,<br>Del<br><br><a href=technological-superstitions.html#c6959770160121917592 title="comment permalink">9/16/14, 11:20 AM</a><br><br>
