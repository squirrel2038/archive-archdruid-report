Over the nearly eight years that I’ve been posting these weekly essays on the shape of the deindustrial future, I’ve found that certain questions come up as reliably as daffodils in April or airport food on a rough flight. Some of those fixate on topics I’ve discussed here recently, such as the vaporware du jour that’s allegedly certain to save industrial civilization and the cataclysm du jour that’s just as allegedly certain to annihilate it. Still, I’m glad to say that not all the recurring questions are as useless as these.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of these latter deserves a good deal more attention than I’ve given it so far:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>whether the Long Descent of industrial society will be troubled by a revival of fascism. It’s a reasonable question to ask, since the fascist movements of the not so distant past were given their shot at power by the political failure and economic implosion of Europe after the First World War, and “political failure and economic implosion” is a tolerably good description of the current state of affairs in the United States and much of Europe these days. For that matter, movements uncomfortably close to the fascist parties of the 1920s and 1930s already exist in a number of European countries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those who dismiss them as a political irrelevancy might want to take a closer look at history, for that same mistake was made quite regularly by politicians and pundits most of a century ago, too.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nonetheless, with one exception—<a href=../../2007/11/fascism-feudalism-and-future.html>a critique some years back</a> of talk in the peak oil scene about the so-called “feudal-fascist” society the rich were supposedly planning to ram down our throats—I’ve done my best to avoid the issue so far. This isn’t because it’s not important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s because the entire subject is so cluttered with doubletalk and distortions of historical fact that communication on the subject has become all but impossible. It’s going to take an entire post just to shovel away some of the manure that’s piled up in this Augean stable of our collective imagination, and even then I’m confident that many of the people who read this will manage to misunderstand every single word I say. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a massive irony in that situation. When George Orwell wrote his tremendous satire on totalitarian politics,
<i>1984</i>, one of the core themes he explored was the debasement of language for political advantage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That habit found its lasting emblem in Orwell’s invented language Newspeak, which was deliberately designed to get in the way of clear thinking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Newspeak remains fictional—well, more or less—but the entire subject of fascism, and indeed the word itself, has gotten tangled up in a net of debased language and incoherent thinking as extreme as anything Orwell put in his novel. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
These days, to be more precise, the word “fascism” mostly functions as what S.I. Hayakawa used to call a snarl word—a content-free verbal noise that expresses angry emotions and nothing else. One of my readers last week commented that for all practical purposes, the word “fascism” could be replaced in everyday use with “Oogyboogymanism,” and of course he’s quite correct; Aldous Huxley pointed out many years ago that already in his time, the word “fascism” meant no more than “something of which one ought to disapprove.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When activists on the leftward end of today’s political spectrum insist that the current US government is a fascist regime, they thus mean exactly what their equivalents on the rightward end of the same spectrum mean when they call the current US government a socialist regime: “I hate you.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It’s a fine example of the way that political discourse nowadays has largely collapsed into <a href=../../2012/12/last-weeks-post-here-on-archdruidreport.html>verbal noises linked to heated emotional states</a> that drowns out any more useful form of communication. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The debasement of our political language quite often goes to absurd lengths. Back in the 1990s, for example, when I lived in Seattle, somebody unknown to me went around spraypainting “(expletive) FACISM” on an assortment of walls in a couple of Seattle’s hip neighborhoods. My wife and I used to while away spare time at bus stops discussing just what “facism” might be. (Her theory was that it’s the prejudice that makes businessmen think that employees in front office jobs should be hired for their pretty faces rather than their job skills; mine, recalling the self-righteous declaration of a vegetarian cousin that she would never eat anything with a face, was that it’s the belief that the moral value of a living thing depends on whether it has a face humans recognize as such.) Beyond such amusements, though, lay a real question:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>what on earth did the graffitist think he was accomplishing by splashing that phrase around oh-so-liberal Seattle? Did he perhaps think that members of the American Fascist Party who happened to be goose-stepping through town would see the slogan and quail? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To get past such stupidities, it’s going to be necessary to take the time to rise up out of the swamp of Newspeak that surrounds the subject of fascism—to reconnect words with their meanings, and political movements with their historical contexts. Let’s start in the obvious place. What exactly does the word “fascism” mean, and how did it get from there to its current status as a snarl word? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That takes us back to southern Italy in 1893. In that year, a socialist movement among peasant farmers took to rioting and other extralegal actions to try to break the hold of the old feudal gentry on the economy of the region; the armed groups fielded by this movement were called
<i>fasci</i>, which might best be translated “group” or “band.” Various other groups in the troubled Italian political scene borrowed the label thereafter, and it was also used for special units of shock troops in the First World War—<i>Fasci di Combattimento</i>, “combat groups,” were the exact equivalent of the Imperial German Army’s
<i>Sturmabteilungen</i>, “storm troops.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
After the war, in 1919, an army veteran and former Socialist newspaperman named Benito Mussolini borrowed the label <i>Fasci di Combattimento</i> for his new political movement, about the same time that another veteran on the other side of the Alps was borrowing the term
<i>Sturmabteilung</i> for his party’s brown-shirted bullies. The movement quickly morphed into a political party and adapted its name accordingly, becoming the Fascist Party, and the near-total paralysis of the Italian political system allowed Mussolini to seize power with the March on Rome in 1922.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The secondhand ideology Mussolini’s aides cobbled together for their new regime accordingly became known as Fascism—“Groupism,” again, is a decent translation, and yes, it was about as coherent as that sounds. Later on, in an attempt to hijack the prestige of the Roman Empire, Mussolini identified Fascism with another meaning of the word <i>fasci</i>—the bundle of sticks around an axe that Roman lictors carried as an emblem of their authority—and that became the emblem of the Fascist Party in its latter years. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of all the totalitarian regimes of 20th century Europe, it has to be said, Mussolini’s was far from the most bloodthirsty. The Fascist regime in Italy carried out maybe two thousand political executions in its entire lifespan; Hitler’s regime committed that many political killings, on average, every single day the Twelve-Year Reich was in power, and when it comes to political murder, Hitler was a piker compared to Josef Stalin or Mao Zedong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For that matter, political killings in some officially democratic regimes exceed Italian Fascism’s total quite handily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Why, then, is “fascist” the buzzword of choice to this day for anybody who wants to denounce a political system?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More to the point, why do most Americans say “fascist,” mean “Nazi,” and then display the most invincible ignorance about both movements? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a reason for that, and it comes out of the twists of radical politics in 1920s and 1930s Europe. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The founding of the Third International in Moscow in 1919 forced radical parties elsewhere in Europe to take sides for or against the Soviet regime. Those parties that joined the International were expected to obey Moscow’s orders without question, even when those orders clearly had much more to do with Russia’s expansionist foreign policy than they did with the glorious cause of proletarian revolution; at the same time, many idealists still thought the Soviet regime, for all its flaws, was the best hope for the future. The result in most countries was the emergence of competing Marxist parties, a Communist party obedient to Moscow and a Socialist party independent of it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the bare-knuckle propaganda brawl that followed, Mussolini’s regime was a godsend to Moscow. Since Mussolini was a former socialist who had abandoned Marx in the course of his rise to power, parties that belonged to the Third International came to use the label “fascist” for those parties that refused to join it; that was their way of claiming that the latter weren’t really socialist, and could be counted on to sell out the proletariat as Mussolini was accused of doing. Later on, when the Soviet Union ended up on the same side of the Second World War as its longtime enemies Britain and the United States, the habit of using “fascist” as an all-purpose term of abuse spread throughout the left in the latter two countries. From there, its current status as a universal snarl word was a very short step. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What made “fascist” so useful long after the collapse of Mussolini’s regime was the sheer emptiness of the word. Even in Italian, “Groupism” doesn’t mean much, and in other languages, it’s just a noise; this facilitated its evolution into an epithet that could be applied to anybody.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The term “Nazi” had most of the same advantages: in most languages, it sounds nasty and doesn’t mean a thing, so it can be flung freely at any target without risk of embarrassment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The same can’t be said about the actual name of the German political movement headed by Adolf Hitler, which is one reason why next to nobody outside of specialist historical works ever mentions national socialism by its proper name. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That name isn’t simply a buzzword coined by Hitler’s flacks, by the way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first national socialist party I’ve been able to trace was founded in 1898 in what’s now the Czech Republic, and the second was launched in France in 1903. National socialism was a recognized position in the political and economic controversies of early 20th century Europe. Fail to grasp that and it’s impossible to make any sense of why fascism appealed to so many people in the bitter years between the wars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To grasp that, though, it’s necessary to get out from under one of the enduring intellectual burdens of the Cold War. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
After 1945, as the United States and the Soviet Union circled each other like rival dogs contending for the same bone, it was in the interest of both sides to prevent anyone from setting up a third option. Some of the nastier details of postwar politics unfolded from that shared interest, and so did certain lasting impacts on political and economic thought. Up to that point, political economy in the western world embraced many schools of thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Afterwards, on both sides of the Iron Curtain, the existence of alternatives to representative-democracy-plus-capitalism, on the one hand, and bureaucratic state socialism on the other, became a taboo subject, and remains so in America to this day. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You can gain some sense of what was erased by learning a little bit about the politics in European countries between the wars, when the diversity of ideas was at its height. Then as now, most political parties existed to support the interests of specific social classes, but in those days nobody pretended otherwise. Conservative parties, for example, promoted the interests of the old aristocracy and rural landowners; they supported trade barriers, low property taxes, and an economy biased toward agriculture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Liberal parties furthered the interests of the bourgeoisie—that is, the urban industrial and managerial classes; they supported free trade, high property taxes, military spending, and colonial expansion, because those were the policies that increased bourgeios wealth and power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The working classes had their choice of several political movements. There were syndicalist parties, which sought to give workers direct ownership of the firms for which they worked; depending on local taste, that might involve anything from stock ownership programs for employees to cooperatives and other worker-owned enterprises.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Syndicalism was also called corporatism; “corporation” and its cognates in most European languages could refer to any organization with a government charter, including craft guilds and cooperatives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was in that sense that Mussolini’s regime, which borrowed some syndicalist elements for its eclectic ideology, liked to refer to itself as a corporatist system. (Those radicals who insist that this meant fascism was a tool of big corporations in the modern sense are thus hopelessly misinformed—a point I’ll cover in much more detail next week.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There were also socialist parties, which generally sought to place firms under government control; this might amount to anything from government regulation, through stock purchases giving the state a controlling interest in big firms, to outright expropriation and bureaucratic management. Standing apart from the socialist parties were communist parties, which (after 1919) spouted whatever Moscow’s party line happened to be that week; and there were a variety of other, smaller movements—distributism, social credit, and many more—all of which had their own followings and their own proposed answers to the political and economic problems of the day. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The tendency of most of these parties to further the interests of a single class became a matter of concern by the end of the 19th century, and one result was the emergence of parties that pursued, or claimed to pursue, policies of benefit to the entire nation. Many of them tacked the adjective “national” onto their moniker to indicate this shift in orientation. Thus national conservative parties argued that trade barriers and economic policies focused on the agricultural sector would benefit everyone; national liberal parties argued that free trade and colonial expansion was the best option for everyone; national syndicalist parties argued that giving workers a stake in the firms for which they worked would benefit everyone, and so on. There were no national communist parties, because Moscow’s party line didn’t allow it, but there were national bolshevist parties—in Europe between the wars, a bolshevist was someone who supported the Russian Revolution but insisted that Lenin and Stalin had betrayed it in order to impose a personal dictatorship—which argued that violent revolution against the existing order really was in everyone’s best interests. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
National socialism was another position along the same lines. National socialist parties argued that business firms should be made subject to government regulation and coordination in order to keep them from acting against the interests of society as a whole, and that the working classes ought to receive a range of government benefits paid for by taxes on corporate income and the well-to-do. Those points were central to the program of the National Socialist German Workers Party from the time it got that name—it was founded as the German Workers Party, and got the rest of the moniker at the urging of a little man with a Charlie Chaplin mustache who became the party’s leader not long after its founding—and those were the policies that the same party enacted when it took power in Germany in 1933. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If those policies sound familiar, dear reader, they should. That’s the other reason why next to nobody outside of specialist historical works mentions national socialism by name: the Western nations that defeated national socialism in Germany promptly adopted its core economic policies, the main source of its mass appeal, to forestall any attempt to revive it in the postwar world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Strictly speaking, in terms of the meaning that the phrase had before the beginning of the Second World War, national socialism is one of the two standard political flavors of political economy nowadays. The other is liberalism, and it’s another irony of history that in the United States, the party that hates the word “liberal” is a picture-perfect example of a liberal party, as that term was understood back in the day.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course when people think of the National Socialist German Workers Party nowadays, they don’t think of government regulation of industry and free vacations for factory workers, even though those were significant factors in German public life after 1933.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They think of such other habits of Hitler’s regime as declaring war on most of the world, slaughtering political opponents en masse, and exterminating whole ethnic groups. Those are realities, and they need to be recalled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s crucial, though, to remember that when Germany’s National Socialists were out there canvassing for votes in the years before 1933, they weren’t marching proudly behind banners saying VOTE FOR HITLER SO FIFTY MILLION WILL DIE!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When those same National Socialists trotted out their antisemitic rhetoric, for that matter, they weren’t saying anything the average German found offensive or even unusual; to borrow a highly useful German word, antisemitism in those days was <i>salonf<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>ä</span>hig</i>, “the kind of thing you can bring into the living room.” (To be fair, it was just as socially acceptable in England, the United States, and the rest of the western world at that same time.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, when people talked about fascism in the 1920s and 1930s, unless they were doctrinaire Marxists,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>they didn’t use it as a snarl word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was the official title of Italy’s ruling party, and a great many people—including people of good will—were impressed by some of the programs enacted by Mussolini’s regime, and hoped to see similar policies put in place in their own countries. Fascism was <i>salonf<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>ä</span>hig</i> in most industrial countries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It didn’t lose that status until the Second World War and the Cold War reshaped the political landscape of the western world—and when that happened, the complex reality of early 20th century authoritarian politics vanished behind a vast and distorted shadow that could be, and was, cast subsequently onto anything you care to name. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style='font-family: Times; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode"; mso-fareast-language: #00FF; mso-font-kerning: .5pt'>The downsides to this distortion aren’t limited to a failure of historical understanding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If a full-blown fascist movement of what was once the standard type were to appear in America today, it’s a safe bet that nobody except a few historians would recognize it for what it is. What’s more, it’s just as safe a bet that many of those people who think they oppose fascism—even, or especially, those who think they’ve achieved something by spraypainting “(expletive) FACISM” on a concrete wall—would be among the first to cheer on such a movement and fall in line behind its banners. How and why that could happen will be the subject of the next two posts. </span></div>

Very amusing, but with a strong hint of truth. <br><br>Quote: "the near-total paralysis of the Italian political system allowed Mussolini to seize power". <br><br>I wonder how many people pick up the historical similarities to current political deadlock.<br><br>Quote: "argued that business firms should be made subject to government regulation and coordination in order to keep them from acting against the interests of society as a whole, and that the working classes ought to receive a range of government benefits paid for by taxes on corporate income and the well-to-do."<br><br>Extreme wealth inequality breeds this sort of wish fulfilment. To be brutally honest though, there is a certain appeal to those stated objectives in your quote. <br><br>It is always a bad look when executives on company boards vote themselves a pay rise whilst at the same time sacking employees and/or are at the helm of poorly performing businesses and being rewarded for bad decision making. Nothing breeds anger and resentment quite like those sorts of actions.<br><br>Too bad Australia is heading down the path of widening wealth inequality. I'm unsure whether you have heard, but the motor vehicle manufacturing industry in this country is now dead as of 2017 when all three manufacturers will pull out of the country. The final announcement was made a few days ago. In addition to this the largest canning operation in the Southern hemisphere is being closed down too.<br><br>I strongly suspect that these people and industries are being cut loose for ideological reasons in a self-defeating attempt by the political process to shore up the current status quo. I could be wrong, but it is just a gut feel. Cutting loose sections of the middle class is perhaps – as you’ve stated before – one way for the system to correct its current imbalances. However, the flow on effects of these decisions will be enormous here and will most probably push us into a semi-permanent recession.<br><br>On a note closer to the home front, I'd like to point out that the people and community in this area affected by the recent bushfires have been quite supportive. This is contrary to some peoples comments and expectations that I have read on this very blog.<br><br>In addition to this, I'll note - and this may be relevant to your current essay series - that centralised responses breed a lack of local resilience and encourage a certain helplessness.<br><br>Also in a peak oil world, such centralised responses as I witnessed by the authorities are probably going to be very difficult to maintain.<br><br>It would be nice if they just all backed off and allowed me to learn to manage the forest as needs to be done here.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c2062998283274878636 title="comment permalink">2/12/14, 6:43 PM</a><br><br>

That’s a difficult thing to wrap my mind around, especially after decades of misleading and frankly dishonest propaganda from both of those factions. But this is one of the reasons why the Archdruid Report is one of my favorite blogs. Intellectual integrity, brilliant essays on a wide range of topics and innovative research combined with a willingness to ask the hard questions, step on some toes and challenge “conventional wisdom”. Tis an ill wind that blows no minds…<br><br>Speaking of Newspeak, I had a university professor who was also active in conservative (or is that liberal, in the classical sense of the term?) politics who flat out refused to use the term “Political Correctness” on the grounds that PC is really a form of Newspeak and always referred to PC as Newspeak whenever he lectured or otherwise discussed the subject. Needless to say, this did not make him popular with the trendy middle and upper middle class leftists (their wealthier comrades are sometimes referred to as “limousine liberals” and “penthouse proletarians” for good reason) who tend to dominate university campuses in both Europe and North America, but he had tenure and a sterling reputation as one of the top academicians on campus, so he could ignore the slings that came his way.<br><br>I also had a friend who spent a year in China as an exchange student. He got back around the time the term “Political Correctness” was becoming popular. He was quite shocked, because he pointed out that there is a term in the Chinese language that translates literally as Political Correctness and roughly translated into English, it means something like “complete conformity with whatever the party line of the CCP currently is”. He was surprised that the liberal Left would use a term with such blatantly totalitarian, even Communist, connotations.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c6238248204510456850 title="comment permalink">2/12/14, 6:52 PM</a><br><br>

For them, the word "fascist" was almost a technical term, applied to almost any opponent of Moscow and Moscow's policies. It was not precisely a snarl word in the mouths of these partisans, but close enough.<br><br>Only during the later 1960s, and especially the 1970s, did I see the word "fascism" begin to be used widely by liberals and left-leaning political people in general, including those who knew little or nothing about Moscow and its policies. At that point it had become a snarl word and nothing more, as JMG has noted. (By that time I had moved to the East Coast, so regional differences in the use of the word may have also come into play here.)<br><br>By then hardly anyone knew where the word had come from, or what exactly the Roman *fasces* had been and what they had symbolized about the power of a Consul in the ancient Roman Republic. So no one except a few Latin teachers paid much attention to the *fasces* -- the ax in the middle of a bundle of rods -- that stood at the center of the obverse of the new FDR dimes. It would have been impolitic to talk about the meaning of that design, once "fascism" had come to be used as a snarl word only.<br><br>By the way, the changing designs of United States coins have several other interesting things to tell about changes that have place in the political climate of the nation since its founding . . . I would include the new design for the obverse of the penny among these indicators of shifts in attitudes.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c2345939403370776376 title="comment permalink">2/12/14, 6:54 PM</a><br><br>

It would seem that a real, versus theoretical, definition of Communism for much of the twentieth century might have been, “whatever Moscow’s party line happened to be that week.”<br><br>It appears a theme of this post, and perhaps the next two as well, is distance between what a political movement is theoretically about (and what a past movement is perceived to be about) and what it is or was really about. My cute comment last week about the problem between worker ownership of the means of production and maintaining an industrial system certainly falls on the theoretically side of things. Actual Communist rulers never have any issues with it and if anything did arise because of it – well that was the guys who were hammering out this week’s party line were supposed to handle.<br><br>The one thing this post brings up is the utter poverty of our current political discourse in this country with its binary options – socialism/fascism/communism versus democracy/capitalism. I just hope that this binary eventually breaks and third (and fourth, fifth and so on) options can finally reappear.<br><br>I have many more questions of course and am looking forward to seeing how many you are able to answer in the next two posts.<br><br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c828758853266405594 title="comment permalink">2/12/14, 7:22 PM</a><br><br>

I was a Republican for 22 years and got tired of people on the Left calling conservatives "fascists" as a general purpose insult. Fifteen years ago, I decided to do something about by seeing what the academic experts on the subject had to say. I'll start with what Stanley Payne, Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, lists as the diagnostic features of fascism in his 1980 book "Fascism: Comparison and Definition":<br><br>A. The Fascist Negations<br><br> 1. Antiliberalism (By "liberalism", this means free-market capitalism and representative democracy, not the democratic socialism and group-identity politics of modern American "liberalism").<br><br> 2. Anticommunism.<br><br> 3. Anticonservatism (Surprise! By "Conservatism" that means resistance to social change and allegiance to traditional sources of authority, such as the church and, in Europe, the crown. Fascism considers itself a modernizing, revolutionary movement that will produce new sources of authority. See Ideology and Goals).<br><br>B. Ideology and Goals<br><br> 1. Creation of a new nationalist authoritarian state based not merely on traditional principles or models.<br><br> 2. Organization of some new kind of regulated, multiclass, integrated national economic structure (national corporatist, national socialist, or national syndicalist; this is why Payne describes the m.o. of fascism as an "all-class revolution" in contrast to the revolution of the proletariat espoused by Communism).<br><br> 3. The goal of empire or a radical change in the nation's relationship with other powers.<br><br> 4. Specific espousal of an idealist, voluntarist creed, normally involving the attempt to realize a new form of modern, self-determined, secular culture.<br><br>C. Style and Organization<br><br> 1. Emphasis on esthetic structure of meetings, symbols, and political choreography, stressing romantic and mystical aspects.<br><br> 2. Attempted mass mobilization with militarization of political relationships and style with the goal of a mass party militia.<br><br> 3. Positive evaluation of and willingness to use violence.<br><br> 4. Extreme stress on the masculine principle and male dominance, while espousing the organic view of society.<br><br> 5. Exaltation of youth above other phases of life, emphasizing the conflict of generations, at least in effecting the initial political transformation.<br><br> 6. Specific tendency toward an authoritarian, charismatic, personal style of command....<br><br>Those criteria work very well to diagnose a mature fascist movement in power or rising into power and unite Mussolini's Fascism, Hitler's Nazism, and Franco's Falangism along with other authoritarian nationalist movements that arose in interwar Europe and Asia; a good many but not all apply to Argentina's Peronism. However, they don't help recognize a fascist movement in its infancy or youth and some may not work well in 21st Century North America. The list is also too long.<br><br>(To be continued)<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c3520609920999281612 title="comment permalink">2/12/14, 8:51 PM</a><br><br>

These movements also tend very strongly to right-wing populism. These criteria will pick out a proto-fascist movement rather early in its ontogeny. As AlanfromBigEasy pointed out, The Tea Party would fit this model. My opinion of the Tea Party is that its even more in denial of its fascism than it is of its racism. Fortunately, it doesn't have a youth movement or uniformed street thugs (cosplayers in Revolutionary War garb don't count), like a mature fascist movement would. Instead, it's a bunch of right-wing Gray Panthers, so it makes it less acutely physically dangerous.

Protesters have seized government buildings around the country and it is questionable whether or not the current government will be able to take them back without the use of considerable force.

We happen to live in Lviv and, though one can't prove a negative, we have not seen any thugs around, let alone streets filled with them. To my wife and me, the protesters represent a huge chunk of Ukraine. They have many different points of view and represent a wide spectrum of society. They are united in their outrage at the current government which functions very much like a criminal organization.

It was interesting to note that in 2012 the anti-Muslim English Defence League (EDL) chose Denmark as the location for their first official conference. As a result there was much hand-wringing by apologetic UK-based progressives, who tend to project a morally-simplistic Good (Denmark) and Evil (the UK) narrative onto political discourse.<br><br>But from my decade living in the former country I could not help but notice that the idea of being anti-Islamic is more or less salonfähig there - so it seemed like a logical choice for the EDL. Indeed, if one could read Danish, many of the commentators on news sites were supportive of this 'brave' group. <br><br>This, after all, was the country where the Danish People's Party - whose policies are basically 'a generous welfare state for ethnic Danes' - held positions of power for so long.

Now that is a golden nugget of dangerous knowledge right there. I am fairly sure you are right, because the same thing seems to have happened in East Asia. This is going to be a long comment, but since we're going down the complex road of post-WW2 political regimes I think it will prove relevant.<br><br>Japan in the 1920s had an excess of left-wing intellectuals. In order to deal with them, the government gave them jobs in Manchuria. According to the diary of one of these men, "One group were men who had traveled to Manchuria after coming under severe attack in Japan with their political movements back home crushed. A second group were men who escaped to Manchuria after being arrested any number of times by the police and having renounced in writing their left-wing political views ... A third group was those who were unable to find work because of their activities in the political movement and had accordingly come to Manchuria." (Ito Takeo, <i>Life Among the Manchurian Railway</i>, p. 174)<br><br>That is to say, Japanese colonialism was basically a left-wing operation!<br><br>In Manchuria, after the military had helpfully set up a puppet state, the left-wing intellectuals created a complex bureaucracy. Legally, the Empire of Manchukuo was run by democratically elected Chinese politicians. Actually, the legal system was so convoluted that the politicians were completely at the mercy of Japanese bureaucrats, who had the power to stop any behavior they didn't like. The Japanese elites created a network of large corporations, like zaibatsu but under the control of the bureaucracy, and this in turn resulted in astounding economic growth.<br><br>The next part is a little sketchier but believable. According to the veteran journalist Eamonn Fingleton's book <i>In the Jaws of the Dragon</i>, the zaibatsu in Japan Proper were an independent political force and stood as a threat to implementing a similarly centralized, one-party system on the home islands. When MacArthur occupied Japan, the Japanese intellectuals advising him told him to break up these warmongering zaibatsu and replace them with smaller individual corporations (like Baby Bells). The broken-up businesses required government approval to link back together, and thus the zaibatsu (now called keiretsu) came under control of the postwar bureaucrats. The postwar electoral reforms, quietly designed after Manchukuo's system, also guaranteed that politicians would be powerless and at the mercy of the bureaucracy. Again, this strategy resulted in staggering economic growth in the 1960s.<br><br>Fingleton proposes that the Manchukuo system was in fact so successful that it was adopted across East Asia: in South Korea, Taiwan, and even China! Furthermore, Western journalists like to construct narratives about dissent within China, pretending that there is a European style democracy struggling to get out, but in fact Chinese businesses are so dependent on the bureaucracy for success that political revolt becomes less likely every year. The bureaucrats are in for the long haul, and freed from political concerns, they have the ability to plan for the oil crisis two decades down the road. (The manipulation of the Western media is proven to an embarrassing extent in <i>In the Jaws of the Dragon</i>.)<br><br>Whether the American dream stands a chance against this Confucian-style government is not something we can see through a crystal ball. But perhaps deeper thoughts about the creation of stable regimes in difficult times can help direct this discussion away from this facile dialectic of democracy vs. fascism.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c6144690253104201171 title="comment permalink">2/12/14, 11:02 PM</a><br><br>

It touches upon some issuses that I was thinking about before when reading comments under your blog, and I had really strong temptation to intervene.<br><br>As a matter of fact, fascism as a type of ideology is so well described and defined by politologists, historians of ideologies and similar others that it would be useless to reinvent what they say. In any case, I warmly welcome your historical excursion, which comes as very precise to me.<br><br>I am indeed deeply troubled by the fact that real neo-fascism, as academically defines, is on its rise in the whole Europe now, which is also what serious peer-reviewed analyses tell us; what more, a new neo-fascist International is just being constituted all over Europe, and many parties that are genuinely neo-fascist or neo-nacist or at least are in close contact with such movements are gaining popularity - France, Netherlands, Greece, Romania, Hungary, but lately also Slovakia, and especially Russia, where one of the outstanding teoreticians of ultra-right is the adviser to the president. You know, we here in Central Europe, with our grandparents that were planned to play a certain role in the imagination of the Reich's leading ideologists and politicians (would have our grandparents ended in gas chambers, been moved to Argentine, or rather sterilized and "reeducated"?), are a bit oversensitive to such things as fascism and Nazism. It is really terrifying that you have now people who explicitly claim to be inspired by the legacy of the ultra-right regimes of 30's and 40's, and symbols derived from the fascist and Nazi symbols of the past in public.<br><br>What troubles me as well is that I can find some traces of more or less unconscious ultra-conservative thinking reminiscent of fascism in the peak oil blogosphere, but sometimes it is also relatively conscious programme that is close to genuine fascism. In my opinion, this is precisely the danger of a too dogmatic denial of anything related to modernity in toto - of everything that has been achieved in societal progress since Renaissance or Enlightenment. I can see too often the zeal of convertites, who came to realize the present situation is untenable. For too many people everything that has ever relied of fossil fuels, and especially everything that is a product of the present system, is evil.<br><br>A crystal clear case is Juhana here: a former liberal, now despising liberalism and promoting "neo-tribalism", welcoming the rising influence of the Orthodox Church in East Europe, and what you have. The fact is that Putin's Russia has declared herself the world's conservative power and that the ultraright doctrines, including Dugin's aggressive geopolitical teaching, are popular there; and both Dugin's "euroasianists" and the Orthodox Church have close contacts with neofascist movements both at home and all over Europe. After all what happened in Europe in 20's-50's, I simply cannot understand how anyone not totally brain-washed could ever welcome the rise of these movements. In the end, this simply amounts to support for the rule of skinheads - one can almost feel how Europe is becoming a dangerous place these days. For me, the most decadent and corrupt liberal democracy is million times better any of those "appealing" systems of thought for young, strong, authentic close-to-nature etc. ones.

And especially those Canadians and Americans featuring in commentaries below his blog preparing to do the same what Orlov proposes for his son. Well, saying that present-day Russia is in fact far saner place than any country in the West - this must be from the perspective of pure concern for bare survival, not taking account anything else than extense of free land, abundance of water or climate. But people do not live just by these, and especially until states exists. I wonder how these to-be-immigrants will be welcomed in Russia: immigrants are always terribly popular in ultra-conservative societies and in times of crisis. Russians will certainly embrace these Canadians and Americans - against which Alexander Dugin would like to fight in WWIII. Also, utterly technocratic, anti-liberal, anti-postmodern, anti-civil-rights, oil-burning and oil-selling Russia will certainly show understanding for independent permaculturalists or other alternative lifestyles - when it is already so nice on gays, environmentalist, journalists etc. A bit naive?<br><br>Finally, I would also warn against too excesive scapegoating in commentaries.

This line runs through Finland, the Baltic countries and Belorus in the North, through Ukraine, between Hungary and Rumania, splits at Bosnia and goes around both sides of that region, and passes between Croatia and Serbia until it ends on the Mediterranean coast. (Bosnia was a third kind of Christianity, neither Catholic nor Orthodox, during much of the Middle Ages.) <br><br>In the centuries before this fault-line developed, there was a fairly powerful state centered on the city of Kiev in what is now -- but was not then -- called Ukraine. A variety of factors broke the power of that state around the time that the Catholic-Orthodox fault-line developed, and turned its territory into a natural border-land between stronger powers.<br><br>Like all such European borderlands, Ukraine has served as the rope in a tug-of-war between more powerful countries across that divide: Poland and Germany in the West, Muscovite Russia in the East. Each of these players had its partisans among the people who lived in the borderland. This resulted in strong fault-lines within the modern culture(s) of those people. WW2 only strengthened these divisions: caught between Russia and Germany, many Ukrainians preferred Germany, many others preferred Russia, and yet others preferred independence, saying to the two powers, "A plague upon both your houses." Since both Germany and Russia were seen as "Leftist" states at the time, the "Rightists" in Ukraine were largely forced into the third camp. After the war Ukraine was incorporated into the (Russian-dominated) USSR, and all these old allegiances and preferences became things too dangerous to discuss dispassionately.<br><br>And here's where I walk through a live mine-field . . . The situation was hugely complicated by the history of political power in Muscovite Russia, which had borrowed all its institutions, titles and political vocabulary from the Kievan state, and claimed that it was the sole legitimate successor of that state. <br><br>It wasn't. Depending on how you judge succession, there was either no successor state or two competing successor states. The other contender (with much the same institutions, titles and political vocabulary) was based in Vilnius, not Moscow, and originally it lay on the Orthodox side of the fault-line, not the Catholic one. Eventually this other contender state was absorbed into Poland in an almost accidental fashion (and thus became aligned with Catholicism rather than Orthodoxy), more by political and diplomatic means than by military ones.<br><br>But in Moscow, the old failed Kievan state was seen as a major source of Moscow's legitimacy, and any failure to control Ukraine feels in Moscow like a threat to the legitimacy of of the Russian government. (Many Ukrainians don't see it that way, of course.) So the stakes are very high indeed here, maybe as high as those involving Serbia and Kosovo.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c1281289189456545498 title="comment permalink">2/13/14, 2:46 AM</a><br><br>

Pity you had to spoil your reference with a bit of apple pie fascism:<br><br>“What we perceive as bizarre was as American as apple pie back in the day...”<br><br>So we poor Europeans had to wait for the USA to invent the apple pie? Here are two links to disabuse you of that notion:<br><br>http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/PieHistory/ApplePie.htm<br><br>http://www.piemaven.com/history.html<br><br>Thijs Goverde said:<br><br>“Are you absolutely certain about the Wallonians? As far as I know it was mainly the Flemish who cooperated with the Germans in both world wars. The idea being that the Germans, speaking a germanic language like the Dutch-speaking Flemish, would break the rule of the French-speaking Wallonians.”<br><br>The Nazis were skilled at accentuating different parts of their eclectic program to appeal to their target groups. From 1943 they emphasised to the occupied peoples their aim to save European culture from Bolshevism, and this enthused a small number of West Europeans to join the S.S. Legions. My stamp collection of World War 2 includes some of the military field post stamps of those legions, including a set for the Wallonian Legion. Just Google “Léon Degrelle” and “Wallonian Legion”.<br><br>The Archdruid said:<br><br>“They weren't trying to copy a "fascist economy," because you're quite right, there's no such animal; they copied the national socialist economy, because that was the system they feared -- not the Italian one.”<br><br>The Nazis implemented a pick and mix of policies from the left and the right, including some pseudo-socialist or social democratic policies. It’s also in the nature of democracy that impulses from both left and the right get incorporated into the system over the years, so I’d say that the post war Western economies were based on what worked, and it’s accidental that they resemble the Nazi economy in any aspect. <br><br>The Archdruid said:<br><br>“As for palingenetic ultranationalism, yes, that will pick out fascist movements early on, but it will also pick out movements that aren't fascist by any stretch of the imagination -- Gandhi's movement for the liberation of India could be described in those terms, you know. You run the risk of identifying fifteen of the next three fascist movements well in advance.”<br><br>I’d define ultranationalist as meaning “my nation or race above all others”, with the corollary that you consider yourself absolved of any moral compunction in your treatment of those of other nations or races. By that token, Gandhi was merely nationalist, as he was too spiritually-inclined to be ultranationalist.<br><br>onething said:<br><br>“As my old friend from the former USSR said, the difference between the fascists (she meant Nazis) and the communists was that the fascists mostly killed others while the communists killed their own.”<br><br>True up to a point, but the Nazis also defined various Germans as “other” (or “life that is unworthy as life”) and then killed them: Jews, gays, the handicapped, communists, democrats, etc. <br><br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c9181652019736665091 title="comment permalink">2/13/14, 5:19 AM</a><br><br>

This is quite distinct from inverted totalitarianism. Instead, economic forces have constrained much of the US government, which seems to suffer from inertia.<br> <br>One might point to Barack Obama as being the mascot for the corruption and degeneracy of the liberal class (as Chris Hedges has done), or one might point to Obama's cooperative policies with regard to Wall Street, the military-industrial complex, insurance companies, mining companies and fossil fuel companies as being exactly what one might expect from a leader in an inverted totalitarian industrialized state.<br><br>In any case, what we have in the USA is far removed from fascism, either in the original definition or the one used by Mussolini. <br><br>I believe that you were correct several months ago in pointing out that in reality we live at a time in which our national government is weak (although large, corrupt, intrusive and wasteful), and in which there is really nobody in charge in a truly significant sense.<br><br>A strong government should be able to change course quickly in response to changing international and domestic circumstances.

Fascism in Spain meant the expulsion of university professors who did not endorse the appalling historical, cultural and racial nonsense preached by the Falange; many of the Falangist professors who did endorse it are still holding University chairs in Spain, so the reach is long.

One of the problems in the 20th century was that those on the left had a tendency to overlook or try to excuse the tyrannies of the extreme left, while those on the right had a tendency to overlook or try to excuse the tyrannies of the extreme right. In my experience the word fascism has often been use by these on the left to describe those on the right. This is why I prefer to use the term “totalitarianism”, as this is a term that is free of left/right bias and can be equally used for tyrannies of the left and right. It is those political movements that want to remove the restraints imposed by demoracrary, free press etc that pose the real threat. It does not matter which end of the political spectrum they come from.<br><br>It strikes me that as we go further down the slope of hubberts curve that a 20th century concept of left and right may start to lose its relevance. If we are going to be moving into what Spengler call the second religiosity, then the battle ground may move back to older religions like Islam and Christianity etc. We already see this happening in the middle east. I know that the battles in the 20th century were about the secular religions of progress.

Our treatment of history and human behavior in the public schools is straightforward religio-patriotic brainwashing, and by the time we get free of the compulsory system and into college, we've already "specialized" into something more lucrative than history: sciences, business, etc., and in the name of efficiency, do not get a broad education in matters outside that specialty.<br><br>There is almost no substance at all in our mainstream media, which is why a lot of us have tuned it out. The only things of value in our media are (some) entertainment, but the themes are so limited and predictable, it's really not even entertaining any more. It certainly isn't educational or challenging: it's mostly pandering to pre-existing prejudices and tastes, with the goal of financial profit.<br><br>Never having been exposed to meaningful historical information in school or media, we don't discuss it amongst ourselves -- not at coffee-shops, not at potlucks, not at church socials. If you do know anything at all, you are like a chess player in a world of tic-tac-toe. I already know far too much; negotiating a typical political conversation at a party has become, for me, an exercise in watching my tongue.<br><br>There is also a strong anti-intellectual cultural streak throughout much of the country, though there are other regions where this isn't true. But most of the West, where I grew up, will beat you up in your youth if you are "too smart for your own good," and this general attitude follows people well into adulthood, with a significant number of people who remain ignorant, and proud of it, right up to the casket. It's acceptable, once you reach adulthood, to be knowledgeable in your field, but you aren't supposed to know anything outside that field. We're supposed to buy into a kind of general myth that "you can be good at One Thing."<br><br>That has fostered a culture of specialization, expertise, and credentialing. So in the eyes of many Americans, JMG would be just a blowhard because he does not have whatever imagined credentials are required to critique modern civilization. I see this frequently regarding Noam Chomsky -- what business does he have, talking about US foreign policy? He's just a "linguist."<br><br>This general ignorance serves a political purpose, of course, else it would have been fixed a long time ago.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c2998193828659468513 title="comment permalink">2/13/14, 8:12 AM</a><br><br>

There are any number of ways we could go. Are you familiar with the works of Allen Butcher? He has spent years studying the "intentional community" movement, and demonstrates how different communities can have multiple economic systems, based on who owns the wealth (private vs. public ownership) and who makes decisions about that wealth (consensus methods vs. democratic majority vs. small authoritarian group). Some of these ideas probably wouldn't be practical on the level of a nation state, but on a local level, many of these systems could work very well.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c8968391666224916089 title="comment permalink">2/13/14, 8:53 AM</a><br><br>

Confusing, and I'll have to return to this essay a few times in order to even follow your next couple of posts, I suspect. I'm an engineer, not a historian.<br><br>Meanwhile, I note a modern irony which this particular historical perspective presents to me -- something I have always felt but found it difficult to put into words:<br><br>Those in America today who most proudly call themselves "progressives," are actually conservatives, at least in the near-to-medium historical sense. American Progressives today fight to preserve the system of relatively moderate government co-ordination and regulation of businesses, with institutionalized fringe benefits handed out to the poor and middle class -- the same system which rocketed Germany from a provincial fiefdom into the technological, military, economic and political leader of the world, for a decade or two back around 80 years ago. In another irony, that system flourished in America immediately after America defeated it in Europe, and the system (fueled by petroleum of course) also rocketed America from a former agrarian backwater into the technological, military, economic, and political leader of the world. That system has been under blistering attack for the past 30 years -- not least because of the waning of the fossil fuels it is based upon -- but also, politically, by those in America who call themselves "conservatives". <br><br>Those Americans who most proudly call themselves political "conservatives", also ironically, are apparently radical progressives. Their stated verbal policy is to "return" America to a bizarre paradisiacal state which has, far as I know, never actually existed in Earth's history... A kind of self-levitating commerce-ocracy, based entirely on rational economic transactions between free individual consumers and unregulated businesses, without any apparent infrastructure or support from governments nor even guilds or social movements. That's their stated verbal goal, and as with all political rhetoric no doubt the bulk of their members believe it in their hearts. But I suspect in real life the actual practice of such policies would lead the society backwards into something more like a feudal state... a feudal state that had modern technology. Which sounds distasteful to our modern ears, but I remember you saying once or twice that absent moral judgment, feudalism is a reasonably stable mode of organization for tribes of humans to live.<br><br>Just my 2-cents, please let me know if I am severely misinterpreting something...<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c6444898001761830818 title="comment permalink">2/13/14, 9:39 AM</a><br><br>

I've already learned a good bit this week. Perhaps I'm getting ahead of the conversation but I don't see National socialism, as you defined it having a significant influence over American politics for many years.<br><br>When I use "fascism" in conversation, I have been referring to a government controlled and motivated by corporate interests. This different from Socialism in that the government does not own private corporations, but also different from classic capitalism in that (I think) capitalism places an interest in profitable economics in general while the philosophy I called fascist is willing to suppress the rights of small businesses and free markets, as well as individuals, to increase corporate power. It is not pure aristocracy, either. While the "1%" is it's principle financial beneficiaries the focus is not on supporting their interests as much as the collective abstract corporate entities themselves.<br><br>I have long said that the American people are only free because it is good for business. It's coming out now that one of the more substantive (not justified) objections to Obamacare is that it removes health insurance as one of the chains of wage slavery. Conservatives are blatantly saying that is an utter disaster that independent access to healthcare will give people more choice in where, or if, to work. Even that legislation was largely written by the insurance industry to end run around more significant reforms.<br><br>When the American people stand up, refuse to continue participating in mindless materialism and demand equal wealth distribution, they will be smacked down hard and fast, including the possible installation of a corporate sponsored dictatorship. That will be deffended by calls to patriotism and a fight against the internal "terrorists" who would undermine the interests of (corporate) America. It will be a very long time before the people, or their charismatic leader, have enough power and influence to install a government that takes their interests into account in any significant way at all. Even outright violent revolution will be largely ineffectual until the armed services revolts against the government.<br><br>But that's just my observation.

(You said it much more eloquently, but hopefully the group of words I put together to describe a ‘word’ conveyed the ideas I was intending.) It is just a label we assign to something and the something everyone agrees upon at the moment is the extent of its usefulness. In this case, the alternative news outlets I pay attention to consistently use the term ‘fascist’ today to describe the merger of corporate and state power. When I hear the word ‘fascist’ that is immediately what comes to mind, thus to me it is useful in that setting. It is also interesting to note that the more critical thinking outlets I peruse don’t seem to blindly throw the term about and will sometimes examine its definition or inform the reader/viewer of their definition when they do use the term. (James Corbett’s most recent video is an example.) I am guessing outside of that setting, say in the mainstream media, it is thrown about much the way you have described. (Though, I wouldn’t really know. I tuned the mainstream media out long ago.) I don’t want this to detract from your post JMG, so I will say that I certainly do find it interesting and sometimes useful to discover the history of words and how their meaning has changed through time.

I have one minor point that I hesitate to bring up because it relies on subjective and anecdotal interpretations of broad words like "average," but I guess I'm bringing it up anyway. When you say <br><br>&gt;[the Nazis] weren’t saying anything the average German found offensive or even unusual [about Jews]<br><br>I'm reminded of my reading of William Sheridan Allen's <i>The Nazi Seizure of Power: The Experience of a Single German Town</i> and his descriptions of rural German Jews and Christians living peacefully side by side before 1933. I don't deny antisemitism in the 1920s was a potent force and casually widespread in ways most Westerners would consider shocking today, and I get your larger point, but I do have to think parts of <i>Mein Kampf</i>, published in full by 1926, expressed antisemitic ideas that were more extreme than those held by average Germans. For instance, I don't think Hitler's declaration that "the personification of the devil as the symbol of all evil assumes the living shape of the Jew" was something most average Germans, who in the cities shopped in Jewish-owned stores and in many small towns had Jewish neighbors, agreed with in the 1920s. I DO think most Christian Germans though were wildly more antisemitic about Eastern European Jews though than they were about their Jewish countrymen and women.<br><br>One can quibble about who is and isn't "average," and obviously a great number of Germans even before 1933 considered Hitler's antisemitism acceptable enough, even if they didn't personally agree with all of it, that they were OK overlooking it and supporting him. Certainly none of this negates anything about your larger points.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c2637987686712033273 title="comment permalink">2/13/14, 10:30 AM</a><br><br>

Since 1933, and the “State of Emergency,” the government appears to have focused its energies into establishing a totalitarian police state under collectivism via national socialism (FICA / Social Security). This has been done by incremental taxation and restrictive regulation, amounting to the overt takeover of the nation’s people, vocations, and property. (When you need permission / license and pay a tax to do that which your ancestors did without permission or taxation, you had better realize you’re no longer a free man.)<br><br>In that regard, America has been solidly “left wing” since 1935, and the alleged rivalry between liberals and conservatives are far left of center. Frankly, until the state of emergency is ended, and people volunteer out of national socialism (FICA), America is the shining beacon of glorious socialism (aka The Peoples Democratic Socialist Republic of America) without absolute ownership rights and natural liberties that our forefathers endowed us with.<br><br>The “Takers” outvote the “Taken,” so there is no remedy in the ballot box nor reform in the democratic form of government. That leaves us the one viable solution : the republican form of government (not synonymous with “republic”). Sadly, not 1 in 100,000 Americans know of it, nor can they accurately define it, or even realize that they have surrendered their rights in it. Such is the victory of the world’s greatest propaganda ministry, bar none.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c7467553493452816727 title="comment permalink">2/13/14, 11:48 AM</a><br><br>

And yes, it is used as a snarl word. Nonetheless, it may still have meaning if defined narrowly. My favourite definition of fascism comes from the quote attributed to Mussolini that runs as follows:<br><br>"Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power."<br><br>Benito was unusually concise and lucid on this occasion. Your readers may enjoy his more characteristic bombastic drivel at http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/mussolini-fascism.asp. <br><br>Because it is such an emotionally loaded word (this being Mussolini's fault as much as that of anyone else), if people use the word without defining it, I'd say that is a “tell”. It gives away the game. Now you are in the realm of polemics i.e. argument for the sake of victory not truth. <br><br>As defined in the quote above, fascism isn't something that may happen in the future. It is obviously something that has already largely arrived in many countries. Since it is pointless to argue definitions, if a word needs to be defined every time you use it, it may be time to retire the word.<br><br>Lovely post.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c4719907677349548567 title="comment permalink">2/13/14, 12:36 PM</a><br><br>

I think that's what JMG hints at in the final paragraph.<br><br>Any kind of major environmental disaster (major flood, prolonged drought, long-term interruption of electrical power over a wide area, substantial interruption of food supplies, pandemic that affects tens of millions of citizens in the modern, industrial world) or global economic and/or energy supply related sustained "event" could easily have a large percentage of the affected population demanding that governments come in and assert control, re-establish order and just "bring back the good old days". But once governments "take over", people may quickly find that they like the ways that "the trains run on time" (sometimes), and that all those undesirables who begged for food and money on the streets and sidewalks are suddenly gone and no one knows where they went.

It bears on fascism in the USA <br><br>My father, who was Danish-American, had worked all his adult life in the defense weapons industry (starting with the Norden Bombsight Project), and had a very high level security clearance, took me aside one day in the summer of 1960, just before I started college, for a very private conversation. He told me that there was something I would never hear in any course in American history, but should know anyway. That's how important he thought it! And he also thought it dangerous enough knowledge that it had to be passed on in private. (This was the only time in his life where he took any precautions to keep any conversation with me private.)<br><br>What he wanted me to know was how very close a thing it had been that the US had not entered WW2 on the side of Nazi Germany -- a fact that everyone would now just as soon forget. <br><br>The sort of people he had worked with -- Military brass hats, top executives in the defense industry, captains in other industries, weapons engineers with high-level security clearances, and so forth -- had been pretty much equally divided into thirds about entering WW2. About one third of these people wanted to stay out of the war altogether, and another third wanted badly to enter the war on the side of the Allies. And the final third wanted with equal passion to enter the war on the side of the Axis. This final third seemed to him to be winning the debate in the months before the Axis attack on Pearl Harbor. <br><br>This last third argued that Germany, after all, had the best engineers, made the best machines and machine tools, and had perfected the scientific method. It also had had the good sense to follow our own home-grown American lead in matters of eugenics, the sterilization of the "unfit," and "racial science" in general. (These were regarded by very many as real advances in the progress of American science at the time.)<br><br>Had it not been for that attack, he was fairly certain that we would have entered WW2 on the Axis side within a few months, and that this would have made all the difference: the Axis would have won WW2, and shaped the subsequent course of Western history. He did not like to contemplate what this would have meant for the future course of our civilization. <br><br>So anyone who might hope, "it can't happen here," needs to think hard about the possibility. It nearly did happen here. It wouldn't take all that much for it to happen again -- not as a plot by some secret evil cabal, but as the open expression of popular will.<br><br><br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c7353254560191758809 title="comment permalink">2/13/14, 1:36 PM</a><br><br>

First, the German national socialist program was by no means as eclectic as all that – as I mentioned in my post, national socialism was a recognized position on the spectrum of political economy, and the Hitler regime's <i>gleichschaltung</i> of German industry after 1933 was straight out of that position. Second, however adaptable democracy might be, it's still the case that none of the democracies adopted such measures before 1933, and most of them rushed to do so after 1945.

They are two completely different animals. The Nazis, Fascists and Communists are clearly examples of the latter. In the U.S., the Democratic party has an economic platform closer to national socialism, but the right-wing Republican party in America has configured itself into an authoritarian movement based largely on the John Birch Society of the 1950's, merged with discredited "Austrian" economic theories, Christian reconstructionism, and the social Darwinism of Ayn-Rand. The signatures of an <i>authoritarian movement </i>include:<br><br>1. Scapegoating of minority groups for the nation's problems (Jews and gypsies in Germany, blacks and Hispanics in the US)<br>2. Intolerance of homosexuality and embrace of "traditional values." Hatred of so-called "degenerates."<br>3. Macho chauvanism and embracing of martial virtues, including gun fetishism.<br>4. Reverence and worship of the miltary and military strength. Deference to all soldiers as "heroes" regardless of their role.<br>5. Complete and total aggreement and a sidelining of any opposing voices. Marching in lock-step.<br>6. Rewriting history and unthinking reverence for past leaders (compare Reagan to Lenin, Mao, etc.)<br>7. Government regulation of personal behavior and victimless crimes (abortion, drug use, etc.).<br>8. Mass surveillance of the citizenry (NSA, although this is embraced by both parties).<br>9. Use of physical intimidation and citizen militias to frighten their enemies (Brown shirts then, Brooks Brothers riots, bringing guns to town hall meetings, and patrolling polling places for "fraud" today).<br>10. Use of incessant propaganda to reinforce belief systems which spin a "different" truth for followers (compare Goebbels "big lie" to FOX news, Drudge, Limbaugh, etc.)<br>9. Politicization of every aspect of life, including things like transportation policy, science, etc. (e.g. trains and bikes are socialism; global warming is a hoax. Compare to Lysenkoism and Horbigers' World Ice Theory).<br>10. The branding of opponents not just as people with different ideas about governance, but as subversives and traitors to the nation to be eliminated at all costs (e.g. anything written by Ann Coulter).<br><br>I would argue that this is far more useful to understand the dangers of political parties than focusing on economics. That's why I prefer to use the term authoritarianism instead of Fascism, since authoritarianism is agnostic of an economic platform. The above checklist is accurate to authoritarian parties from the Nazis and Communists, to today's far right parties such as Jobbik and the Golden Dawn (the Greek version, not the mystical lodge). Although it should be noted that the American Republican version may be the first and only one to leave most of its followers worse off economically.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c8004198639412983510 title="comment permalink">2/13/14, 3:16 PM</a><br><br>

I'll be re-reading it to get even more out of it than I already have.<br><br>Here's an experience from earlier this week that is at least relevant to the broader themes of your blog, if not precisely this post. A new bridge over the Mississippi in downtown St. Louis will be opened to vehicle traffic later this month. Last Saturday, it was opened for several hours to pedestrians and human-powered wheeled vehicles. On Monday I looked at Facebook to see what was there. I found a post from an acquaintance who calls himself a climate change activist extolling the actions of another such, a woman, who had walked the bridge with a sign urging people to act on climate now. It hit me wrong, so I asked how she had gotten to the bridge to make her statement, saying I hoped she hadn't driven as it would negate the power of her message. First he seemed to misunderstand my question, so I repeated it and said I'd stopped going to protests by car when driving cars made whatever was being protested against worse. Then he told me that while he respected my choice, I was not to be critical of him or other climate change activists because they are doing what they can to engage others. He said "our opposition" would love for us to sit at home and tend to our organic gardens but he and other activists would not give them the satisfaction. She joined in the conversation and it turned out she drove her Nissan Leaf all electric car downtown to a charging station to get most of the way to the bridge, where another friend picked her up and drove her to the bridge. Our electric utility generates 73% of its electricity from coal, so it could fairly be said that she did more damage driving the Leaf than she would have by driving a gasoline-powered car. She also said she's got solar panels generating 70% of her electricity, so maybe that makes the car a little greener than I gave her credit for above. Still, this exchange indicates not only their idea of themselves as the holy opposition, but that I and others are not to question what they do in that regard. I find that rather chilling. And that may dovetail into the theme of this and the next few posts.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c7178805921292369343 title="comment permalink">2/13/14, 3:39 PM</a><br><br>

Often there is a charismatic leader at the top. This system achieved and maintains it's grip by playing the emotions of people under it in particular ways. First they play the peoples feelings of victim-hood. They also play a fear of the Other. Some sort of identifiable group is blamed as the cause of their problems or their decline. There is a propaganda machine to make lots of <i>"verbal noises linked to heated emotional states"</i>. And a large part of the population buys into this nasty emotionalism.<br><br>Based of the post by Pinku-sensai the word <i>Fascist</i> may fit. But if this word has devolved into just a snarl word then most people will not understand the intended meaning.<br><br><br>Second, how could we label a system where the government is run for the benefit of multination corporations. The government could be obviously autocratic or it could go through the motions of being a democracy. <br><br>One possible label is <i>corpocracy</i> but that sounds a lot like corporatism. I have just learned corporatism is more about giving workers or government more control and ownership. That label does not fit. I could call this second system <i>bannana republicanism</i> but then no one would know what I mean by this label.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c7174278786757410088 title="comment permalink">2/13/14, 3:45 PM</a><br><br>

I kept seeing how many of them were changing the definition of communism to dis-include the excesses of the various soviet, Asian, and Latin American governments. It was one of those weird and rather juvenile attempts to whitewash a political ideology so it could be popularized and put back to use.

Eddie, you're an example of Pushback Method #1: pretend that my post didn't say anything contrary to the conventional wisdom, and talk right past the points I made instead of responding to them. Here's your test question: how many "generals and titans of industry" were in the inner circle of either the German or the Italian fascist regimes? Answer: none. Ergo, your definition of fascism doesn't correspond to the historical reality; as I noted, it's been distorted for partisan ends, just like "socialism." <br><br>Thomas, nope, you're square on the money. <br><br>Btidwell, authoritarian regimes run by and for the interests of very large businesses have been quite common in the last century or so, especially in Latin America, where the US used to impose them at gunpoint for the benefit of United Fruit and several other corporations. Those differed from fascism in a great many ways -- we'll talk about some of those next week. If you want a convenient slogan, you might talk about the idea that the rich want to turn the US into a banana republic, to the extent that they haven't done so already. <br><br>Dustin, the problem there is that using the term "fascist" in its modern debased sense makes it harder to recognize actual, classic fascist movements – and as I commented in my post, I'm deeply concerned that such movements could play a large and disastrous role in our future. Those who like to decry today's failing democracies as fascist states have forgotten that some of the likely alternatives are far, far worse. More on this two weeks from now. <br><br>Zed, even those Germans who objected to anti-Semitism were used to it, knew that plenty of their neighbors believed in it, and treated it by and large as just one more set of opinions that some people had. That's the point that I was trying to make. \<br><br>MPL, well, of course. The fracking bubble's losing air, so people have to come up with some other way to convince themselves that they can expect limitless energy from a finite planet. <br><br>Eddie, not so. You're engaged in the very common tactic of taking a real phenomenon and exaggerating it to the point of absurdity. Please go read Orwell's novel, pay attention to the role that Newspeak plays in it, and notice the differences between that and the current misuse of language. <br><br>Paul, and because it's being used for relatively modest steps toward authoritarianism – how many of your friends have been rounded up and sent to prison camps? – the misuse of the word is making it much more likely that actual fascism will not be recognized when it appears. <br><br>Jetgraphics, well, that's another way to classify things; I'm not sure that it's particularly useful, but it's an option.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c6890074155018425488 title="comment permalink">2/13/14, 3:52 PM</a><br><br>

Or would it be better to just drop the term in its modern use all together and replace it with something else? I see banana republic was mentioned. Either way, it seems like it might help for us all to come to a common agreement on what to call the mess we're currently facing today.

First, as G.K. Chesterton says, "progress takes for granted an already defined direction: and it is exactly about the direction that we disagree." Everyone believes in progress towards their own idea of goodness. "Progressivism" is in that sense as useless a term as "fascism".<br><br>Second, as you were pointing out, American conservatives these days are actually liberals, because they believe that the golden age was an age of freedom from government. So they are progressives in that sense too.<br><br>In any case, you make an excellent case that the much-hyped left-right divide in America actually boils down to a debate over the meaning of "freedom", and what kind of freedoms should be on our agenda.

Sara reads more literature than I do -- she's a particular fan of Jane Austen and other 19th century British authors -- and so when the two of us are standing at a bus stop talking, the conversation might well end up banking off magical philosoply, Celtic legend, word origins, and some plot twist from <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> by the time it really gets going!<br><br>Marcello, interesting. I'd read that "fasci di combattimento" was another term for "arditi" -- if that's incorrect, so noted. <br><br>Cherokee, sorry for the confusion! I was referring to the actions of the authorities, of course. What you're doing is precisely a matter of trying to work with an evolving system, rather than applying some harebrained rationalizing scheme to it. <br><br>Agent, okay, here we have Pushback Method #2: pull a very brief statement out of context, neglect to note that the meanings of the words have changed, and use that to try to defend the conventional wisdom. Here's your test question: how much did the <i>corporazione</i> Mussolini was talking about have in common with, say, Goldman Sachs? Answer: nothing. He wasn't talking about corporations in the modern American sense, he was talking about syndicalist structures that forced management and labor to sit down together and negotiate under the beady eyes of Fascist Party officials. (You can look this up in any book on Italian Fascism.) I did mention this in my post, you know...<br><br>Saturnboy, Steiner's biodynamic methods have very strongly influenced my organic gardening style, and of late I've been putting a fair amount of time into studying his elucidations of Goethe's work in the natural sciences; I haven't studied his sociopolitical thought. (As I'm sure you're aware, there's a lot of Steiner to read!) Thus I can't really comment on its potential viability in a deindustrial world. As for biodynamics, though, that's a slam-dunk -- it's a good system, and entirely workable in a nonindustrial world. <br><br>Ric, no, that's not what I was hinting at, but it's a good point. The word "authoritarian" is a good one for those social forms that stress centralized authority and expect (and compel) people to obey. Yes, we're going to see a lot of that; the movement toward "state capitalism" of the Russian and Chinese sort is a good example. <br><br>Robert, many thanks for sharing that story. I spoke in an earlier series of posts about the old division in American society between the Anglophile coasts and the Anglophobe hinterlands; that was a much more powerful force before 1941 than most people remember -- and the attitudes that guided Hitler's regime were a good deal more popular here than most people like to admit. <br><br>MawKernewek, "Newspeak" was a good deal more than euphemisms. You might want to reread Orwell's book one of these days. <br><br>Andy, fascinating. That's worth considering. <br><br>Escape, excellent. Not all authoritarian movements blame their troubles on minority groups, unless you consider "the rich" as a minority group, but other than that, your taxonomy is pretty much spot on. It's crucial, as you point out, to remember that this sort of system can emerge from any point in the political spectrum -- another detail that today's easy talk about fascism tends to miss. <br><br>SLClaire, that story's utterly appropriate to the current topic, as well as the broader topic of this blog. It's precisely the insistence, on the part of activists, that actions of theirs must not be judged because they're doing all of it in a good cause, that leads by few and easy steps to the equivalent of armbands and prison camps.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c2234426807162162972 title="comment permalink">2/13/14, 6:13 PM</a><br><br>

The origins of what, here in the States, used to be called Nativism is a complicated issue, though it might be worth a discussion down the road. <br><br>Mark, exactly -- the labels you use are broken. They were deliberately broken, to keep you from being able to use them to make sense of your world. Now step back from labeling for a while, look at the world around you without benefit of single-noun labels like "fascist," and see what the world looks like. (By the way, the phrase "banana Republican" badly needs to get into general use, as it's mostly the GOP these days that's pushing the country into banana-republic status -- the Dems have their own bad ideas, but they're different.)<br><br>Varun, the US doesn't have the financial resources left to manage a nanny state -- the cost of hiring that many nannies, so to speak, would finish the job of bankrupting us.

He's basically the trad Catholic equivalent of Richard Dawkins -- and yes, I know that comparison would infuriate both of them!

I wasn't trying to deliberately misrepresent Benito's intended meaning. Nor was I defending anything. I also wasn't attaching you. Perhaps your essay didn't define “Fascism” as such; but giving the etymology and history comes pretty close. In any case you weren't using the word to snarl. I understand you will define it next week. <br><br>So the quote was: "Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power."<br><br>As you indicated in your post, “corporate” had a wide meaning. Then as now it could refer to any chartered organization regardless of the ownership structure or business model. Though I don't have a book on Italian fascism handy, I accept your assertion that Mussolini used the term “corporate” in the sense of “syndicates” owning (or attempting to own) a business enterprise as opposed to the legal entity called a “corporation” owning the same. <br><br>Was Mussolini addressing small businesses? Is that where syndicate/corporate “power” lies? No, I think he was concerned with big business. So in either case (syndicate or corporate owned), Mussolini's definition was concerned with large commercial business enterprises and the state's relationship to these. That these would be syndicate owned was a given under his scheme.<br><br>So to answer you question: “How much did the corporazione Mussolini was talking about have in common with, say, Goldman Sachs?” The correct answer is “Quite a lot.” Goldman Sachs is a legal entity that controls a large commercial business enterprise. The corporazione were legal entities some of whom controlled (or sought to control) large commercial business enterprises. A syndicate is just one type of entity involved in control or ownership of a business. I'm not sure it matters much who owns the specific business enterprises; particularly if Mussolini intended to direct the owners.<br><br>So what would be the relationship between the state and large commercial business enterprises under Mussolini's Fascism? I think its clear from the foregoing and the quote that Mussolini understood that the state is “merged” with big business under Fascism. There is no indication in his definition, or my post, as to who had/has the upper hand in the relationship then/now. Nonetheless, Benito's intention was that the state would have the upper hand. Under Mussolini’s Fascism, such worker owned big commercial businesses would be directed by the Fascist state to serve (ostensibly) national (as opposed to purely private or class) interests. <br><br>Currently, big business interests often controls government through “regulation capture” and other means. The center of power is entirely different. Who decides what is in the nation's interest is entirely different. Nonetheless, has government not merged with big business in both cases? So in that sense, governments merged with big business can be called “Fascist”.<br><br>But wait. Why am I arguing definitions against my own advice? Ah, polemics rears its ugly head. Though it does come from Mussolini, I'd admit the quote is a pretty narrow definition. It gave only one dimension of Fascism. There was and is a good deal more to it. I look forward to your next essay when you go into this. <br><br>P.S. What is Pushback Method #1 and are there more than two such methods? Perhaps you should do a post on these one day. Inquiring minds want to know. ;-)<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c1358328228434191290 title="comment permalink">2/13/14, 10:48 PM</a><br><br>

The confusion about the terms fascist and national socialist is one I've attempted to address with many, many people. As a side note, I think that the political apathy and stupidity in the US is more a product of our general distaste for the current system than anything else. Our democratic model requires binary thinking for political success, yet only a small minority will agree wholeheartedly with the entire platform, so most people avoid identifying with it. They think politics means Red vs. Blue - which in the US it does, usually - and opt out. I can't blame them.<br><br>As for the terminology, though... there comes a time when words get so bogged down, so distorted, so warped, that their meaning is forever changed. Language evolves, and is horribly exploited for political purposes. You intend to try removing the clutter around these terms, yet judging by the comment section, it hasn't really worked. These words are too loaded. You'll fail to get through to a lot of people simply because of terminology.<br><br>This whole system of speaking doesn't work anymore. Capitalism, Liberalism, Socialism, Communism, Fascism, Conservatism, Progressivism. All of these words are <b>irreparably broken.</b> Everyone brings different baggage with them for each term, so trying to describe anything with them is just an awful mess of misunderstandings. Again, look at the comments. I'm not belittling anyone, but a number of the general political ideas you put forward would be wholeheartedly supported by the same people who are trying to identify the newest fascist boogeyman. I've seen at least six mentioned here so far. What good is the word if no one will associate with it, even those who wholeheartedly believe it? These words are dead as useful terms, I say.<br><br>We need new words! They could be based on some form of logic or structure, or even simple compound words (like when they first whipped up national socialism as a term), or even just gobbledygook. But anything, ANYTHING, is better than saying fascism or nazism.<br><br>I realize that it's awfully difficult to try and whip up new words, or even just related words, to describe these concepts that once had perfectly good terms. But people identify a group as fascist for acting like national socialists from their view because they are liberals who identify as conservatives who in reality are actually statists! How can we talk like this?!<br><br>End the madness for us, please! :)<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c6669054536654339423 title="comment permalink">2/13/14, 11:18 PM</a><br><br>

As you have been speaking about forthcoming age of salvage, here is one more example how a person with some manual skills can help to build decent and humane living space with nothing but "waste" and muscle-powered tools at hand. Certainly a ray of light into the darkening future.<br><br>When it comes to current topic, I have lately come to conclusion that it is just waste of time to speak politics with persons outside your own interest group. <br><br>I have long had this feeling how industrial societies, especially the West, are like passengers inside the plane guided by the autopilot. That autopilot is malfunctioning and the course is bound to cause a crash. As clock is ticking, passengers just shout to each other, not hearing what the other dude is actually saying. As one subgroup highlights one angle to problem of predicament caused by autopilot crash, the other ones do not actually listen what they have to say but already think ways to strengthen their own original opinion about how reality really is.<br><br>That's not the way to have a conversation, or to have true decision-making process. So I personally think that the time when it made sense to talk about politics with outsiders is long gone in the Europe, and probably in the US also. In the end of the day, one group shall win and rule the others, derailing them into darkness and misery. <br><br>The faith of the class of people represented by certain political movement depends if they win or lose in this ongoing zero-sum game. World is in the state of flux, and old certainties don't hold any more. One thing is crystal clear though: during earlier period of European history the most bitter political hatred and resentment was reserved for movements representing native working class in the red corner and the bourgeois in the blue corner. Now this rivalry is between middle-to-upper-class "progressive" liberals (American style) and native working classes. If one of them wins, the other is bound to lose. <br><br>As this new situation is quite unpleasant for members of European hipster Marxist academia, slur words like "fascism" are bound to be hurled around. But who cares about them, outside their own circles?<br><br>Everyone stands with his/her own. I think Western decay has reached the level where there is no more meaningful exchange of opinions between different classes/interest groups inhabiting the same rotting carcass, or genuine will to understand distress of other subgroups pressured by unintended side effects of the globalist ideology. So while your article has great historical appeal, I see no point to contribute into conversation about it more than this.

National socialism was a recognized position in the political and economic controversies of early 20th century Europe.<br><br>National socialist parties argued that business firms should be made subject to government regulation and coordination in order to keep them from acting against the interests of society as a whole, and that the working classes ought to receive a range of government benefits paid for by taxes on corporate income and the well-to-do. Those points were central to the program of the National Socialist German Workers Party from the time it got that name.”<br><br>In practice, the difference between National Socialist and Social Democratic policies regarding the working classes are not clear – only the theoretical emphasis is different.<br><br>And the Archdruid said to me:<br><br>“Torch, I think you're wrong on two counts. First, the German national socialist program was by no means as eclectic as all that – as I mentioned in my post, national socialism was a recognized position on the spectrum of political economy, and the Hitler regime's gleichschaltung of German industry after 1933 was straight out of that position. Second, however adaptable democracy might be, it's still the case that none of the democracies adopted such measures before 1933, and most of them rushed to do so after 1945. I don't think that's accidental.”<br><br>National socialism may have been a recognised position, but when had it ever been in real power before the Nazis? The complexity of managing an economy means that some “positions” have to be abandoned over time. <br><br>In any case, Hitler was consciously opportunist and did not believe in rigid programs. When did he ever ban department stores? Yet that was one of his party’s 25 points. In 1932 he gave a speech in which he said something along the lines of: “People ask me, what is your program? I will not stand before the German people and give them cheap promises!” Of course he had ideas about how to run his state and country, and it’s clear that he stole some of them from Lenin and Stalin (Dolfuss, the so called “Austro-fascist”, abhorred the Third Reich as “Stalinesque”). Initially he believed that capitalism satisfied the pseudo-Darwinistic concept of “the survival of the fittest”. However, by the mid-1930s he came to admire Stalin’s economic achievements, and so in 1936 the Nazis instituted their first (and last?) Four Year Plan, in direct imitation of Stalin’s Five Year Plans.<br><br>Hitler believed that the economy should be secondary to his war aims, and when his finance minister disagreed with him, he was sacked. From Wikipedia:<br><br>“Hjalmar Schacht served in Hitler's government as President of the Reichsbank and Minister of Economics. As such, Schacht played a key role in implementing the policies attributed to Hitler. Since he opposed the policy of German re-armament spearheaded by Hitler and other prominent Nazis, Schacht was first sidelined and then forced out of the Third Reich government beginning in December 1937, therefore he had no role during World War II.”<br><br>Hitler’s minions competed with each other for influence, and the policies eventually implemented were as much as result of this as any well-considered plans by Hitler, who was definitely not a “detail” person, except when he was philosophising about propaganda and pseudo-racial theory, and carving up the map of Europe. <br><br>During the war, the Allied economies became more state-directed of necessity, and this necessity persisted post-war, as the ruined cities and towns and economies had to be rebuilt. What was once a necessity became habit, until this was challenged by Reagan, Thatcher and others in the 1980s. I don't think there was anything National Socialist about it, whether consciously or unconsciously.<br><br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c2559595340463790374 title="comment permalink">2/14/14, 4:22 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not up enough on theories of modern political history (another mis-educated American, I guess) to be able to make a substantive comment. However, two questions:<br><br>1. "If what you contemplate you imitate" is true, how does one avoid imitating authoritarianism and its fascist variant if one spends too much time analyzing, reading about, discussing and contemplating same?<br><br>2. Our situation now, in which climate instability and increasingly detrimental resource depletion and environmental destruction are beginning to contribute in very real ways to decline, seems on a fundamental level different from the global situation in which modern totalitarianism, authoritarianism and fascism arose.

If I have followed JMG to this point, this used to be the norm, e.g. before "socialism" became "national socialism." The former was a straightforward class movement: the workers versus the world, particularly the owners and managers. By converting it to "national socialism," it embraces everyone in one big, happy class, and totally ignores the very real economic distinctions.<br><br>The basic problem is that those economic distinctions are quite real, and there is no "national" class at all. So as classes lose the political cohesion, and then the language, and eventually even the very concept that they belong to an economic class ("We're all Americans here, love it or leave it"), the most advantaged classes have absolutely no pain associated with exploiting the weak. As they do so, however, the fiction of "national" socialism starts to become a bad joke in poor taste.<br><br>Of course, the economic classes will eventually rediscover themselves (as you are saying), and the result can be explosive and very destructive.<br><br>Is there any point to dialogue between classes? Maybe not. They are at war, whether it is contained within a political system that grants every class some concessions, or in passive-aggressive subversion and corruption at every level, or in open armed revolt.<br><br>One friend who has traveled extensively in the Middle East says that bribery is the only way to cut through the bureaucracy. You hand over your papers with the local equivalent of $10, or $100 folded into it (depending on the service requested), and your papers are processed immediately with a smile. No money, you're told to go wait. For days. Months, even. The reason is simple: the bureaucrats are not paid enough to live on. If they don't demand bribes -- call them tips, for service -- their families don't eat.<br><br>The only place dialogue really makes sense is within the containment of a functional political system that can grant and enforce concessions between the classes. The US government certainly no longer fits that requirement.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c4329945738806766958 title="comment permalink">2/14/14, 7:50 AM</a><br><br>

He would have also told you that if it had been entirely up to him he would have like to introduce some sort of syndacalist/socialist system with a nationalist bent. But of course had he tried something radical the King (with the army and police forces at his call), the bourgeoisie, and quite likely some of his followers would have booted him.

More generally, of course, your hypothesis is possible but, like any attempt to predict political events in advance, far from certain. <br><br>Justin, no kidding. That doesn't mean it won't be tried. <br><br>Agent, using your logic re: Goldman Sachs and Italian Fascist corporazione, I could prove without difficulty that Mussolini's party was a Girl Scout troop: both wear uniforms, use a lot of symbolism, etc. As for Pushback Method #1, I noted that in responding to a comment before yours -- and yes, there are many more than two. I'm waiting for the others to show up. <br><br>Derv, I'd suggest that it's not the words that are broken -- the problem is simply that Americans have never learned to think, and so use these as vague verbal noises conveying simple emotions. Given a willingness to learn, I suspect most Americans could figure out how to attach actual meanings to words again. <br><br>Juhana, see my comment to Derv. There's a lot of thought-free discourse these days...<br><br>Unknown, rancor and inequity are features of every political system in the real world. The 30s had plenty of both. <br><br>Ice Torch, the fact that national socialism had never been in power before 1933, but had its policies adopted by every Western nation after 1945, is exactly my point -- and it wasn't just a matter of more state involvement in the economy, it was specific policies of the sort already discussed. <br><br>Stephen, that's also quite possible, since the Boers (not, btw, Boars -- you might want to check your spellcheck program!) were heavily supported by German public opinion. <br><br>Anselmo, good -- Toynbee's categories are worth considering here. On the other hand, I think it's unwise to assume that the only possible driver for fascism is an exact repeat of the historical conditions that launched the first wave of it in the 1920s. I'll be discussing this as we proceed. <br><br>SMJ, exactly. What makes the current distortion of the concept of fascism so dangerous is that it obscures just how promising and plausible the original fascist parties looked in their time -- and thus how promising and plausible their equivalents may look in the years before us. More on this in a bit. <br><br>Phil, also not a surprise. The author Hitler loved most in his boyhood was Karl May, who wrote adventure fiction mostly set in the American West. It was a common taste in his generation, and got a lot of Germans thinking about the concept of geographical space. <br><br><br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c5890906973348660591 title="comment permalink">2/14/14, 1:28 PM</a><br><br>

But about PC, such nostalgia... I feel compelled to ramble on for a moment or two.<br><br>"Politically correct" was a test or shibboleth taken seriously only by the tiny community of hard-line doctrinaire Marxists in the US -- the UK version was "ideologically sound" iirc. It was a measure of the conformity of one's thought and utterance to the Party line. To be "ideologically unsound" was to be suspect, in danger of exile from the (ever shrinking) in-group; of course, if you were in Moscow the consequences could be far more serious and the exile literal and geographical!<br><br>The term was used *as a joke* by people on the larger Left, in various social movements, in gentle mockery (often good-humoured, sometimes a bit more edgy) of the notoriously self-important and humourless cadres of the Party. [Marxist zealots and Bible-thumping zealots have a lot of personality traits in common; the lyrics may vary but the tune is similar, if you get my drift.] Good-hearted attempts to curb the use of cruel/dismissive/contemptuous epithets in common speech sometimes got a bit over-fussy (depending on who you ask) and were joked about as "PC" -- words and actions were tagged as "PC" or "Non-PC" in the same kind of taxonomic playfulness that gave us "U" and "Non-U" in British humour. There were even light-bulb jokes.<br><br>On the defensive Right however, the self-important and zealous cadres of Angry White Men seized on the phrase with glee -- first off, it glibly linked *all* social reform movements to "humourless Communist cadres" which was a godsend for propaganda/thaumaturgy purposes, and secondly its actual vernacular usage (i.e. the admission that conscious social reform was maybe going a little OTT at times) suited their position that *any* curbing of traditional whitefella impunity, swagger, and roost-ruling was an outrageous excess. Suddenly it became suspiciously "PC" to assert that the N-word should not be used by WASPs talking about Black people, or to object to male bosses feeling up female employees in the workplace, and so on; rudeness and casual assertion of social supremacy could be thaumaturgically morphed into a noble last-stand resistance to "totalitarian communist greeny hippie faggy women's libbers" -- or in other words, to anyone who in any way critiqued the unexamined privilege of the defensive [usually] whiteboyz.<br><br>And then, as usually happens when a meme (like an empire) passes its best-by date, everyone was using it like Humpty Dumpty to mean whatever they wanted it to mean, and the word or concept became somewhat useless. The feminist-movement variant remains in fond memory however, in the funny little pastiche-song "Ms PC".<br><br>I used to snort when people started fussing over what was PC and what was not PC -- speech terms, that is -- and often reminded 'em that it might as well stand for just Plain Courteous, or perhaps basic Polite Conduct. Your Mama could (and should) have taught you how to speak respectfully and kindly to and of other people; it's not rocket science, and it doesn't take a BA (or a lot of BS) in Politics either. A lot of jargon seems to me, at this late stage in life, like a weirdly desperate attempt to paint crazy grandiose graffiti all over basic commonsense.

But I think what most people *fear* about fascism, at a root/gut level, the thing that gives the snarl word its vehemence, is its association with the police state, genocide, mass surveillance, centralized power, secretive parties in control and manipulating the public, etc.. Now, beyond that, you will never get a better understanding from the majority of people. The vast majority of people are not adept at that kind of analysis. But they see scary images from the History Channel or wotnot. Then, sophisticated operators can use those root fears by attaching the word fascism to whatever they think people should consider the most politically heinous.<br><br>This, I believe, is the price of incredible power - and increasingly to my mind, a great reason to be thankful that in reality *they* will NOT think of something else to replace fossil fuels. Thanks be to God that humanity will not uncover some greater energy source!!<br><br>Compared to the time of WW II, humanity has an even greater sum of power at its disposal and control - even though it is peaking, and declining, still we are at the peak. America's similarities to the political structure of Nazism go beyond those you recognized. I mean, the same kinds of mass incarceration, genocide, surveillance, and forced patriotism, coercion, mass manipulation, are being conducted now. The difference is, it's not revealed, as it was. History is told by the victors. The methods, like the power behind it, the industrial energies, are better now, and a consequence is that much of what is happening remains concealed.<br><br>One way to conceal it is simply to conduct genocide, or its effective equivalent, in other countries, such as Congo, East Timor, Iraq... Also, mass media is clearly much more advanced in some respects...<br><br>Even that, perhaps, could not be avoided, considering the power humanity has at its disposal - chiefly controlled by a very tiny few people. Because if we didn't do the violence, someone else certainly would have - maybe the Iraqis, Congolese, or Indonesians even. It's much like Jevon's Paradox.<br><br>I won't go on with that, but it is certainly worthwhile and for practical purposes to consider in what ways the methods of manipulation and control by those who own the industrial energies will be adapted to the decline of living standards, running into the pressures of population growth, migrations, and in consideration of some of the new, but temporary technologies available, particularly the forms of mass media. I suspect a goal will be simply to convince people, in some way, that it's just not happening even as it does. Sadly, most people, as they already have been, are likely to continue to go along with it, and continue to agree that some bright new technological future will be opening up any day now, as their grandchildren's schoolbooks turn to dust. Really, there are few alternatives to going along for most people.<br><br>A worthwhile quote from Reinhold Neibuhr, who discussed the matter of hidden evil: <br><br>"The stupidity of the average man will permit the oligarch, whether economic or political, to hide his real purposes from the scrutiny of his fellows and to withdraw his activities from effective control. Since it is impossible to count on enough moral goodwill among those who possess irresponsible power to sacrifice it for the good of the whole, it must be destroyed by coercive methods and these will always run the peril of introducing new forms of injustice in place of those abolished."<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c5500537345602344350 title="comment permalink">2/14/14, 2:24 PM</a><br><br>

I think you've commented on this before, but governments seem to be responding to the rising spirals of crises by cutting expenditures wherever possible, and that usually happens to hit the people who can't afford lobbyists. Whether it's austerity in Europe or Republicans(and often Democrats happy to let Republicans take the blame for something they wanted to do too) here in the US, it seems that one of the major bulwarks against a revival of fascism is being enthusiastically undermined by those currently in charge. I never had a clearer idea of how they're tying their own lamppost swings than I do today! <br><br>Second, regarding your conversation with SP, I also believe that Imperialism will become a thing of the past- eventually. As in, it might not even happen for another million years down your "Next Ten Billion" timeline. As I understand it, Imperialism requires an imbalance of some combination of advantages between societies such that one society can conquer others both profitably and repeatably. While that will almost certainly continue to be a recurring phenomenon for a great long while, it is possible that eventually the diminishing returns of all forms of advantages that societies might conceivably achieve over their neighbors might render an Empire impossible to build, or at least maintain at any significant size. For example, the post-1492 imperial extravagance of Europeans and their successor states is now impossible to recreate on the same scale for the simple reason that the rest of the world now has gunpowder, iron, and firearms, to say nothing of smallpox! There will be more advances discovered somewhere(after the dark age, perhaps?) that will allow allow humans to subjugate their neighbors, but I'm willing to bet that the disparity won't quite be as huge as a late-iron-age society with rudimentary firearms running into Huayna Capec. Rinse and repeat for many thousands of years, and the law of diminishing returns will render each successive advance less of an advantage over one's neighbors than the previous one, until empires just aren't what they used to be. <br><br>Please note that I'm not saying people will "learn their lesson" or achieve some moral variant of the March of Progress- if anything, the far future may resemble a high-tech version of the Maori of New Zealand, where no one tribe could really get an advantage over the others, or at most like the city states of ancient Greece, where the hegemony of Athens barely lasted a generation, followed by equally short-lived Spartan and Theban moments in the sun. And neither of those situations were run by the better angels of our nature! <br><br>In any case, however, that's not up to us to deal with but for people born very far into the future. Which is to say, apologies for getting a little off-topic!<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c6170232099912588773 title="comment permalink">2/14/14, 2:29 PM</a><br><br>

No surprise if Hitler enjoyed reading Karl May far more than Karl Marx!<br><br>As one wag once quipped, the "civilised" West will never forgive Germany for doing to European Jewry almost exactly what "civilised" Europe had already done to indigenes world-wide. The crux of the matter could be seen as the redefinition European Jewry as "White" (another content-free emoticon that really means "Us", since there really ain't no such animal as a "pure" white-person), and there's actually a whole book about that called "How the Jews Became White Folks." In the UK in the 30's it was quite common for a popular fiction writer to refer to a character as "Oriental" or "Mediterranean" or some other "foreigner" tag to indicated that character's Jewishness and hence alienness; in the US in the same era, most country clubs, upper-class neighbourhoods, golf courses did not admit Jewish residents or members (they were nieblankes); but after full exposure of the extermination campaign by those Bad Guys in Germany, this was not OK any more.<br><br>The hardening of Israel into a settler state with a cowboy attitude to Palestinians is just one more of history's painful rhymes... aiee.

And if you were, how high was your own security clearance?<br><br>My father was there, and he had a security clearance higher than mere "top secret." I think you dismiss too easily the alternate course of history that worried him at the time.<br><br>It is unlikely that he mistook the routine thinking of the people he associated with every day in his line of work. Most of the important men he knew and worked with in the defense weapons industry were of recent Northern European ancestry, or had even been born in Northern Europe: the surnames that I heard growing up were generally Dutch, German and Scandinavian ones. It would have been natural for these men to think that the best prospects for the future of the USA in the 1930s, which they viewed as a backward and unsophisticated country, lay not in trying to "go it on its own" as a world power in its own right, but in forming a permanent close alliance with Northern Europe. <br><br>If anyone had suggested to these men that United States could ever become a world power in its own right, they would have thought it a bad joke. As it happened, they were proven wrong. But it was contingent events that proved them wrong, not any necessity of history. <br><br>Many of these men were Anglophobes (and Francophobes, too), and they also favored political programs like that of the Technocratic Party -- essentially, absolute government by impartial engineers and scientists.<br><br>In consequence, they despised the older political establishment from New York and New England, headed at the time by FDR. This establishment certainly did *think* that it "called the shots at the top" (as you put it). In reality, however, this was by no means a certain conclusion. <br><br>The Presidency had not yet acquired the preponderance of power over against the Congress that it now possesses. And FDR himself was becoming weaker with every passing year, both physically and politically. His failing health was certainly not a secret in the military establishment. And the unprecedented run he made for a third term -- to say nothing of a fourth term! -- was an enormous risk. FDR had always seemed arrogant, but now he was beginning to appear foolish as well.

I don't recall anybody else using necromancy to respond to my comments, but it may be a good idea from time to time.

No, I wasn't one of those who got excluded, because I decided to do something else with my life long before that would have been an issue -- but the rigid intellectual dogmatism I encountered under the banner of PC was a significant factor in that decision. <br><br>Chris, I know -- people think they're frightened of fascism, when they're actually frightened of an authoritarian regime of any kind. The problem with the F-word, again, is that people are so fixated on the notion that they already know what a fascist state is that they run a very real risk of supporting a fascist movement they don't recognize as such. <br><br>Rik, you're not paying attention. People at the time didn't see fascism as barbaric; it looked new and exciting, a cutting edge political movement that could break through the partisan logjam and actually make desperately needed changes in society. More on this as we proceed!<br><br>Matthew, no argument on your first point -- governments in most of the Western industrial societies are hard at work recreating the conditions in which they are most likely to be overthrown by fascist movements. As for your second point, though, er, I'd point out that Rome's advantages over the other great powers of the Mediterranean world weren't technological -- they were political, cultural, and organizational, and thus of kinds that could very well arise in a deindustrial world. Thus I think you're quite mistaken in expecting empires to go away. <br><br>DeAnander, oh, granted, the definition of "white" has changed remarkably over the years. Irish weren't, for quite a while; Italians still weren't until the middle of the 20th century; to most white Americans, Hispanics still aren't, though they will be. That is to say, it's not a designation of an actual biological reality, simply a label for a certain category of privilege. <br><br>RJ, I'm not sure that I'd consider fans of Ayn Rand and Rand Paul to be politically aware -- dogmatic adherence to an embarrassingly dysfunctional belief system doesn't fit any definition of "aware" I know of. As for Mitchell, he's a good deal more interesting -- his distinction of <i>kratos</i> and <i>arche</i> is usefully nuanced.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c5024266286073464884 title="comment permalink">2/14/14, 6:11 PM</a><br><br>

To start, imagine no Marshall plan to rebuild Europe after the War, and Europe would be in a much different place. Europeans would probably still be living among the ruins of WW II. The aftermath of a new Fascism is going to be like living in a post WW II world without the petroleum fueled reconstruction that occurred after WW II. Secondly, Europe was so thoroughly destroyed by the last Fascism that it was reduced to client state status in the Cold War. I simply can't see how a homegrown Fascist movement could come to power in Europe again, unless a rising outside power, like Russia bankrolls it. Now, a Fascist Russia coming to save Europe from the "Moorish hoards" would have some appeal, but the US is too far gone to bankroll European Fascism, part 2.<br>Brings me to my next contrast between past and future Fascism, as regards the US, while German Fascism was an expansionist, explosive, imperial power (at least until the tide turned in the War), American Fascism is going to be a strictly inward, implosive, "circular firing squad" sort of affair. The US is well beyond its peak of imperial power, and Fascism is going to take place in the US as the American empire implodes. I doubt if the US will even be able to impose Fascism on Canada or Mexico, let alone any other country.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c2200381761158245747 title="comment permalink">2/14/14, 6:32 PM</a><br><br>

They had been forced to accept the complete blame &amp; economic reparations for the entire WWI, which they had, arguably, been more ready to avoid than either the French or the Austrians. Most upper and upper middle class Germans, who thought they could control or channel the Nazis, soon found they had a tiger by the tail.I advise anyone who has not done so to see "Cabaret".<br>Robert, I certainly can not say your father was wrong, but his statement to you goes against everything I heard growing up and since.<br>I was born in NY four months after the start of WWII in Jan. 1940. My father was the head of the branch office of a British firm.He was a WWI veteran, but had very right wing pro Nazi views during the 30s, as did many of his class in US, UK, France. I think much of this was a respect for order and a fear of communism and chaos. Most of these peoples views changed with the German/Soviet non aggression pact in 1938. My mother was from the American industrial upper middle class. So most of the adults in my childhood were either anglophile upper middle class, left wing, bohemian middle class( some ex Lincoln or Garibaldi battalion),or working class. All this is just to give you an opportunity to reject my opinion if you choose.I am aware that other parts of the country and other ethnicities might tell a completely different story However from the adults I knew and throughout my later life, I would say that 1/3 or more of the population of the US was politically apathetic and anti involvement, 1/3 more or less pro German, but anti involvement and 1/3 pro allied. I think the element who would have favored a pro German involvement was very small.<br>Of course much of the story hinged around Edward VII, or more accurately Wally Simpson, and his abdication. Had his faction remained in power, it might be a very different world. Churchill actually wanted to have him tried for treason and executed, not sent to be governor general of the Bahamas.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c1724764862805966680 title="comment permalink">2/14/14, 10:28 PM</a><br><br>

I really try hard to work with nature as it is always teaching me.<br><br>I'm reading a book by Robert Ruark, "The Old man and the boy". Is this an American classic? It was actually a present from my Grandfather who has now been dead almost two decades and is a signed hardback edition. I wasn't mature enough to understand the book when it was given to me, so I left it alone, but something drew me to it recently. Perhaps a feeling of unfinished business?<br><br>Anyway, this a relevant but also nice quote, which seemed somehow appropriate to those that listen to nature: "Boy, he said. I will tell you a very wise thing. If a man is really intelligent, there's practically nothing a good dog can't teach him. But a dumb man can't learn anything from a smart dog, while a dumb dog can occasionally learn something from a smart man. Remember that."<br><br>The book is full of home spun wisdom, which is far more nature centric than today's culture.<br><br>Apologies to everyone for not posting the lemon cider recipe, but it hasn’t been forgotten! Unfortunately, the recent bushfires have thrown a massive spanner in the works here. It has been a bit mental here, to say the least.<br><br>Yesterday, I performed my annual pilgrimage to the Seymour Alternative Farming Expo. It was very good as usual and I picked up a few new chooks.<br><br>What was interesting was that because of the extreme heat in this part of the world, the chooks that were available to purchase were both down in numbers and up in price. In the past 3 years, chooks have increased in price 300%. I now have to pay about AU$45 per chook and silkies were even a little bit more at AU$50 each. Mind you, at that price they were still selling and it was mostly sold out by lunchtime. <br><br>I understand that in the US this is not the way to buy chooks, but things are more along the UK lines here with agricultural shows and poultry auctions being the way to purchase chooks.<br><br>Having my own egg supply (with surplus to give away for both social and business currency), I completely ignored the recent article in the newspapers about egg production dropping off due to the extreme heat and completely didn't put two and two together until late yesterday. However, the chooks have finally come home to roost! hehe.<br><br>Anyway, because of the bushfires, I then got home from the Expo and had to dig by hand another 20m (60ft) trench to install yet another tap for the new strawberry bed. A blackberry bed maybe in the near future too... The heat has made the wild berries all small and fermented. A shame because a large amount of my years jam comes from those berries.<br><br>Today, I visited a mate for a housewarming party. What was interesting was that he had a 35 litre demijohn (9+ gallon) of alcoholic ginger beer (amongst other demijohns) - which was suspiciously like the lemon cider but with ginger. Good stuff, but it is very interesting to see the telluric currents in action. Plus other people at the barbeque were making mead etc. at their own homes. There must be something in the water! hehe!<br><br>Please accept my apologies about the lemon cider recipe, but I'll get there over the next few days, promise.<br><br>Back to the chooks though and the young buck (or girlie) has entered the fray and one of the 18 week old chooks in her first night slept on the second top perch. This is no easy feat. Tonight however, she completely threw me for a six (cricket reference) and is sleeping on the top perch with the boss chook and the enforcer chook. I must say, that I'm feeling a little bit nervous about such preciousness. Well, it is a little bit scary.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c1615694803258987176 title="comment permalink">2/15/14, 2:33 AM</a><br><br>

The interplay of forces (democratic and not: business, the military, the civil service, etc.) in such a diverse bunch of nations would surely not have allowed such a uniform and blanket response – unless the Bilderberg group and the so called “Illuminati” really do wield the power that the naïve ascribe to them. And if the West adopted national socialism out of fear that the real national socialists would snatch power – then surely there could be no possibility of the revival of which you speak? <br>As I see it, post-war, the Nazis were a symbol of the consequences of discrimination. The professed ideals of communism (as opposed to the sordid practice) therefore gained influence in the West, (particularly because the USSR became a power in the world and its propaganda gained a certain influence) along with socialism and social democracy. Intellectuals in Britain were already turning against the idea of empire in the 1930s, and post-war, the intellectual climate (as well as economic and logistical necessity, and the US disdain of British imperialism) allowed Britain to give up her empire without too much fuss. The USA and the West found subtler means of being imperialists, of course.<br>This anti-discrimination trend has led to some of the wilder shores of “PC”. And as for the influence of national socialism on our societies – where does gay marriage come in? <br>To quote the Archdruid again:<br>“It wasn't just a matter of more state involvement in the economy, it was specific policies of the sort already discussed.”<br>Perhaps it’s too big a subject for a wide-ranging post, but you need to be far more explicit and bring to the argument the same depth and intellectual rigour that you brought to your theory of catabolic collapse before you will convince me. What you see as “national socialism”, I see as anti-national socialism, and social democratic and socialist influences, which were already at work even in the time of Bismarck, who is credited with the beginnings of a welfare state in Germany. I would have no qualms about accepting the idea of national socialist techniques that were however put to a good cause.

One regular poster, for example, is clearly strongly antisocialist and antimodernist, but he is just as strongly proconservative. The antiliberals or anticonservatives tend to be prosocialists or promodernists. And this reflects what I see around me living in daily life out here in the backwoods. I'm just not seeing much of a strain of the "anti-everything" sentiment that would be required. Even the whacko "Agenda 21 New World Order" conspiracy theorists tend to be very pro-conservative. And they drive their SUVs and use their smart phones in their PV-powered off-grid hideouts, so they are not really in a position to be antimodern in a practical sense.<br><br>I'll be very curious to see how your arguments develop in the coming weeks, because I am just not sensing the roots of a "traditional" fascist movement even here in the countryside that most folks from the rest of the U.S. would expect to be the source of it.

And fascism did so by rejecting the narrative that underpinned both liberalism and socialism.<br><br>Both free market liberalism and communism have, at their basis, a Christian teleology and Christian values.<br> <br>Fascism is at its core a profoundly irrationalist, anti-modern ideology. It proposes not a rehash of Christian morality and narratives under a fancy new cover - call it the myth of progress or the perfect communist society - but a radical new alternative that completely rejects Christian morality.<br> <br>In this sense fascism is a true alternative to the myth of progress, and a powerful, compelling one at that.<br> <br>It is no coincidence that fascism in its most virulent form – German National Socialism - emerged in Germany. That country had long harboured an underground philosophical counter-current - an anti-history to the triumphal march of progress and the Enlightenment, which in Germany had taken the shape of conquest at the hands of French revolutionaries.<br><br>There is a very interesting essay by Karl Polanyi, written in the early ‘40s when it appeared that fascism would indeed triumph on both liberalism and communism, in which he argues for the essential impossibility for fascism to achieve its ideological goal – the complete destruction of Christianity and the reversal of values held true by Western philosophy for two thousand years:<br><br><br>“The Christian idea of society is that it is a relationship of persons. Everything else follows logically from this. The central proposition of Fascism is that society is not a relationship of persons. This is the real significance of its anti-individualism. The implied negation is the formative principle of Fascism as a philosophy. It is its essence. It sets to Fascist thought its definite task in history, science, morals, politics, economics, and religion. Thus Fascist philosophy is an effort to produce a vision of the world in which society is not a relationship of persons. A society, in fact, in which there are either no conscious human beings or their consciousness has no reference to the existence and functioning of society. Anything less leads back to the Christian truth about society. But that is indivisible. It is the achievement of Fascism to have discovered its whole scope.

I am sure that this was a quirk of the SF Bay area. <br><br>And my father's family was on the upper end of the lower class, not very far above real poverty; he was the first to attend so much as a junior college. For him and his relatives, the Democratic Party was the party of big business and wealth, as typified by FDR. It was, in their perception, the Republicans and the Socialists were grouped together who were two like-minded parties that worked for the common man. (Of course, these were still Lincoln-esque Republicans, not the sort we know now.)<br><br>So . . . clear regional and class differences in perceptions of the past area at play here.<br><br>But also something else: my father said, when he told me the story, that pretty much everyone wanted to forget that they had ever favored the Nazis, and that American history textbooks had been heavily whitewashed out of shame and guilt. If he was, perhaps, wrong, about the details of his story, he was certainly right about the general whitewashing that masks the real history of every nation.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c5223252614605000448 title="comment permalink">2/15/14, 8:36 AM</a><br><br>

The Sacred Cause, whether prolife, pro choice, support for Israel, support for Palestinians, GMO labeling, anti-GMO labeling, gay marriage, defense of (traditional heterosexual) marriage, must be defended and promoted at all costs and all other matters are to be decided on the basis of plain old self interest, or the interest of one's class or tribe. For example, I sometimes attend meetings of good food activists, and when I dare to suggest that the ill effects of the poisonous American diet could be partially alleviated if only the poor and working classes were allowed to grow food in the yards of their rented dwellings, well, the activist becomes instantly a champion of "property rights" and the financial interests of property owners, whose convenience must be allowed to trump all other considerations.<br><br>And so it goes. The "immigrant rights" groups won't hear of a progressive farm bill--one which might eliminate some of the more outrageous subsidies to absentee owners and which reinstates commodity support prices--because factory farming is their entry level jobs program, ill paid and dangerous though those jobs might be. Zionists won't hear of GMO labeling because Israel has bio tech firms. Pro life activists are deaf to pleas that young men need to be able to support families and therefore need wages which would let them do so. And, each and every "issues" voter considers him or herself a shining example of principled virtue amid the corruption of everyone else. The notion of win/win, you get something you need and I get something I need, and we both give a little, seems to have been banished to outer space.<br><br>Incidentally, anyone who thinks that the Tea Party believes in individual rights has never worked for or lived next door to a TP sympathizer.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c6701382888031707741 title="comment permalink">2/15/14, 9:47 AM</a><br><br>

A concern about fascism as opposed to, say, Islamic totalitarianism, or Christian Dominionism, or straight-up Marxism, or Tea-Party Libertarianism, or what-have-you, is pointless unless there is still some contingency left in the system. That is to say, suppose fascism is coming? Is it contingent, like the abdication of Prince Edward, or is it as inevitable as the decline of industrial society? Are any of the alternatives preferable?<br><br>The insight I have pulled from this latest post is that the attempt at national socialism (by a different name) in the post-depression US was important in unifying the nation under the "national" part, but also laid the groundwork for disenfranchising all economic classes as political entities. I was raised in what I believed (i.e. was taught to believe) was a "classless" society, and would have regurgitated that belief until very recently -- even though my life experience (i.e. reality) has persistently taught me otherwise.<br><br>Without identity, the classes have no political solidarity, and therefore no possible political representation in government, even if the government <i>wants</i> to represent them. The only remaining classes with a well-defined identity are the uber-rich, and the uber-poor. The rich have both the identity (common identifying marks, outlook, and objectives) and the means to seek and obtain effective political representation. The poor are too busy surviving to be political.<br><br>So the question becomes, what possible forms of government can exist when the only real political representation is held by a small, privileged, easily-identified class, supported by an illusion of "participation" by every other class, all other classes manipulated into 49% versus 51% outcomes in every test of participation, backed by militarized internal security forces and a surveillance system that is also managed and operated by very few people?<br><br>Does it matter whether we call it fascism, communism, plutocracy, kleptocracy, totalitarianism, dictatorship, or frackism, or what color bunting it drapes over the podium?<br><br>When it eventually breaks -- and this modern house of cards is nothing like the Egyptian dynasties, or the Roman Empire, or even the European monarchies, it's going to fracture when the underlying economic system cracks -- it seems to me it's going to be like getting caught in a tsunami, and all of us are going to become good little fascists, or communists, or frackists, if we want to live. We'll either participate in the collective atrocities, or become victims of them.<br><br>Afterwards, survivors will look at the blood spilled and offer up their regrets to whatever gods they worship, vow "Never again!" (how many times has that been said in the history of the human race?), and move on. <br><br>I apologize (somewhat) for the strong tone, but while one can identify the stages of grief, it's never that tidy. You'll find yourself caught up in anger (again) long after you've thought you'd come to acceptance. Right now, I'm angry (again) with what I see going on in the US.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c4936657906837988303 title="comment permalink">2/15/14, 11:13 AM</a><br><br>

The brutality of the industrial revolution was such that, from what I read in my "history of technology" books, it was the biggest break in the way of life in the normal population since the beginning of agriculture. It took decades for the British population to ameliorate the extremest of Dickensian conditions. Govt. regulation to workplace conditions and social policies contributed to all of this along with worker participation in decisions, unions and voting reform. On the continent this whole process took place 50 years later and quicker (as nowadays in China and the NICS,etc.) when technology was that much more destructive so that there was less time and experience in population, govt. and industry to get used to the new situation and so ideologies(which are extremely dangerous) took the place of organically grown systems which slowly developed in Brtiain that had avoided revolutionary type behaviour while developing a healthy middle and working class. <br><br>Generally a democratic system of deabate between interest groups in a parliamentary democracy takes decades, if not generations to learn as union formation in the USA against industrial interests shows. Acceptance of rigid working times and industrial lifestyle were low at the start of industrial revolution but the workers got used to working within the system and not trying to destroy it and the industrialists got used to worker's rights although they are constantly nowadays trying to undermine them and regualtion through lobbying, job export, automation. Essentially it is an ongoing history of a war between those with access to capital, who control the technological frontier and the masses and governments, who are always well behind the curve. Letting the genie ofut of the bootle, like with mobile communications and internet has had consequences politically that no technologist foresaw, destabilizing the whole global system in the last 20 years. Micro-ideologies (Peak oil, animal rights, climate activists) and mass movements like islam have networked to trade information and ameliorate bad elements of the industrial system, furthering democracy(i.e. informing a broad public discussion and public awareness of systemic abuses, leading to reform pressures).<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c9203865744730028348 title="comment permalink">2/15/14, 11:37 AM</a><br><br>

Always glad to know a certain sinking feeling is justified ;) <br><br>As for the second point... I'm not as wedded to this idea as I might have come across, which is why I put this hypothetical situation so far in the future. Also, in my rough draft of that comment I had a bit about "social technologies" such as the political organization of the Romans that I probably should have left in. But anyway, you're right- empires certainly can and will exist in the deindustrial future. What I'm really trying to express here is a gut feeling that nothing lasts forever; and just as the vast majority of humans no longer live in hunter-gatherer tribes, there will quite possibly come a time when most of us are no longer living in empires, and that was my attempt to mentally model that scenario. <br><br>I will say this, though- The thing that got me thinking about this was something that you pointed out: that not all dark ages are created equal. After the collapse of Mycenae, the Greeks lost their system of writing. After the fall of Rome, the alphabet was still in use. After us, perhaps we'll even have radio. You are correct in that the situation that I just modeled would require carrying over social technologies as well, and I have no idea what that would look like. But the idea you presented about dark ages that can preserve a little knowledge from the past does suggest a certain (dare I say k-selected?) resilience that would make imperial conquests more difficult, though not impossible- and if things continue along those lines for a very, very long time we could end up with a human ecology that renders empire-building an obsolete social strategy.<br><br>I'm not saying that empires won't exist at all, any more than hunter-gatherers no longer exist, or grass no longer exists because we have forests. But it would be a very different world than what we have today.<br><br>Again, though, this is just a castle in the sky.

I think it's a lost cause and tragic. From my understanding, Middle Eastern peoples fill the same role in Europe as Latinos in the US. I'm looking at it from two perspectives, wealth and demographics. The US and Europe both have wealth, that creates desire in those lack it, and creates an unavoidable demographic pressure by those that lack wealth, people from the Middle East and parts of Latin America. Couple that with a demographic imbalance: anemic birth rates in Europe and, to a lesser extent the US, and the stage is set. You can either welcome them with open arms or fight them tooth and nail, but come they will and there's not much you can do about it over the long haul. I think JMG has said as much.<br>The whole racial/ethnic thing is arbitrary, Middle Eastern people I've spoken with point to the shared history of the Middle East and Europe as part of the same classical empire (Rome) to say that any division between Europe &amp; the Middle East/Northern Africa is arbitrary. Indeed, Arabs qualify as "white" in the US. By the same token, Latinos point to shared ancestors claiming their exclusion from "whiteness" is arbitrary.<br>I do agree that any ethnic nationalist movement that claims to save Europe from the "Moorish hoards" will come from the East-Russia is the only imperial power that could bankroll such an effort. The rest of Europe is dependent on outside imperial powers for their own power.<br>I think if I were an evil dictator I'd establish a policy of forced "miscegenation" to promote social cohesion (I'm not an aspiring dictator, but I'm thinking of the effectiveness of the foundational myth of "La Raza" in promoting social cohesion in Mexico)<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c6698943068308169450 title="comment permalink">2/15/14, 2:43 PM</a><br><br>

John Gray (the political philosopher, not the Mars &amp; Venus relationship guru!) is very informative on this, see e.g. 'Black Mass'.<br><br>The irrational, anti-Enlightenment side of Nazism is well-known and does, as you say, have deep roots in some aspects of German history and culture.<br><br>The Enlightenment side can be seen in the Nazis' enthusiasm for 'racial science' and eugenics, which were scientifically much more respectable in those days, and were used to justify the sterilisation of 'unfit' people in 'enlightened' countries like Sweden and the USA.<br><br>The Nazis also believed in 'progress' in the sense that the Third Reich was to be the culmination of German Empires 1 and 2, a utopian, thousand-year Reich born out of ferocious but purifying violence.<br><br>The influence of Christian apocalyptic - the thousand-year rule of the saints, the messianic political leader - is pretty clear here, as it is in the choice of the Jews as the demonic other, though Pagan apocalyptic of the Twilight-of-the-Gods type seems to have been part of the mix, too.<br><br>Some observers at the time drew parallels between Hitler and Jan of Leyden, the violent anabaptist leader who tried to establish the New Jerusalem by force at Muenster in 1534 - both were marginal, oddball but charismatic figures who were able to win the support of normally conservative people because it was a time of crisis in which the existing authorities were discredited, in Hitler's time by the catastrophe of defeat in World War One followed by a humiliating treaty, occupation by the victors' armies, hyperinflation and then a global economic crash. <br><br>Interesting to see what JMG will make of this, given his past writings on apocalyptic delusions, specifically the mistaken beliefs that history must either be a tale of unending progress or of apocalyptic collapse, with no other options, and how these tales are 'secondhand theologies', half-understood versions of Christian apocalyptic, post- and pre-millenialist.

Alternatively, one can say a Leaf emits as much as a 37 mpg gasoline car when recharged in St. Louis. (chart on page 12).<br><br>45% of Americans live in areas where the grid is clean enough that an EV is better than a 50 mpg gasoline car, and 38% live in their "better" category, where an EV is equivalent to a 41-50 mpg gasoline vehicle (e.g. a hybrid).<br><br>Then you say solar panels make 70% of her electricity so "...that makes the car a little greener…"<br><br>The appendix to "State of Charge"<br>http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_vehicles/electric-car-global-warming-emissions-appendix.pdf<br>says SRMW (SERC Midwest) is 80% coal (the UCS report was done in 2012, using 2009 EPA data, Ameren's 2013 report says 73% coal now - so the grid is already getting cleaner).<br>Using the chart on page 5 of the main report, solar is 500 MPGghg, coal is 30 MPGghg, etc.<br>If 30% of her electricity is(was) 37 MPGghg from Ameren, and 70% is 500 MPGghg from her PV panels, then (.3 * 37) + (.7 * 500) = 361 MPGghg. So her Leaf "emitted" as much greenhouse gases as a 361 mpg gasoline car (assuming charging at home - not in this case, but even if only half the time, that's still 180 mpg!). I'd call that a <i>lot</i> cleaner, since gasoline cars kinda top out at about 50 mpg, assuming they can get gasoline, 'cause there's this thing called "peak oil"… .<br><br>There are several nice bike racks for Leafs, and the rear seats fold down, leaving enough room to just toss most conventional bikes in without even removing a wheel.

Activists of a particular ideological group are advocating the change. "Newspeak" exists by government mandate. The use of "collateral damage" to describe civilian casualties from military activities seems more like an example of government defined language.<br><br>I understand the frustration of having language and opinions being limited in a setting that is supposed to support inquiry and open-minded thought. But some language is rude and demeaning even if it is in popular use. The terms "moron", "idiot" and "mental retardation" used to be medical diagnosis, but through popular use became derogitory terms. So now the term "cognitive disability" is being substituted to try and move away from the corrupted terms. Personally I'm glad there is some attempt to change how people treat others by changing the terms that are used.<br>Times have also changed. My sister has been in a living together relationship with a man for over 20 years. They are not getting married so he is not her husband or fiancee.

As for the circular firing squad model of American neofascism, though, that's entirely possible. <br><br>Chris Bonhomme, okay, now look at the distinctly Orwellian way you've used the label "Newspeak" to impose your own take on what, from another perspective, is an ordinary shift in social habits -- I doubt you address people as Milord and Milady these daysfor example. Aren't you simply saying that "Ms." is doubleplusungood?<br><br>c2, the estimate I used was out of two academic histories of fascism. The deportation of resistance fighters to camps was a feature of the German occupation, and it's by no means simply "received opinion" that Mussolini's government wasn't greatly interested in anti-Semitism -- here again, that's a point that has repeatedly been discussed in the historical literature. More broadly, it's very easy to trot out the standard tropes in dealing with fascism, but -- as I've tried to point out -- those tropes may well make it impossible to recognize a revived fascism in our own time. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Cherokee, I'm not familiar with the novel -- will have to check it out. The old man's advice about dogs strikes me as spot on. <br><br>Ice Torch, if I ever have the time ind inclination to research and write a book on the impact of national socialism on the western world in the second half of the 20th century, I'll keep you in mind. Until then, well, if you disagree with me, you disagree with me; I don't mean to be rude, but that's not exactly an overwhelming issue to me, you know. <br><br>Bill, we're not quite there yet. I'm sure that if you'd been hanging out in Bavaria or Swabia in, oh, 1910 -- I figure those are more or less the German equivalents of Tennessee -- you'd have seen about the same thing you're seeing now. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Kathy, that might work. I'd point out, though, that the most important difference between fascism as it actually existed, and fascism as it's portrayed in the 21st century American imagination, is that fascism as it actually existed was an insurgent movement seeking radical change, not the existing elites seeking to preserve the status quo. <br><br>Hypnos, thank you for a thoughtful response! I hope that a good many of my readers go click on the URL you've given, and note the Fronte Sociale Nazionale -- that would be National Social Front in English, which some may find reminiscent of a certain other name. I don't propose at this point to get into the deeper dimensions of fascist thought, as discussed by Polanyi and of course many others; that's not useful in terms of the goals I'm trying to pursue just now. Still, we'll see about the future. <br><br>Joseph, once again, it matters because <i>the way people think about fascism right now makes it really quite likely that they will end up supporting fascism when it next appears on the American scene</i>. If they understand what it is, they might be a little less likely to fall into step behind the banners. Not all authoritarian societies are created equal; some are much more murderous than others -- and a case can be made, I think, that helping to immunize at least a few people against one of the most murderous kinds is worth doing. <br><br>Ed, nicely put. A very strong case can be made that radical authoritarian regimes such as fascism and communism are what happens when the transition from agrarian to industrial economies happens too fast -- and that raises the question of what will happen in the case of a fast transition from industrial to agrarian economies.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c726445267314331740 title="comment permalink">2/15/14, 6:15 PM</a><br><br>

I'm still not at all sure it's justified -- for example, as far as I can tell, it's only because of abundant fossil fuels that the less hospitable corners of the planet aren't still inhabited mostly by hunter-gatherers, or by the highly stable and flexible fusion of hunting and gathering with small-patch horticulture and animal raising that's still common in the world's tribal societies -- once we're out of energy resources needed to extend the power of industrial societies to the world's far corners, my guess is that a lot of areas will revert to one or the other system. Still, it's at least plausible to suggest that the far future may include many other kinds of human social organization, including some that may make empires obsolete. <br><br>Shane, good!

Democracy actually requires a certain amount social capital to be built up in the society in order for it to function properly. People often comment on the necessity for a well educated citizenry in order for them to be able to make well informed decisions, but I wonder if a deeper necessity is for a citizenry who 1) actually desires the common good of the nation, 2) doesn't suspect other segment's of the society are out to use their vote in order to destroy them, 3) can accept the fact that to not everyone has the same exact interests nor believes exactly the same things about how things are run and as such compromises will have to be made. I came to this conclusion while noting that during the USA's 2012 election campaign it seemed like there were two distinct tribes one located on the coasts, the other in more the interior, both deathly afraid that the other tribe would manage to get power this time and then use that power as a weapon against them. This didn't seem like a recipe for a healthy democracy, and from your article I get the impression that could of had an effect on the rise of fascism, In that the political sphere was primarily made up of competing interest groups fighting to use politics as a means of enriching their constituents at the expense of others. Because of this each group desired to prevent each other group from being able to do anything. If I'm off base here please inform me.<br><br>On a related note I recently watched a talk given by Jorgen Randers, which can be found here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILrPmT6NP4I. <br><br>The talk was given at the club of Rome and the Smithsonian institution's consortium for understanding and sustaining a biodiverse planet. The relevance to this current discussion is that he openly stated is distaste for democracy and the necessity for lessening it order for climate change to be dealt with. In this context is reasonable to expect that a fascist movement may come out of the environmental movement. In addition to the Jorgen talk of been noticing a lot talk coming out of the environmental movement which basically implies that the only reason why we're not powered by clean green wind, and solar energy is because the evil fossil fuel companies won't let it happen, and use their political and propaganda power to prevent it. The inability to understand the technical limitations of renewable energy combined with a desire to blame their lack of adoption solely on fossil fuel propaganda and societal ignorance seems somewhat dangerous. That said I doubt there main constituents would have the stomach to become brown shirts.<br><br>Just to be clear I don't think the fossil fuel companies are good.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c8770499983853793205 title="comment permalink">2/15/14, 9:48 PM</a><br><br>

When complex society faces predicament it cannot circumnavigate or ignore, it's obvious that there are variety of "exit plans" coming to the political stage.

I don't know why they do such a tragic mistake: maybe they are just afraid, because their positions of power are facing same situation as that guy Damocles with his famous sword during antiquity. But this atmosphere of non-conversation is driving people from the middle to the extremes, that's for sure.<br><br>@Shane Wilson: I have been visiting numerous West European countries also, and for anyone with intellectual honesty it's clear they are facing Völkerwanderung unseen since Germanic tribes swarmed over frozen Rhine during winter of 406-407. What makes me despise liberal political correctness most is the Orwellian fact that you are not allowed to speak about that situation at all. It's not the end of the world. It was not the end of the world during 5th century AD either. I know many decent, hard-working Middle Easterns and their wonderfully conservative religion has certain appeal to it, even though it's not my people's tradition. But the fact that you cannot SPEAK about changes in the actual physical environment you live is just despicable. This Orwellian atmosphere of untruths is not the fault of immigrants though; it's the fault of liberal Western elite. Situation in the East Europe is quite different, and I have to say it sounds like you are not truly familiar with it. Political discourse is much more straight there, if you don't ask about it from local Western-minded liberals representing maybe 3-5 % of voters... But Western media always asks from them, of course. I don't like all blunt and partially extremist opinions which are said aloud there, but that is how open discussion looks like. One zealot group cannot define moral boundaries to policy discussions, based on their self-proclaimed "superior awareness and openess", like they do in the West Europe. Free discussion should be FREE discussion, without Stasi-like thought police (Swedish Expo and Researchgruppen, anyone?)intervening.

Hilarious comment, I have to say :). <br><br>You were speaking about "ethnic nationalism" there, and just for the record, I am not advocating any kind of supremacist policy for any group. It is somewhat troubling to see how current political discourse in the West is warped to the point where it's extremist just to say:<br><br>"Current globalism with it's multi-faced aspects does not serve my group or myself.

As natural resource depletion is already there, that predicament is not going to change. Because current ideology of never-ending economic growth awaits ever-increasing profits for shareholders, only way to gain them anymore is to impoverish those actually producing things (welders, carpenters, engineers, warehouse workers) every year little bit more. Mathematically it leads to the race to bottom; it is FAR WORSE system for manual workers than old-school feudalism, where fief holder expected roughly same amount of products every year. Nowadays stakeholders expect RISING amount of wealth to be extracted from the workers year after year. It should be obvious that sooner than later this leads to real income nosediving below subsistence level. Multicultural "free borders" insanity is just one way to break labour's cultural cohesion and force salaries down.<br><br>I have witnessed this trend first hand: my better half works as storage worker, and their company outsourced workers (but not foremen)into payroll of "temporary employment firm" some time ago. It was effectively benefits and salary cut, and big one. <br><br>This international network of exchange and free movement has nothing to offer but impoverishment for any below upper-middle class anymore. So it is example of brilliant propaganda skills from neoliberal interest groups that they can mask all opposition to current state of affairs "far right". <br><br>How wishing national sovereignty and freedom to make decisions without distant and deeply corrupt technocrats meddling makes you "far right"? And if that is truly definition of "far right", maybe it is not such a bad thing after all? This system is so corrupt, so dysfunctional, and worst of all, so HYPOCRITICAL that it's alienating growing numbers of people from it every day.

I heard about some of it at 2nd hand, but I was safely elsewhere :-)<br><br>I think one error made by the more well-meaning among the "PC" cadres (as opposed to those who were purely opportunists jockeying for institutional rank) was to believe that, because changes in language mirror changes in attitudes, changing language could magically change attitudes; that if we could just convince people that it wasn't OK to call Black people N*****s, or to call women B*****s (or worse), then the attitude of contempt for females or PoC would just naturally wither away. Amazingly naive optimism, for well-educated and well-read people.<br><br>Certainly there's a grain of truth there -- verbal tics are used routinely to reinforce contempt for some targeted Other (as in classic Nazi propaganda or military boot camps), 'cos rote repetition of hate speech does help to desensitise and reinforce, or even implant, bigotries. So the banning of hate speech probably does help somewhat to interrupt the thaumaturgy of hate. But influencing how people *talk* doesn't automatically influence how they *feel* or *act*. In my day, plenty of male professors who had learned to use all the right PC language still tried to coerce sexual favours from their female students, who ironically were more trusting because the professor-dudes were using all the code words that should have meant "I respect women". And as we all know from watching politics, anyone can stand up and waffle about "freedom" while systematically undermining the whole idea of Constitutionality or the rule of law; anyone can wave the flag while subverting the national interests of the polity they represent; and so on. The Devil can quote Scripture, etc.<br><br>I think the binary between "words shape thought" and "words reflect thought" is another one we need to dispense with; the relationship is continuous, multi-path, fractal if you will. Calling bigots on their hateful speech is worth doing; but policing everyone's speech doesn't eliminate bigotry or injustice from our world... too bad, wish it were that easy!<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c3018614161856188307 title="comment permalink">2/16/14, 11:43 AM</a><br><br>

Only after he falls off the cliff, or alternatively keeps on walking safely forward, does the actual fact of a cliff (or not) have any bearing whatever on his actions. I did have the impression that you thought that (apart from obvious hindrances like sudden blindness or drunkenness or insanity) one would *always* correctly perceive the presence of that cliff or not, and act accordingly. That is what I find doubtful in the extreme, at least in matters of war, national defense and governmental policy.

He pointed out that when he started, speech writing was a craft that required skill, thought, effort. Speeches had to be built for the politicians. Then he outlined the evolution of the industry as he saw it to the present day and a problem that was likewise prevalent in the general community. According to him, speeches are no longer thought out, but are simply slogans and sound bites cobbled together. Little thought or skill needed. He blames power point presentations, citing how many million happen each day, in bullet point form, little if any story narrative needed. He said that presented in such a way, people don't need to think, just accept. An example given (I can't tell if he was serious or not) was the exploded space shuttle. He thinks that in the short time that the engineers on the ground had to come up with a solution, they were given a power point of their options and were incapable of thinking beyond what was listed.<br><br>Interesting listening to this guy talk.

Sad to see him take this position. Incidentally, Randers doesn't see energy depletion as such a big problem, thinking we will turn to lower-quality fossil fuels as well as renewable energy. Gail Tverberg recently posted a good critique of Randers' position in this regard. <br><br>Kyoto - So someone is trying to suggest that Harper et al is fascist?

One of the disadvantages of a technological society with long supply chains is that it is vulnerable to a disrupting infrastructure attack. IMHO, the intelligence agencies in the US are very (and rightly) fearful of such an attack - or even the threat of such an attack - being used by some foreign power as a means to neutralize conventional US military power. <br><br>The flip side of this, though, is that this surveillance, especially the lawless aspect of it, feeds the corrosive political mistrust present in the US. <br><br>Finally, I read some histories of the Third Reich some time ago in order to try to understand just this subject - how to recognize a fascist movement, and just how close the US is to having one now. One thing that struck me more than the ideology was the means - totalitarian to the point of having party members placed in any social club or organization; party paramilitaries used to intimidate opponents; gaining control of the police, and then using them lawlessly to destroy opposition parties.

The fact that there is a fear of Fascism suggests people probably already have some idea of what it is they fear even if they may mislabel it. What I think people correctly fear is the violent suppression of human rights and other values by authoritarian regimes whatever their label. <br><br>That political chaos follows economic chaos is reasonably likely. That authoritarian regimes arise out of political chaos is also reasonably likely. That such regimes will violently suppression human rights is also likely. These are well established patterns in history. None of this is certain, just likely. These are just seeds. For it to be certain that an authoritarian regime will obtain power, the soil needs to be made fertile. <br><br>I'm guessing the single most important factor that would make the ground fertile for authoritarian regimes is a sustained and successful attack on the values that underlie the very notion of human rights; not just human rights, but the full matrix of values that are the basis of the culture of Western industrial societies. Some of these values certainly deserve to be retired, but many do not. Given most people live unexamined lives, many people may be inclined to throw the baby out with the bathwater when a significant portion of their value system proves to be false. Such people would be very vulnerable to any system of belief that appears coherent and whole, even if only on an emotional level. <br><br>And this is where the leather boots, dark shirts, pagan symbols, mythology, torchlit mass rallies etc. come in.

Oil, coal, natural gas have technical limitations, but we don't hear much of those. Fusion - now we're talking technical limitations!<br><br>My take is <i>both</i> the people claiming "technical limitations" and the people claiming "evil oil companies" are dancing around the real issue.<br>Namely, that the "modern world/American Dream/..." of late was built upon historical EROEIs for coal and oil of &gt; 100:1. But now oil is down in the 20-30:1 range (around wind power, though more convenient/dispatchable), and unconventional oil is down around 10:1 or less (around PV). Baring some miraculous advance in physics - humanity will NEVER see EROEIs anywhere near 100 again.<br>(OK, maybe the odd run-of-the-mountain-stream hydro for maybe a megawatt - but NEVERMORE in the 80 million bbls/day of oil energy equivalence).<br><br>Declining EROEIs means energy is/will cost more, this means the economy will contract (further), and will continue to contract until we reach an equilibrium with whatever energy (and material/ecological) resources we will be able to maintain. We are in a game of economic/ecological musical chairs, where loosing really hurts.<br><br>"technical limitations" is all well and good - yes, it would be nice if PV was cheaper, etc. But "technical limitations" seems really (mostly) just a cover for "not my fault", or "<i>they</i> ought to change (invent stuff cheaper than oil/coal and let me in on the ground floor or validate my pet economic theory)", along with "I was promised infinite growth, better living through chemistry, more money would bring more happiness, economics is the only valid measuring criteria, ... - so I'm entitled (I don't have to change)".<br><br>The same as "evil companies ought to change" and/or "those people ought to change (wake up, renounce their wealth/businesses)" is just a cover for the same "not my fault" and "<i>they</i> ought to change", along with a slight difference of "I was promised if I was politically correct, was a member of the right clique, … then I'd be happy and so would everybody else if they did it my way - so I'm entitled (I don't have to change)".<br><br>It is scary - people will be losing and hurting and wanting answers to why their lives are being destroyed, why their values are seemingly under attack, how long will this grinding collapse continue, where will it end? But it's not just the environmental movement that's vulnerable to group-think violent movements.<br><br>If hurting people got together in groups,<br>they might be easily motivated to rather violent (and likely ineffective) actions by charismatic leaders telling them "it's not our fault, we were stabbed in the back".<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_legend<br><br>But it <i>is</i> just us, being animals, growing until we overshoot our ecological limits.<br>Hopefully our fate is not as severe as the reindeer formerly on St. Matthew Island.<br><br>oooh - double thanks, in searching for the name of the island, I found this very tasty reference in the wiki article on the island:<br>http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_ecolate_view_human_predicament.html<br><br>In it Hardin talks of scarcity, and wonders why it's almost always seen as a problem of shortages, when it can also be seen as a problem of too much demand, but that's rarely mentioned.

It's not "liberal Western elites" that promote and pursue this agenda, it is corporate and government financial interests. The EU is to their benefit. "Multiculturalism" is a push to keep the voters supporting the EU. Whether or not it helps villages in Estonia is not the issue. It's whether or not it helps financial centers in Frankfurt and London. If it stops helping the top-level financial economy, I expect you'll see countries start to give the EU their middle finger (or each regionally specific version of this same gesture) soon enough. <br><br>We went to the UK in the summer of 2000. One of our stops was at the Millennium Dome, which was apparently also the 2000 World's Fair. We were astounded and aghast. It was almost nothing but displays plastered with corporate sponsor logos talking about how that particular multinational corporation was fighting to make the next millennium a better place (so buy our products). Remember, we're from the U.S., we thought WE were bad with the corporate sponsorships and corporate infusion of everything. Their grand "Millennium Show" was an exceedingly thinly veiled pitch for the EU, which was the political hot topic that summer in the UK. That made it clear to me that the EU was about money and corporate interests and little if anything else, and that multiculturalism was just the advertising campaign that was being used to get the voters in line behind it. Many who promote it is as helping to prevent another pan-European war probably sincerely believe that; but the means they have chosen to accomplish this is through multinational corporations. <br><br>I've never quite understood, though, why you lump shifting gender roles in with EU-style multiculturalism. This is a long process that has been happening across many cultures for more than a century, often from internal populist origins not external or top-down sources. You cheer women choosing to become housewives; why not cheer anyone, male or female, who chooses to focus on the homestead and the household economy rather than the corporate financial economy? Here in the U.S., it is men who are dropping out of the labor force in the largest numbers, in large part because of shifts in the economy driven by the combination of resource depletion and globalization. But traditional gender roles are preventing many of these men from becoming active in the household economy, forcing their wives to both make the money AND run the household. I want to tell these men, "Man up and grow a pair! Get off the couch and into the kitchen! If your wife is bringing home the paycheck, you need to get the kids ready for school! Laying about and being useless is about the least unmanly thing on earth! You want to provide for your family? Great, how about providing a home-cooked meal so you don't need to spend money eating out?!"<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c8686895863226139160 title="comment permalink">2/17/14, 5:29 AM</a><br><br>

That there is some impact of language on perception seems obvious enough; it is the details that are crucial.<br><br>Consider a 50-gallon steel drum used to transport gasoline. Is the drum more dangerous when it is "full" of gasoline, of after the gasoline has been pumped out of it and it is "empty"? Without careful reflection one might think that an "empty" gasoline drum is pretty harmless. The truth of the matter is that the "empty" drum still contains some gasoline vapor along with air, and the mixture of gasoline vapor and air is far more explosive than liquid gasoline in a container from which air has been excluded. The word "empty" with all its implied assumptions has led us astray.<br><br>This example turns on vocabulary, on words and their meanings. Similar examples can easily be found that turn on grammar, though one has to have a good knowledge of two or more unrelated (or distantly related) languages to follow such examples precisely. Russian, for one example, has two ways of saying "I read [that book]," with considerable differences in their implications, and the difference is more a matter of grammar than vocabulary. One way implies that you finished reading the book, and usually that you understood it. The other way implies only that you dipped in to the book. And almost any sentence you might utter in Russian, with almost any verb, requires you, the speaker, to choose one or the other of these two forms of the verb. It also requires you, the hearer, to grasp all the implications of the form the speaker has chosen to use.<br><br>Juhanna, who appears to be a native speaker of Finnnish, could no doubt provide even more dramatic examples of cognitive dissonance between Finnish and other European languages, than my Russian one.<br><br>Since most of us habitually think in words, the choice of words offered by one's language of thought affects what one can easily and habitually think about, and the specifics of that language's grammar affects how one easily and habitually frames one's thoughts. <br><br>To be sure, translation is always possible, but when the two languages are not closely related, translation does not always capture everything implied by the original text that one is translating. Though there are some neurological commonalities to the thought processes of all humans, they do not extend as far as is commonly supposed.<br><br>And all this is deeply and obviously relevant to the subject of this week's post. [It is also a phenomenon that experienced magicians who are multilingual can and do make full use of when they use words to work magic. And it goes a fair way to explaining why the use of non-native languages can enhance the power of any ritual, whether magical or simply religious or social.]<br><br>The linguist Benjamin Lee Whorf published two fascinating papers exploring these subjects back in the years around 1940. Here are links to them:<br><br>http://varenne.tc.columbia.edu/bib/texts/whrf0benj56relahabi.pdf<br><br>and<br><br>http://www.generalsemantics.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/articles/etc/9-3-whorf.pdf<br><br>The first link goes to a PDF of the paper's original publication. The second is to a PDF of a reprint, which was edited and is not quite accurate, though close enough to the original for our purposes here.

Contrast the lack of diversity of political economy today with the spectrum of different parties active in the early 20th centuries, and any modern aspiring fascist movement has a much easier time of suppressing dissent and bringing everyone in line than in the early 20th century, especially in the US. When you couple that with the strong desire by many, at least in the US, for unity and consensus, you could see where they would fall all over themselves embracing fascism if it promised unity and consensus. Comparing the political and historical intelligence and activism of early 20th century Europe with the modern West also shows how much easier a time modern fascism will have. In the current apathetic political climate, particularly in the US, people will pretty much just fall in line, no questions asked.<br>@Juhana<br>most of my exposure to upper middle class PC/"diversity/multiculturalism" was at "college" (university), and most of it bores me to tears, at this point. It sounds like the East/West divide in Europe may be similar to the Red/Blue divide in the US, in that they're willing to discuss things that the other side vilifies and refuses to acknowledge, with the exception that you all are probably way more historically/politically literate in Europe on both sides. I think it was JMG who said, "collapse now, and avoid the rush" Basically, industrial lifestyles can't be maintained over the long haul, and upper/ruling classes are going to resort to increasingly violent means to maintain their control of things as globalism comes apart. I like to think of immigrants (in my case, Latino) as examples of the future, with lessons to teach as to how to live rich, full lives with much less. In the future, we all will be making do with much less than today, much as immigrants already are currently. As for the East/West divide, I know that Russia has demographic issues with birthrates, and has also had issues with Islamic immigration, but I'm not sure how much of that transfers to other Slavic countries in the East. Honestly, I think the whole "terrorism"/Islamic fundamentalism is simply a shadow/reaction to the West that will fade away along with Western industrialism/imperialism. I also think that the East/West divide in Europe will dissipate as the US declines. When Great Britain was faced with its own imperial decline, it made a concerted effort to cozy up to the US to cushion its descent, and it was a wise move. Likewise, I think Western Europe will look at the descent of the US, and make a concerted effort to cozy up to Russia, again to cushion the descent, and I think an aspiring Russia will welcome Western Europe into its sphere with open arms.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c5769373614176876403 title="comment permalink">2/17/14, 8:47 AM</a><br><br>

That sickness has spread around the whole world. About this gender issue: you have to remember that I am writing with alien language here. In Finnish school system they teach you four languages during compulsory school: two native ones (Finnish and Swedish), and two foreign ones. One foreign language is "the long" language, starting at very early age, and the one is "the short" language, that you read only three years before your compulsory education is over. From all these languages, English is my WEAKEST and least used language. I live sandwiched between Sweden and Russia, so it's quite natural that I use those languages much, much more. So I have NO ability to understand subtleties or cultural hues of American English. SO everything I say may come out quite bluntly; please keep in mind my stellar distance from your language, culture and homeland. I have never been farther West than UK; and I probably never shall go further in that direction. In the East I have seen waves rolling to the beaches of Kamtšatka from the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>When it comes to gender roles, I find it disgusting how feminist dogmatists of the West belittle domestic work and raising children. I also find it sickening how they drive wedge between husband and wife. In holy union of man and woman they become one whole against storms of the world. Money is common, as is all the other wealth. As little child needs more his/her mother than father, it's quite natural that more often than not it is husband that goes to work. Seeing some kind "oppression" where there should be union of two fragile human beings against dangers of the world is just wrong. Among poor people at least there is no better safeguard against dangers than good spouse and good extended family. No government or ideology can substitute them. So I find it little bit confusing why this thing is so political for you Americans. Is it some "new normal" for your country to have war between husband and wife? If so, I really feel sorry for you.

It looks to have been set in the 20's as there were a few references to the Great Depression which was yet to happen as that time was written about as a future event.<br><br>Spot on observation about the book teaching conservation ethics. Good pick up.<br><br>There is a chapter on quail. It seems that the family had a reliable patch of quail that they used to hunt annually. The book briefly describes how the family fed the quail and setup the environment for those birds by planting out favourite food and shelter plants in the surrounding area.<br><br>Then it went on to describe that the family had a responsibility to ensure that the quail neither, got inbred or over populated. They also seemed to know from experience what the carrying capacity of that area was for that species in any given season.<br><br>What is interesting is that such a system represents what is known in Australia as a template (this is a European descriptive) and historically the Aboriginals dotted these over the entire continent and they were made and maintained for virtually every circumstance that you could possibly think of. They are there to make life easy and predictable, whilst providing a living example of what works (sort of like an Earth book). But it took effort to set them up and maintain them.<br><br>Today, an environmental activist would want to lock up that quail area as a wilderness refuge or some such rubbish. This action may possibly lead to decline in that ecosystem as nature will establish a new equilibrium which most likely would not favour the quail. It is pretty obvious because if nature did favour the quail, they'd be everywhere and you wouldn't have to go to the effort of setting up and maintaining a template! The activists would think that they’d won something too.<br><br>On the other hand, a hunter would want to head into the area without intimate working knowledge of that template and they'd never know how many head of quail they could cull for that particular season before causing problems of inbreeding or population crashes/explosions. They'd also never know what other hunters have been through that template and what actions they'd taken. Further, they'd try to take the same route as the environmental activists and get away with doing nothing to maintain that environment because it costs a lot of money - which has to be earned somewhere else - to buy a whole lot of hunting gear from Walmart!<br><br>Just to be completely controversial, a cattle farmer would see the green pick wasted in the quail template and want to get the cattle in there over summer. This assists feeding of the cattle because in a dry year the farmer may have over stocked. The farmer has forward supply contracts which have penalties for non-compliance. Cattle, like any introduced animals in a template can only upset the equilibrium.<br><br>Tell you what. They're all wrong and I'd have to suggest that they are completely out of touch with nature. Nature isn't an industrial process with uniform and consistent output, but a complex and variable system. As a civilisation, we have favoured our own species thereby drawing down on the reserves inherent in that system. You can see some of the problems that it produces in the examples above.<br><br>By the way, nice mental image of you walking down the street with a loaded .22 and getting smacked around the head in the 1950's. You probably deserved it, if not for that, then for something else you'd previously thought that you got away with! Hehe!<br><br>If I wore my Ghurkha knife down to the local shops the police would have me pinned on the ground within 10 minutes as a public hazard (let alone a loaded .223) and I'd probably be charged with a criminal offence too just for good measure!<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c1727868822825802002 title="comment permalink">2/17/14, 2:18 PM</a><br><br>

These are people who believe that we can simultaneously grow the economy so that everyone on the planet has a higher standard of living, and lessen our impact on the environment at the same time. In that context solar and wind quite definitely have technical problems, and it seems quite evident to me that the west will not be able to do a massive build up of either of these resources without diverting a lot of energy from the consumer economy.

Our moderator and I have brains that process sarcasm and humor differently. There have been miscues in the past. Just avoiding a recurrence. And I am not especially fond of "emoticons." <br><br>Now to the substance...<br><br>I write a column on birds (the wild kind) in a local monthly general-audience publication. It is distributed mostly in small towns and rural communities in this part of Tennessee. There are words I just don't use, because they might trigger a response among my readers that will not help convey the information I wish to convey. I wrote an entire column about birds and dinosaurs, how paleontologists have concluded that birds are not just descended from dinosaurs, they are in fact still dinosaurs and the dinosaurs never went extinct. I wrote this whole column without using the verb "evolve" and the noun "evolution" a single time. My current article (which I should be writing now instead of this...) is about landscape ecology, and how large-scale habitat mosaics affect the birds you will see in a given spot. I have no intention of using the word "ecology" at all. In mainstream circles, most people seem to think that ecology is a political movement, not a branch of biology. <br><br>So am I being PC? Or am I just trying to communicate effectively with my audience? Those two "E" words could alienate some readers, or send their understanding of my article in directions that obscure my point rather than illustrating it. Using words that will convey your intended meaning to your particular audience is one of the most basic language skills. <br><br>Hence, if you do use terms like "PC" or "baby killer" or "right-wing reactionary" or "fascist pig" or "bleeding heart liberal," you apparently have no interest in communicating with a very large fraction of your potential audience. If you do only care to speak to the smaller subset, fine. But if that is not your intention, well, frankly, you are not being wise. <br><br>I realized that I myself might have used the term "PC" non-ironically in the last 20 years. Around that long ago we had a friend who was extremely imbedded in "Identity Politics." I may have at some point, in a conversation among small group of mutual friends when she was absent, observed that talking to her could be exhausting because she was just so PC. If I did say this, I said it in a group that I knew would understand it exactly as I intended; if they had an emotional reaction at all, it was likely a sympathetic chuckle. <br><br>These thoughts led me to appreciate what JMG is doing here. If I did want to write an essay about ecology, for an audience that I thought might find it interesting, the first thing I would do would be to define what I mean by "ecology." And also what I do NOT mean by the term. And that is of course what JMG is doing with "fascism." And "facism." <br><br><br><br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c4977795534417230252 title="comment permalink">2/17/14, 4:43 PM</a><br><br>

It is a stereotype that has little to do with present-day life here. The majority of American women have been in the work force for many decades, a full generation. Belittling of women who chose to stay at home did happen -- in the 1970s and 1980s. Not so much now, at least not overtly. American feminism (which is mostly afraid to use that name for itself anymore because of the adverse reactions to it) long ago recognized that part of freedom for women included the freedom to NOT work, and to chose child-rearing as a life. The point was fo rthis to be a choise, not an obligation. Young american fathers mostly take an active role in child rearing as well. The partnership model you describe is pretty close to what American mass culture now presents as the ideal family structure. To what extent reality matches this ideal, I am not sure. But that is the prevailing attitude towards marriage and family that is openly expressed in the mainstream here -- partnership, dual parenting, all in it together, working it out as a team. So to a significant extent you are attacking a straw man that does not really exist, based on attitudes from decades ago. <br><br>It is also not "elites" who support expanded ranges of options for women. An American politician who expresses any hint that he thinks women belong in the home and should stay out of the work force will lose about 80% of the women's vote -- that's not elite, that is the mainstream. And one who belittles women who chose to stay home will also probably lose 80% of the women's vote. <br><br>If there is an image over there that America is overrun with feminists shaming women who stay at home and raise children, it is nonsense.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c9047297201701267344 title="comment permalink">2/17/14, 8:58 PM</a><br><br>

Hospitals now encourage breastfeeding but how can you breastfeed a baby when you return to work in 6 weeks, which is the norm where I work. Occasionally, 3 months. I have lost count of the number of women who have told me that they cry when they have to leave their infants and come to work.<br>And many of them are cared for by relatives and even husbands, although I don't think they cry much if it is a husband. For all our vaunted standard of living a baby who is bottle fed because its mother works does not have a high standard of living nor a fair shot at health and longevity. <br><br>I believe that people should be free to pursue their interests even if they are in a minority, but I am also observing that many more women than I had thought are not at all happy with being out of the house and away from their children as a way of life and wish they could stay home. <br><br>And, women pour out stress hormones when they are separated from their children and men do not. This means women's long term health will decrease from it. The fact is, it all makes a lot of sense from a survival point of view, that men are not wired to pour out stress hormones while they are out on a 3 day hunting trip to provide for said children. And that the breastfeeder without whom the child dies would have a fundamental need to remain near the child.<br><br><br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c1807520246817118951 title="comment permalink">2/18/14, 7:02 AM</a><br><br>

One thing left out of the post which I think is important is the air of romanticism that infuses fascism. That is where it connects to Nietzsche: throwing off the 'shackles' of all 'enslaving morality'; glorifying 'action' above all else. Yet, romanticism is inherently individualistic. On the other hand, also following N., fascists do believe devoutly in the legitimacy of hierarchy. The upshot is that fascists want their Leaders ("leader" is all the word "fuehrer" means) to embody romanticism (in N.'s sense), with the rank-and-file willingly serving as an instrument for whatever ends the Leader chooses.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c7109422051552612711 title="comment permalink">3/3/14, 5:06 AM</a><br><br>

Suffice it to say, they have very little overlap, and national socialism was primarily concerned with the nation, at the dispense of the individuals who might comprise it. Workers, while courted with propaganda, were not supported with the right to organize and vote in unions. There was no redistribution of wealth or power under National Socialism. And as the German Workers Party changed their name to "national socialist workers party," they would advertise meetings with red banners only to then confront the socialists who showed up. Actual socialists were locked up and killed by Nazi's. <br><br>This idea that socialists and Nazis share a common philosophy has been pushed by the right in the US, and I don't think we do public discourse any favors by not breaking down the gulf of differences between socialists and the Nazi party.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-one-up-from.html#c8153557727120939599 title="comment permalink">2/1/17, 7:09 AM</a><br><br>
