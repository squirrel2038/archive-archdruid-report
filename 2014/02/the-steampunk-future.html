For those of us who’ve been watching the course of industrial civilization’s decline and fall, the last few weeks have been a bit of a wild ride.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To begin with, as noted in last week’s post, the specter of peak oil has once again risen from the tomb to which the mass media keeps trying to consign it, and stalks the shadows of contemporary life, scaring the bejesus out of everyone who wants to believe that infinite economic growth on a finite planet isn’t a self-defeating absurdity. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then, of course, it started seeping out into the media that the big petroleum companies have lost a very large amount of money in recent quarters, and a significant part of those losses were due to their heavy investments in the fracking boom in the United States—you know, the fracking boom that was certain to bring us renewed prosperity and limitless cheap fuel into the foreseeable future?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That turned out to a speculative bubble, as <a href=../../2013/02/the-end-of-shale-bubble.html>readers of this blog were warned a year ago</a>. The overseas investors whose misspent funds kept the whole circus going are now bailing out, and the bubble has nowhere to go but down. How far down? That's a very good question that very few people want to answer.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The fracking bubble is not, however, the only thing that's falling. What the financial press likes to call “emerging markets”—I suspect that “submerging markets” might be a better label at the moment—have had a very bad time of late, with stock markets all over the Third World racking up impressive losses, and some nasty downside action spilled over onto Wall Street, Tokyo and the big European exchanges as well. Meanwhile, the financial world has been roiled by the apparent suicides of four important bankers. If any of them left notes behind, nobody's saying what those notes might contain; speculation, in several senses of that word, abounds. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus it's probably worth being aware of the possibility that in the weeks and months ahead, we'll see another crash like the one that hit in 2008-2009: another milestone passed on the road down from the summits of industrial civilization to the deindustrial dark ages of the future. No doubt, if we get such a crash, it'll be accompanied by a flurry of predictions that the whole global economy will come to a sudden stop. There were plenty of predictions along those lines during the 2008-2009 crash; they were wrong then, and they'll be wrong this time, too, but it'll be few months before that becomes apparent.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the meantime, while we wait to see whether the market crashes and another round of fast-crash predictions follows suit, I'd like to talk about something many of my readers may find whimsical, even irrelevant. It's neither, but that, too, may not become apparent for a while. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Toward the middle of last month, as regular readers will recall, I posted an essay here suggesting seven sustainable technologies that could be taken up, practiced, and passed down to the societies that will emerge out of the wreckage of ours. One of those was computer-free mathematics, using slide rules and the other tools people used to crunch numbers before they handed over that chunk of their mental capacity to machines. In the discussion that followed, one of my readers—a college professor in the green-technology end of things—commented with some amusement on the horrified response he’d likely get if he suggested to his students that they use a slide rule for their number-crunching activities. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Not at all, I replied; all he needed to do was stand in front of them, brandish the slide rule in front of their beady eyes, and say, “This, my friends, is a steampunk calculator.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It occurs to me that those of my readers who don’t track the contemporary avant-garde may have no idea what that next to last word means;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>like so many labels these days, it contains too much history to have a transparent meaning. Doubtless, though, all my readers have at least heard of punk rock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>During the 1980s, a mostly forgettable literary movement in science fiction got labeled “cyberpunk;” the first half of the moniker referenced the way it fetishized the behavioral tics of 1980s hacker culture, and the second was given it because it made a great show, as punk rockers did, of being brash and belligerent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The phrase caught on, and during the next decade or so, every subset of science fiction that hadn’t been around since Heinleins roamed the earth got labeled fill-in-the-blankpunk by somebody or other. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Steampunk got its moniker during those years, and that’s where the “-punk” came from. The “steam” is another matter. There was an alternative-history novel, <i>The Difference Engine</i> by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, set in a world in which Victorian computer pioneer Charles Babbage launched the cybernetic revolution a century in advance with steam-powered mechanical computers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>There was also a roleplaying game called <i>Space 1889</i>—take a second look at those numbers if you think that has anything to do with the 1970s TV show about Moonbase Alpha—that had Thomas Edison devising a means of spaceflight, and putting the Victorian earth in contact with alternate versions of Mars, Venus and the Moon straight out of Edgar Rice Burroughs-era space fantasy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those and a few other sources of inspiration like them got artists, craftspeople, writers, and the like<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>thinking about what an advanced technology might look like if the revolutions triggered by petroleum and electronics had never happened, and Victorian steam-powered technology had evolved along its own course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The result is steampunk:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>part esthetic pose, part artistic and literary movement, part subculture, part excuse for roleplaying and assorted dress-up games, and part—though I’m far from sure how widespread this latter dimension is, or how conscious—a collection of sweeping questions about some of the most basic presuppositions undergirding modern technology and the modern world.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s very nearly an article of faith in contemporary industrial society that any advanced technology—at least until it gets so advanced that it zooms off into pure fantasy—must by definition look much like ours. I’m thinking here of such otherwise impressive works of alternate history as Kim Stanley Robinson’s <i>The Years of Rice and Salt</i>. Novels of this kind portray the scientific and industrial revolution happening somewhere other than western Europe, but inevitably it’s the same scientific and industrial revolution, producing much the same technologies and many of the same social and cultural changes. This reflects the same myopia of the imagination that insists on seeing societies that don’t use industrial technologies as “stuck in the Middle Ages” or “still in the Stone Age,” or what have you:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the insistence that all human history is a straight line of progress that leads unstoppably to us. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Steampunk challenges that on at least two fronts. First, by asking what technology would look like if the petroleum and electronics revolutions had never happened, it undercuts the common triumphalist notion that of course an advanced technology <i>must</i> look like ours, function like ours, and—ahem—support the same poorly concealed economic, political, and cultural agendas hardwired into the technology we currently happen to have. Despite such thoughtful works as John Ellis’ <i>The Social History of the Machine Gun</i>, the role of such agendas in defining what counts for progress remains a taboo subject, and the idea that shifts in historical happenstance might have given rise to wholly different “advanced technologies” rarely finds its way even into the wilder ends of speculative fiction. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If I may be permitted a personal reflection here, this is something I watched during the four years when my novel <i>Star’s Reach</i> was appearing as a monthly blog post. 25th-century Meriga—yes, that’s “America” after four centuries—doesn’t fit anywhere on that imaginary line of progress running from the caves to the stars; it’s got its own cultural forms, its own bricolage of old and new technologies, and its own way of understanding history in which, with some deliberate irony, I assigned today’s industrial civilization most of the same straw-man roles that we assign to the societies of the preindustrial past. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As I wrote the monthly episodes of <i>Star’s Reach</i>, though, I fielded any number of suggestions about what I should do with the story and the setting, and a good any of those amounted to requests that I decrease the distance separating 25th-century Meriga from the modern world, or from some corner of the known past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some insisted that some bit of modern technology had to find a place in Merigan society, some urged me to find room somewhere in the 25th-century world for enclaves where a modern industrial society had survived, some objected to a plot twist that required the disproof of a core element of today’s scientific worldview—well, the list is long, and I think my readers will already have gotten the point. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
C.S. Lewis was once asked by a reporter whether he thought he’d influenced the writings of his friend J.R.R. Tolkien. If I recall correctly, he said, “Influence Tolkien? You might as well try to influence a bandersnatch.” While I wouldn’t dream of claiming to be Tolkien’s equal as a writer, I share with him—and with bandersnatches, for that matter—a certain resistance to external pressures, and so Meriga succeeded to some extent in keeping its distance from more familiar futures. The manuscript’s now at the publisher, and I hope to have a release date to announce before too long; what kind of reception the book will get when it’s published is another question and, at least to me, an interesting one. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Outside of the realms of imaginative fiction, though, it’s rare to see any mention of the possibility that the technology we ended up with might not be the inevitable outcome of a scientific revolution. The boldest step in that direction I’ve seen so far comes from a school of historians who pointed out that the scientific revolution depended, in a very real sense, on the weather in the English Channel during a few weeks in 1688.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It so happened that the winds in those weeks kept the English fleet stuck in port while William of Orange carried out the last successful invasion (so far) of England by a foreign army.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As a direct result, the reign of James II gave way to that of William III, and Britain dodged the absolute monarchy, religious intolerance, and technological stasis that Louis XIV was imposing in France just then, a model which most of the rest of Europe promptly copied. Because Britain took a different path—a path defined by limited monarchy, broad religious and intellectual tolerance, and the emergence of a new class of proto-industrial magnates whose wealth was not promptly siphoned off into the existing order, but accumulated the masses of capital needed to build the world’s first industrial economy—the scientific revolution of the late 17th and early 18th century was not simply a flash in the pan. Had James II remained on the throne, it’s argued, none of those things would have happened. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It shows just how thoroughly the mythology of progress has its claws buried in our imaginations that many people respond to that suggestion in an utterly predictable way—by insisting that the scientific and industrial revolutions would surely have taken place somewhere else, and given rise to some close equivalent of today’s technology anyway. (As previously noted, that’s the underlying assumption of the Kim Stanley Robinson novel cited above, and many other works along the same lines.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At most, those who get past this notion of industrial society’s Manifest Destiny imagine a world in which the industrial revolution never happened:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>where, say, European technology peaked around 1700 with waterwheels, windmills, square-rigged ships, and muskets, and Europe went from there to follow the same sort of historical trajectory as the Roman Empire or T’ang-dynasty China. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Further extrapolations along those lines can be left to the writers of alternative history. The point being made by the writers, craftspeople, and fans of steampunk, though, cuts in a different direction. What the partly imaginary neo-Victorian tech of steampunk suggests is that another kind of advanced technology is possible: one that depends on steam and mechanics instead of petroleum and electronics, that accomplishes some of the same things our technology does by different means, and that also does different things—things that our technologies don’t do, and in some cases quite possibly can’t do. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s here that steampunk levels its second and arguably more serious challenge against the ideology that sees modern industrial society as the zenith, so far, of the march of progress. While it drew its original inspiration from science fiction and roleplaying games, what shaped steampunk as an esthetic and cultural movement was a sense of the difference between the elegant craftsmanship of the Victorian era and the shoddy plastic junk that fills today’s supposedly more advanced culture. It’s a sense that was already clear to social critics such as Theodore Roszak many decades ago. Here’s Roszak’s cold vision of the future awaiting industrial society, from his must-read book <i>Where the Wasteland Ends</i>: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Glowing advertisements of undiminished progress will continue to rain down upon us from official quarters; there will always be well-researched predictions of light at the end of every tunnel. There will be dazzling forecasts of limitless affluence; there will even be much
<i>real</i> affluence. But nothing will ever quite work the way the salesmen promised; the abundance will be mired in organizational confusion and bureaucratic malaise, constant environmental emergency, off-schedule policy, a chaos of crossed circuits, clogged pipelines, breakdowns in communication, overburdened social services. The data banks will become a jungle of misinformation, the computers will suffer from chronic electropsychosis. The scene will be indefinably sad and shoddy despite the veneer of orthodox optimism. It will be rather like a world’s fair in its final days, when things start to sag and disintegrate behind the futuristic fa<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>ç</span>ades, when the rubble begins to accumulate in the corners, the chromium to grow tarnished, the neon lights to burn out, all the switches and buttons to stop working. Everything will take on that vile tackiness which only plastic can assume, the look of things decaying that were never supposed to grow old, or stop gleaming, never to cease being gay and sleek and perfect.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As prophecies go, you must admit, this one was square on the mark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Roszak’s nightmare vision has duly become the advanced, progressive, cutting-edge modern society in which we live today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s what the steampunk movement is rejecting in its own way, by pointing out the difference between the handcrafted gorgeousness of an older generation of technology and the “vile tackiness which only plastic can assume” that dominates contemporary products and, indeed, contemporary life. It’s an increasingly widespread recognition, and helps explain why so many people these days are into some form of reenactment. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Whether it’s the new Middle Ages of the Society for Creative Anachronism, the frontier culture of buckskinners and the rendezvous scene, the military-reenactment groups recreating the technologies and ambience of any number of of long-ago wars, the primitive-technology enthusiasts getting together to make flint arrowheads and compete at throwing spears with atlatls, or what have you:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>has any other society seen so many people turn their backs on the latest modern conveniences to take pleasure in the technologies and habits of earlier times? Behind this interest in bygone technologies, I suggest, lies a concept that’s even more unmentionable in polite company than the one I discussed above: the recognition that most of the time, these days, progress no longer means improvement. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By and large, the latest new, advanced, cutting-edge products of modern industrial society are shoddier, flimsier, and more thickly frosted with bugs, problems, and unwanted side effects than whatever they replaced. It’s becoming painfully clear that we’re no longer progressing toward some shiny Jetsons future, if we ever were, nor are we progressing over a cliff into a bigger and brighter apocalypse than anyone ever had before. Instead, we’re progressing steadily along the downward curve of Roszak’s dystopia of slow failure, into a crumbling and dilapidated world of spiraling dysfunctions hurriedly patched over, of systems that don’t really work any more but are never quite allowed to fail, in which more and more people every year find themselves shut out of a narrowing circle of paper prosperity but in which no public figure ever has the courage to mention that fact. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Set beside that bleak prospect, it’s not surprising that the gritty but honest hands-on technologies and lifeways of earlier times have a significant appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There’s also a distinct sense of security that comes from the discovery that one can actually get by, and even manage some degree of comfort, without having a gargantuan fossil-fueled technostructure on hand to meet one’s every need. What intrigues me about the steampunk movement, though, is that it’s gone beyond that kind of retro-tech to think about a different way in which technology could have developed—and in the process, it’s thrown open the door to a reevaluation of the technologies we’ve got, and thus to the political, economic, and cultural agendas which the technologies we’ve got embody, and thus inevitably further. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Well, that’s part of my interest, at any rate. Another part is based on the recognition that Victorian technology functioned quite effectively on a very small fraction of the energy that today’s industrial societies consume. Estimates vary, but even the most industrialized countries in the world in 1860 got by on something like ten per cent of the energy per capita that’s thrown around in industrial nations today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The possibility therefore exists that something like a Victorian technology, or even something like the neo-Victorian extrapolations of the steampunk scene, might be viable in a future on the far side of peak oil, when the much more diffuse, intermittent, and limited energy available from renewable sources will be what we have left to work with for the rest of our species’ time on this planet. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For the time being, I want to let that suggestion percolate through the crawlspaces of my readers’ imaginations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those who want to pick up a steampunk calculator and start learning how to crunch numbers with it—hint:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>it’s easy to learn, useful in practice, and slide rules come cheap these days—may just have a head start on the future, but that’s a theme for a later series of posts. Well before we get to that, it’s important to consider a far less pleasant kind of blast from the past, one that bids fair to play a significant role in the future immediately ahead.</div>

A great happenstance, since the two books complement one another quite nicely. I would recommend both highly and they both had a significant effect on my view of history and industrial civilization. <br><br>I had a university professor who was a huge fan of Mumford and had actually worked with him back when my professor was a graduate student. So in looking for some of Mumford’s works, I came across “Where the Wasteland Ends” as well. One thing that struck me about “The Pentagon of Power” was how prescient his comments about the World Trade Center were, and this was back when it was no more than an architect’s model and a set of blueprints. I remember reading “The Pentagon of Power” a few years before September 11, 2001, and thinking of Mumford’s observations as I watched the twin towers fall live on TV at my parent’s house.<br><br>Incidentally, I am a science fiction and fantasy buff and have been since I was a little boy, but I am into steampunk as a genre and am involved with a live-action roleplaying group. One of my best friends is an artist who does a lot of artwork with a steampunk theme and I am a huge fan of Hayao Miyazaki’s films. Miyazaki incorporates a lot of steampunk themes and aesthetics in his films, and I find steampunk aesthetics and the underlying philosophy to be far superior to the plastic crap and the mentality of the plastic, suburbanized two legged herd animals that prevails today.<br><br>There are a couple of novels that I can think of right now that did a pretty good job of trying to imagine what an advanced steampunk society might look like, complete with advanced technology bases that went in radically different directions than our own. One is “Fitzpatrick’s War” by Theodore Judson, the other is “The Peshawar Lancers” by S.M. Stirling, who is one of my favorite sci-fi authors. Look forward to reading your upcoming series about the other F word!<br><br><a href=#c4576323843559517702 title="comment permalink">2/5/14, 8:32 PM</a><br><br>

Also, I have set up my first blog post at <br><br>http://sacredfast.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-epcot-pillar-of-progress.html<br><br>My fiancees family gave us the opportunity to go to Disney's Epcot this past January. Epcot was built upon the "everything is chrome" vision of the future. future world has a ton of space rides, along with a world showcase displaying world harmony. The first post is picking out the elements of the religion of progress reflected in this Disney Themepark. Thought you might be interested! <br><br> In Chinese politics today we had a discussion of the Han clothing movement. The Han are the largest ethnic group in China with about 1 billion people worldwide. They invented this movement which is in my understanding, an abandoning of the myth of progress, to take refuge in a imagined ideal Ming dynasty past. They have meetings that are a cross between civil war reenactments and medieval fairs in tone. They have some controversial views and are gaining serious traction, and in my opinion are the beginnings of a fascist movement based upon ethnic lines. Reminded me of the Golden Dawn in Greece actually.<br><br> My guess is that in an era where the total energy/resource pie is shrinking, cooperation no longer makes as much sense to different groups. Therefore acquisition of the energy/resources of others is the only way to maintain a semblance of normalcy. Fascism is the mechanism by which those with power start to justify resource grabs. The easiest way to do that is develop a scapegoat like an ethnic group and assert dominance and a kleptocracy for that group. <br> The more and more I think about it a steampunk style Victorian revival would be a great way to add a bit of style to alternative tech. A little aesthetic appeal might push the on the fence demo graph over the edge. In my experience many people are willing to make drastic changes but the idea of setting themselves too far apart socially holds them back. A fun Victorian era steampunk social identity type movement might be just the pre-text for people to make these changes towards learning useful knowledge and skills. It's much more socially acceptable than the head for the hills and learn to grow potatoes or die type vibe "peak oilers/doomers" tend to give off.<br><br>-Crews or Robert Martini, whichever you prefer<br><br><br><a href=#c3955352870084006677 title="comment permalink">2/5/14, 9:31 PM</a><br><br>

A hand router's a very useful tool, and the skills you'll pick up making and using it are more useful still. <br><br>Ventriloquist, there is indeed. Part of the backstory is that in the early to mid-21st century, the US government established a program to manufacture very durable equipment for critical facilities; the program was called IOC, "interruption of continuity," and that's where the computers at the Star's Reach facility and a few other places came from. Until and unless that happens, most computer equipment is likely to be junk in the not too distant future. <br><br>As for electricity, though, I've discussed that at length in many posts here. The very short form is that it's quite easy to generate a little electricity for local use, and there are good uses for it -- lighting, pumps, and long-distance communication via radio are some of them. Keeping a continent-wide grid powered won't be an option, but so long as enough people preserve the knowledge and technology to generate and use it, electricity as such should be a long-term possibility.<br><br><a href=#c6482779042146897033 title="comment permalink">2/5/14, 10:08 PM</a><br><br>

The superior craftsmanship of the Victorians was for a select few, not for the huddling masses in the factories or the large number number of people that that still lived in rural villages and eked out a living as - what do you call it today? - "homesteaders". Similarly, most people in the Middle Ages were not knights in shiny armour or flashy bandits or what have you, so all these LARP fantasies will remain just that, fantasies. As for your chances of running steam engines on something else than coal - well, Central Europa was pretty much deforestated by the 14th century without the additional burden of having to support steam technology with charcoal, so I wouldn't bet on this either. As you wrote yourself some time ago, the Greeks already knew the principle of steam power, but didn't do much with it because they lacked access to the huge amount of combustible ressources that is needed. Expect some sophisticated windmills and maybe some electricity, but whatever other technology the future has in store will have to be rely on very modest amounts of energy.<br><br>Can't wait to see what you have to say about future fascism though...<br><br><a href=#c2372620750909377079 title="comment permalink">2/6/14, 12:07 AM</a><br><br>

They will probably be diesel electric rather than steam, but trains are an incredibly efficient form of transport. Over here in the UK we still have a fairly extensive network, even though we lost many lines in the 1960’s. There has been something of a revival in railways recently and passenger numbers have increased to levels last seen in the 1940’s. Thanks to a botched rail privatizations the management of the railways is still pretty awful, but for the first time in age’s government is at last investing in railways. The government has recognized the need for new capacity between London and the North and is starting work in 2016 on a new high speed line between London and Birmingham. This line will be incredibly expensive and take 10 years to build. Latest estimates are about 44 billion pounds. The expense of this line is unpopular. There was recently a proposal by some in the Labour (The Opposition party) to reopen the old Great Central Line which runs between London and Leeds. This story appeared in the Daily Telegraph. This would not be a high speed line, but would only cost 10 to 15 billion pounds. The article also indicated that the carrying capacity of this line would be much greater because the trains would be slower. Therefore you would not need so much space between trains and could run more of them and they would be able to stop at more station. A great example of how older technologies and be more efficient than the newer ones. Another financial crisis may turn this into the preferred option<br><br><br><a href=#c6381830611341336311 title="comment permalink">2/6/14, 6:13 AM</a><br><br>

They are actually opening up one old line south of Edinburgh and another line between Plymouth and Tavistock. One fact that will make this doable project even more doable is that the UK has more preserved Railways than any other country in the world. There are loads of them all over the place that are run by steam enthusiasts. Because of health and safety standards these lines are up to standard and could be used by modern diesel electrics. If I remember correctly there are over 560 miles of preserved lines and some of the preserved railways are laying new tracks. The fact that parts of the lines that were lost in the 1960 have been preserved will make it a lot easier to rebuild them and bring them into the existing network. <br><br>These preserved railways have also done a great cultural service. They have helped to instill a love of the railways into British culture. Many of us have lovely memories of going for trips on these preserved railways when we were children. A lot of this is sentimental nostalgia for the past. However it has helped to ensure that the railways have a position in the British imagination, which is similar to the place held by the car in the American imagination. Such a love of railways could be a great advantage in an age of declining oil supply. In an age of resource restraint it will not be enough for the project of rebuilding lost railways to be economically feasible. It will also be necessary to have a population that is willing to spend precious resources on such a project. The fact that there is such a cultural attachment to these lost railways could be the most important factor in bringing them back into existence<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c5821868806428529411 title="comment permalink">2/6/14, 6:15 AM</a><br><br>

Remember, most steam engines were powered by coal, and the engines themselves were sadly inefficient. They have their advantages surely, but their disadvantages cannot be overlooked.<br>I would argue that we may only have to go back ~80 years to the Chemurgic movement - who unfortunately failed at convincing society to develop and base industry upon agricultural and natural materials.<br>I would never claim that we can run our coast to coast strip-mall, suburb and theme-park with the Chemurgic strategy. But we can surely live pretty well if we are intelligent and conservation minded.<br>There are an incredible amount of internal combustion engines and generator heads strewn across our modern landscape, with numerous people tooled and skilled enough to fix and maintain them. <br>Internal combustion engines did not begin their history running on fossil fuels. And they may not continue their history running on fossil fuels either. In their early days, spark ignition engines were often run on producer gas.<br>Personally, if I were looking for a Victorian-era engine, I would re-investigate external combustion engines such as Stirling- and Ericsson- Cycle Engines which died early in their history because they are notoriously hard to scale-up, since they depend on their ability to maintain a large temperature differential at close-proximity. But in a smaller-scaled world, they might just make much more sense.<br>And although you are completely right - that a different fork in the road in our past may have lead to a completely different outcome with no direct analogs to our society's technologies, we can also choose to keep some existing useful technologies as well. The Chemurgic movement, if it had been successful, might not have led to MIG welders, but my goodness, we're in a place where we can choose both, and why wouldn't we? <br>If MIG welding wire production can't be sustained by our future economy, my bet is that it will one of the last industrial products to wave goodbye because of how useful it is. I've lived off-grid for over 15 years and I can MIG weld during stretches of sunny days without any generator backup, and I share a small 2.4 kW solar system with both my neighbor and a small farm.<br>What more could be done with engines, generator heads, and producer gas?

You can read pages of details of the mechanisms for contagion of the collapse if you search the literature. Other experts have studied a British nationwide transit strike in the early oughts (sorry, I am working from memory and don't have precise details, only the punch lines) which lasted 3 weeks before the government put an end to it. Looking back on it in retrospect, the consensus is that if it had gone on for much more than another week, the British economy would have been in total collapse (no goods on the store shelves, so no cash register receipts deposited in the bank, etc.). Once the employee furloughs turn into terminations you cannot rebuild the self assembled system of an economy by any central planning means. Once folks have missed about 20 consecutive meals things start to get really ugly. My point is that our elected officials have allowed us to live in a world where an apocalyptic type collapse is actually a concrete possibility--it doesn't have to be that way. I have also read the book Scarcity by Christopher Clugston who does a little value adding to US government figures to show that the majority of materials needed for advanced "civilization" will exhaust their large deposits within the next 40 years and just about everything but silicon and bauxite will go the way of oil--leading to your decent scenario. I prefer the gradual descent scenario, given the choices, but you have to be aware that "serious people" view the rapid collapse scenario as presently possible as a result of government policies around the "advanced" world. Rapid collapse deserves a bit more than a casual dismissal given the realities of our world today.<br><br>As a final comment, the Victorian era energy use of 10% of our use today would not even run the internet as we have it today. That uses about 17% of the power generated in the US counting the server farms, etc., that make up the whole structure.<br><br><a href=#c4678268188499145984 title="comment permalink">2/6/14, 8:13 AM</a><br><br>

When I look at the lower energy past, I see a good deal of stuff that was built sturdily to last forever - but always complemented by DIY ephemera like hand-woven baskets (the work of an offhand moment to a skilled hand) or a shopping bag quickly sewn from a flour sack. Well, it's a given that our descendants will know how to make a basket - but if we can preserve innovative mechanical engineering - well there are advantages to heaving your water from the well with a hand pump rather than a bucket.

The boilers are usually under pressure. These engines are not made of plastic, but rather, cast iron. Cast iron requires foundries, molders, and founders. Once the iron casting is made, and after it has cured, it must be machined to tolerance in order to be useful as an engine. Once the engine has been machined, and hooked up to a boiler, and the needed pressure obtained to do some useful work, it must be lubricated, or it not work very well for very long. Yeah, lubrication. The whole industrial Steampunk world relies on lubrication... and foundries... and machine shops... and the skilled workers who know how to make things that are not just props in a role playing game.

I've always felt that much of the nostalgia we moderns have for the past is a longing for a lost sense of beauty. What makes so many people cynical about the modern notion of "progress" is witnessing the destruction of things that were perfectly fine and beautiful and replacing them with something ugly, whether it was a grand old 19th century building, torn down and replaced with one that looks like a block of Styrofoam, or the clear cutting of a forest teaming with wildlife to make way for an asphalt parking lot. What I long for, what I'm working towards in my own life is not just creating a world that I can survive in but one that is actually worth living in.<br><br><a href=#c374229061501368328 title="comment permalink">2/6/14, 8:33 AM</a><br><br>

While concentrating solar might be a viable source for steam in some places, I would agree that actual steampunk technology is itself problematic. But as an example... some readers may wish to search for a couple of offshoots of steampunk which have attempted to do the same sort of reimagining technological and social development starting at different periods of history--look up Sandalpunk (hearkens back to the Greek or Roman eras--sometimes with a provably Aristotelian cosmology complete with crystal spheres) and Stonepunk (exactly what it says on the tin).<br><br><a href=#c2224841237247757444 title="comment permalink">2/6/14, 8:51 AM</a><br><br>

Maybe that'll give some clues.”<br><br>There were some really bad floods in France a while back. A lot of modern steel and concrete bridges, some less than a decade old, were washed out or suffered major structural damage requiring expensive repairs. Meanwhile, you had Roman bridges, some more than 2000 years old, all which survived with barely a scratch. There are also Roman buildings like the Pantheon show that it is possible to build concrete structures that are very durable, have great aesthetics and can last millennia. One thing that both the Romans and the Victorians showed is that it is possible to build things that are elegant and beautiful but very durable and designed to work for long periods of time. This is a much better approach than the cheap, tacky plastic junk and planned obsolescence that we take for granted today, delivering much better quality products while being far less wasteful.<br><br>Speaking of old-fashioned technology, Low Tech Magazine has some great articles on some of the amazing things that ancient, medieval, early modern and 19th century engineers were able to achieve with renewable energy sources, clever engineering and lots of manpower.

As long is one is imagining, one could certainly imagine a future in which only a very small amount of today's knowledge and technology is practiced, or for that matter is even remembered. Something different from your Meriga, but also plausible. We'll see how it unfolds itself.<br><br>On slide rules, we now have four slide rules in this two adult household. One is wooden, given to us by a friend after her father died (it was his). One, plastic, bought new before the other three came to us. One, a K&amp;E Deci-Lon a friend purchased for us at an auction. This one is my favorite, perhaps because it reminds me of my father. I borrowed his K&amp;E slide rule for use on exams in high school (no calculators allowed back then) but by the time I got to college calculators were cheap enough that the profs let us use them on exams. I would have liked to receive my dad's slide rule when he died, but apparently my parents sold or got rid of it. (I did get his drafting set, however). Finally, my husband's favorite, an aluminum Pickett, bought a few months back for $5 at a yard sale or a thrift store, I forget which. It's the same model he used in technical school years ago. He'd kept his slide rule till I came into his life and always regretted shedding it when we put our households together. We also bought the book Delights of the Slide Rule since neither of us remembered how to use a slide rule. Now to set myself to relearning how to work that Deci-Lon ... another addition to my list of goals for the year.<br><br><a href=#c370468314560844170 title="comment permalink">2/6/14, 10:33 AM</a><br><br>

Capital observations as always! (as a steampunk might say)<br><br>Regarding alternative technology, and steam age technology, I would like to suggest that the steam railway enthusiast scene (particularly here in the UK) makes an excellent case study, with typical Steampunk developments of Victorian technology beyond their supposed period of usefulness, the role playing and re-enactment, and potential use to a less sophisticated world of the future.<br><br>Steam railways are something of a watershed technology linking the rational modern world to a more superstitious past. When the West coast mainline was built through Rugby, the local Public School headmaster proclaimed that "Feudalism had gone forever" - railways impose timetabled order. Yet there is something very primally engaging about a steam loco, even simmering at the station you can sense the heat, the smell of oil and fiery breath, that sense of contained power, like a sleeping dragon.<br><br>The Steampunk-esque development of Victorian steam technology to the point where it may yet again be competitive with diesel technology can largely be attributed to a string of great engineers, Andre Chapleon whose "internally streamlined" steam locomotives were competitive with electric power of the time, never mind diesel, then Livio Dante Porta, an Argentinean engineer who improved on Chapleon's ideas further and invented further improvements to water treatment, ejectors, etc, and then Wardale who remains active to the modern age. The latest projects by engineers to make competitive steam trains are the 5AT project in UK and the Coalition for Sustainable Rail in the states. The latter organisation have got hold of a steam locomotive they hope to modify to run at 130mph. Powered by (kiln dried) wood - the fuel of the future according to your recent article. The people driving these projects include trained engineers who apply the latest practices in their art: no doubt we owe their improvements to such things as computational fluid dynamic models that their forebears could not manage on their slide rules!<br><br>Of course a preserved steam railway is one of the best examples or re-enactment to be found, all the more so when it is considered that the re-enactment happens daily during the tourist season. It is certainly the re-enactment with the best hardware. Of course the retro technology is not limited to the locos - old structures, communications and signalling systems also have to be kept running. Here in Wales we are known for our narrow gauge railways and the Ffestiniog / Welsh Highland has about 40 miles of track - well worth a visit.<br><br>I hope that the existence of these volunteer railways mean that in the future we can still organise on the scale needed to run a railway!<br><br><a href=#c1375686157198216905 title="comment permalink">2/6/14, 10:54 AM</a><br><br>

It's only Thursday and I'm really tired. Not the kind of sleepy tired but the soul-deep tiredness that comes right before someone sinks into a malaise. Let me tell you my tale, because I really need to vent.<br><br>Over the past several weeks I've been trying to convince my friends and family that something is drastically wrong in the global economy. Everyone single one of them agrees that something is wrong but not one of them will even look at the energy issues. The whole spread of stories, from the apocalyptic to the utopian, that you talked about in your book “The Long Descent” are available in my group of friends. It's bloody disturbing and I decided to try and combat it because I'm clearly not that bright. Well needless to say I've been failing but at least I'm getting people to recognize the importance of community and skill building. Hopefully these people will all be ready to take care of themselves when I high-tail it the hell out of the US. Yeah, I'm giving it another year but I'm pretty sure I don't want to be anywhere near the US once the imperial decline really gets going. I love this country but people are too nutty and, even worse, too lazy. Like I said every single one of my friends get that something horrible is headed our way but not one of them wants to put plans in place to soften the blow. I've tried telling them the story of the Ants and the Grasshopper to no avail. As of the end of 2014, barring some drastic change in my friends, I'm headed back to India.<br><br>In the interim I'm finding refuge in my project View on the Ground (http://viewontheground.com). I truly hope it'll be some help to all of you and if anyone wishes to contribute please feel free to sign up with the site. The website is basically a place to consolidate and analyse all the news stories about the cracks that are appearing in society or, more accurately, the negative and positive cyclicals that drive society. Right now there are only two of us working on the site, which is why there's extensive coverage of Wisconsin and California, but hopefully as more people join we'll get more eyes and ears everywhere. Always to have a lookout during troubled times, right?<br><br>Anyway, if you don't want to sign up just send any local, state, national, or international articles that you find to ViewontheGround at gmail.com<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Varun Bhaskar<br>Chief Administrator <br>View on the Ground<br><br><br><br><a href=#c4542933484131548658 title="comment permalink">2/6/14, 11:16 AM</a><br><br>

Most land was worked by tenant farmers, who in England, had secure leases. Agricultural laborers lived in cottages that might belong to them or might be rented. They usually had enough land for a garden, sometimes enough to fatten a pig, chickens, etc. Some villages still had common land in which working class could gather firewood, edible plants, pasture a cow, etc. Game laws prevented the laboring classes from hunting any game valued for food or sport by the upper classes. By Victorian times the majority of the medieval commons had been enclosed into private fields and the resulting hardship helped channel the population into the jobs in the new factories. Enclosure had some advantages for the population overall as it permitted educated landowners to experiment with more productive farming methods. But it reduced the ability of the farm laborers to support themselves.<br><br><a href=#c1402161299035733401 title="comment permalink">2/6/14, 11:32 AM</a><br><br>

I may just do a post on this...<br><br>Pinku-Sensei, that last is a good point. So much of modern culture consists of the pursuit of ugliness and rudeness for its own sake; an alternative is worth pursuing. <br><br>Dagnarus, good gods.

Do you recall what I said in the post about the insistence that if the future isn't just like the present, it must be just like some corner of the past? That's what I was talking about. <br><br>As for salonfähig, oh, granted -- I'm trying to explain it to a mostly American audience, remember, for whom "salon" means a place women go to get their hair styled. I figured the common American suburban distinction between living room and family room, which covers some of the same ground, would transfer at least some sense of the meaning. Translation is a dog's momma, no question; I sometimes think that scholars who lead sufficiently wicked lives are condemned to spend all eternity translating <i>À la recherche du temps perdu</i> into classical Mayan. <br><br>Compound F, okay, that does it -- I'm going to have to do a post on how amateur astronomy used to be done, back in the day. I should probably don my wizard's robe and conjure up the ghost of Sir Patrick Moore for assistance!<br><br>Flute, that's a great story -- and rather reminiscent of Arthur C. Clarke's classic SF piece "Superiority." Thanks for the data on Swedish, also -- so many languages, so little time...<br><br>Robert, it fascinates me that despite the extremely complex history of slavery, and the fact that it's been abolished many times, so many people instantly default to the notion that once industrialism goes away, poof! Slavery will come back. It's an interesting obsession, and deserves study. <br><br>Phil, the fascinating thing is that the figures on per capita energy use in Britain in the Edwardian era are based on the hard numbers of how much coal was mined and imported. It's sometimes hard to realize just how much of the energy we use, we never see! <br><br>Bill, thanks for the link to your blog post!

Biological evolution may be a good example here. The process is fundamentally unpredictable, but constrained by the environment and natural selection in such a way that many evolutionary processes repeat themselves in convergent evolution. For example, octopuses and mammals both evolved camera eyes. I agree that technological evolution is much much less inevitable than the standard progress myths imply. <br><br>Information processing is a highly valuable capability as evidenced by the metabolic cost that many vertebrates expend on brain function. I suspect that efficient information processing is a nearly unavoidable outcome of any technological evolution that gets to the point of understanding the basics of how things work...i.e. basic physics. Knowing what we know about materials, it seems almost inevitable that electromagnetic information processing is a convergent technology in the convergent evolution sense. Now that doesn't mean familiar electronics. The first electromagnetic information processors we know of were biological brains which use complex electrical and chemical pathways (chemical bonding is the quantum mechanics of electromagnetic interactions). Humans then developed mechanical and later electronic information processors. It could have been different. We could have developed quantum electrodynamics first and used arrays of trapped atoms with laser readout for quantum computations. Or many things I can't imagine. But that is still electromagnetic. In the future which we can only guess at, our version of electronic computing will be replaced by something else, but whether that will look like evolutionary refinement or whether it will be an extinction is impossible to know. <br><br>I have commented before that I think you overestimate how dependent electronics is on oil and our complex economic system. For example, our electronics are much much more energy efficient than any biological or mechanical device for doing numeric calculations. Any competent group of a dozen physicists and/or electrical engineers could build a 2 micron feature size lithography system capable of supporting microprocessors running around a Megahertz in a few years. If they have to melt sand to grind lenses and to purify silicon wafers, and if they have to build the wind turbine to power their setup, it may take a few more years. If they can't pay others for the copper, iron, and coal/biomass they need, it will take yet a few more years. But there is nothing fundamentally complicated about fabricating electronic circuits. It is fundamentally much simpler than cooking or gardening. Because electronics are a focus of modern fantasies of progress, we build them in $10 billion dollar fabs, but you don't need anything like that to ensure that slide rules remain obsolete. The human brain, even using a slide rule, is astoundingly poor at doing arithmetic. Evolution just didn't optimize very well for that function.<br><br><a href=#c5500570640994048869 title="comment permalink">2/6/14, 12:55 PM</a><br><br>

We have a steam railway here in Cumberland, MD, running a very fine old steam locomotive up through the mountains to Frostburg and back. For that matter, the local Shriners have their own private railroad, with a retired mine engine and handmade rolling stock. (You can tell that Cumberland used to be a <i>major</i> rail town.)

I'm not sure it's just control freakery, though -- my scenario, like <i>Star's Reach</i>, was meant to conflict with the narratives hardwired into people's heads, and the resulting cognitive dissonance drove a lot of the demands that I give people a future they expect rather than one they might actually get. <br><br>Mortal, that's very encouraging indeed. Maybe some of that sentiment will catch on over here one of these days. <br><br>Maria, getting into better shape is always a good idea. As for the old-fashioned way of doing things, well, here in Cumberland young men from the poorer part of town shoulder snow shovels and do the rounds -- $20 gets your walk and driveway shoveled.

That's a movement of which I was completely unaware. More research needed!<br><br>Friar P., again, are you equating a technology with a specific set of social forms, and if so, why? <br><br>Steve, I'll take your last point first. Of course Victorian levels of energy won't keep the internet running. Neither will anything else. The internet isn't going to be around indefinitely; as we finish burning through the last cheap fossil fuels and have to deal with much less energy, it's going to go away. Deal. <br><br>As for economic fast-crash scenarios, I've dealt with them repeatedly here. They make perfect sense as long as you ignore all the evidence of history and pretend that the only thing governments and people will do during an economic crisis is sit on their hands saying "Oh, whatever shall we do?" Lacking those dubious assumptions, what we face instead is a series of brutal economic crises, each of which is followed by the impoverishment of a lot of people, a partial recovery that only reaches some people, and a transition toward the next crisis. <br><br>In 2008, a whole flurry of people were making the same fast-crash claims, and they were wrong. I made the claim I've just repeated, and I was right. I'll be right again this time, too, because the situation's the same. If you want to disagree, fine -- let's talk about it again in 2016, shall we? <br><br>Andy, excellent. Notice also the knee-jerk habit of conflating Victorian technology with Victorian society -- again, a reflection of the widespread inability to imagine a future that isn't either a continuation of the present or a carbon copy of the past. <br><br>SC, why do you think I'm trying to get steampunk aficionados interested in slide rules? Actual steam engines are next. Shhh -- don't tell 'em. ;-)<br><br>Goldmund, nicely put. The raw ugliness of modern life is, to my mind, one of the most obvious symptoms that something has gone very, very wrong with the Enlightenment dream of limitless progress as a way to human betterment. <br><br>Unknown, those were new to me. As for steam, though, I'm going to whisper a phrase here, in the hope that it stirs some imaginations: "Augustin Mouchot's solar steam engines..."<br><br>Enrique, <i>Low Tech</i> is always worth reading. As for tacky junk and planned obsolescence, good -- another reason why Victorian technology might be a workable model is that so much of it was made to endure, rather than to be thrown out in a few years and replaced. <br><br>Robo, exactly. Again, not an exact replay, but an extrapolation in new directions from that starting point. ("Augustin Mouchot's solar steam engines...")<br><br>Zaphod, we'll be getting to that in the series of posts on the coming dark age.

And I used to live in Mountain View, CA - home of Moffet Field, and 3 very large hangers - for Lighter Than Air vehicles. I'm not so hopeful about airships, the Akron had 4 accidents and was lost, along with a search blimp. Before that, the Shenandoah. Back to California, the loss of the USS Macon is local history.<br><br>Anyway, JMG - re: "… lose 2/3 of the total energy converting mechanical power to electrical power and back again". I too wonder about the need for aluminum-air batteries for emergency use, though on a weight limits of LTA vehicle basis.<br><br>But are you implying that going from diesel engine to generator to motor to propeller will loose 2/3 of the <i>output</i> of the diesel?<br>n.b. aluminum-air batteries are primary cells, not rechargeable except by replacing the cathode.<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium–air_battery<br><br>Actually, such a hybrid arrangement is the only (IMO) sensible thing about Alan's proposal. The heavy diesels would be (hopefully) along the centerline for balance, and easy to access for repairs. Some light wires would carry power to the motors, which would be easily controllable and (nearly) instantly reversible without all kinds of crazy mechanical linkages.<br><br>The efficiency of medium to largish motors and generators is in the 90% range. Due to energy codes around the world, a lot of motors are now/soon required to be "Premium Efficiency", where any motor above 7.5 kW (10 hp) must be &gt; 90% efficient, and larger motors are required to be 95%.<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premium_efficiency<br><br>I might doubt that Alan's future airship's motors would be that efficient, but they wouldn't be far off.<br>Note that virtually all "diesel" locomotives are such hybrids - diesel prime mover running generator, which powers an electric air compressor and the motors in the trucks. So much easier, efficient and more reliable than mechanical transmissions.<br><br>High efficiency brushless DC motors exceed 96.5%, though those require electronics.<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor#cite_note-Nozawa_.282009.29-67<br>(Simple brushed DC motors are typically 75-80% efficient.)<br><br>That's one reason why electric vehicles are a win, most of the energy goes to the wheels, typically around 80% efficient from plug to wheels, helped along by regenerative braking and no idle losses. An Internal combustion engine is about 25%, but when accounting for idling and parasitic loads, ICE vehicles are more like 20% efficient.<br>While the grid from fossil fuels in boilers is only 35-40% efficient, combined cycle is pushing 60%, and renewables are effectively 100% (free fuel). But oil production is 95% efficient (EROEI 20:1), refining is 87-90% efficient, and transportation of oil/gasoline cuts into that too. So gasoline is only like 17% efficient "well to wheels", but an EV is 25% or much more efficient "well to wheels", even starting from 35% boilers.<br>refinery efficiency: http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/TA/635.PDF<br>EV efficiency:<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car#Energy_efficiency<br>http://www.teslamotors.com/goelectric/efficiency<br><br>Of course if one has distributed PV or wind or small hydro, one can recharge an EV on one's own.<br>(particularly if it's an electric bike or trike sort of thing).<br><br>One could grow/process biofuels locally, but what will the cost of that be, once the fossil fuel subsidy goes away?

But our culture(s) hugely downplay the mental skills and habits that one must cultivate before one can do these things: long periods of solitude and silence, and the ability to think using patterns and relationships only, without any words.<br><br>I used to take square roots in my head when I was in my teens. To do so, first I went off by myself somewhere where I wouldn't hear or see any noise, or have any compelling distractions. Then I set up several retentive "blackboards" in my mind. I used one to write out the original number (framing it in pairs of digits to the left and right of the decimal point), a second to write out the square root as I slowly worked it out, and a third as scratch paper while I calculated each digit of the square root, one after the other. When I had done this, I just started calculating wordlessly, in utter silence, moving from left to right, using symbols and patterns, but never a single word. (Every number has its own unique set of properties, as distinctive as the faces of individual human beings, which can serve to identify it without needing to use its ordinary name.) Eventually I would have the complete answer on the second board, and then I could read it off digit by digit, or copy it down on paper. It might take a half-hour or more to finish the work, if the original number was a long one. <br><br>I am sure than anyone could train him/herself to do the same, if that person could first get good at doing two things that happened to come to me naturally. It would be harder, of course, for many people to do these things than it was for me. I had two natural advantages that most of my peers did not. <br><br>First, I didn't (and don't) naturally think in words or pictures at all, but only in abstractions of pattern and interrelationship. (I have to translate these inward things into some every-day human language in order to communicate any of my thoughts to other people.) Words have always annoyed me: they are useful tools, but extremely clumsy ones, and they really get in the way of just many things that I enjoy doing. <br><br>And second, I'm solitary by nature, and I really enjoy spending quite long periods of time without any human verbal contact. People are always talking, after all, and I have a sort of allergy to the endless river of words in which so many people swim every hour of their lives.<br><br>In short, no, one doesn't need calculators or computers, or even pencil and paper.

It started with museum shows and catalogs in the 1980s, followed by many books on the architectural and decorative style and an annual conference for collectors and dealers in Asheville, North Carolina. <br><br>There were two principal magazines, Style 1900, which suspended publication a little over a year ago, and American Bungalow, which is going strong. The Arts and Crafts revival has generated successful local movements to establish historical preservation districts in town and city neighborhoods that were built up between 1900 and 1940. Many of these neighborhoods are trolley-car suburbs, walkable neighborhoods beloved by the advocates of the New Urbanism.<br><br>American Bungalow pays attention to the underlying philosophy of the A&amp;C movement, rather than treating it just as a consumer fad, and anyone who reads the magazine for a while would know who Elbert Hubbard was. Although every issue includes a piece about a high-end house full of antiques, the magazine has regular features on DIY restoration of old bungalows and on community organizing to prevent good old houses from being torn down and replaced by McMansions.<br><br>While it was trendy, demand for furniture and decorative objects in the Craftsman style led both to mass-produced knockoffs and to furniture, paintings, pottery, needlework kits etc. of excellent quality from artisans and small shops. Some continue to have customers. <br><br>The trend peaked and has been replaced by a revival of Mid Century Modernism. The latter is partly fueled by the natural fascination of the young for the Space Age and New Frontier that happened before they were born, and by the availability of relics from that period. However, the disconnect between Modernism and what our times require is too great for this fashion to last, IMO.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c3720764988009056100 title="comment permalink">2/6/14, 7:33 PM</a><br><br>

By the mid 60s, it accounted for the majority of computers in the world (about 10,000.) Push back a generation to punched card equipment - this stuff didn’t use transistors at all, and some of it didn’t use vacuum tubes except possibly in the power supply. I’d say the IBM 305 was Rube Goldberg’s finest creation, except that there were hundreds installed.<br><br>You don’t have to go quite all the way back to Bob Cratchet and Ebineezer Scrooge for manual accounting methods.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c4605271257754529490 title="comment permalink">2/6/14, 8:15 PM</a><br><br>

I lived for many years in Aberystwyth, where the Victorian promenade and bandstand collapsed into the sea during some of the recent storms (not long after repairs needed after earlier storms had been completed). Although pictures made lots of national papers, I haven't seen any evidence that it's led to further belief that climate change is real. Still, the washing away of the railway in Cornwall is much more significant than the loss of a bandstand.

I remember reading about Pol Pot’s regime in Cambodia where they basically shipped off all of the urban population to rural areas and whilst millions of people died (many shot and many starved), I don’t recall reading accounts of people consuming long pig.

At university before major exams, one could see engineering students running pencils down the ridge of the slide on aluminum rules and along the top and bottom where the cursor rides to minimize binding. (Don't use oil -- graphite works much better!) I personally prefer bamboo slide rules. They operate more smoothly, hold up better over time, and the craftsmanship is marvelous. <br><br>I'm in complete agreement with Villager's comment. Using a slide rule requires you to develop skill in estimating the answer to a calculation -- seemingly a lost art in today's world. I also agree with JMGs comment that his speed compared favorably with electronic calculators.<br><br>The one place I do think calculators are superior is the range of operations they can perform. Slide rules generally don't have scales for addition and subtraction for example, and so even the four basic functions are not necessarily supported. So maybe we'll need to add a sorobon or abacus to our list of calculating aids. Moving numbers back and forth can be a problem!<br><br>Added to that are the myriad trig, statistical, exponential, reciprocal, inverse, and many other specialized functions performed by modern electronic calculators. They are indeed wondrous devices. The downside is that they do not encourage the kind of thinking mentioned by Villager -- an intuitive feel for the result of a calculation that serves as a reality check before one acts on the answer provided by the calculator.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c6992891677148155994 title="comment permalink">2/6/14, 10:35 PM</a><br><br>

Sounds cold and unpleasant.<br><br>I was thinking about the dialogue last week with Calm Center of Tranquillity and the question of values.<br><br>I agree with you in that values can mean pretty much whatever you want them to mean and that there is often no bridge between differences of values and opinion when they are used as a motivator.<br><br>However, taking the example used by Trish, I could see that her values were framed around a human perspective and perhaps she was reflecting her own status by displaying those values? I'm not judging this, but merely pointing this out.<br><br>The weakness (from my perspective anyway) in utilising the human perspective to form values is that it can unfortunately disregard the ecosystem completely. It is as if those values exist in a vacuum or a system that is bent towards providing for those values.<br><br>I've recently been coming around to the conclusion that this is a major weakness and fault-line in Western culture. The reason for this statement is that in disregarding the ecosystem and only taking into account the human perspective, we all end up doing whatever we want and in so doing end up trashing the environment. It is a self-defeating outlook and dare I say it, an immature outlook.<br><br>I've been recently reading about the Aboriginals here who maintained a relatively stable and coherent society and culture for somewhere between 40 and 60 millennia and they had a completely different outlook. It is worth mentioning that outlook for the readers here.<br><br>The Aboriginals considered that every animal, plant and all of the landscape (even the rocks) were part of their family. Members of a tribe were allocated totems which made that particular person responsible for a particular animal, plant and/or area. The resources were then managed in such a way that in a boom and bust environment such as Australia resources were made to be as abundant as possible and that the human population (as well as all of the other animal and plant populations) was kept at a level that the frequent environmental shocks were not a consideration for those people. It is also very telling that this culture which was the Dreamtime also spanned the entire continent as well as Tasmania.<br><br><br><a href=#c5097993820144305740 title="comment permalink">2/6/14, 11:24 PM</a><br><br>

They believed that should they not act in accordance with the Dreamtime that their very souls and lives were in peril – as perhaps they may have literally been given the fragile nature of the environment here.<br><br>Since coming to grips with this understanding, I've been looking at the wildlife and plants here a bit differently. I've always kept space for them and managed the place so that it is a place they'd like to be without them also in turn trashing the farm, but never quite formulated why I was doing this. People are quite happy pointing out to me that this is a loopy thing to do (co-operation versus seeing them as competition).<br><br>There are however, frequent surprising outcomes too, as for example the local owl is helping decimate the rat population quite effectively. Old man roo is a new frequent visitor here too. He has a clipped ear and is a loner (whilst being well over 6 foot – he’s big) and obviously been usurped by a young buck, but happily chows down on the herbage whilst drinking the bees water minding his own business. However, from time to time he effectively clears off Stumpy the wallaby who is the arch nemesis of all fruit trees, so he is giving the trees an occasional break from predation.<br><br>The problem is understanding all of their stories takes a massive amount of time and effort and is probably a bit beyond any one lifetime. I'm slowly starting to get a handle on their interactions though.<br><br>My gut feeling tells me that such a religious and societal response is one possible outcome for a second religiosity, especially if the environment deteriorates significantly and we find that we have to actively manage it and not just take the ecosystem services for granted.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c5096758968842739546 title="comment permalink">2/6/14, 11:24 PM</a><br><br>

Overt slavery in our current world would need a similar kind of long-range order to keep slaves from just walking away.<br><br>My understanding is that this is exactly what African slaves in South America did in the 16th-17th centuries. They walked away and founded their own villages, and were called "Maroons." They often raided and made war against their former masters. Marta tells me there are significant areas of Colombia occupied by the descendants of these "Maroons."<br><br>African slaves in the antebellum Southern US faced the problem of long-range order: Northern states that did not themselves permit slavery would usually recognize the Southern rights to their slave "property," and would cooperate in recapturing and extraditing escaped slaves. Otherwise, the South would have "bled out" a long time before the Civil War.<br><br>If things break down to the tribal level, short-range order can also do the trick: for instance, if running away is a self-imposed exile into a wilderness spotted with other (hostile) tribes, and escape is (or is believed to be) worse than slavery.<br><br>In the in-between, such as the long descent, outright slavery would likely result in slaves just walking away, and there would be little the slaveowner could do about it.<br><br><br><a href=#c8491668999774662822 title="comment permalink">2/7/14, 7:11 AM</a><br><br>

I didn't want to put anyone down, but 'competent' in the context of fabricating electronics would indeed rule out most of the theorists. :)<br><br>@Robert Mathiesen...By any metric you choose to identify, humans are bad at arithmetic compared with simple electronics. In the time you can do a square root in your head, a 1980 vintage computer could do at least thousands of them. Humans are indeed very adaptable. In fact, we are doing arithmetic with neural circuitry designed by evolution for very different purposes. A CPU turns out to be pretty adaptable as well. We'll see how they evolve over centuries. I am not saying I know what will happen...just that the claim that construction of electronics will not survive the end of oil seems somewhat more likely to be false than true.<br><br>@JMG...the material resources required for electronics fabrication is really not the barrier. There is some degree of infrastructure and components without which the process is much harder...things like electric motors to run fans for clean rooms and automation etc., basic machine tools, etc. You can build these things, it just takes time and people. In the 19th century, establishing a science laboratory was essentially a task of manually constructing all these things you need and it took quite a few years. The main cost is the one you identified before...it is the effort of the talented people who could be doing something else. If society breaks down to the point that there is nowhere a functioning regional government capable of allocating resources to strategic goals, then electronics may indeed be lost. <br><br><br><a href=#c6795063338133679046 title="comment permalink">2/7/14, 10:48 AM</a><br><br>

I foresee a return to obsession with parabolic reflectors coming to my studio quite soon. They will resemble the hearts of sunflowers. Also, as mentioned above, one can imagine a wide range of variations on the theme of retro-tech: the Antikythera device, Hiero of Alexandria's steam engine, Leonardo's machines, the medieval invention of the clock, and no doubt many others that bear further looking into. Archimedes, the original parabolic mirror guy, also designed and built a celestial model, later described by Cicero, that accurately predicted eclipses(?!). It seems to me that all of these could easily be imported into a steampunk context. <br><br>My personal favorite for historical anachronisms is one dreamed up by Terence Mckenna, who imagined an alternative history in which the Roman Empire survives to make contact with Meso America, establishing a Greco-Mayan civilization. Imagine the aesthetics of that one. <br><br>I've read up lately about rogue waves, which unfortunately are quite real, so Jason's remarks about a giant wave in the local bay strike a scary note for those of us interested in sailing.

They get their subtlety and depth not from anything structural about the German language, but from German culture and philosophy. There is no difference linguistically between "Zeitgeist" and "spirit of the times" except that the former uses germanic roots and construction while the latter uses latin roots and construction. And to someone who is familiar with the concept of a "Salon" (other than a place to get your hair styled), "salonfähig" and "salon-ready" mean the exact same thing. Neither of these words are denser in connotation and complexity than "free spirit" and "streetsmarts." Just leaving out the spaces and hyphens doesn't make the terms magically more profound! The culture in which it is embedded does that.<br><br>English has its own means to expressive depth that can be challenging in other languages. For example, the fact that our nouns, verbs, and adjectives are entirely interchangeable opens up whole levels of expressive richness, whether you are talking about slang or high poetry. And we often have both a latin (french) root and a teutonic root that have been differentiated with subtlety of meaning. This is a great asset; the old spirit/ghost pair is the classic here. <br><br>And so far as I understand it, the standard term in use in Germany for stop-and-go traffic is "Stopundgo"<br><br><br><br><a href=#c60468076217797871 title="comment permalink">2/7/14, 2:17 PM</a><br><br>

As for hats, oh, granted -- the stereotypical American cowboy hat was worn for good reason. <br><br>Helix, there were actually a wide range of specialized slide rules for functions like that: business slide rules could do discounts and markups, simple and compound interest, and an assortment of other things of the same kind. I've long coveted one of the old electronics slide rules, which would calculate reactance and other useful figures. <br><br>Cherokee, and that's why arguments based on values mean nothing unless the values are shared. The Aboriginals could talk all day about the importance of treating all living things as family -- my Lakota ancestors used to say <i>mitakuye oyasin</i>, very roughly "all things are related" -- and the white settlers shrugged and ignored them, because they didn't share the values. <br><br>Seb, two excellent points.

By all means use it if you wish; there were stories with shared themes in the last anthology, too. (Also one with airships!) <br><br>Joseph, I'll consider it. My take is that slavery is only economically viable when there's a shortage of labor.

And of course there is the problem of poorly maintained infrastructure caused I would imagine by the reluctance of many americans to paying taxes. In Europe and scandinavia with a relative high tax base, most of the infrastructure is well maintained a plus I would think in the long descent.Of course public transport systems can be built, and obviously were in the age abundance, when high cost systems such as slavery were viable, I am not sure of how this will go in a time increasing scarcity.<br>Diane<br><br><a href=#c5396945577745787725 title="comment permalink">2/7/14, 6:42 PM</a><br><br>

I find the understanding of both suffer from extremely muddied (as well as bloodied) waters. I feel that communism in particular has been subjected to intellectual over-reach by its supposed practitioners. One possibly over-the-top example might be what was practiced in Cambodia, which was (I was told) Communism without industrialism (huh?). This post may be very useful since you expect our Right’s promotional efforts may eventually pay off in a return of Communism to respectability in this country.<br><br>I would like to close with a thought that stirring in head awhile about one of possibly central problems with Communism when it’s been tried in the real world. Besides the issues with promised utopias, there is a very real problem with the concept with the idea of ownership of the means of production by workers. Here I talking about actual ownership, not the various dodges perpetrated by probably all Communist countries. The concept of Communism has primarily been used to industrialize non-industrial counties like Russia and China. If the Communist system ever did flip over into actual ownership of the means of production by workers, then the ability to actually have an industrial system would be lost (as per Alf Hornborg’s work). This form of ownership would destroy the concentration of wealth required for the industrial system in the first place. If it wasn’t for Communism’s other problems, this might not be a bad thing in a de-industrializing future. But since all the countries that did the Hammer and Sickle thing were trying to industrialize, well…<br><br><br><a href=#c3223073463234375441 title="comment permalink">2/7/14, 6:44 PM</a><br><br>

But he then goes on to explain that African slavery was quite a different beast. It was generally temporary, and the result of being on the losing side in a war, or having debts. When the European slavers sold them to the owners in the Americas for plantation work under brutal (nd lifelong) conditions, those owners found out the hard way that they'd bought themselves a military general and sent him out to work the fields under a lash.

A technological sensibility isn't a technology, much less a social system. <br><br>Robert, again, slavery only makes economic sense when there's a labor shortage. In the Long Descent, will there be a labor shortage? Not with six billion more people than the planet can reasonably hold. <br><br>Marin, good. I have occasion to wear a silk top hat now and again, as the presiding officer of a Masonic body, and it's a fine and comfortable item. As for Victorian manners, well, a case could be made...<br><br>Diane, you get tonight's gold star. Exactly; it's the very rich, whose wealth, influence, and (ultimately) survival are most dependent on the hypercomplex system we've got, who have the most to lose, and will lose it. I have no idea which sector of the obscenely wealthy will go up against the wall first, but sooner or later, they all will, to be replaced by those who can exercise power in simpler and more hands-on ways. <br><br>Doctor W., I'll consider it. I don't know that it would do much good, but I'll consider it. <br><br>Renaissance, well, yes. ;-)<br><br>KL, I'd be happy if somebody would take the time to translate <i>Finnegan's Wake</i> into English. <br><br>LatheChuck, some of the best slide rules were made of bamboo, with the scales printed using lithography; there were also mechanical devices worked out in Victorian times to space logarithmic scales accurately. If you've got the math to generate log tables, you can make a slide rule -- the very first proto-rule, for that matter, was a sheet of paper on which distances were measured by dividers, was made in 1620. <br><br>KL, yes, whenever there's a labor shortage, slavery's a common human practice, and when there's a labor shortage combined with plantation agriculture for export markets -- as in ancient Greece and Rome, say, or the 19th century American south -- it's all but inevitable. It'll be some centuries before we have anything approaching a labor shortage, and large-scale export of agricultural crops isn't a viable business model in a dark age, so it's not a relevant concern for the future we have to worry about. <br><br>Joseph, and that's another point, of course. Most human relationships are unequal in one way or another; where do you draw the line defining such a relationship as slavery? On that decision depends a lot of the conversation. <br><br>Esther, in America, there's no such thing as a traditional monarchy; our tradition -- one might almost say our Tradition -- is representative democracy, with all the good and bad that entails.

I ignored it completely as it wasn't based in reality, but at the same time was annoyed that they'd adopted my style somehow (obviously not having anything at all to do with them whatsoever)... Liked the pubic reference joke though. Hehe!<br><br>On a serious note, as a youth I had the unfortunate pleasure of managing people that were far older and far more experienced than myself, which was the primary reason for growing the facial hair. Magic I guess, it just made me feel older somehow. As an interesting side note the activity of interacting with people many decades older than myself tempered the worst of my early arrogance.<br><br>I reckon any reduction in the availability of sun screen and/or ready access to skin cancer treatments will lead to an increase in the wearing of hats Down Under.<br><br>Like the Lakota people, he Aboriginals fought back too, unfortunately the European diseases wiped out 90% of the population. Even so and despite this, they continued to attempt to manage the landscape with far less people using the systems that they'd inherited until they were simply and promptly rounded up and moved along to reserves and forced to comply with the Europeans.<br><br>European culture does not take kindly to other cultures that are mobile and/or transient. It is a great advantage for a people to be mobile and I suspect that a lot of European technology was developed to resist this (food storage technology as an example).<br><br>Thanks for mentioning your Lakota heritage. You are correct of course in that the dominant cultural narrative sets the tone of humans relationships with nature and the European culture was again dominant in that arena too. Sacred hills are sacred for a very good reason, even if it cannot be readily explained or even understood in an alien language.<br><br>Of course the dominant cultural narrative nowadays is wrong, but probably few will concede that important point until it can no longer be denied because it requires them to change utterly. But at what price is that resistance of change?<br><br>I feel a great and deep sadness about this issue because it simply doesn't have to be that way and I can feel and see firsthand (especially with global warming here) where it is going and also decline is escalating as new real wealth to plunder is exhausted.<br><br>I also feel a bit sad today on a completely different note because my trusty Pentax digital SLR camera which has travelled with me on this journey for far more than decade packed it in and is now beyond economical repair.

On the one hand, even so simple a technology as a wheel has certain requirements beyond what's needed for its manufacture, and a source of motive power suitable to pull wheeled vehicles is one of them; on the other hand, you may be right that there's something broader involved here. <br><br>Robert, labor shortages were pervasive in the New World until relatively recently, which is why such immense efforts were made to attract immigration from everywhere else once slavery stopped being an option. As for "our masters," sure, if you want to impose that simplistic a model on the complexities of power in the industrial world, you can count on stereotyped answers... <br><br>DaShui, that's plausible. <br><br>Mark, I'd encoruage you to look into it. A good used bookstore that doesn't rotate its stock very often will likely have old books on darkroom technique and how to build your own equipment -- I have a handyman's encyclopedia from the early 1960s that includes a wealth of lore for the home darkroom enthusiast, for example -- and again, if that's going to survive, someone's going to have to do it.<br><br>Eric, thank you. Thanks for the link! <br><br>Joseph (if I may horn in), no, it's not a communist enterprise, it's a syndicalist enterprise. It astonishes me how many people have forgotten what used to be common concepts in political economy!<br><br>Stunned, for what it's worth, I'm a fan of waistcoats as well. <br><br>WVJohn, an excellent idea. What steps can you take in that direction before winning the lottery? <br><br>Brad, yes, I'm familiar with the kind of hunter who can't hunt without 150 pounds of assorted junk from Mall*Wart. Gah. <br><br>John, excellent. Yes, that's a very common misconception, and I'll be talking about it shortly.<br><br><a href=#c78662865316412442 title="comment permalink">2/8/14, 11:08 AM</a><br><br>

When we trifle, in our sly, Gothic, grave-robbing fashion, with archaic and eclipsed technologies, we are secretly preparing ourselves for the death of our own tech. Steampunk is popular now because people are unconsciously realizing that the way that we live has already died. We are sleepwalking.

Archaeologists were looking at some old pre-Columbian aqueducts (pre-Incan, I think). The channel consisted of cuts through the ridges, complemented with raised earthen sections across low spots. The degree of pitch that they maintained was impressive enough, but the scientists noticed that as the channel neared the earthen-work sections the engineers had sometimes narrowed and then bulged out the banks. They didn't understand why until some hydrologists reproduced it in the lab. What happens is that when water flow is normal, the strange shape is irrelevant. But when there is a flood, the narrowing and then expanding would create whirlpools that would cause the water to spill out at that spot (rather than spilling out on the earth works where it would do damage to a very labor-intensive part of the works).<br><br>This always struck me as a much more elegant solution than the Army Corps of Engineers would have managed with a massive dam and floodgates. It's entirely possible that these people had no particular need for wheels.

They, too, had a very similar sense of the value of all life and all things. One of them said "Every pine needle is holy and every step is a prayer." And certainly those in South America saw the "personhood" in all the animals. I believe I understand what they meant by that. I have tried very hard to get "into" the psyche of various animals, and once I did get in, to a tired and much used horse. He saw me and I saw him, and he knew it, and was surprised. But I am not above trying with insects. I wonder if the Aboriginal's philosophy was a natural outgrowth of a people close to nature and their own intuitions who simply came to a natural conclusion of the world, or whether they might have learned some hard lesson in the past, and incorporated it so as not to make the same mistakes again. And I say this because I hope that is what will occur with us, but at the same time I think there is a kind of natural human philosophy and spirituality that arises in people if they are not blocked by stronger belief systems.<br><br>Now I happen to be a remarkably unobservant person with a strong new interest that will put my powers of observation to the test, i.e., I have been bitten and smitten by the idea of gathering wild foods and learning to prepare them. I know it was something someone said here that got me started, but I looked up some books and found such a gem, that I ought to mention it here.<br><br>That book is "Nature's Garden" by Samuel Thayer. It is apparently a sequel. This 500-page book is heavy due to slick pages filled with excellent photos. He spends 50 pages on the acorn, discussing varieties, harvesting, how to spot the bad ones, the history of human and animal acorn eating, methods of drying and preparing. This is the kind of detail needed to really learn from a book. You can't just have a simple sketch with a paragraph. He chooses to focus on only 40 plants, due to the need for that detail but knows perhaps hundreds. Most of these plants grow in most of the states. 100% in Appalachia, although he lives in the mid west. Furthermore his writing style is superb. I've had a festering interest in wild food for some time, but I had no idea really that there were so many edible plants around. Some of the myths he busts are surprising. He considers the "don't touch anything natural, all you will do is damage" liberal tendency as the opposite side of the coin to the ones who think nature is something to be exploited and not seen. Both reflect alienation from the environment, an environment which all things alter by their presence and in which we also belong.<br><br>"We need a new paradigm - one of attachment and participation. We don't need more concerned intellectuals pondering the importance of Nature from 3rd floor offices; we need people who know the land because they live and work there, who love the woods because it nourishes them."<br>Starting in a few weeks, I will begin a new phase in my life, a vegetable garden, raising chickens, and foraging.<br><br><a href=#c2870176563547739049 title="comment permalink">2/8/14, 3:37 PM</a><br><br>

In one hand, I have a Post Versalog 1460, with 11 scales on one side, 12 on the other, and its core is made of bamboo.

Mussolini was, of course, a socialist to begin with. I still remember an essay title from a first-year International History module in my undergraduate days, though: "Fascism is extremism of the centre. Discuss"...<br><br>I'll look forward to the coming cycle of posts on the topic. The evidence seems to be conclusive, from contemporary societies that are more stressed than the US, UK etc,that a move to greater authoritarianism is on the cards. The question of how to establish Temporary Autonomous Zones is much on my mind.<br><br>Also on my mind is violence. I understand your reasons for not wanting to cover it here. Still, there's a prominent article in today's Observer (a British Sunday newspaper): <a href=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/09/global-water-shortages-threat-terror-war rel=nofollow>Why global water shortages pose threat of terror and war</a>. It's not anything that will surprise readers of this blog, but it seems that just as we saw a realization of what Peak Oil means seep into some mainstream media in recent times, a similar awareness of other resource-based issues is also now appearing. The article doesn't follow through the logical consequences (food production collapse and major economic disruption in the US, mass migration in the Middle East, etc), but we here know they're coming.<br><br>This means that topics which have appeared in the comments here so far really will become pressing. Slavery, for example: you think it won't happen because there'll be surplus labour. I'm not so sure: many places won't have the carrying capacity any more. I'm reminded of a book (author &amp; title forgotten) I read some years back by an American who lived with Bedouin in the middle east during the 20s. The Bedu, rich or poor, high- or low-status, were all warriors, who wouldn't soil their hands with work. They despised the peasants who laboured in the fields - and they had many slaves, often Sudanese Africans, who themselves owned property and other slaves. The author noted that many of these slaves had no desire for "freedom" - in terms of wealth and power, it would only be a step down. As you noted, slavery has many degrees, and some of them are not as unlikely as you think. Let's not take for granted that a feudal elite is an inevitable path - the return to a tribal structure is also conceivable. <br><br>Faced with collapse and the need to defend territory and culture against refugees and migrants, how will cultures of the remaining rainlands respond? Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRTJKcIljzU" rel=nofollow>one possibility</a> from Russia (links to YouTube). I often think that Juhana may be on the money.<br><br>Perhaps on a more positive (and steampunk) note: some of the comments here regarding slide rules and computational ability suddenly put me in mind of the Mentats from Frank Herbert's <i>Dune</i>. Perhaps someone might consider founding a Mentat Academy? It would sit comfortably alongside the religious, knowledge-preserving communities much-mentioned by JMG - and I could easily conceive of some being like the Bene Gesserit! David Lynch's version of Dune was of course a fantastically steampunk version of the story...<br><br><a href=#c975150083601004781 title="comment permalink">2/8/14, 9:51 PM</a><br><br>

That's reminiscent of some of Viktor Schauberger's work. <br><br>Marcello, good heavens, didn't you know that all the French philosophes were passionate Anglophiles?

Right now, there's an underlying nastiness, ugliness, and disorganized violence in the US that is palpable everywhere in the US, blue/red, coast to coast, and border to border. Indeed, it seems to be the one unifying characteristic of modern day America. A charismatic, powerful leader who could tap in to that disorganized force and organize it would be very powerful. An economic crisis/contraction equal to, if not worse than anything experienced by post WW I Germany is certainly on the horizon in the US. The recent/near term weak presidents and there incompetence and lack of power call out for a strong powerful leader who could cut through the bureaucratic stasis of modern US politics. The implosion of the American empire demands scapegoats to blame for the fall, and a charismatic leader who claims a return to glory and pride if only certain scapegoated groups were eliminated/exterminated, as well as weak and ineffective opposition to any proposed holocaust, seems very plausible. An underlying death wish animating and driving it all seems all within the realm of the possible. Rights of minorities quickly abolished in an emergency seems very plausible. The notion of American exceptionalism coupled with American disregard/ignorance of history would blind the US to the German experience. All it takes to imagine such an American Nazi scenario complete with a powerful, charismatic Hitler-style leader is to extrapolate current existing, powerful trends in the US out to their logical conclusion. <br>The question then becomes who intervenes to stop and stabilize the situation, and this is where history might diverge from the past. Both the US and the Soviet Union had vested interests in the stability of Europe, and wanted to establish client states there, and saw Europe as vital to their power. I'm not sure the same could be said of the US. The only thing that might prompt an international intervention is if the US death wish was strong enough that it targeted a group with a particularly powerful enough backing for extermination. If the US targeted, say, ethnic Chinese, or even ethnic Mexicans, for extermination, then those countries and their allies would be brought in to intervene as a matter of national/ethnic pride.<br>History never repeats itself exactly, but I don't think that you could dismiss German-style fascism out of hand, particularly in the US.<br><br><a href=#c8140369195341306066 title="comment permalink">2/9/14, 7:46 AM</a><br><br>

Those are all normal concomitants of the decline and fall of a civilization. Feudalism, too -- that's the absolute bog-standard social response to civilizational collapse, for good reasons I'll be covering in an upcoming series of posts. I'd consider the Bedu and their Sudanese serfs, by the way, an example of feudalism rather than slavery -- note the very common practice of subinfeudation, in which vassals have vassals of their own. The difference is that vassals have legal or customary rights that can be enforced, while slaves have none. As for Mentats, good! I've been talking about that on and off since the first months of this blog; yes, a Mentat academy would be a very good thing to think about. "It is by will alone that the slide rule moves..." <br><br>Pot, of course my posts are US-centric. As I've discussed here repeatedly, I've never lived anywhere else, and the last thing the rest of the world needs is one more clueless American telling it what to do; there are any number of good blogs discussing the peak oil situation from other parts of the world, and I encourage you to read those if you're interested in a more global perspective.

I recall reading an article about a Roman effort to extract silver from a mountain in one of their far flung vassal states, mowing down an entire forest for wood to construct mine tunnels and smelt the ore. They managed to dismantle most of a mountain peak (West Virginia coal companies were not the first ones to do this), but at the end of it came "peak wood". Nevermind all the possibilities of coppicing or other renewable fluffery. <br><br>And I know you favor the Seebeck effect as a source of electric power, JMG. But that, too, is hideously inefficent. You can twist together a copper and a tin wire, for example (extracted at the price outlined in the previous paragraph), and by heating one end and cooling the other, produce enough current to swing a galvanometer. Meanwhile, we are currently capable of converting about 15% of infalling sunlight directly to electric power, and have several ways (not just lead-acid) to save that power for a gloomy day. Furthermore, we have some older methods of extracting silicon to which do not involve the rigors of nine-nines refining employed for microelectronics. If you can make a poor diode from a galena crystal and a steel needle, you could reasonably expect to make crude solar cells with only slightly more effort. <br><br>But after reading these essays for several years, and watching the beginnings of the first catabolic step unfold, it has ocurred to me that the biggest impediment to keeping the knowledge alive will not be physical or thermodynamic. It will be cultural. Quite a lot of technological knowledge may be lost as the civil religion of Progress is abandoned. The Canadian government burning all its environmental records comes to mind. <br><br>As Alan has pointed out, there are a few places in the world where abundant electric power is simply a matter of running the turbines in the dam, or using the steam which gushes out of the ground. New Zealand, Iceland, the Yellowstone area come to mind, as does the big dam in northern Quebec. <br><br>But we are also now seeing the end result of imbuing silicon with an insect-like intelligence, and there are certainly already some folks (e.g. in the Hindu Kush) questioning the wisdom of this idea. A handful of locations on the planet can produce aluminium and silicon for the modern equivalent of the Roman Legions. But is it not likely that these areas will also be targeted for destruction by those on the receiving end of said legions? And that as the financial collapse progresses, the ranks of said legions will thin? The rest of the story is a matter of extrapolation at this point. <br><br><br><a href=#c6533985910042587855 title="comment permalink">2/9/14, 1:18 PM</a><br><br>

Please stay safe. <br><br>Shane, fair enough. That said, I'll be discussing that possibility at some length in the weeks ahead. <br><br>Jim, whenever you use the word "efficient" you need to specify "efficient at what." Sure, the Seebeck effect is inefficient at turning sunlight into electricity, as compared to photoelectrics; so? That's not the only efficiency that matters. Liebig's law -- the principle that the resource in shortest supply is the one that limits the whole system -- applies to technologies as well as other complex systems. Thermoelectric generators can be made from scrap metal using Bronze Age technologies, while PV cells can't; if you've got plenty of scrap metal and hand tools, and a severe shortage of what you'd need to make PV cells, thermoelectric generators are more efficient in terms of the resources that matter. I'd encourage you, by the way, to try making a PV cell by hand and see what kind of light-to-current efficiencies you get!<br><br>That said, your broader point -- that social factors are also crucial -- is unquestionably relevant as well. Technical feasibility, economic viability, and social desirability all have to be factored into the question of whether a given technology will be likely to survive into the deindustrial future. <br><br>As for coal shortages: "Augustin Mouchot's solar steam engines..."<br><br><a href=#c5219979598337693719 title="comment permalink">2/9/14, 5:22 PM</a><br><br>

I wondered why this is not factored in more often: You can run a perfectly good, in fact pleasantly relaxed, mid level industrial system when the wind blows, the sun shines, the creek is flowing, there is flammable waste from the harvest to burn.<br><br>And as Alan pointed out, there are some places on earth with a natural source of energy of one sort or another, lots of sun, lots of wind, lots of mountains and water, lots of geothermal and while requiring more work, lots of Hot Rocks, which parts of Australia are blessed with.

It's far from uncommon in historical examples for relatively complex products to be manufactured in a few locations where conditions are optimal, and sold from there -- you can go all the way back to the Neolithic for examples, as the kind of stone that makes really good axes can be found only in a few places, and was traded across near-continental distances.

They're based on the assumption that people live in an area with abundant rainfall, have rather large suburban backyards to garden in, or at most can "run for the hills" and live off the land. <br>Hardly relevant for the millions in concrete apartment blocks in Cairo, Hong-Kong, Mumbai etc. <br> <br>What seems likely is that the American wilderness will be filled with gangs, refugees and illegal migrants (most of them having overstayed their visas and attempting to evade the state). The trees will be cut down for makeshift shelters and fires, and the animals will be hunted illegally to the brink of extinction. The woods will be a cutthroat anarchy that no "decent white people" will dare to enter without an armed escort."<br> <br>As JMG has said he isn't going to tell people of other cultures or nations exactly how they're going to under go / handle their collapse. And it is equally clear you aren't aware of how big the USA really is.<br> <br>Much of the western US has a very low population density, most small 'cow /farm towns' have become ghost towns, unless they're on a main road between one large city and another. Here in the pacific states it gets more populated the closer you get to the coast, however much of the land is very rugged. The county I grew up in has a very low population density to this day. Flat land there is at a premium and the soils are clay with a heavy mixture of brittle shale. It's easy to get lost there on the logging roads away from the main roads. The county is large enough that the year I moved out of that state a fire got up in the back country during an exceptionally dry year and intense fire season, when it hit 100,000 acres, with the state's resources over stressed, they just let it burn until the winter rains put it out.<br> <br>The state in which I now live a boy on his quarter pony got separated from his folks while they were moving cattle on horse back through old lava flows. The pony came home by itself and they didn't find the boy's body until the following year.<br> <br>I currently live a few miles north of JMG's former home and in a violent societal collapse this valley is one of the safest places to be. There's very rugged country between here and the coast, some dry country and two mountain ranges to climb from the south, three to cross from the north and a lot of dry, volcanic terrain to the east. I don't see us as being flooded by starving refugees even though it was / is principally a farming area. And frankly most urban dwellers don't know their rear end from a hole in the ground when it comes to wilderness survival. Hunting, as most outdoor activity, has taken a hit from modern electronics and most people these days know nothing about subsistence hunting and fishing. And if it comes to identifying edible wild plants, well I think a lot of urban people will end up poisoning themselves.<br> <br>We have more problems with illegal back country pot plantations right now from their booby traps to guard their crops than anything else. And that's a better reason to go armed in the woods than the mountain lions. I'd take a dim view of having my favorite horse crippled by their traps and I don't give a tinker's whoopity doo about their profits! The attitude comes from my partial ethnic background which is eastern swamp Indian by way of Oklahoma.

I can't say I've gotten into the steampunk movement, though I certainly have heard of it, but I suppose I'm into my own anachronism: that of homesteading.<br><br>In fact, I just reinvigorated that bit of my life with a move two miles down the road. (I'm hopeful and expectant that this will be my last move in a good while, though I'm renting and don't own the place. Still, I work for and am on good terms with the owners and, by all accounts, I should be able to stay a good long while if desired.)<br><br>The new house is an old 1917 farm house. It's heated by wood (the bank demanded electric baseboard heaters installed in the upstairs bedrooms, but those will be turned off at the breaker.) One of my first acts upon moving in was to hang much of my cast iron collection on a (well-secured) bit of perforated hardboard that had previously held a collection of mugs. I added a new pan to the collection after salvaging it--rusty and long-neglected--from the garage. A scrubbing and reseasoning and, guess what, it's of far better quality than all my newer cast iron.<br><br>I'll be cleaning and salvaging multiple boxes of old canning jars, as well, and I managed to pluck some ax heads and old hand tools from the assortment of junk that came out of the barn and garage during our work party cleaning. Let me tell you, such old farm buildings contain the ores of our salvage economy. I couldn't believe how much old metal came out of there, much of it rusted but still in workable condition.<br><br>The house is sturdy. It needs some more weatherstripping and insulation, which is on my list of things to do--I'll be using <em>Green Wizardry</em> as a guide for what steps I want to take--but this is far sturdier than any house built in the last few decades. It's amazing what some old growth wood will do for a structure.<br><br>The house is a weird mishmash of disparate elements. Upstairs, decades-old linoleum is peeling up, torn apart, stained, and in a general state of disrepair. The real question, though, is why it was ever there in the first place. Beneath it is tight-grained, old growth fir hardwood floors. Eventually I hope to take up the linoleum and sand and stain the original floors. Downstairs, meanwhile, the living and dining rooms have been covered in Pergo. I can't say I comprehend why original hardwood floors were covered with faux-hardwood laminate. No doubt the hardwood floors below are still sturdy and intact while the Pergo has started to crack and peel in a few places. Meanwhile, vinyl baseboarding runs along the real baseboards. Every time I look at it, I wonder why? The real baseboards still look good and are solid. The tacked-on vinyl baseboarding just looks, well, tacky.<br><br>The prize of the house, in my mind? A huge, sturdy, floor to ceiling bookshelf in the living room. It has a good chunk of my book collection on it, and I can't help but admire it. An old Royal typewriter also came with the house and--while missing its 'z' and '1' for some reason--I typed a letter for a friend on it. Its heft and sturdiness, and the sharp clack of the keys, delight me.<br><br>And so, I'll seek to reclaim this house over time and return it to something of its original glory, though with some appropriate-tech modifications. I've been watching my electricity usage and putting into place practices to reduce it (the wood stove is supplying most of my cooking and hot water, since it's running anyway this time of year.) I hope to build a fairly cheap solar water batch heater and plump it into the electric water heater later this year. I already have a variety of good salvaged windows to work with, and friends who have built their own and will provide me with plans.<br><br>So not so much the steampunk for me as the homesteading and farming realm. But I'll be happy to cherry pick good ideas out of that movement, as well--and I really do need to get myself a slide rule one of these days soon.<br><br><a href=#c2987425803208171501 title="comment permalink">2/10/14, 4:10 PM</a><br><br>

(AP) — Some Central Michigan University students are getting schooled in the undead this semester, thanks to a religion course that's exploring apocalyptic themes in biblical texts, literature and pop culture.<br><br>Philosophy and religion faculty member Kelly Murphy says she always wanted to teach a course on apocalyptic literature, and she is a fan of AMC's TV show "The Walking Dead." The result is Murphy's class, which is called "From Revelation to 'The Walking Dead.'"<br><br>"Thinking about the end and imagining life in a different way is something that humans have always done," Murphy said in a university release.<br><br>Murphy's class will discuss biblical texts, review popular novels and watch clips from movies such as "Shaun of the Dead" and "28 Days Later." Students also will discuss hypothetical ethical and theological problems that people could encounter in a post-apocalyptic world.<br><br>"The prevalence of apocalyptic stories in various media gives us a window into what people are worrying about, what they hope for and how they imagine they would react in the face of a cataclysmic event," Murphy said. "In the same way, we can read the Book of Revelation ... and learn what ancient Jewish and Christian groups were concerned about."<br><br>Kevin White, a senior from the Detroit suburb of St. Clair Shores majoring in political science and religion, said it is important to incorporate popular culture into classroom settings because it helps to give students a way to connect with subjects of study.<br><br>"Studying ancient biblical texts isn't most people's cup of tea," he said.

An untended/ill-tended accident or illness of human/livestock might mean the end of a farm.<br> * planning of mutual work assistance more efficiently, where that efficiency means the difference between survival and insolvency.<br> * ordering of repair parts for farm gear - shortening downtime, perhaps meaning the difference between a harvest brought in vs. a harvest left to rot in the fields.<br> * buy/sell orders transmitted without costly travel or stays in market towns, perhaps meaning enough margin to survive until next year.<br><br>So, in some cases dirt-farmers do "need" electronics to survive, though I will grant these may be rare compared to cases where it "merely" makes their lives easier, wealthier, and healthier if they had them.<br><br>And if the farmers had more "money", they could buy more/more sophisticated goods and services, and other people (including governments) would have more money, and there would be a higher level of culture, like more effective medicine, more education, law enforcement, etc.<br><br>"How much electricity do [farmers] really need?"<br><br>Depends on a given biome/ecological niche.

If one wants to avoid going broke farming in a place/time where drying means the difference between success or failure, then one "needs" fans (probably electrical).

The whole hyper-consumerist and overworked lifestyle - not to mention the difficulty in getting an entry visa - pretty much guarantee that I won't consider following in their path anytime soon; but if I would ever have the opportunity to visit your country, it's the rural, small town "old" parts like your current hometown that I would love to check out. <br><br>Also, I am happy to say that I am now the proud owner of a Soviet-era "Zenit" photo camera.

I used to worry about that scenario also. But after most of a lifetime in the south, and over a decade in this particular spot, a fundamental thing has become clear to me. Hardly any of those "redneck boys" know how to do anything anymore if there is not a Tractor Supply, Mall*Wart and gas station just down the road. They have never felled a tree by hand (even if they had the tools, which they don't), they have never killed a squirrel without a .22 and ammo manufactured across the ocean somewhere. <br><br>In a fast collapse scenario, I think you would see that sort of thing in the short run, until most of them had gotten themselves killed or had abandoned the wilderness to scrounge in the cities where the density of salvageable resources is greater. Few of these "redneck boys" care to actually learn how to do these things with pure muscle power. In a long decline, I think you will find the rural areas depopulating, not filling up with roving gangs and well-armed compounds. Hasn't the Russian countryside effectively emptied out in the wake of the Soviet collapse? <br><br>Listen to the lyrics of that redneck survivalist anthem, "A Country Boy Can Survive." The only thing he seems to know how to do is shoot a gun, grow smokables, and make booze. Probably all using store-bought materials. Sorry, but that particular country boy won't survive very long with that limited skill set. <br><br>As for drug wars, those are fueled by money coming in from outside, or by addiction to drugs that cannot be locally manufactured (meth cooking requires pharmaceutical and industrial raw materials). It's down to pot and opium, really, and with no large external market there's no reason to shoot your neighbor to protect your home-grown patch. You're probably inviting him over to share the harvest anyway. Crash the global economy, and the global drug production and distribution system goes down really fast, too -- legal and illegal. <br><br>I am assuming the type of financial crash JMG mentioned that he suspects might be coming in the near future is just another step down, not The End of The Global Economy. It's 2008 all over again, winding up a bit deeper than last time.<br><br><a href=#c8202717546515018179 title="comment permalink">2/11/14, 6:41 AM</a><br><br>

The commercial software is hilariously expensive and crashes, a lot. Granted, the students are learning how to build new things, an activity diametric to, say, a guild that would try to crank out the exact same IC designs over a century or three. That we lost analog computing after a previous fall may not bode well for any future crunch: it is likely not economic to step down the ladder in advance, especially for complicated geegaws. Perhaps if there is some rich investor who builds the necessary infrastructure and sets up an inheritance--and even then things may well turn out poorly.

He is a supermodel now, appeared in a Super Bowl TV ad this year. Beard like a rhododendron bush. <br><br>Calculating in your head -- two tricks I learned:<br><br>Squares of two-digit numbers:<br><br>a^2 = (a+b)*(a-b)+b^2<br><br>The value for b is whatever single digit that will make either a+b or a-b into an even multiple of 10. So, if you want to do 27, <br><br>27^2 = 30*24+3^2 = 720 + 3 = 729<br><br>Likewise, 93,<br><br>93^2 = 96*90 + 3^2 = 8640 +9 = 8649<br><br>To multiply longer numbers in your head, you just do every pair of digits individually and do a running sum. An example:<br><br>153*397 = 100*300+100*90+100*7+50*300+... etc.<br><br>It takes a bit of practice, but the only real tricks are keeping track of the number of zeros and not forgetting your running sum. You have to be able to look at the pairs of numbers with single-digit mantissae and just know the product without working it out; when you see 100 and 300 you think 30000. So the thoughts in your head just go like "that's 30000, 39000, 39700, 54700, 55150, etc." until you wind up with 60741.<br><br>Even as an adult you can get fairly adept at these things. If you teach them to children and they practice them all their lives, I expect many could get to the point where they could just look at pairs of three digit numbers and write the products out after very brief contemplation. <br><br>It's not a question of whether these things are "better" or "faster" than calculators. It's that they require nothing but a brain, which is renewable and biofueled.<br><br><a href=#c2727638377750086266 title="comment permalink">2/11/14, 8:29 AM</a><br><br>

The day the Internet goes dark, I lose my job (I work remotely). The day LSI chip fabrication goes under, my profession becomes permanently obsolete. <br><br>It is really hard to credit any idea that says something that didn't exist a century ago, and won't exist a century (or two) from now, is somehow "needful" for human survival at any level.<br><br>Yes, life without technology will be, in many ways, harder than life with it. I remember a documentary years back on certain tribes in Africa that periodically suffer from long regional droughts, and when this happens, they are reduced to living on a hardy legume that is plentiful and drought-resistant. But the peas contain a neurotoxin, and when people subsist on it over long periods, it builds up in their bodies and they can permanently lose the use of their legs and sometimes other limbs. Long droughts could and did periodically cripple a significant fraction of entire generations. This has been going on for a long, long time. It is part of their expectation of life.<br><br>Just as, even a century ago, people expected to lose children to measles and trenchmouth, wives to childbirth, the middle-aged to tuberculosis, the old to pneumonia, and entire populations to influenza and dysentery. None of this made life unworthy of living to our ancestors.<br><br>So yes, a dirt farmer foolish (or desperate) enough to expect to run a profitable farm out here in what used to be high-plains desert, is going to be in a world of hurt in the near future: you could even say he "needs" the technology, but that is only because of the expectation that dirt farmers <i>should</i> be able to make the desert bloom just because they happen to possess a piece of paper that says they "own" the land. Without the technology, the sensible thing to do is to abandon desert farms and the pieces of paper, and move elsewhere.<br><br>Yes, there are already people living "elsewhere." Sounds a bit like the Voelkerwanderungen JMG has been talking about, and the concomitant troubles they bring.<br><br>Unlike a computer software developer, the dirt farmer does not "need" a transistor, or electricity. There were dirt farmers a thousand years ago. There will be dirt farmers a thousand years from now. There were not, and will not be, any computer programmers.<br><br><a href=#c5505049054793315204 title="comment permalink">2/11/14, 10:26 AM</a><br><br>

I have ALWAYS been interested in wilderness survival even as a child in the lumber camp I grew up in and luckily I have a memory that retains such things. If I'm going to subsistence hunt for squirrels, I'll use a blowgun, like my Cherokee ancestors, the only N. American tribe that did and yes, there will be a learning curve. If I want to plow or haul something heavy without a gas powered engine I'll get some yearling steers and hit or miss, carve some yokes and use oxen as my great grandfather did. (I'll figure that out too!) He liked oxen and resented that the logging company he worked for went to mules. (I have a copy of a photo of him with his three span and the big wheels they used in the woods, complete with mule ear boots, overalls, high crowned, flat brimmed hat and his bull whip coiled on his shoulder.)<br><br>If I can't get direct instruction in something I'll get a book and I generally do pretty well at learning things that way. I need to get back into practice but I can braid rope and weave knots and rawhide makes some very durable equipment for horse handling plus I like the natural horsemanship practiced by the old Californios, I'll just do without the spade bits. <br><br>My big drawback is my age, I'm in my early sixties although I'm still pretty agile. (You should see a couple of the horses I ride, cutter types, quick little boogers!) <br><br>My point is that there are ways of recovering old skills.

Given that we could exploit these resources (due to accidents of geography, history and culture) it's inevitable that we would choose to do so, and do so in the extreme.<br><br><a href=#c4919459801494571941 title="comment permalink">3/3/14, 1:53 PM</a><br><br>

Even without any significant geologic oil the world would still have had WWI for the same reasons and I’m guessing the outcome probably would have been nearly the same as well. The technology of machine guns, artillery, railroads and landing craft were developed during the coal powered American Civil war after all! However, a fuel poor World War II would have been more interesting. Thanks to World War I, the seeds of WWII were planted. At the same time, Germany had made strides in practical chemical processing methods that allowed it to substitute coal for liquid fuels. Those fuels were vital for it’s new Blitzkrieg tactics. Even without those tactics, it would only take a few incidents of vintage wood and cloth alcohol fueled planes sinking expensive coal powered (or wood powered) warships to demonstrate expensive planes were cost effective weapons. Tanks would have been built and provisioned with expensive liquid fuel for similar reasons. <br>With Allied powers starved of oil, I’m guessing the outcome in Europe may have been very different. If the Allies did manage to get a foothold in Europe, they would not have been able to move as fast. So, World War II might have turned into a repeat of WWI trench warfare. What would have been interesting (or tragic) is the role that nuclear weapons would have played as a game changer to break the stalemate. I think the nuclear bomb still would have happened. After all, many of the scientists working on it were born close to the horse and buggy era! <br>Hopefully, we’ll figure out the resource challenges and not need to fight a second nuclear war (WWII being the first one). As the saying goes, “Whenever I see an adult on a bicycle, I have hope for the human race.”<br><br><a href=#c5760019445938921045 title="comment permalink">3/6/14, 4:03 PM</a><br><br>

For example,<br><br>1. The much maligned oil industry must be one of the most international businesses that exist — you will find people from all over the world working in the design office of a major offshore contractor for example. (Kenneth Clark made the point many years ago that those issues which are critically important to us are always international. He used the example of the Archbishop of Canterbury in the Middle Ages: the appointees came from all over the world — now they are always English.) Many international oil workers come from India and other countries which do not follow the Judaeo—Christian tradition; they instinctively pick up on a birth/death/rebirth model rather than one of linear progress to a destination.<br>2. Most engineering types could care less about literature and its relationship to technical work — but some do.<br>3. However liberal arts people are horrified if they are expected to understand the basics of thermodynamics or calculus - their lack of effort seems to require no justification. Recently I chatted to someone who was thinking of preparing a talk on the life of Ismbard Kingdom Brunel — one of the world’s greatest engineers. I noted that, in order to really understand his character you don’t need to know about his personal life but you do need to understand why he decided that piston speeds should not exceed 280 ft/min at 30 mph whereas his competitors allowed values of 500 ft/min. I did not make my point.<br><br>Which is why I see a weakness in Hesse’s Glass Bead Game. He was writing at a time when German industry and science were world leaders, and the book is very Germano-centric. Yet he does not incorporate chemistry or theromodynamics into the Game.<br><br><a href=#c6857993341048189966 title="comment permalink">3/6/14, 4:37 PM</a><br><br>
