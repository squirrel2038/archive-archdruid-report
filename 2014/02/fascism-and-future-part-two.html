As the first part of this series pointed out last week, there’s an odd mismatch between the modern use of “fascism” as an all-purpose political snarl word, on the one hand, and the mediocrity of the regime that put the term into general use, on the other. All things considered, as tyrants go, Benito Mussolini simply wasn’t that impressive, and while the regime he cobbled together out of a bucket of spare ideological parts had many objectionable features, it cuts a pretty poor figure in the rogue’s gallery of authoritarian states. Let’s face it, as an archetype of tyranny, Italian
<i>Fascismo</i> just doesn’t cut it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, it’s far from obvious that there’s enough common ground among the various European totalitarian movements between the wars to justify the use of a single label for them—much less to make that label apply to tyrants and tyrannies around the world and throughout time. Historians in Europe and elsewhere thus spent a good deal of time in recent decades arguing about whether there’s any such thing as fascism in general, and some very thoughtful writers ended up insisting that there isn’t—that more general words such as “dictatorship” cover the ground quite adequately, and the word “fascism” properly belongs to Mussolini’s regime and that alone. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On the other side of the equation were those who argued that a certain kind of authoritarian movement in Europe between the wars was sufficiently distinct from other kinds of tyranny that it deserves its own label. One of those was Ernst Nolte, whose 1968 book <i>Die Krise des liberalen Systems und die faschistischen Bewegungen (The Crisis of the Liberal System and the Fascist Movements)</i> played a central role in launching the debate just mentioned. Nolte was careful enough not to propose a hard and fast definition of fascism, and offered instead a list of six features that any movement had to have to count as fascist. The first three of them are organizational features: a cult of charismatic leadership, a uniformed Party militia, and the goal of totalitarianism. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That last word has been bandied around so freely over the years since then that it’s probably necessary to stop here and discuss what it means. A totalitarian political system is one in which the party in power claims the right to rule every sphere of life: political, religious, artistic, scientific, sexual, and so on through all the normally distinct dimensions of human existence. There are plenty of dictatorships that aren’t totalitarian—in fact, it’s fairly common for dictators to spare themselves a lot of extra work by focusing purely on the political sphere, and letting people do what they want in other spheres of life so long as their activities don’t stray into politics—and there are also totalitarian systems that aren’t dictatorships: there are plenty of religious communities, some of them more or less democratic in terms of governance, that claim totalitarian authority over every aspect of the life of the faithful. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The totalitarian dimension, though, is central to those movements and regimes that count as fascist by Nolte’s criteria, and it’s a crucial distinction. The charismatic leaders and party militias of between-the-wars European fascist parties presented themselves, and in at least some cases honestly saw themselves, as trying to overturn not merely a political system but an entire civilization they believed was rotten to the core. Crusades against “degenerate” art and literature thus weren’t simply the product of the individual vagaries of fascist leaders; they were part and parcel of an attempt to reshape an entire society from the ground up, and the cult of leadership and the party militia very often served mostly as vehicles for the broader totalitarian agenda. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A good deal of the discussion that followed the publication of Nolte’s book focused on whether the three organizational features just discussed were sufficiently unique to fascist movements to serve as touchstones, whether there were more features that might usefully be added to the list, and so on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The other three features in Nolte’s description, by contrast, were broadly accepted by scholars. This is all the more interesting in that one of them is almost always rejected out of hand on the rare occasions it slips outside the charmed circle where professional historians practice their craft. These three features are the things that fascist movements and regimes consistently rejected. The first is Marxism, the second liberalism, and the third—the hot-button one—is conservatism. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mention this to anyone in the contemporary American left, and you can expect blank incomprehension. Try to push past that, and if you get anywhere at all you can normally count on seeing the blank look replaced by flat rejection or incandescent rage. It’s one of the standard credos of current political folklore that fascism belongs to the conservative side of the political spectrum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More specifically, it’s supposed to be the far end of that side of the spectrum, the thing that’s more conservative than the conservatives, just as—to the contemporary American right—Communism is the far end of the left side of the spectrum, the thing that’s more liberal than the liberals. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I mentioned in last week’s post the way that the riotous complexity of political thought in the early 20th century got flattened out into a Hobson’s choice between representative-democracy-plus-capitalism (the ideology of the American empire) and bureaucratic state socialism (the ideology of the Soviet empire) in the course of the Cold War. The same flattening process also affected domestic politics in the United States, though in a somewhat different way. Communism and fascism have long been the most overheated labels in our political culture’s demonology, and Republicans and Democrats eagerly applied these labels to each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since Republicans and Democrats are themselves simply very minor variations on a common theme, it worked well thereafter to apply those labels to anyone who strayed too far from the midpoint between the two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This allowed the parties to squabble about peripheral issues while maintaining perfect unanimity on core values such as maintaining America’s empire, say, or supporting the systemic imbalances in financial and resource flows that keep that empire in business. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the consequences of that strategy was the elimination of conservatism, in anything like the old meaning of that word, from the vocabulary of American politics. The Anglo-American tradition of conservatism—continental Europe has its own somewhat different form—has its roots in the writings of Edmund Burke, whose <i>Reflections on the Revolution in France</i> became a lightning rod for generations of thinkers who found the hubris of the radical Enlightenment too much to swallow. At the risk of oversimplifying a complex tradition, conservatism was based on the recognition that human beings aren’t as smart as they like to think. As a result, when intellectuals convince themselves that they know how to make a perfect human society, they’re wrong, and the consequences of trying to enact their fantasies in the real world normally range from the humiliating to the horrific. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To the conservative mind, the existing order of society has one great advantage that the arbitrary inventions of would-be world-reformers can’t match: it has actually been shown to work in practice. Conservatives thus used to insist that changes to the existing order of society ought to be made only when there was very good reason to think the changes will turn out to be improvements. The besetting vice of old-fashioned conservatism, as generations of radicals loved to point out, was thus that it tended to defend and excuse traditional injustices; among its great virtues was that it defended traditional liberties against the not always covert authoritarianism of would-be reformers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In America before the Cold War, conservatives thus called for limitations on federal power, denounced the nation’s moves toward global empire, demanded balanced budgets and fiscal prudence, and upheld local and regional cultures and governments against the centralizing reach of Washington DC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the South, that reasoning was inevitably used to defend segregation, but it’s a distortion of history to claim that American conservatism was never anything more than a polite label for Jim Crow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like every political movement in the real world, it was a complex thing, and combined high ideals and base motives in roughly the same proportions as its rivals. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Whatever its faults or its virtues, though, it died a miserable death during the 20th century, as both parties and most of the competing power centers that form America’s governing classes joined eagerly in the rush to empire, and vied to see who could come up with more excuses for centralizing power in the executive branch of the federal government. As part of that process, the old conservatism was gutted, stuffed, and left to rot in cold storage, except for very occasional moments of pro forma display for the benefit of the dwindling few who hadn’t gotten the memo.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In Europe between 1919 and 1945, though, the European version of old-fashioned conservatism was still a major power, and Nolte was quite correct to say that one of the core themes of fascism was the rejection of conservative ideas. Where conservatives saw themselves as the defenders of the old order of Europe—Christian, aristocratic, agrarian, and committed to local custom and local autonomy—fascists wanted to impose a New Order (one of Hitler’s favorite phrases) in which traditional social hierarchies would dissolve in the orgiastic abandon of “one leader, one party, one people.” Fascists by and large hated and despised the conservatives, and the conservatives returned the compliment; it’s a matter of historical fact that the most diehard resistance Hitler’s regime faced, and the conspiracies that came closest to blowing Hitler himself to smithereens, all came straight out of the hardline aristocratic right wing of German society. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The bitter divide between fascists and conservatives, in fact, goes straight back to the origins of both movements. In a teasingly titled book, <i>Hitler as Philosophe</i>, Lawrence Birken showed in detail that the entire vocabulary of political ideas used by Hitler and the other ideologues of German national socialism came straight out of the same radical side of the Enlightenment that Edmund Burke critiqued so trenchantly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When Hitler ranted about the will of <i>das Volk</i>, for example, he was simply borrowing Rousseau’s notion of the general will of the people, which both men believed ought to be free from the pettifogging hindrance of mere laws and institutions. Examples could be multiplied almost endlessly, and matched nearly word for word out of Mussolini’s speeches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Despite the trope that fascism was a reversion to the Middle Ages, Hitler, Mussolini, and their fellow fascists were thoroughly modern figures pursuing some of the most avant-garde, cutting-edge ideas of their time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Point this out to most people nowadays, though, and you’re likely to get pushback along two lines. The first is the claim that fascism equals racial bigotry, and racial bigotry is a right-wing habit, thus fascism must be a right-wing movement. That argument gets what force it has from the astonishing levels of historical ignorance found in the United States these days, but it’s common, and needs to be addressed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Old-fashioned conservatism in the United States, as noted above, unquestionably had its racist side. South of the Mason-Dixon line, in particular, talk about local autonomy and resistance to edicts from Washington DC normally included a subtext favoring segregation and other policies meant to disadvantage Americans of African descent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That’s one consequence of the tangled and bitter history of race in America. It’s conveniently forgotten, however, that well into the twentieth century, the labor movement in the US was as heavily committed to racial exclusion as any collection of Southern good ol’ boys—keeping African-Americans out of the skilled trades, for example, was seen by many labor activists as essential to boosting the wages of white laborers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With embarrassingly few exceptions, racial prejudice was widely accepted straight across the American political scene until the convulsions of the 1960s finally pushed it into its present state of slow disintegration.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Elsewhere in the world, the notion that racial bigotry is purely a right-wing habit has even less support. Even to the extent that labels such as “left” and “right” apply to the n-dimensional continuum of competing political and economic viewpoints in the pre-Cold War era, racial prejudice, racial tolerance, and relative apathy on the subject were more or less evenly distributed among them. Fascist parties are a good sample of the whole. Some fascist regimes, such as Hitler’s, were violently racist. Others were not—Mussolini’s regime in Italy, for example, was no more racist or antisemitic than the democratic government it replaced, until Germany imposed its race laws on its ally at gunpoint. The easy equation of fascism with racism, and racism with contemporary American (pseudo)conservatism, is yet another example of the way that the complexities of politics and history get flattened out into a caricature in what passes for modern political discourse. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the first standard argument for fascism as a right-wing movement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The second is the claim that German national socialism was bought and paid for by big business, and therefore all fascism everywhere has to have been a right-wing movement. That’s an extremely common claim; you’ll find it splashed all over the internet, and in plenty of less evanescent media as well, as though it was a matter of proven fact. The only problem with this easy consensus is that it doesn’t happen to be true. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There have been two excellent scholarly studies of the issue, Pool and Pool’s <i>Who Financed Hitler?</i> (1978) and Turner’s <i>German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler</i> (1985). Both studies showed conclusively that the National Socialist German Workers Party got the vast majority of its financing from its own middle-class membership until the last year or two before it took power, and only then came in for handouts from business because most German businesses decided that given a choice between the two rising powers in the final crisis of the Weimar regime—the Nazis and the Communists—they would settle for the Nazis. In point of fact—and this can be found detailed in any social history of Germany between the wars—German big business by and large distrusted Hitler’s party, and bitterly resented the new regime’s policy of
<i>gleichschaltung</i>, “coordination,” which subjected even the largest firms to oversight and regulation by Party officials. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So where did the claim that fascism is always a puppet of big business come from? Like the use of “fascism” as a generic label for regimes liberals don’t like, it’s a third-hand borrowing from the Soviet propaganda of an earlier day. In the political theology of Marxism, remember, everything boils down to the struggle between capitalists and the proletariat, the two contending forces of the Marxist cosmos. Everything and everyone that doesn’t support the interests of the proletariat as defined by Marxist theory is therefore by definition a tool of the capitalist ruling class, and any political movement that opposes Marxism thus has to be composed of capitalist lackeys and running dogs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>QED!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
More broadly, communist parties have generally pitched themselves to the public by insisting that all other political movements work out in practice to a vote for the existing order of society. A useful bit of marketing in any context, it became a necessity once Stalin’s regime demonstrated just how unpleasant a communist regime could be in practice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Insisting that fascism is simply another name for what we’ve already got, though, had an enduring downside—it convinced a great many people, in the teeth of the evidence, that fascism by definition defends the status quo. The fact that Italian Fascism and German national socialism both rose to power promising radical change in their respective societies <i>and delivered on that promise</i> has been completely erased from the modern political imagination. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, the flattening out of American political thought into a linear spectrum from “the left” (the Democratic party, and the Communists who are presumed to be lurking in its leftward fringe) to “the right” (the Republican party, and the fascists who are presumed to have a similar hideout in the GOP’s rightward fringe) helps feed the same belief. Once all political thought has been forced onto that Procrustean bed of ideology, after all, if the fascists aren’t hiding out somewhere on the far end of the Republican half of the spectrum, where else could they be?</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s at this point that we approach the most explosive dimension of the history of fascism, because the unthinking acceptance of the linear model of politics presupposed by that question isn’t merely a problem in some abstract sense. It also obscures some of the most important dimensions of contemporary political life, in the United States and elsewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>According to that model, the point in the middle of the spectrum—where “left” and “right” fade into one another—is the common ground of politics, the middle of the road, where most people either are or ought to be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The further you get from that midpoint, the closer you are to “extremism.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(Think about that last word for a moment.) What happens, though, if the common ground where the two major parties meet and shake hands is far removed from the actual beliefs and opinions of the majority? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the situation we’re in today in America, of course. Americans may not agree about much, but a remarkably large number of them agree that neither political party is listening to them, or offering policies that Americans in general find appealing or even acceptable. Where the two major parties can reach a consensus—for example, in giving bankers a de facto amnesty for even the most egregious and damaging acts of financial fraud—there’s normally a substantial gap between that consensus and the policies that most Americans support. Where the parties remain at loggerheads, there are normally three positions: the Democratic position, the Republican position, and the position most Americans favor, which never gets brought up in the political arena at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s one of the pervasive occupational hazards of democratic systems under strain. In Italy before and during the First World War, and in Germany after it, democratic institutions froze up around a series of problems that the political systems in question were unwilling to confront and therefore were unable to address.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Every mainstream political party was committed to maintaining the status quo in the face of a rising spiral of crisis that made it brutally clear that the status quo no longer worked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One government after another took office, promising to make things better by continuing the same policies that were making things worse, while the opposition breathed fire and brimstone, promising fierce resistance to the party in power on every issue except those that mattered—and so, in both countries, a figure from outside the political mainstream who was willing to break with the failed consensus won the support of enough of the voters to shoulder his way into power. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style='font-family: Times; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode"; mso-fareast-language: #00FF; mso-font-kerning: .5pt'>When fascism succeeds in seizing power, in other words, it’s not a right-wing movement, or for that matter a left-wing one. It seizes the abandoned middle ground of politics, takes up the popular causes that all other parties refuse to touch, and imposes a totalitarianism of the center. That’s the secret of fascism’s popularity—and it’s the reason why an outbreak of full-blown fascism is a real and frightening possibility as America stumbles blindly into an unwelcome future. We’ll talk about that next week.</span></div>

The result might be a Confucian-style bureaucratic government like I described in my previous post, or a military junta. But neither of these things are the same as populist fascism. Rather, they may be the most savory alternative to a totalitarian regime.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c789923655737119668 title="comment permalink">2/19/14, 6:31 PM</a><br><br>

First, I figured out that there were a lot more of them. Second, I looked at the history of Communist vs. Fascist regimes. I can't think of a single successful indigenous Communist revolution that took place in a democracy. When the socialists take over a democracy, it looks like Sweden, not the U.S.S.R. Therefore, that wasn't going to happen to the U.S. On the other hand, I looked at all the fascist regimes and every one of them came out of a failed experiment with democracy. That could happen here.<br><br>Also, you're not alone among Peak Oil thinkers in expecting fascism in America's future. James Kunstler has been predicting for more than a decade that we'd elect maniacs who'd promise to allow us to keep our McMansions, cars, and commutes long after Peak Oil made all of them untenable. After a few years, he changed "maniacs" to "corn-pone Nazis led by a corn-pone Hitler." He's been looking for that "corn-pone Hitler" since. The last time he identified one, it was Sarah Palin. That turned out to be a false alarm; women historically don't become fascist dictators.

The man doesn’t hide his prejudices.<br><br>On an entirely different topic, you’re absolutely right that a simple linear model of Left vs. Right doesn’t fully describe political ideology. Calling that idea one-dimensional is both figuratively and literally true. The whole idea came out of the French Revolution and the seating of delegates with the conservatives on the right on the liberals on the left. That didn’t last, as the most radical group, the Montagnards, who unleashed the Reign of Terror, didn’t sit at either side, but instead high in the center. Given your description of fascism as a totalitarianism of the center, I find that quite fitting.<br><br>Now that I’m finished with the historical aside, I’ll point out that there are several models that incorporate two dimensions to describe ideology. The most famous is probably the Nolan Chart, which the Libertarians use. That one uses economic freedom and personal (non-economic) freedom as its two axes and has the advantage of separating three groups collectively considered the Right, libertarians, conservatives, and fascists. It will also map the fascists next to the communists as different kinds of Statists instead of at opposite corners.<br><br>The Political Compass is very similar, with an Authoritarian-Libertarian axis corresponding to personal freedom and a Left-Right axis corresponding to economic freedom. That will also separate out different political philosophies almost the same way that the Nolan Chart does. It also allows people to take tests to find their position and then graphs them on the chart. When done in the aggregate, it exposes a flaw in the model; the two axes are not independent of each other. There is a strong correlation between Authoritarianism and Right and Libertarianism and Left. There are relatively few people who score as Authoritarian Left or Libertarian Right; most fall on a main sequence that may as well be the traditional Right-Left axis, except that the Far Left is not Communist, at least as practiced in officially Communist countries, but Anarchist. That might be something to think about when one considers the failure of Left-leaning organizations during the past 30 years, something you wrote about during December 2012.<br><br>A third model is that of science fiction author and Ph.D. in Political Science Jerry Pournelle. In his dissertation, he came up with his own axes for what is now called the Pournelle chart--rational vs. irrational and acceptance or rejection of government authority. The rational vs. irrational dimension was basically a conservative vs. liberal dimension, with the conservatives being exactly as you described them, but also irrational. The liberals were the rational ones, as they were trying to do what you described the reformers doing by imposing an ideological model. Remember that Pournelle considers himself to be a conservative, so being irrational is not a bad thing to him, nor is being rational necessarily a good thing. The attitudes toward government would separate out the two authoritarian types (Communist and Fascist) from the two anarchist types (Libertarians and Anarchists) on opposite sides of the chart, with most political philosophies participating in democratic politics in the center of the chart.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c2046984638181901591 title="comment permalink">2/19/14, 8:24 PM</a><br><br>

There is another model that has the advantage of being derived empirically, DW-Nominate, which Voteview computes. That one takes the votes of U.S. Representatives and Senators and determines the independent axes that best describe their votes. Ever since the beginning of the Republic, there has been a Left-Right axis, with votes on the left being in favor of redistributive policies and those on the right being against redistributive policies. The second axis has changed over time. For most of U.S. history, it was about race relations, which supports your point about racism being independent of left and right. Since the 1970s, that version of the second dimension has collapsed into the first axis, with race-related issues also become economically redistributionist issues. That would also explain the current state of thinking about left vs. right and racism; now they are correlated. The second dimension is now about insider vs. outsider with the insiders in favor of the U.S. as an imperial power with all of the military, intelligence, and policing apparatus that entails, while the outsiders are questioning the idea of empire and think that the costs, both financial and social, are too much. That’s what united Ron Paul and Bernie Sanders, the most Right Representative and the most Left Senator, until Paul’s retirement last year.<br><br>That graph doesn't have the advantage of distinguishing Fascists, as there aren't any in Congress, but it will separate the libertarians from other Republicans and the populists from the Establishment Democrats. Based on what you wrote about advocating the abandoned center, maybe what DW-Nominate sees as the second dimension is starting to pick that up.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c5207070919730505463 title="comment permalink">2/19/14, 8:32 PM</a><br><br>

Society cannot exist, unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere; and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without.

While it is certainly true that <i>the conspiracies that came closest to blowing Hitler himself to smithereens, all came straight out of the hardline aristocratic right wing of German society</i>, one of the reasons for this was that those aristocrats could still move with realitve freedom once the Nazis were in power, and that they (as opposed to, say, communist groups) were able to get close enough to Hitler to even try.<br><br>Likewise, though it is certainly true that dynamic young men from the conservative aristocratic class who joined the SS were looked down on by their elders, it is rather telling that they were even there to be looked down on. <br><br>While young aristocrats were among the most valued members of the SS, you'd have to look pretty hard to find them in communist gatherings, and only slightly less hard to spot them amongst socialists.<br><br>The dynamics between Nazism and conservatism were more complicated than you seem to imply here.

I think they like to see themselves that way, but really? Not a chance. <br><br>DaShui, the frantic insistence that Hitler was crazy, that only the evil or the deluded could have followed him, blah blah blah, is driven by an attempt to forget just how plausible and convincing the man was in his own place and time. <br><br>Pinku-Sensei, what all those schemes leave out, to my mind, is the dimension I discussed in last week's post -- which class has its interests catered to? -- which can't be tracked by any simple linear scale or set of scales, since in any society there are a good many classes with their own distinct agendas. I may have to brood on that and propose my own scheme one of these days. <br><br>Bill, Weimar Germany was obsessively individualistic and fixated on fantasies of personal autonomy, too. It's an interesting detail of history that when a society swings to one extreme along that line (as well as many others), it can be vulnerable to flipping to the other extreme -- at least for a time. It takes sudden disruptions to cause that sort of snapping, but such things aren't exactly unlikely in the years ahead of us. <br><br>John, and there's also much to be said for scrapping the notion of "innovation" and asking instead "what actually works when it's tried?" There again, Burkean conservatism does remarkably well. The challenge, of course, is the need for individuals to tackle the very hard work of making themselves fit for liberty. <br><br>Paul, it's partly that, but remember also that fascist movements generally rise out of a general critique of their societies -- Hitler's followers didn't believe that Germany just needed a change of leaders, they felt that German society had to be transformed from top to bottom, and the totalitarian impulse came largely from that perception. <br><br>Bob, expect to get almost universal rejection.

You have definitely hit on something. It is interesting to me particularly since both my parents grew up in Nazi Germany and lived through WWII. My father actually used to equate fascism as the extreme right end of the political spectrum but actually thought of the political continuum as forming a circle where the extreme right and left (fascism and communism) met to complete the circle. In his mind they both eventually became practically equivalent forms of totalitarianism. His family was from the conservative, business, upper middle class side of the German society and easily melded into Hitler's new order. My mothers family on the other hand was involved in the arts, theater, and music and both her parents were artists and intellectuals. Her family did not enjoy or profit from the rise of the Nazis. They also helped some of their Jewish friends avoid the Nazis. So in that sense from my family history the Nazis definitely seemed more at home with what we would call conservative middle class society, than the liberal intellectuals and artists. Just some thoughts.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c7234386305679584511 title="comment permalink">2/19/14, 9:59 PM</a><br><br>

When the question of conservatism comes up (and I am a staunch conservative), I've often tried to present the supposed left-right spectrum instead as a conservative-progressive spectrum.<br><br>To my mind, the defining feature of conservatism, from Burke to today, is that we cannot escape human nature. The general structure of society that we see, even under various political systems, is an inevitable outcome of human nature writ large. Progressivism, on the other hand, is the idea that human nature is malleable, and that we could potentially become something other than we've been. They think that man a century from now could be a different creature than man a century ago.<br><br>To the progressive, the potential for utopia is high, but utopia isn't an easy thing to come by. Naturally, many of them tend toward totalitarianism as a simple matter of ideological consistency; you can't re-form man without changing every element of his environment. Gramsci was big on that idea and I think was simply articulating the general sense held by progressives.<br><br>To a conservative, of course, the potential to create a utopia is precisely zero, and so any new method (especially those that tend toward totalitarianism) presents nothing but a danger. Any traditional Christian is conservative almost by definition. The doctrine of original sin and concupiscence means that every society will have poor and rich, power-hungry politicians, thieves, murderers, and so on. The state can never be dismantled like the Communists hoped, and history bore that out.<br><br>I would agree that Fascism is not a conservative movement whatsoever, but rather a progressive one. If anything, the far-conservative boogeyman ought to be monarchy, or even borderline-theocracy. And for many decades both the Republicans and Democrats have been progressive parties. <br><br>But I disagree that Communism is also wrongly ascribed to the far left. It is the most extreme form of progressivism, the belief that progress to utopia is not only possible but inevitable. They depart from the Fabianists by believing that violent revolution is necessary, believe the Dictatorship of the Proletariat must rule the entire world, and essentially advocate totalitarian slavery for generations in order to create paradise. It really is the furthest you can take the progressive ideology. Of course, that doesn't mean that there are any large number of Communists in the US, but it's properly ascribed to the left/progressivists.<br><br>I agree that some form of authoritarianism is a danger in the US, though I'd bet against fascism in particular. The best hope against that, in my opinion, is a return to states' rights. It's a long-shot, but when the debt crisis finally reaches its end-game, we'll have a window for real change. I hope the pendulum is swinging in our direction, then.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c1633155089283119077 title="comment permalink">2/19/14, 10:04 PM</a><br><br>

Interesting read.<br><br>A book of modern philosophy I’m currently reading seems to equate fascism with nihilism. There may be something to this, especially if, as I think you are saying, fascism lacks a distinct philosophy or program. The fascist/nihilist would then believe in nothing except what was expedient. Nothing except a will to power? After all, the attributes you list from Ernst Nolte hardly add up to a platform; they appear to be more of an attitude or a style of governance, not a belief system. A fascist regime could use the Old Testament or Das Kapital for inspiration as long as it met Nolte’s requirements.<br><br>Looking forward to next week.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c9178259927297889074 title="comment permalink">2/19/14, 10:07 PM</a><br><br>

I find that period between the wars to be a very confusing time to try to get a handle on; I suppose it was even more confusing for the people living through it. <br><br>I'm also reminding myself that we are probably talking about people who are still children and very young adults now, when we talk about the people who might ditch individualism, Jesus, and conservatism in exchange for promises of something better than stagnant creeping poverty and decay. I think about folks here talking about their traditional "Southern Ways," and these young dudes don't seem to view these "Ways" as anything deeper than beer, trucks, guns, and fishing. I don't think most of them even know the history of that "red flag" they get tattooed on their necks and why it makes some people queasy.

A lot of conservatives joined Nazi organisations during the 20s and 30s because of the shared enemies (Communism, Liberalism etc.), only to find out later that this didn't square with their traditional elitist and/or Christian views. In some cases, this lead to a cautious retreat into what some of them termed "inner emigration", in others, to actual resistance.<br>However, this doesn't mean conservatives simply wanted to go back to the old days of Christian Europe. If you look at the political ideas of the Kreisau Circle, the conservative network behind Stauffenberg's assassination attempt, you will find that they pretty much resembled Franco's Spain, i.e. a more or less totalitarian state without too much racism and aggressive imperialism, but with strong links to the Christian tradition. There were even some elements of democracy, but without universal suffrage. The basic idea was "something has gone awfully wrong since the French revolution, and we need to fix it", but the proposed solutions contained old elements as well as new ones.<br><br>A little note on "Gleichschaltung", the usual English translations do not really cover its meaning. "gleich" means "alike" and "Schaltung" is something you do with a "Schalter", i.e. a "switch", and it also means "electrical circuit". So, the image conveyed here is that of a national bureaucracy as some kind of a giant switchboard that is used to influence the "wiring" of society in a way that brings all of the latter's elements "into line", emphasizing the totalitarian aspects.

There's one thing that seems to me to be missing from your analysis, and that's the Spanish Civil War. <br><br>As you've pointed out, National Socialism differed from Italian fascism, though it was certainly inspired by it in many ways. Franco's Falange and the Carlists were neither fascist nor national socialist; they were a European paleo-conservatism of the Church, army and aristocracy, of the sort you describe this week.<br><br>Nevertheless, when they overthrew the Popular Government, the only help the democratically-elected Republicans received was from the Soviet Union and Mexico; the European democracies turned their backs. This turned civil war into 'a battle against world communism', which brought in Germany and Italy. <br><br>Italy, as you pointed out was the original and prestigious fascism; it also had the military reputation at that point, having been militarily victorious in Libya and Ethiopia. <br><br>It was natural, then, for the European left to bundle all three movements together under the term 'fascists', and I suspect this has much to do with the widespread use of the term for a range of 'rightist' movements. The Falange may not have been technically fascists, but the Italian troops fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with them were.<br><br>Regarding your comments about Mussolini's regime not having the prejudices of national socialism, I came across an interesting <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Libya_as_Italian_colony#Mussolini_and_Libya rel=nofollow>element on Wikipedia</a>: <i>By 1934, Libya was fully pacified and the new Italian governor Italo Balbo started a policy of integration between the Libyans and the Italians, that proved fully successful. Indeed in 1939, laws were passed that allowed Muslims to be permitted to join the National Fascist Party and in particular the Muslim Association of the Lictor (Associazione Musulmana del Littorio), and the 1939 reforms allowed the creation of Libyan military units within the Italian army</i>. <br><br>In Germany, as you've noted, there was a widespread anti-semitism, in common with much of northern Europe at that time. According to various sources I've read, though, what made the Nazis so extreme in this area was the early involvement in the party of Baltic Germans, who had been the aristocratic rulers of the Baltic states for centuries until dispossessed and driven out following the Russian revolutions. They brought with them their sense of German racial supremacy, along with late-Tsarist attitudes towards the Jews and Bolsheviks...<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c3437176425064620547 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 12:34 AM</a><br><br>

I'm hoping a blogger account (in the greater service of the post-peak writing challenge) will help!<br><br>This latest series on fascism (and even facism ...) has really underlined the bankruptcy of recent political discourse - hardly any of the labels applied are accurate today, distorted either by self-delusion or demonisation of opponents.

The degree to which this is deliberately cultivated is a fascinating conjecture. <br><br>Anyway, I've had to rethink exactly what it is I believe fascism to be, and more to the point - if it isn't what I thought it was (exactly), then what has it been that I've found so scary in some kinds of politics?<br><br>I've always held the hallmarks of fascism/nazism etc to be: extreme nationalism, charismatic leadership, militarism, authoritarianism, 'social Darwinism'/eugenics, irrational scapegoating, intellectual/ideological uniformity (preferably on as low a level of sophistication as possible), and finally populism.<br><br>I think what we need to be wary of in particular: anti-intellectualism, simple solutions to complex problems, group identities (either positive like 'patriotism' or negative scapegoating).<br><br>@Bill Pulliam - I don't hold out so much hope for your gun-totin', Bible-waving, autonomous neighbours as a bastion against fascism. I think any culture that can lynch can be swayed to fascism*. Fascists are like Rosicrucians in that they 'adopt the habit of the country' - all they need to do is weave a narrative in which their constituents' right to wield those guns and Bibles are threatened, sprinkle a little anti-intellectualism, and hey presto there's your new party militia.<br><br>@Ventriloquist - re Ukraine...

On one occassion, someone started a thread about fascism and how fascists come to power; I took part in the discussion and related some of the memories told to me by my grandfather, who was born in 1925 and fought in the second world war. (I'm Austrian, so my grandfather, who was conservative in the continental European sense, was drafted into the Wehrmacht in 1943.)<br><br>As soon as it became clear that, as someone from a country with first-hand experience in fascism, I had some sort of "expert status" on the topic, people wanted to know how an ideology as extreme as fascism could have possibly come to power in Germany and other parts of Europe. I told them more or less the same things JMG has described in this week's posting, because basically that's what's taught in school here. That caused quite a stir. Back then I didn't really understand why, but now, after having read JMG's post, I begin to grasp how oversimplified political views seem to be in the USA. I also explained the concept of "militant democracy" (wehrhafte Demokratie) on which the constitutions of many continental European countries were based in the wake of the second world war.<br><br>But I digress; what really amazed me were the reactions once I made the "mistake" to suggest that no country and no people, including the USA, are immune to the lure of totalitarianism under the right circumstances. I presented my opinion that in the Great Depression of the 1930s, the USA might already have gotten uncomfortably close to fascism (again, that's not a conclusion I came to on my own, but rather what I learned in school).<br><br>The result was an uproar that eventually got me banned from the forum. Americans, most participants in the discussion proclaimed, are by nature democratic, individualistic and capitalist (why these three concepts were viewed as an inseparable whole is still beyond me). An especially fervent supporter of innate American democracy explained to me that basically, Americans were simply mentally superior to the rest of the world – he based that assumption on the fact that many Nobel laureates are Americans – and would thus never, ever deviate from democracy. When I repeatedly questioned his "reasoning", suggested that it bordered on racism, and warned that exactly this sort of thinking – "it can never happen here, we're an advanced, civilized country" – was prevalent in interwar Germany before the rise of the nazis, I finally got banned – from a forum proclaiming free speech!<br><br>Make of that what you will, but in my opinion, it doesn't bode well. And that was almost 18 years ago.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c7300419382739417872 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 3:57 AM</a><br><br>

Moreover, I think a strong case can be made that this financial and political support was a necessary condition for the ultimate success in Nazism in gaining all-encompassing power over German society. That is, the Nazis would not have ultimately succeeded in attaining and maintaining their hold upon absolute political power in Germany WITHOUT the support of big business as a junior partner in the enterprise.<br><br>This state of affairs underscores both the crucial historical role of big business in paving the way for the worst excesses of Nazism, and their moral bankruptcy in so doing. Ultimately, all big business cared about (as usual) was their bottom line, and so they proved reluctantly willing to enter into what ultimately proved to be a devil's bargain with the Nazis with the aim of securing that bottom line. Any private moral misgivings that the agents of big business may have had in entering into an alliance with the Nazis mattered nothing in the end. <br><br>As a result, big business wound up playing a crucial role as the junior partner in one of the most egregiously monstrous regimes of the 20th century. Yet, those egregious monstrosities might have been avoided had big business placed certain basic moral considerations ahead of its own bottom line in deciding how to deal with the Nazis.<br><br>With big business remaining arguably the single most powerful concentration of power on today's social-political scene, I think it is important not to overlook or minimize the role of big business as an indispensable, albeit junior, partner in the Nazi rise to power, as well as the Nazi's ultimately destructive exercise of that power (e.g.: IBM eagerly supplied the punch-card machine systems that undergirded the notorious administrative efficiency of the Nazi death camps).<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c9169936582268113236 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 4:48 AM</a><br><br>

But that does require the patience to actually sit there, and not interfere too much.<br><br>It's now my personal disposition, but only after years of seeing grand schemes, and several of my own temporary enthusiasms for such schemes, come to crashing down, as they were always going to.<br><br>I've been doing part-time work in New York quite a bit recently, taking the train in along the Connecticut coast line, and coming into the city.

There's a very consistent populist critique/diagnosis about corruption in this society (the US) that appeals to people all over the political spectra. And when the appeal of the duopoly parties consists of, "Our guy stinks, but at least he's not as bad as their guy," the door is left wide open for a political entrepreneur to make a play.

(Internationally based finance had seriously got it wrong). That option for our democracies could seem unlikely in the 21stC, perhaps? Is there a ‘right’ economics so handily available?<br><br>But the defining features in inter-war years for Europe were not just economic. There had been the 1914 war.<br><br>Of course, the military build-up in the geopolitical context before 1914 had been very noticeable, even as the actual result was unimaginable beforehand. For example, three old Empires and their rationale disappeared across Europe and Middle East and a lot else went with them, and the previously hegemonic global-trading British Empire was no longer in ascendant contention.<br><br> Nationalism, a powerful 19thC concept of organisation, was more seriously than ever up-for-grabs and re-invention, and there was an enticing landmass already with a long-standing ethnic German Diaspora. <br><br>But perhaps more importantly, the sheer power of the mad military machine and its massacres had destabilised ordinary personal expectation: modernisation had led to disintegration and dead ends. Modernisation though could not be abandoned: it was too relentlessly competitive.<br> <br>I wrote the following as part of a small essay of my own last week. <br>“Modernism ached to be re-engineered according to the will – violent energies could create new machines. And violence own reward created new energy out of thin air. Totalitarian-welded violence sees no limitations – anything is possible. Why not encompass a whole obedient nation? … The scientific method is enlisted to make reality of fantasy. And the national will can find endless enemies to fight - and total war. “<br>I ended by saying:<br>“Pogroms had been a feature across central and Eastern Europe but not in Germany. Being good modern Germans, Jews could not understand the defining role being assigned to them in the violent imagination.<br><br>I do not understand America. Your violence has seen extreme episodes in my lifetime – talking of mad machines - and is internally chronic. But is it equivalent to the 1914 watershed?

The Germans were in no position in 1938 to impose them at gunpoint.<br><br> It has always puzzled me why Mussolini did it, since he had at least one Jewish mistress, and initially most of the Fascists were not anti-semitic. After his invasion of Abyssinia (Ethiopia), Mussolini became isolated within Europe, and he fell more into the wake of Hitler - even though he had opposed Hitler's attempted overthrow of the Austrian government in 1934, when the Austrian Nazis assassinated the Austrian chancellor Dollfuss.<br><br>From what I have read, Mussolini became angered by the increasing protests of foreign Jews against his regime - they rightly associated Fascism with its Nazi allies - so decided to hit back. Some of Mussolini's more moderate(!) Fascists apparently complained at the time that Italy's Jews were suffering because of the deeds of foreign Jews. To their credit, most Italians, whether civilian, military or police, actively obstructed those laws. Only after the Nazis had set up Mussolini in the puppet-state of the Italian Social Republic (in Northern Italy) in September 1943 were Mussolini and his Italians really at their mercy, and the Jews suffered accordingly.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c4827761731464595466 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 5:45 AM</a><br><br>

For years I have tried to explain to my acquaintances from all political persuasions how simplistic, dualistic and limiting the concept of a left/right linear spectrum really is. I've also tried to explain that what they call “conservative” is not what conservative used to mean. I suggest that many of those who call themselves “conservatives” today have no intention of conserving anything. They should be called “preservatives” because their main motivation is preserving the status quo. This post brought to light a few new historical threads I had not stumbled across until now.<br><br>As Cherokee Organics wrote: “Conservatism in the traditional sense of the meaning is an advantage too in fragile ecosystems in that it avoids novel responses which can ultimately harm the environment,” I have often explained that Nature in general is extremely conservative over long periods of geologic time once ecosystems have evolved to a climax community and changes only when a major change in the environment requires it. Then it often does so fairly rapidly (i.e. Gould and Eldredge's Punctuated Equilibrium.)<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c1429107911377992392 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 6:36 AM</a><br><br>

Kunstler is probably not too far off in that energy and resource constraints will mean many will fear for their comforts, privileges, luxuries and entertainment, and so those who offer hope they can keep them will win favor. <br><br>Of course, the resource limits are real, but real problems are the key that allows the manipulators an advantage, and in recent years that has manifested in a great concentration of wealth and power. So one could make things appear to be less dire than they are by reversing that concentration, but only by taking on today's wealth and power. If some social/ethnic/religious grouping could be identified among them to separate them from the “regular people”, then this would be the tool – and of course this has been done before and looks to be repeatable. I have thought for some time that such a backlash is inevitable. <br><br>It will be interesting and possibly useful, if unpleasant, to anticipate the characteristics of what such a totalitarianism of the center will be. Given the real resource constraints, I suspect it will not be as broadly inclusive as some may have been in the past.<br><br>Oh, and your Burkean sympathies have leaked out before (no criticism implied) – it is at least a unique view in modern American political landscape. I think the challenge for anyone is to evaluate any of the political traditions of the 20th century in a frame that does not include boundless growth and cheap and abundant energy, and consider how viable it is in a lower energy, lower complexity, no growth world. Thus, disputes about how to distribute the spoils of industrial society become obsolete when there are no spoils, and different organizations become preferable.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c4561103572301979405 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 6:52 AM</a><br><br>

In such a climate concepts like freedom, the law and democracy may no longer be important. Freedom and democracy do not feed you or keep you warm. It such an environment the prophet who promises bread may find it easy to get elected and sweep the democratic parties aside. If you start getting bread in your mouth you might not care that democracy has gone down the drain and might welcome the opportunity to take your anger out on some scapegoats. Many of us are still leading fairly middle class life styles. From this perspective it may be difficult to realize how desperate we might become in the future.<br><br>There is still a lot that we could in theory do to mitigate the effects of peak oil. This will not stop us from getting poorer, but it may prevent us from reaching the stage of desperation where we are happy to wave democracy goodbye. If people think that they are doing something constructive about the situation then they may be prepared to bear a lot of sacrifices, just like Britain did during the Second World War. This may be enough to preserve a democratic system. However the real danger comes when nothing constructive is being done about the situation. That’s when people may become disillusioned and will vote in the prophet who promises us bread. The tragedy is that the prophet may be a lot worse than the useless democrats he expels from office. The situation in Germany in 1932 was bad, but this was nothing compared to how bad it was in 1945. We may find that turning our anger on the scapegoats was just another distraction from the real problems that we face and that we have only made things worse. However if we have got rid of democracy we will find that we cannot get rid of the prophet and there will be nothing we can do about it..<br><br><br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c2269778013535084515 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 7:03 AM</a><br><br>

The vitriolic speeches, the sinister uniforms and the one, strong leader are all part of that cliche and I don't regard them as the essential components of that movement. At the core of fascism is the notion that it is the only solution left, the best of a bad lot. It rose when the public and its leaders were exhausted; tired of the struggle to fix what seemed unfixable and unwilling to take responsibility to make very hard choices. Weimar Germany was essentially the last gasp of even a moderate effort to solve problems by some honourable process. It didn't occur to anyone at the time to make an effort to fix the existing structure; it was either Nazism or Communism. The public and leaders gave up, essentially taking the selfish route; "make it stop hurting for me, let someone else pay". Kind of like suicide. Fascism is an apex predator; a high energy state that requires a healthy ecosystem to feed from. Nazi Germany failed primarily due to a lack of energy. The modern notion of the "one world government" (which I regard as code for global fascism) has become an obsolete concept that we don't have the energy and resources for. We may see some of the cliche fascist states being created as the world fragments but that's speculation not particularly relevant to current affairs. You see I regard America and the rest of the 1st world (who follow the same capitalist methods) to have been fascist for some time. The American way of life is the apex predator of our time and the general notion of the global public, not just Americans, is that there is nothing out there that is better and so no real action to solve our many problems will be taken. In our case though there is no "enemy" who will take us to task; the rapid depletion of resources and exponential growth of climate change will sort things out.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c8759071594854687986 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 8:45 AM</a><br><br>

It would probably have to "wrap itself in the flag and carry the cross," like folks on the Left expect. But it wouldn't be the caricature Republican from Bumbleturkey spouting off about "job creators." I haven't read much of Mr. Hitler, but I do recall reading a couple of his speeches, and he spent as much time ranting against "capitalists" and "bankers" as anything else. I have a feeling that we were almost at the point in 2008-2009 where a movement that began with bankers as its scapegoat might have taken power... I remember hitchhiking through Oregon as the Tea Party was beginning. I got a ride with some typical Douglas County rednecks-- and (at the time I was a typical leftist-anarchist) I was shocked to find we agreed on a great deal. If anything, they were more anti-military than I was (because they thought the government was responsible for 9/11). They were all psyched about the Tea Party. <br><br>So maybe 2009 was too early. The crisis hit, and it got two responses: The Tea Party from the "right" and the Occupy movement from the "left." One got into power but failed to change anything; the other just failed. What that suggests to me is that when the next crisis comes, if it comes soon enough for 2008 to not have disappeared into the American memory-hole... when the next round of bailouts comes, there may be a sense that the right-left paradigm has failed. That might open the way for a third option, which seems to be " talking common sense, just in a somewhat strident tone." <br><br><br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c7974149309706208239 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 8:45 AM</a><br><br>

I am sorry to say that it makes all too much sense. A lot of what you have said in the last two posts I feel like I already knew, some of it no doubt from small remarks sprinkled through the ADR archives.<br><br>http://thejuniperlog.blogspot.com/2014/02/land-of-free.html<br>I hope its not improper to post this entry again closer to the front end of comments, fishing for commentary.<br><br>Though I would have changed a couple things in it in light of this weeks post, namely more focus on what aspects of our era could be sharply rejected by potential Totalitarians. But the story works as it is, maybe a different experiment on the theme will follow the completion of this series.<br><br>Any thoughts on what parts of our decadent are likely to be forcefully changed by a totalitarian experiment. <br><br>Also, stuck with alot of politically dubious projects rising and falling any ideas on how to avoid getting on the wrong side of a dangerous party line, and how to foster something comparatively sane? Right now it seems to be fostering virtues in the self and among kith, and trying to lie low politically, so those virtues don't get marched out into some wasteland work project to decompose in an unmarked swale.<br><br>The thing I have seen which most frightens me at the moment is alot of folks talking about being more... 'spiritually progressed' than others, who just need to be 'helped along'. Maybe it is a danger of living too close to the Principality of Boulder. <br><br>I think too many work about a crazed government defending our wealthy way of life, but that's what we already have, the Reagan Dynasty it could be usefully titled. Certainly they support the upper-most classes graft to an embarrassing degree, but most Americans also get a much larger bribe than is polite to mention. When that bribe check can't be cashed the Dynasty is nearing its end.<br><br>What comes next doesn't feel like a more serious Corporately my kith fear. Instead I suggest an imposed and self righteous austerity as more likely, all doing our part toward the shared goal of what ever. Austerity has alot to speak in favor of it of course, the challenge is implementation that isn't too hot headed (I am mad at tat group, lets hurt them) or cold hearted (That group's survival is not cost effective, they must pass on).<br><br>Of course the details are vague to me, what my current interest is in what can be done to make sure that such a potential monoculture of values doesn't end up stamping out the usefulness of dissensions. How to protect dissensious and the potentially worth while works from being crushed before they have had a reasonable chance to be tested on their own merits? Resource limits of course will impose much pruning with out the help of Groupism, but retarding the hands which would go further with that pruning than our material predicaments require is an interesting problem.<br><br>I suspect old fashion human virtues, fostered in individuals are the best thing, but also an unlikely one on a national scale. The courage and wisdom of individuals and groups protecting what they find beautiful and worth while in the world, may be the most effective thing currently within grasp.<br><br>Who here would hazard the ire of a murderous government to protect something great from extinction? People like that have passed forward some of the finest heritages of human culture.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c7720744417965386766 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 10:46 AM</a><br><br>

That is our situation now with problems a-plenty that our leadership cares not to confront or acknowledge. With such a commitment to the tried and untrue things can only get worse. <br><br>But in a culture of manufactured consent where a thirty second T.V. spot has more social sway then ten thousand well written internet blog articles and homeland security is ready to respond on any threat to homeland security how can any figure from outside the political mainstream emerge? So far the tightening ratchet of our creeping crumble is slow enough that an amnesia of a short term public attention span kicks in. The eroding crumble of life plods on un-noticed. The fantasy of things eventually getting better with enough time and enough inaction continues to dominate public thought and is encouraged.<br><br>The problems mainstream parties refuse to touch could engender popularity if such problems could be discussed but full-blown media control will not allow this to happen. An outbreak of a fascist alternative is impossible without a real and influential free press. Something our already fascist state has quietly done away with and will not allow any more. Only the pretence of its former self remains.<br><br>The totalitarian dimension, central to a fascist organization, we have now. Management of consent is carefully orchestrated by media and numerous three letter government agencies already exist to effectively keep dissent repressed and hidden from public view. America once rich with counter-culture is for the most part fully homogenized now with acceptable and unacceptable modes of behaviour well defined.<br><br>I don't see how any change is possible. I don't see an outbreak of full-blown fascism as a real and frightening possibility for America. Modern electronics and computers have made its emergence impossible.<br><br>I'll be looking forward to next week for you to describe how an outbreak of full-blown fascism is a real possibility as America bumbles and stumbles blindly into the unwelcome future.

We live in New England, in an 130-year-old house which is interesting but unfortunately, not very energy efficient.<br><br>It's refreshing to see Burke mentioned. I first learned of him from Russell Kirk, probably one of the last true American conservatives. I was introduced to Kirk was reading his ghost stories, which are excellent, by the way.<br><br>It seems to me one can apply the Burkean "proven to work" rationale to religion as well. For thousands of years cultures around the world followed polytheistic, pagan religions for the most part. Then monotheism (primarily Christianity)arrived, promising to usher in a new world, make everyone equal, etc. These wonderful visions justified, of course, the forced conversions of entire cultures that followed.

I'll propose an alternative view down the road a bit. <br><br>Fielder, I'd disagree with the idea that fascism is inherently nihilistic, though it's a viewpoint that was ably defended by Hermann Rauschning among others. Rather, you're quite correct in suggesting that it's a style of governance rather than a specific ideology -- the same is true, please note, of monarchism, and of many other political stances. <br><br>SP, are you defining the success of a fascist movement based on how successful it was in invading other nations? Hmm. By that measure Mussolini's regime was an equivocal success at best, as it got its rump handed to it repeatedly when it tried to invade anything but Third World nations. <br><br>Mister R., good. Are you familiar with the concept of competitive exclusion in ecology? <br><br>Bill, exactly. If past parallels are anything to go by, for what it's worth, I'd expect to see an American fascism catch on first among college students and unemployed vets, then start gathering support from the downwardly mobile middle classes, and only in its final stages start getting mass support from your neck of the woods. <br><br>Steve, funny. Petraeus might be the General Ludendorff of today's Weimar America, I suppose. <br><br>Bernd, thanks again for the grammatical notes! You're quite right, of course, but I used the standard English translation for the sake of clarity. <br><br>Bogatyr, granted, and I could also have brought in the other European fascist parties, Peronism, etc. Every successful fascist movement drew its ideology from the beliefs and opinions that were popular in its own culture, which is one of the reasons it's so easy for people these days to use it as a content-free snarl word. As for German antisemitism, while the role of the Baltic Germans is important, there's also the simple fact that Hitler was deeply into that kind of thinking himself. That's one of the reliable problems with dictatorship: whatever delusions your dictator has will get imposed on everyone else, usually at gunpoint. <br><br>Tony, charismatic leadership, ideological uniformity, and populism are certainly features of successful fascist movements; there's also the cultivation of emotion in place of thought, which of course is standard practice in any kind of rabblerousing (consider the use of such content-free slogans as "hope" and "change" in the Obama campaign of 2008). Since, to borrow another reader's formulation, fascism is more a style of governance than an ideology, it can stretch to embrace whatever happens to be fashionable in the society where it takes root -- populism, after all, tends to focus on what's popular...<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c3662810048981199422 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 1:31 PM</a><br><br>

It is true that nazis somewhat despised conservatives, nationalsocialist rethoric was in fact quite fond of slapping the "reactionary" label on things it disliked and adding the volk or revolutionary label to things it liked. The large majority of conservatives was however so happy with what the nazis and fascists delivered, such as the destruction of communist organizations or the strenghtening of the hyerarchical principle, that they were willing to get along with them, when not groveling at their feet;that long range nazi goals would result in the destruction of traditional Germany in favor of some racial fantasyland was something they were eager to overlook. <br>The italian fascists had power handed to them on a silver platter by traditional conservative forces, starting from the King himself, without that support they would have gone nowehere (whenever they actually ran afoul of law enforcement they were badly beaten); the german case as far as I can tell differed mostly in details. <br><br>The generals opposition to Hitler had relatively little to do with some principled Burkeian stand against tyranny. It was the chilling (well founded as it turned out) fear of a losing war that mostly drove people like Beck into amateurish plotting in the late 30's. Some eventually got disgusted by the mass murders or some aspects of the regime but it was far from universal, Stülpnagel got along with the Einsatzgruppen, Nebe (who was supposed to kill Himmler) had commanded one. Some had baser motives, such as having been snubbed for promotions or what not. Even Stauffenberg, who was perhaps the best of the lot had hardly batted an eyelid when the Army got Rohm's head in 1934 gangster style (that it came along with Schleicher's hardly warranted concern it seems). <br>It is hardly a coincidence that they did not really get their act together until 1944, when the sentence "the sky is falling" could have a literal meaning in Germany. In a genuinely totalitarian society,as it was Germany at that point, where merely making a joke about Hitler could result in a trip to the guillotine with perhaps a detour to the torture room, the military was simply the only entity left with the organization and the means to seize power away from a leadership bent on a suicidal course.

A few suggestions:<br>Get a theater program from the time and look up the ads (desires and dreams of people).<br>Try to forget what came later and rather think about what happened in the last 13 years (or last few elections).

Even though his style will greatly suffer under translation there's enough left content wise.

I'm surprised that in all this chitchat about authoritarianism and totalitarianism, no one's mentioned one of the cultural ear-tags of fascist and fascist-style movements: gender anxiety. most of these movements embody a lot of anxiety about some kind of "rot" in society as reflected in a loosening of gender (as well as race) taxonomy and enforcement, and promise to return us all to the Good Old Days when [White] Men Were Men and everyone else knew their place. in majority Black or Asian cultures you can, of course, replace the race label as needed, but the gender revanchism seems pretty consistent.<br><br>Weimar was remarkable in being a more "advanced" cultural era, in terms of tolerance for gender nonconformity, gayness, etc (not to mention such dangerous things as Abstract Art, gosh) than any Anglo era after it until maybe the 70's in N America. the Nazis promised to set that right, to restore "order", outlaw homosexuality, and restore women to their rightful and secondary place in society.

I suspect that to some future humanity looking back at us -- may we survive that long and have the leisure for historical research -- we may sound a lot like mediaeval thinkers debating about maximum angelic concentration on pinheads.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c8157170763281560332 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 2:50 PM</a><br><br>

It may not really be practical for larger groups but I have some hope the guys at liquid-democracy are working something out for that.<br><br>Usually at some point shortly after a "left/right fubar" is reached people bring up customs and values.<br>In my view moral high ground cannot be attained by a custom per se (maybe one exception) but by values. Of course you can ascribe value to a custom (Burke reasoning) and kind of convert it into "the value of tradition" (not withstanding you can turn this argument around as well, seeing that we are not wearing loincloths and fur).<br><br>This leaves us with a list of values. In my experience any self respecting list of values is at odds with itself. <br>Also it so happens that very, very many of the fundamental terms we use are wide open to interpretation. Before things get too abstract I'll use an example:<br><br>List of values:<br>Survival <br>Reason<br>Freedom<br>Diversity<br>Transcendence<br><br>I could easily imagine a conflict between "diversity" and "reason". For example there is a much more efficient way to manage a food garden than is being done by most. Yet I see value in the fact that people do things differently.<br>Or what is currently practiced as "liberté" and "égalité" in France may not be free of conflict from a US perspective. <br>"Survival" and "freedom" are in conflict with regard to abortion.<br>It may not only be context, but over historical periods meanings are also perceived differently.<br>"Survival" can illustrate some fuzziness nicely. <br>What is to survive? <br>Me? My genes? My kid's dreams? My kid's best friend's dreams? My family's culture(s)? My list of values? My reasoning? Industrial society? Or our ecosystem?<br><br>The priorities of values typically also vary from issue to issue. Early abortion vs late abortion vs war vs supermarket meat. Decisions fall here and there even though you may be fascist or liberal. It often is very different if the issue affects mostly one individual, or a diverse group. <br>This ultimately makes the axes bend or the n-dimensional space stretch. Possibly this rather wild curvature of the axes is what really contains the significant information though. This would the necessary background info in a political debate. For practical purposes though, I would say a short form code that covers a dozen hot button issues will suffice quite often. <br>I've tried interpreting religious scriptures in this context but it didn't get me very far. Maybe that is because the words and concepts have blurred too much over time. If I had to write my political program and was not aware of shifts in meaning I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up with something Sharia-like.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c266985027135096094 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 3:38 PM</a><br><br>

Most of my reading focused on the economic troubles of the hyper-inflation of the 1920s. Your insight that the National Socialist party was essentially populist/centerist is a major missing piece of the puzzle. Thank you for that. <br><br>Have you read or heard of a book called "Diary of a Man in Despair" by Friedrich Reck? It's the diary of a conservative in your sense of the word - someone who values traditions because they generally work - in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. If the diary is authentic, it agrees with your view that the conservatives were the ones who hated the Nazis the most - at least in the early days before everyone hated them. As an aside he has a great quote about what cars have done to society: "Gasoline, as the basis for all motorized happiness, has contributed more to the inner decay of mankind than alcohol" -written in 1937.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c148839255940352769 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 3:55 PM</a><br><br>

At least not of the absolute domination model exemplified by the USSR and Germany. I see it more along the lines of India, circa 1975, where Delhi and a few other cities were dominated by parliament and Congress Party but the rest of the country, especially the south, was under the rule of other parties and factions. Even if the US does harden at the centre I can't see such a system lasting for more than a couple of years before corruption and regionalism start to break it down. The universal state in the US is fragile and without the imperial drum, which our generation seems fairly inoculated against, it can't hold. Of course as Bill says, who knows what will happen with the next generation.<br><br>By the way I'm supporting your prediction for a hiccup in the economy this year. Those points that ventriloquist brought up are just a handful of issues that are going to strain the system. Add in the beginning of Pakistan's counter-insurgency efforts, the upcoming US elections, and the instability in Thailand and we're going to see the boat being shaken. One really interesting note is that those droughts that are popping up all over the place are pushing governments to use desalination technologies, which are massively energy expensive as you all know. If the energy producing states start redirecting their supplies toward producing drinking water for their citizens it's gonna tighten the energy markets something fierce. <br><br>Gah, I was hoping to get my article on the rise of the right-wing in Europe done today but looks like it'll take at least another day.

Many thanks!<br><br>Fidelius, it's precisely because most Americans think they're invulnerable to fascism that a fascist movement is so likely here. They'll have no problem at all convincing themselves that the movement they join isn't fascist, despite the banners, armbands, and prison camps, since after all, this is America and it can't happen here! <br><br>Has anybody else reading this, by the way, ever read -- or even heard of -- Sinclair Lewis' novel <i>It Can't Happen Here</i>? I may just have to make that required reading...<br><br>Richard, I take it you're not a businessman. Their opinion tends to be different. <br><br>Johannes, I beg to differ -- Hitler's regime wasn't dependent on the big industrialists at all. If any of them tried to pressure the regime, they'd have had their corporations seized by the SS -- which ended up with a huge industrial empire of confiscated enterprises by the latter part of the war -- or simply handed over to somebody more reliable. As for social conservatism, that's another matter -- but social and political conservatism are not at all the same thing. <br><br>Nestorian, as I just noted to Johannes, big business wasn't a junior partner in the Nazi system -- it did what it was told or it got expropriated. Did those who did what they were told rake in big profits? Of course -- like any successful dictator, Hitler knew that rewarding loyalty is at least as important as punishing dissent. As I've noted in discussing contemporary America, profiting from the system and controlling the system are not the same things...<br><br>Yupped, I think it's a philosophy as well as a disposition -- though the same is true of every other approach. As for the uniforms, they won't be the same kind of uniforms, to be sure. Stay tuned!<br><br>Nathan, as I've indicated, I disagree -- and I think a definition of fascism that focuses on a surface issue, such as militarism, misses the deeper dynamic we're likely to see in the American future. <br><br>Andy, exactly. The elites forget that the levers of power they're pulling depend on the implicit obedience of a lot of people who don't share their values or goals at all.<br><br>Phil, 1914 hasn't quite arrived yet, so no, that watershed still has to be crossed. It's after that, I think, that the armbands will come out.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c1896402049742790392 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 4:31 PM</a><br><br>

Hitler's Germany had no shortage of first-rate scientists; the believers in intelligent evil don't need to be scientists when they can hire scientists. <br><br>Ice Torch, he did it because by 1938, Mussolini's regime was internationally isolated and increasingly aware of the rise of the Nazi colossus to its north. The 1938 race laws were an attempt to placate Hitler -- yes, you could as well call it appeasement, as that was a popular term that year. Nor, of course, was anti-Semitism enforced German style until the Germans actually occupied the Italian peninsula. <br><br>Nathan, I think Long could well have become America's Mussolini, except that Roosevelt beat him to it. <br><br>Mortal, yes, I know -- a lot of people these days seem to need a scapegoat figure representing absolute evil. If "the corporation" is yours, hey, whatever turns your crank. <br><br>Bruce, "preservatives" is funny! Still, most of the pseudoconservatives I know these days aren't into preserving anything that actually exists -- they've got an imaginary golden age stuck in their heads, having convinced themselves that that's the way things really were before those awful liberals, women, etc. messed things up, and are trying to impose their fantasy of the past on the present world in much the same spirit that radicals on the other side of the barricades try to impose their fantasy of the future. <br><br>Twilight, I can identify, I think, at least two parts of the center in question -- first, hostility to economic globalization; second, standing down from America's global empire. Those are very much desired across a wide range of Middle America, and completely absent from the political scene. The rest? An interesting and very important question. <br><br>Jasmine, no argument there at all. <br><br>Eddie, see my comments to Johannes and Nestorian above. As for "power-grabbing thugs," er, were you under the impression that the people in power anywhere, under any conditions, can be described in any other terms? <br><br>Ángel, fascinating. I wasn't familiar with the sources of Falangism, but I'm not at all surprised. <br><br>Io, that's a useful distinction -- you're quite right, of course, that political and social conservatism aren't necessarily related at all. <br><br>Goldmund, the GOP's eager embrace of a "populism" that involves starving the working class is right up there with the Dem's support of "health care reform" that deals with the fact that people can't afford health insurance by requiring them under penalty of law to buy it anyway. These days, there's no absurdity too vast for our politicians to support!<br><br>Troy, it seems to me that the thing to do about it is to start relearning democratic process, and the skills needed to make that process work, and get that in process right now.

Today and yesterday, a wedge tail eagle has been scouting out the place. The bird was only a few metres off the roof of the house. I reckon the eagle may have been trying to take my crusty old fox terrier? The funny thing was yesterday, the eagle landed at the very top of a very tall eucalypt tree. Unfortunately for the eagle the weight of the bird was too much for that dead branch and the bird had to make a quick and ungraceful exit (very unlike their normal modus operandi) as the branch fell to the earth! hehe!<br><br>Oh yeah, I reckon you and your neighbours won't be in any trouble as long as you can feed yourselves. In Greece, parties such as the Golden Dawn are worming their way into the community because they are simply feeding people.

Yes, 2009 was too early -- there were still plenty of people who believed they had something to gain from the existing parties, and the existing system. The window of opportunity for a fascist movement is when the legitimacy of the existing system collapses, but the current holders of power have themselves too tightly wedged in to be removed by any ordinary means. <br><br>RJ, there again, it's a matter of language. A future American fascism won't talk about "the state" -- it'll talk about "the American people," because that's the phrase that gets the warm fuzzy emotions. <br><br>Ray, excellent. "More spiritually progressed than others" is the latest way to pronounce "Herrenvolk." I discussed that at some length in a critique of Korten's <i>The Great Turning</i> <a href=../../2007/03/round-in-circles-review-of-david-c.html rel=nofollow>here</a>, <a href=../../2007/03/round-in-circles-review-of-david-c_14.html rel=nofollow>here</a>, and <a href=../../2007/03/round-in-circles-review-of-david-c_21.html rel=nofollow>here</a> early on in the history of this blog.<br><br>K-dog, by the same logic it was utterly impossible for the Soviet Union or any of the other eastern bloc states to collapse. When I hear the repeated complaints that the government is just too good at marginalizing dissent, I recall two things: first, the embarrassing lack of basic political and media skills demonstrated by most radical groups in today's America, and second, the awkward but inescapable fact that a very large number of Americans are still doing very well by the standards of the rest of the planet, and aren't interested in messing with the goose that lays the golden eggs. As for the notion that we already live in a totalitarian society, I'llbe discussing that next week. <br><br>John, and then they try to conserve things in that condition. <br><br>Latefall, you're most welcome. <br><br>Fire River, I didn't know that Kirk wrote ghost stories! I encountered him via <i>The Conservative Mind</i>. The religious question you've raised would require about a year worth of posts to address with any clarity, so I'll pass here. As for <i>A World Full of Gods</i>, you might tell your Catholic friend that one of my friends, who had a Catholic education (though he left the church later), used to refer to it as the <i>Summa Pro Gentiles</i>...<br><br>Marcello, to my mind you're misstating the case considerably. Conservatives backed the National Socialists when it looked like a choice between Hitler and the Communists, take your pick, but that hardly justifies claiming that the two are identical. As for the fact that you can cite a few individuals who cooperated more enthusiastically than others did, well, data isn't the plural of anecdote, you know. <br><br>Latefall, good. I'd also strongly encourage reading popular fiction from that period -- Hesse's <i>Demian</i> is especially good at catching the attitude among the young in those years, and with hindsight it's not hard to see how that attitude would be exploited. <br><br>DeAnander, most human societies have some set of interconnected metaphors that provide the global framework within which thinking takes place. Ours is money, the way that medieval Europe's was feudal relationships -- look at old accounts of Christian theology in which God is the overlord, the angels his vassals, etc. What usually drives totalitarian schemes is when a political movement tries to break out from its culture's core metaphors in order to replace them with another set -- consider Hitler's attempt to replace money with race, or the attempts of the great Communist dictators to replace money with Marx.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c2743594626714267270 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 7:19 PM</a><br><br>

Io's comment earlier introduces a nice clarification: social conservatism (for example, the belief the women and men should both remain in traditional roles) is not the same thing as political conservatism, and the former very often extends to groups that reject the latter. <br><br>Shtove, fascinating; I managed to miss that. Thanks for the heads up!<br><br>Latefall, hmm! What you're suggesting has much in common with Alasdair MacIntyre's virtue ethics -- he points out, for example, that virtues are independent of one another and quite readily come into conflict. Rather than an N-dimensional set of Cartesian coordinates, why not envision the whole as an ecological space in which values are resources, and each political "species" finds its unique niche in relation to various values? <br><br>Charlie, no, I haven't -- thanks for the heads up! He's quite right about gasoline, of course. <br><br>Varun, I don't see it sticking, but I can readily see the thing being tried, and getting at least temporary ascendancy -- which is as much as Hitler or Mussolini managed, after all. <br><br>Onething, again, by that same logic the Soviet Union could not possibly have fallen. <br><br>Richard, well, there you are.

The same claims got made about the mess in Syria; before that, the one in Libya; before that -- I forget where it was then, but every international crisis during my adult life has been described by somebody or other as 1914 all over again. My guess is that when the global political balance comes apart and another round of major wars begins, nobody will see it coming at all.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c583964189524793550 title="comment permalink">2/20/14, 7:44 PM</a><br><br>

It is very easy.<br><br>You somehow managed to get my brain working today as I was doing work about the place here. I'm preparing another area for a second strawberry bed. Of course that meant that yet another trench had to be dug to install a permanent pipe for the transfer pump from the reserve water tank to the main water tanks. The steel pump cover also had to be modified. Oh well, that's life.<br><br>Anyway, I was thinking about a fascinating graph I spotted recently:<br><br><a href=http://www.budget.gov.au/2012-13/content/glossy/tax_reform/html/tax_overview_02.htm rel=nofollow>CHART 1: TAX REVENUE TO GDP RATIOS, OECD 2010</a><br><br>Then I remember you writing something a few weeks back about feudalism possibly providing social services at a much lower cost than present arrangements. Interesting stuff.<br><br>It seems that groups such as Golden Dawn in Greece are also following a “services at a lower cost strategy”.<br><br>Then Derv (word up for the mention of the debt crisis in this context, although I don't necessarily agree with the rest of your post, sorry) mentioned the debt crisis and I saw it in a new and totally different light. It is actually an attempt by the existing government to maintain the services and benefits to the population at a price lower than the real cost of those services and benefits. From that perspective it looks a little sad and perhaps a whole lot scary.<br><br>It may end up being a possible wedge that a new player uses to get their foot in the door and start kicking heads.

There are caveats, surely: fascism vigorously serves activist alphas (thus eager corporatists rather than aristocrats) and asserts a dominant alpha standing itself (hence totalitarianism). Not to everyone's taste, but fascism apparently resolved progressive pressures of industrial realities in an alpha-agreeable way. Fascism will be even more <i>useful</i> in the age of decline, as the <i>natural</i> way for us to circulate limited resources is the alpha-beta-... hierarchy, ditching some deltas.<br><br>The scenario of totalitarian <i>center</i> is a fruitful perspective. The political circus today tries hard to try everything else before doing right things (to paraphrase Churchill), and there is certainly an inviting vacuum waiting for any party that would dare (or would be allowed to) to implement the reasonable policies. But this situation tells more about autocracy of current political manners. Recognizing fascism is becoming a mental masturbation, with increasing variety of disproportionate focuses on different aspects. To me, consistent hostility (historically or geographically, in action rather than declarations) against egalitarian-leftist initiatives and sharing this hostility with other powers is an important concern item <br>for any fascism.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c7523739103676959092 title="comment permalink">2/21/14, 12:47 AM</a><br><br>

Unions were destroyed by Reagan and industrail anti-strike tactics and by factory removal. Public unions remained. Chinese and Japanese and Europeans came back in the post-war and post-Reagan age but USD(petro-based), US military power remain dominant. SO we have an anglo-saxon empire with shifting ground. The EU/NAto expands eastward perhaps to Russian border. China becomes an economic partner and competitor.<br><br>The middle ground you speak of shifts when a new interest group or technology is introduced. Suddenly Bill Gates or Mark Zuckkerberg become billionaires or OPEC or Putin`s Gazprom take on the world. The Arab and other springs based on tech influence roil the waters of the stiff postwar order (borders drawn between WWI and WWII by French, British in Middle East or say In Pakistan, India, Afghanistan by British in 1949 or in Africa in 1960s all start to dissolve).<br><br>The "people" and their interests against a vague "they" is hard to defend or create a "populist"(i.e.fascist in your terms) movement as things are moving too fast to get a grip on what is really going on, in say the mad variety of the Syrian resistance to Assad regime and the influences of in anyone helping from Al-quaida to Chechen fighters or in the technical language of new smart-phone messaging Apps. <br><br>Klitschko is a very good example of a "fascist(not totalitarian)" = populist here. He got 13% in elections then after a while starts demonstrating against the govt to overthrow it as it presumably does not represent the people's will but rather represents corrupt interests (janukovich billionaire sons) and foreign interests(Russia). Instead of waiting a year to up his poll numbers internally, organically and make a coalition govt. as would be the case in Germany the US govt. brings bundles of cash(probably kliscko was a trojan horse from the start) to finance a blockupy movement over many months with military style tents, generators, tons of food and warm clothing and constant bussing of fresh demonstrators. So Anglo-American empire expands its markets. Klitschko has his main residence in Germany, speaks practically no Ukrainish, was born in Khirgizian(lived in Ukraine between 14th and 24th years of age before going to Germany to become a boxer). The Germans sent Lenin and America funded Bin Laden. BLowback is a very dangerous problem nowadays. You would think someone had learned a lesson at Langley. <br><br>The interests of Americans and people in Ukraine or Germany or Russia or Syria, etc. are hardly served by those who have or get into power after a putsch or whatever you call it.

In brief, the goal of sexual suppression is that of producing an individual who is adjusted to the authoritarian order and who will submit to it in spite of all misery and degradation. At first the child has to submit to the structure of the authoritarian miniature state, the family; this makes it capable of later subordination to the general authoritarian system. The formation of the authoritarian structure takes place through the anchoring of sexual inhibition and anxiety.[5]" <br><br>I worry for the current generation of youth , living in their parents basements until well into adulthood, uninitiated , disaffected , impoverished ..,<br><br>E.g - " you vaccinate your children , i shun you"<br>         " you used to be in the u.s armed forces, go away "<br>         " you , worked for a fossil fuel corporation ?

The Cartesian stuff is really not my cup of tea. I was thinking more in "tag cloud"-clusters, but I really like the ecosystem image as well. In fact it is probably superior as important concepts like mutualism, competition, etc. are included. The Macentyre reference has already been immensely helpful. I am trying to cobble together a rough framework of correlating wealth flow and human interaction to produce slightly "better" outcomes. It seems to be a very good reference to peg much of the underlying assumptions to. But I'll have to take a closer look and see how flexible his values are assumed to be over time. It has always fascinated me that societies can do a 180 in less time than it takes to brake before they hit a wall.<br><br>The more I think about the ecosystem the more I like it. You could also apply it to different magnitudes such as your close social environment, cliques, parties, organizations that try to find reasons for their superiority (or existence). It ties in well with the impression that large organizations become very much like organisms, with their survival as their principal goal. <br>However, I would say these values fluctuate, repulse or attract each other (us vs them dynamics, narratives) quite a bit. The GOP may be a good example of an organism that is by now quite far removed from either its old ideals, or how their electorate makes decisions in real life. However everyone is afraid of their fate in the ecosystem if they were to admit the fact. <br>What I find a bit scary is the potential for a "meta-realpolitik". <br>Nowadays you can view potential for this in fairly high resolution on twitter, facebook, etc. NECSI does this already (http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5010): "Periodic patterns of sentiment fluctuate on both a daily and a weekly scale". I am sure they do on an annual scale as well. For example who would kick off a riot just before harvest vs pay-day for utilities? And once you looked long enough at the wobbly domino pieces, there's a good chance you can find/predict a point in the future where all you need is to slightly tweak the search algorithms for a week, or maybe only an hour or two. Hand out some more difficult captchas here, some more easy there, eat or delay a couple of thousand comments, et voila. If you feel like it, you can of course include the traditional toolchest outside of the NSA all the way to false flags, agent provos, relief efforts and armbands. Can this still be considered conspiracy or has inflation been to bad lately?

A couple points: <br><br>I am gaining a lot of very interesting facts reading your take on fascism. And it is really helping to patch up some, admittedly, spotty history knowledge on my part. But my mind keeps bringing up one reason I don't think fascism stands a chance here: We are far too divided. <br><br>A military coup or something like that? Far fetched at this point in time. But maybe. Full blown fascism? I don't know. What do you think the "glue" needed to hold together a fascist movement would be? Economics? Because it sure isn't anything else I can see. This nation is hopelessly divided. To the point where I honestly don't think you could fight another secessionist movement from the south. Both sides would smile, wish the other side well, and be glad to see the other side go away. <br><br>I guess that is possible. But we have a history that shows us how to tame the out of control banking sectors, run a nationalistic trade/currency policy, and divide the pie a lot more equitably without plunging ourselves into a fascist movement. Wouldn't that short provide a route to short-circuit that tendency? <br><br>As far as the labor movement goes I agree wholeheartedly and have said so here. The biggest mistake the labor movement made was largely excluding minorities. Not always and not to the extent some pretend but the proof is in the pudding: the attachments were so weak that a Democratic party switch from labor to identity politics went almost totally unprotested from the minority community. It didn't have to be this way and it is a shame that it did. <br><br>Will<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c8853785664408860340 title="comment permalink">2/21/14, 6:58 AM</a><br><br>

In a democratic system with a money economy, it's normally a safe bet that every political party is corrupt, and ours may just be the paradigmatic case. <br><br>Mark, give it another decade and the two will probably have fused. That won't necessarily turn into a fascist movement -- there are many different ways things could turn out, some more useful than others. <br><br>Chris, you get tonight's gold star -- that's a very cogent analysis. The inability of today's industrial societies to provide services and benefits to the people at a cost people can afford is political dynamite. <br><br>Das Monde, that's a workable analysis -- put another way, fascism offers industrial societies the benefits of socialism without the class warfare. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, good. Can you encourage half a dozen people to read it this year? <br><br>Ed, Langley is very well insulated against the lessons of its mistakes. Sooner or later one of them is going to blow up in a way that can't be ignored -- that was the premise of my series "How It Could Happen" in October 2012, and my forthcoming novel <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> -- but until then, it's going to be the same ol' same ol'.<br><br>Kutamun, the problem with Reich's analysis is that it could be applied to most people in Europe for the last two thousand years or so, and yet fascism as a historical phenomenon is a much more distinctive factor. I find Reich interesting, that is, but far from convincing in many places, and this is one of them!<br><br>Latefall, one of the many reasons I don't do social media like Twitter -- if a potter makes pots, what does a Twitter make? -- is that it makes it much too easy for that kind of meta-realpolitik. Of course, as you point out, manipulating such a system is also very much an option. <br><br>Mortal, every government that's been in power for more than a few years has committed abuses, and most have committed atrocities. Every government that pursues overseas empire has killed people in that process. I'd argue that there's an important difference between those governments that kill some people now and then, on the one hand, and those that engage in mass murder -- say, ten million political killings in twelve years -- as a normal part of governing. I'd also suggest that obscuring that difference does nobody any good. You're free to disagree, of course. <br><br>Will, the best glue for a fascist movement, as history reminds us, is rejection of the status quo. It's amazing how many people will accept the claim that anything other than the current system must be a change for the better. Once the fascist system gets in place, of course, it can enforce conformity, and to the extent that it succeeds in giving people what they want -- for example, jobs -- a very large number of people will fall in line. <br><br>Bill, you're quite correct that I see it as possible rather than certain -- or even probable. My guess is that the way this country is going, fragmentation is more likely than fascism. Still, there's so much protofascist thinking in various corners of contemporary American culture that it seemed worth saying something about the risks.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c9171344682918276382 title="comment permalink">2/21/14, 6:24 PM</a><br><br>

I'm considering an entry, time permitting. <br><br>Mister R., now think about where that habit of thinking about fascism came from, and who benefits from it. <br><br>Nastarana, standard common or garden variety authoritarian abuses, of the sort that can be found in most societies. That's one of the reasons it's important to recognize just how much worse things can get. <br><br>Sheldon, it's surprisingly hard for anybody to live up to their best ideas. You could equally well have cited the considerable number of activists on the far left whose bills are paid by trust funds invested in the corporate economy these same activists claim to hate; they were common enough in the Pacific Northwest when I lived there that there was a slang term for them -- "Trustafarians." <br><br>I trust you realize that the personal failings of one individual associated with a way of thought doesn't disprove the validity of that way of thought. That's why, for example, my critique of Ayn Rand's belief system in a previous post focused on the failings of the belief system, not on her personal problems living up to her beliefs.<br><br>Myriad, good. The crucial thing to keep in mind is that every change is not necessarily for the better, and a movement that seeks change may replace a bad system with a worse one. The cure for that is to support movements that embody such old-fashioned values as civil rights and the rule of law, even in dealing with the other side. <br><br>Phil, true enough. A really close look at the world before the Great War reveals some very unexpected things. <br><br>Richard, it was a common mistake, and was motivated -- as I've suggested -- by the belief that the only choice left was between the Nazis and the Communists.

Down here in Dixie, the conservative tendencies are disturbed by all this talk about strong central government and a shocking lack of mentions of god. Remember, we are a generation removed from the present-day, so these are not your father's southerners. But they still retain their suspicion of government, and their trust in religion. The schism grows deeper, and in a backlash against the increasingly intrusive moves from the federal government southern culture becomes ever more focused on personal liberty. Finally there is a split, and the Free States of America break away, persuading a substantial chunk of the U.S. military to come with them. After all many of the largest bases are down here. In an effort to separate as far as possible from the authoritarian north and west, they adopt a constitution with strong guarantees of privacy, absolute religious freedom, and personal liberty as it defining value. This goes so far as to embrace high-profile freedoms their grandparents were shocked by, such as same-sex marriage and almost no drug prohibitions. New Orleans is the new Amsterdam, though the shadow of war looms large. The inevitable military conflict follows, and the remaining European democracies join forces with the Pacific and Islamic nations to support the FSA against the totalitarian USA and its aggressive moves beyond its borders. The war is horrific and costly, but eventually the USA and its puppet states are brought down. The FSA and is allies begin the long and difficult process of reconstruction and reconciliation. And, of course, the FSA has to return to the harsh realities that it cities are running out of water, its agriculture is failing, its coastline is sinking, and most of the resources that could have been used to help with this situation were consumed by the war.

I recall a documentary about Il Duce that, since people were at their best in war, constant war was part of the strategy. This in that vein from "The Truth Will Make You Mad” blog - Darwin’s Holocaust? (Part 2 of 3):<br>As early as 1939, philosopher Judah Rumney wrote about Darwin’s influence on both Hitler and Mussolini. In an article called “Biology and War,” which Rumney wrote shortly before Germany’s September 1939 invasion of Poland (and the start of World War II), he noted that the German and Italian dictators were both influenced by the philosophy of social Darwinism:<br>Both Mussolini and Hitler avow their adherence to this philosophy of war. Hitler in Mein Kampf argues that the world must be ruled according to the natural law of the survival of the fittest: “In constant war mankind has become great — in eternal peace it must perish.”12<br>Rumney added that Hitler saw war, first, as a “biological necessity,” part of a Darwinian “struggle for existence,” and second, as a means of natural selection, in which the weak and inferior would perish and the strong and superior would be selected for survival. <br>http://thetruthwillmakeyoumad.wordpress.com/2012/06/23/darwins-holocaust-part-2-of-3/<br>Perpetual war is a feature of life in Orwell’s, “1984” a fiction no more. <br>The factors that enabled the rise of Adolf Hitler have not yet included the WW-I reparations treaty intended to cripple Germany economically, which it did.<br>How did the Nazi’s manage to keep the good people of Germany on board? This review of the book “Hitler's Beneficiaries” by Gotz Aly - 2005 was a shocker. http://llco.org/hitlers-beneficiaries-2005-by-gotz-aly/<br>As it rearmed, made war, and sought to keep the social peace, the regime went into massive debt so much so that it faced eventual financial collapse. The Nazis borrowed from domestic and foreign sources. Eventually, they would strong-arm occupied countries into “loaning” the regime large sums. The Nazis had no intention of paying these sums back and entered them as revenue in their books. (266) The Nazis used whatever financial tricks were available to hide the true extent of their borrowing. In 1938, Göring stated, “I know no other way to keep my Four Year Plan and the German economy going.” (45) The borrowing reached a point where the only solution to keeping the German economy afloat was to cannibalize the Jewish population and, eventually other peoples. The cannibalization of Jewish assets was referred to as “Aryanization.” Aly writes:<br>“Forced to come up with ever more creative ways of refinancing the national debt, they turned their attention to property owned by German Jews, which was soon confiscated and added to the so-called Volksvermogen, or collective assets, which by no means restricted to German society, implied the possibility of dispossessing those considered ‘alien’ (Volksfremden) or ‘hostile’ (Volksfeinden) to the ethnic mainstream.” (41)<br>Then there is Edwin Black's history of the involvement of IBM and Ford in supporting the eugenics program in Germany which came from the States. His 2009 book the "Nazi Nexus" connects the dots.<br>Here’s Black’s presentation on CSPAN http://www.c-span.org/video/?285699-1/book-discussion-nazi-nexus<br><br>This need not be added to the que.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c5607569065826434411 title="comment permalink">2/21/14, 8:49 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, there have been some such abuses in the past, such as armed raids on doctors trying to provide natural forms of healing, but it seems to me it has stepped up quite a bit, and isn't that alarming? Those armed raids and legal proceedings against doctors were because they were cutting into the uniformity whose purpose was monopolization of medical care on offer. Now, those food raids and laws against raw milk or laws against seed saving (!) in Europe and so on are for the same reason - Big Agra and the processed food giants are now in a similar position regarding food production in this country, they have it almost locked down and don't want the alternative to grow. At the same time that it is true enough that we still have a fair amount of freedom and of course it can get much worse, there is something in the air, and I see it affecting my daily life in my job, in travel...an air of intransigent rules and the fear of breaking them. The daily performance of my job it utterly changed from what it was 8 or 10 years ago. It was once fairly relaxed and open, and now is controlled by regulations,rules, computers to the minute. Everything must be locked up that a few years ago no one worried about.And vaccinations are more and more forced; if things continue on their current trajectory the entire population will be forcibly immunized. Then there are the various "zero tolerance" rules.

It might be another decade or 2 before things become so acute. There are simply not enough persons in the USA, particularly young ones, without jobs. Furthermore, there are so many different kinds of entertainment available even to relatively poor people. If people have a job, even a repugnant and poorly paying one, and can go home to a television, drink a beer and eat fatty foods until they have a pot belly, they are unlikely to go out into the streets and join a fascist movement.<br><br>Persons in the USA are also poorly informed, especially on historical and cultural issues, much more uninformed than a typical European, or so I've heard. As such, US citizens are likely to belong to a movement only for a short while because they lack a deep understanding of the issues, and have no ideological base that is self-consistent. Once the hatred, passion and resentment fades a bit, most US citizens can be expected to shuffle back to their televisions, internet sites , baseball games, drugs or other forms of entertainment.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c4118589019352576321 title="comment permalink">2/22/14, 3:37 PM</a><br><br>

In the mid sized upper Southern city where I live, impatience and rudeness rules, slow paced Southern gentility, manners, &amp; hospitality is gone. The accent is all but dead except for some older people. The old money, social register, first families of the Southern aristocracy that ruled and controlled the South since colonial times is dead. The redneck culture that people outside the South consider Southern has nothing to do with the traditional South, as it's just a Yankee, Deliverence caricature/stereotype of poor Southern whites that has just become a cultural shorthand for disenfranchised whites to adopt, regardless of their region, much the same way" gangsta" culture is adopted by disenfranchised people of color. Indeed, how Southern is a culture that is claimed by the descendents of Polish immigrants &amp; Union soldiers in the rust belt of the North?<br>Regionalization is in our future, but we've never been more culturally homogeneous than we are now.

When I knew him, he was the chief surgeon in a Westphalian village hospital. He seemed to me, when I knew him, to be a thoroughly decent man. In those years my German was fluent, and I could even get by a little in Plattdeutsch (Low German), so I could also hear what was said in unguarded moments when my presence was overlooked. My host had been quite young when he was an officer in the German Army under Hitler, and he had had a couple of decades, I suppose, to learn from the consequences of his actions in his youth. <br><br>As a professional Slavist, I have also been acquainted with a few people who were loyal party members under Stalin. It was much the same with them. When I knew them, they seemed to me to be decent people -- with a few exceptions. (Here my sample was larger.)<br><br>I suspect it is the same in most totalitarian regimes, whether Fascist or Communist. People are more or less decent in and of themselves, or some of them are not -- most are a complex mix of the two.

There are a number of reasons why this is both effective and dangerous. It can create a sense of solidarity amongst the in-group against the out-group. Hatred and fear of the other is a great motivator. It can also be the basis for mass manipulation and coercion, as those who go along are now caught in a kind of trap because they’ve participated in the scapegoating process. Also, when you are talking about hatred and prejudice, you are talking about states of mind that lend themselves to manipulation, leading to, in the U.S. - race-riots, lynchings, klu-klux-klan, and the numerous assassinations in the American South. <br><br>The more people are suffering, the more they are willing to blame some other group for their problems. In America people blame the poor and the homeless, blacks, mexicans, communists, homosexuals, etc. The whole effect can be amplified by political propaganda and clever use of the media. The Nazis under the guidance of Goebbels, were masters at this. In the US we have Fox News, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, etc. <br><br>There is a direct line between The John Birch Society and the Tea Party. Both exhibit the same intolerance for minorities, reliance on conspiracy theories, open contempt for government, indiscriminate tarring of moderates and left-wingers as communists, etc.<br> One of the original prominent John Birchers was the father of the Koch brothers, the present bank rollers of the TP. <br><br>The problem is that these techniques work, and the worse-off people are, the better they work. I think it is vital to realize that the whole Reaganite Republican shtick about government being the problem plays into this because it creates an atmosphere of mistrust and disrespect for the rule of law. And that atmosphere is fertile ground for fascism. A very similar attitude towards the government of the Weimar Republic helped contribute to the rise of the Nazi party in Germany.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c2192487669566490752 title="comment permalink">2/22/14, 9:18 PM</a><br><br>

And you've done a thorough and accurate job with the definitions and history of fascism, liberalism, and conservatism.<br><br>"Snarl words!" I like it. And my overriding take-away is that the vocabulary word "fascism" now and forevermore will function only as a snarl word. I suspect that the derivations of "liberal" and "conservative" may be soon to follow.<br><br>My point is that no one can yet predict the political future of the United States. (Although you're going to try this coming Thursday. And I look forward to it.) BUT, whatever happens as the US descends into stress and privation, it is likely to be a cobbled together amalgam of things that work - with little regard for purity of definitions. And furthermore, that labeling a political initiative "fascist," whether by friend or foe - is going to lead to that initiative's certain defeat. IOW, no matter what it is in reality - fascist or not - "they" are going to have to call it something else besides fascism.<br><br>And, here's a question that I don't believe you've addressed yet.<br>Fascism is "groupism," right?<br>Therefore, doesn't it and/or wouldn't it require both an in-group and an out-group. And the in-group would be some faction loyal to some surviving or evolving system of government of belief, right?<br><br>But - what would the out-group be. Since history rhymes without repeating; let's argue that the out-group is unlikely to be defined based on sexual orientation or traditional minority status. So what's left? I can think of two possibilities. <br><br>One is age. We're hearing a lot (much of it self-referential, no doubt) of disparaging remarks about "selfish baby boomers," and other groups who - - have all the money/won't pay taxes/belong to the Tea Party/etc/etc. Some could argue that age discrimination already takes place. Could it get worse, and then find the Boomer elderly codified into an official out-group? I hope not, but I can see where those lines might be drawn. And it could happen very quickly, given sufficient stress on society.<br><br>The other potential out-group could not be attacked now, but might be singled out for out-group status within 2 to 4 decades from now. This out-group would be the new white ethnic minority - who would likely still own many of the worthwhile assets still extant in the United States, and perhaps be vulnerable to scapegoating for that reason alone.<br><br>Just some thoughts.<br>Thanks for allowing dissensus, JMG.<br><br>And I've created a new blogger ID handle.

They were in fear of the children telling the authorities about this.<br><br>Her mother was getting awards for bearing such perfect Aryan children. The authorities wanted to send my mother off to a camp where they want the young unmarried ladies to get pregnant and create more perfect Aryan children.

You summarized what I run into weekly. The thing that is so surprising is that so many of these parents involved in whatever leadership positions (various sports, PTAs, Scouts, non-profits, 4-H, etc.) are educated and often highly-trained professionals. Yet, with far too many, you give them an opening to power and they morph into egotistical, top-down, hell-bent-for-leather behaviors. I wonder why we think executives and politicians should be better than they are when the average educated, trained adult is all-too-likely to fail the basic ethics-and-some-humility test when running the local high school lacrosse team.<br> <br>Didn’t mean for my words too sound too harsh toward anyone. I am just so discouraged by the lack of so many to rise to any kind of higher-level leadership that I fear what a true need for leadership (the Long Descent) will result in. History bears me out in this.<br><br>@Tony. “I'm now thinking that one of the most *dangerous* things to give is loyalty. It strikes me as something of a fascistic virtue. I think perhaps we should give 'loyalty' to principles, not entities. When it comes to persons, 'loyalty' is too strong, 'relationship' I feel contains enough commitment and flexibility.”<br>Interesting. I see what you are saying, but I also see the downsides to giving loyalty to ‘principles’. To me, the Nazi Party had loyalty to a set of ‘principals’ (although perhaps you see that as loyalty to a person). (The Tea Party also comes to mind, with them being all-too-willing to throw anyone under the bus who does not vote 100% with them, 100% of the time.) Yet I also see the pitfalls of being too loyal to a person. Perhaps the loyalty needs to be to one’s own principals, and, I would argue, one of those principals should at least take into account the effect on those affected by the ‘principals’. Interesting food for thought, anyway. Agree with your thoughts on country.<br><br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c5809495982412407695 title="comment permalink">2/23/14, 8:26 PM</a><br><br>

I was hoping for some sort of DSM IV type definition of fascism along the lines of: If the presenting organization exhibits at least 3 of 4 of the symptoms from List A and at least 2 of 12 of the symptoms from List B, it may be diagnosed as Fascist. I wasn't disappointed. This may be the start of a full taxonomy of political diseases ;-)<br><br>More seriously, I wonder how predetermined the rise of fascism in the West is as a consequence of peak oil. I realize you are mostly defining your terms at this point. I don't think you have definitively answered this one way or the other though perhaps you have hinted.<br><br>What I've had trouble grasping is why countries that had political systems that gave their governments the power to act decisively in the face of economic crisis (like Germany and Italy early last century) failed to create political parties that seizes the abandoned middle ground of politics, take up the popular causes that all other parties refuse to touch, and impose run of the mill democratic governments of the center. Instead they chose totalitarian governments of the center. <br><br>Of the first three of Nolte's criteria, it is totalitarianism that is clearly the most problematic.<br><br>After reading your essay twice I think I finally got it. Things got so bad politically and economically in Germany and Italy that it became plausible that no mere tweaking of the system was likely to solve these problems. A non-totalitarian party of the center is still quite possible up until the point that a critical mass of people have lost complete faith in their civic religion. After that point, a total remaking of society from its fundamental myths (in the sense of unquestioned narratives) on up through the embodiment of these in its institutions seems the only option left. So voila: totalitarianism.<br><br>The subversive nature of fascism is that there is nothing wrong with the aim of remaking a dysfunctional society per se. The problem is working outside the rule of just laws and using extreme violence (as opposed the normal violence implied, by definition, in any polity) to accomplish this aim. Given the culture of violence in the USA and the fact that the USA in particular also has a government structure that was pretty much designed (due to a deep distrust of central control i.e. monarchy) not to work, I would guess the USA is a top candidate for fascism once things get bad enough. By no means certain though. Feudalism initially funded by vestigial concentrations of great wealth as big business bites the dust is perhaps another possibility? Perhaps feudalism is more likely much later after we give fascism a whirl first. One political disease at a time.<br><br>Thanks for taking the time to respond to all the question and comments put to you including mine<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c1195608210974235690 title="comment permalink">2/23/14, 8:29 PM</a><br><br>

Before I tackle that blog, there will first be a prequel on the evil of binary thinking in general. Whatever I end up with, it will contain a link to this series.<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c952687591468706024 title="comment permalink">3/1/14, 8:13 AM</a><br><br>

Awareness is growing that i am the biosphere and i am not leaving , and that the planet just " is" , is not "evolving". I sense by being conscious of my body , my dreams and being in nature i can connect to my earth roots and experience profound peace . Humans then , are an exothermic reaction of the watery , gassy , ball. Individuation then , not evolution is the goal . What passes for materialistic " individualism" often amounts to little more than narcissistic isolation . Indidviduation , that curious ideal of the philosophers , magicians and jungian analysis . Like a droplet extending from a larger pool to take on an individual shape , yet straining not to break the connection back to its source , which would cause " the fall" . Do you have any posts that explore these images ? , like a cave sealed with an ancient spell, google is refusing to yield up your treasure . Individuation ...a game she plays with herself for her own amusement ? Perhaps she is made richer by our little delineations ....im ok with that somehow . We can be animal fauna , as we seem to be sliding now, though if we struggle to form our droplet , we can exert the mysterious " choice " . Sexuality seems to play a big role in this , the process that facilitates the exothermic reaction that is us . It can be used as a conduit to maintain the connection as an elegant droplet , or in a frenzied orgiastic animal rutting to further shrink and reduce oneself back to brine in the primal sea of planetary consciousness , as can be prsently observed occurring on a large scale. <br>I am probably harking back more to " paths of wisdom " here i guess ...<br>Sorry to drift so randomly , but here i am <br><br>Thanks <br>Kuta '<br><br><a href=fascism-and-future-part-two.html#c243984409297932855 title="comment permalink">3/9/14, 6:04 PM</a><br><br>
