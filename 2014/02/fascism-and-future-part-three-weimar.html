The discussion on fascism that’s taken up the last two weekly essays here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, and will finish up in this week’s post, has gone in directions that will very likely have surprised and dismayed many of my readers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Some of you, in fact, may even be jumping up and down by this point shouting, “Okay, but what about <i>fascism</i>? We’ve heard more than enough about Depression-era European dictators in funny uniforms, and that’s all very well and good, but what about <i>real</i> fascism, the kind we have in America today?”<br>
</div>
</div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
</div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
If this is what’s going through your head just now, dear reader, you’re in interesting company.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It’s a curious detail that in the last years of the Weimar Republic, a large number of avant-garde intellectuals and cultural figures were convinced that they already lived in a fascist country. They pointed, as many Americans point today, to the blatant influence of big business on the political process, to civil rights violations perpetrated by the administration in power or by state and local governments, and to the other abuses of power<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>common to any centralized political system, and they insisted that this amounted to fascism, since their concept of fascism—like the one standard in today’s America—assumed as a matter of course that fascism must by definition defend and support the economic and political status quo.</div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
In point of fact, as Walter Laqueur showed in his capable survey <i>Weimar: A Cultural History</i>, denouncing the Weimar Republic as a fascist regime was quite the lively industry in Germany in the very late 1920s and early 1930s. Unfortunately for those who made this claim, history has a wicked sense of humor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A good many of the people who liked to insist that Weimar Germany was a fascist state got to find out—in many cases, at the cost of their lives—that there really is a difference between a troubled, dysfunctional, and failing representative democracy and a totalitarian state, and that a movement that promises to overturn a broken status quo, and succeeds in doing so, is perfectly capable of making things much, much worse. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
It’s entirely possible that we could end up on the receiving end of a similar dose of history’s gallows humor. To an embarrassing degree, after all, political thought in modern America has degenerated into the kind of reflexive venting of rage George Orwell parodied in
<i>1984</i> in the Two Minutes Hate. Instead of pouring out their hatred at a cinematic image of marching Eurasian soldiers juxtaposed with the sniveling face of Goldstein, the traitorous leader of the Brotherhood, the inhabitants of our contemporary Oceania have their choice of options neatly stapled to the insides of their brains. For Democrats, the standard target until recently was an image of George W. Bush dressed up as Heinrich Himmler, lighting a bonfire using the Constitution as tinder and then tossing endangered species into the flames; for Republicans right now, it’s usually a picture of Barack Obama dressed up as Ho Chi Minh, having sex with their daughters and then walking off with their gun collections. Either way, the effect is the same. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
I wish I were joking. I know people who, during Dubya’s presidency, were incapable of passing a picture of the man without screaming obscenities at it, and I know other people who have the identical kneejerk reaction these days to pictures of the White House’s current inmate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve commented here before how our political demonology stands in the way of any response to the converging crises of our time. The same sort of denunciatory frenzy was all the rage, in any sense of that word you care to choose, in Germany during the Weimar Republic—and its most important consequence was that it blinded far too many people to the difference between ordinary political dysfunction and the far grimmer realities that were waiting in the wings. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
To explore the way that unfolded, let’s engage in a little thought experiment. Imagine, then, that sometime this spring, when you visit some outdoor public place, you encounter a half dozen young people dressed identically in bright green T-shirts, surplus black BDU trousers, and army-style boots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They’re clean-cut, bright, and enthusiastic, and they want to interest you in a new political movement called the American Peoples Party. You’re not interested, and walk on by. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
A couple of months later you run across another dozen or so of them, just as bright and clean and enthusiastic as the first bunch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now the movement is called the National Progressive American Peoples Party, NPAPP for short, and it’s got a twenty-five-point program focused on the troubled economy. You take a flyer, mostly because the young person who hands it to you is kind of cute. The twenty-five points don’t seem especially original, but they make more sense than what either Obama or the Republicans are offering. What’s more, the flyer says that the economy’s a mess and peak oil and climate change are real problem that aren’t going away, and this impresses you. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
Over the months to come you see more and more of them, handing out flyers, going door to door to invite people to local caucus meetings, and doing all the other things that political parties used to do back when they were serious about grassroots organizing. A news website you follow shows a picture of the party’s chairman, a man named Fred Halliot;* he’s an earnest-looking guy in his thirties, an Army vet who did three tours in Afghanistan and earned a Silver Star for courage under fire. You glance at his face and then go look at something more interesting. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
(*Yes, it’s an anagram. Work it out yourself.) </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
Meanwhile, the economy’s getting worse in the same slow uneven way it’s been doing for years. Two of your friends lose their jobs, and the price of gasoline spikes up to $5.69 a gallon, plunges, and finds a new stable point again well above $4. Obama insists that the recovery is already here and people just need to be patient and wait for prosperity to get to them. The Republicans insist that the only reason the economy hasn’t recovered yet is that the rich still have to pay taxes. The media are full of cheery stories about how the 2014 holiday season is going to be so big a hit that stores may run out of toys and electronic gewgaws to sell; there are record crowds on Black Friday, or that’s what the TV says, but nobody you know has the spare money to buy much this year. Not until midway through January 2015 does the media admit that the shopping season was a disaster and that two big-box chains have just gone broke. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
Through all this, the new party keeps building momentum. As spring comes, Halliot begins a nationwide speaking tour. He travels in a school bus painted green and black, the NPAPP colors, and a Celtic tree-of-life symbol, the party’s new emblem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The bus goes from town to town, and the crowds start to build. A handful of media pundits start talking about Halliot and the NPPAP, making wistful noises about how nice it is to see young idealists in politics again; a few others fling denunciations, though they don’t seem to have any clear sense what exactly they’re denouncing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Both mainstream parties, as well as the Libertarians and the Greens, launch youth organizations with their own t-shirts and slogans, but their lack of anything approaching new ideas or credible responses to the economic mess make these efforts a waste of time. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
The speaking tour ends in Washington DC with a huge rally, and things get out of hand. Exactly what happened is hard to tell afterwards, with wildly different stories coming from the feds, the mass media, the internet, and the NPAPP headquarters in St. Louis. The upshot, though, is that Halliot and two of his chief aides are arrested on federal conspiracy charges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The trial is a media circus. Halliot gives an impassioned speech justifying his actions on the grounds that the nation and the world are in deep trouble, radical change is needed to keep things from getting much worse, and civil disobedience is justified for that reason.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He gets sentenced to four years in prison, and the other political parties breathe a huge collective sigh of relief, convinced that the NPAPP is a flash in the pan.</div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
They’re wrong. The NPAPP weathers the crisis easily, and publicity from the trial gives Halliot and his party a major boost. Candidates from the new party enter races across the country in the 2016 elections, seizing much of the limelight from the frankly dreary presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Haley Barbour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When the votes are counted, the new party has more than three hundred city and county positions, forty-three seats in state legislatures, and two seats in the House of Representatives. The major parties try every trick in the book to overturn the results of each race, and succeed mostly in making themselves look corrupt and scared. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
Then Halliot gets released from prison, having served only nine months of his sentence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(Word on the internet has it that the whole point of locking him up was to keep him out of the way during the election—but is that simply a NPAPP talking point?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nobody’s sure.) It turns out that he put the time to good use, and has written a book, <i>A Struggle for the Soul of America</i>, which hits the bookstalls the same week President Barbour is inaugurated. You leaf through a copy at the public library; it’s not exactly a great work of literature, and it’s written in a folksy, rambling style you find irritating, but it’s full of the kind of political notions that Americans swap over beers and pizza: the kind, in other words, that no mainstream party will touch. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
The book has an edge that wasn’t in NPAPP literature before Halliot’s prison term, though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The government of the parties, he insists, must be replaced by a government of the people, guided by a new values consensus that goes beyond the broken politics of greed and special interests to do what has to be done to cope with the disintegrating economy, the challenge of peak oil, and the impacts of climate change. Time is short, he insists, and half measures aren’t enough to avoid catastrophe; a complete transformation of every aspect of American life, a Great Turning, is the only option left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Edgy though his language and ideas have become, you note, he’s still the only person in national politics who takes the economic, energy, and climate crises seriously. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
The next autumn, as if on cue, the economic troubles go into overdrive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Petroleum prices spike again—you start commuting via public transit when the price of gasoline breaks $8 a gallon—and a big Wall Street investment bank that had huge derivative bets the other direction goes messily broke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Attempts to get a bailout through Congress freeze up in a flurry of partisan bickering. Over the next two months, despite frantic efforts by the Barbour administration, the stock market plunges and the credit markets seize up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Job losses snowball. Through the fall and winter, NPAPP people are everywhere, leafleting the crowds, staffing impromptu soup kitchens, marching in the streets. You would pay less attention, but by spring you’re out of a job, too. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
The following years are a blur of grim headlines, hungry crowds at soup kitchens, and marching crowds in green and black. In the 2018 election,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>there are rumors, never proved, of NPAPP squads keeping opposition voters away from the polls in critical districts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One way or another, though, Halliot’s party seats six senators and 185 representatives in Congress, and takes control of the governments of a dozen states. The three-way split in the House makes it all but impossible to get anything done there, not that the Democrats or Republicans have any idea what to do, and the administration copies its last two predecessors by flailing and fumbling to no noticeable effect. One thing of importance does happen; to get NPAPP support to push a stopgap budget through the House in 2019, President Barbour is forced to grant a full federal pardon to Halliot, removing the last legal barrier to the latter’s presidential ambitions. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
Fast forward to the 2020 elections, which are fought out bitterly in a flurry of marches, protests, beatings, riots, and charges and countercharges of vote fraud. When the dust has settled, it turns out that no party has a majority in the electoral college.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The election goes to the House, and since neither of the major parties is willing to vote for the other major party’s candidate, Halliot ends up winning by a whisker-thin majority on the forty-second ballot. He is inaugurated on a bitterly cold day, surrounded by NPAPP banners and greeted by marching files of party faithful in green and black.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He announces that he’s about to call a constitutional convention to replace the government of the parties with a government of the people, get the country back on its feet, and sweep away everything that stands in the way of the Great Turning that will lead America and the world to a bright new future. The crowd roars its approval. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
Later that year, the crowds go wilder still when the old constitution is scrapped and the new one enacted. Those with old-fashioned ideas find some aspects of the new constitution objectionable, as it lacks such minor details as checks and balances, not to mention meaningful and enforceable guarantees of due process and civil rights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The media doesn’t mention that, though, because the “new values consensus” is enforced by Party officials—the capital letter becomes standard usage very quickly—and those who criticized the new constitution too forcefully, well, let’s just say that nobody’s quite sure where they are now, and most people know better than to ask. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
And you, dear reader? At what point along that trajectory would you have decided that for all its seeming promise, for all the youth and enthusiasm and earnestness that surround it, the National Socialist German Workers Party and the folksy, charismatic veteran who led it were likely to be worse—potentially much, much worse—than the weary, dreary, dysfunctional mess of a political system they were attempting to replace?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Or would you end up as part of the cheering crowds in that last scene?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You don’t have to tell me the answer, but in the silence of your own mind, take the time to think it through and face the question honestly. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
What almost always gets forgotten about the fascist movements of Europe between the wars is just how much promise they seemed to hold, and how many people of good will saw them as the best hope of the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their leaders were young—Hitler was 43 when he became chancellor of Germany, the same age as John F. Kennedy at his inauguration, and Mussolini was only 39 when he became prime minister of Italy—and most of the rank and file of both men’s followers were younger still. Hitler’s party, for example, had a huge success among German college students long before it had a mass following anywhere else. Both parties also drew to a very great extent on the avant-garde culture and popular ideas of their time. How many people even remember nowadays that before the Second World War, the swastika was seen as a pagan symbol of life, redolent of ancient roots and primal vitality, with much the same cultural ambience that the NPAPP’s Celtic tree-of-life emblem might have in America today? </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
The fascist movements of the 1920s and 1930s were thus closely attuned to the hopes and fears of the masses, far more so than either the mainstream parties or the established radical groups of their respective countries. Unlike the imagined “fascism” of modern radical rhetoric, they were an alternative to business as usual, an alternative that positioned itself squarely in the abandoned center of the political discourse of their eras.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In terms of that discourse, in the context of their own times and places, the talking points of the fascist parties weren’t anything like so extreme as they appear to most people nowadays—and we forget that at our deadly peril. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
That’s the thing I tried to duplicate in the thought experiment above, by changing certain details of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>German national socialism so I could give the National Progressive American Peoples Party a contemporary slant—one that that calls up the same reactions its earlier equivalent got in its own place and time. Antisemitism and overt militarism were socially acceptable in Germany between the wars; they aren’t socially acceptable in today’s United States, and so they won’t play a role in a neofascist movement of any importance in the American future. What will play such roles, of course, are the tropes and buzzwords that appeal to Americans today, and those may very well include the tropes and buzzwords that appeal most to you. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
There’s a deeper issue I’ve tried to raise here, too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s easy, comfortable, and (for the manufacturers and distributors of partisan pablum) highly profitable to approach every political conflict in the simplistic terms of good versus evil. The habit of seeing political strife in those terms becomes a reliable source of problems when the conflict in question is actually between the good and the perfect—that is, between a flawed but viable option that’s within reach, and a supposedly flawless one that isn’t. The hardest of all political choices, though, comes when the conflict lies between the bad and the much, much worse—as in the example just sketched out, between a crippled, dysfunctional, failing democratic system riddled with graft and abuses of power, on the one hand, and a shiny new tyranny on the other. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div style="text-align: left">
It may be that there are no easy answers to that conundrum. Unless Americans can find some way to step back from the obsessive partisan hatreds that bedevil our political life, though, it’s probably a safe bet that there will be no answers at all—not, quite possibly, until the long and ugly list of the world’s totalitarian regimes gets another entry, complete with the usual complement of prison camps and mass graves. As long as the word “fascism” retains its current status as a meaningless snarl word that’s normally flung at the status quo, certainly, that last possibility seems far more likely than any of the alternatives.<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 200%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: "Courier New"; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-fareast-language: AR-SA'> </span></div>

I certainly agree that a political future of the type you describe is not only possible for the U.S., but likely. Though it certainly would be worse than the failing system we have now, the status quo cannot be maintained because it is unsustainable - the elite remain in power at the expense of the masses, and that can only go on for so long. Can you envision an alternative to fascism? If so, what would that look like? Any examples from history that might serve to show us a more positive way forward into the future? Could a fascist state be maintained in an area as large as the U.S., or would various regions split off to create their own fascist regimes? Once again, thank you for your well reasoned perspective.<br><br><a href=#c2383466634722472970 title="comment permalink">2/26/14, 6:36 PM</a><br><br>

None of the news articles summarizing the document mention magic specifically, but reading the full presentation raised all kinds of hackles and red flags with me. It reminded me very much of your discussion of thaumaturgy. The full presentation is embedded in the bottom of <a href=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140224/17054826340/new-snowden-doc-reveals-how-gchqnsa-use-internet-to-manipulate-deceive-destroy-reputations.shtml rel=nofollow>this page</a>.<br><br>On p.5, "Magic" and "Deception" are specifically noted as fields of social interaction. On p.8, the goal says "We want to build Cyber Magicians." <br>p.10-12 talk about "Magic Techniques" in the service of changing social perceptions. They all seem to be thaumaturgy. <br>On p.16 are three examples of altered perceptions, e.g. the development of camouflage, labeled "Magic, the Military and Intelligence". <br>The last slide quotes Teller (of Penn &amp; Teller) about "Conjuring with information". <br>The entire presentation details a plan or a technique by a government agency to smear and otherwise destroy targets online, exclusively by means of planting false information and _changing perceptions_ in social media. <br><br>The targets are not only the Western world's antagonists, such as terrorists, but "Hacktivists" are specifically mentioned. The news media who are carrying this story, rightly point out that this is a clue that any "free" Western government might be right now manipulating people's perceptions for reasons that have nothing to do with terrorism.<br><br>It seems like there might be some practitioner(s) of magic in the UK at least, who is willing to advise the security agencies how to use thaumaturgy. (For all I know, there may be many in the US, but they probably don't use the word "magic" as openly when dealing with our boring economics-oriented government officials.) Oh, if only there was some kind of Harry Potter Council of Wizards who could revoke this guy's license to practice the Craft.<br><br>More realistically, as you proceed in your discussion of fascism, I really think you should remind your readers of <br>your previous columns about defending themselves from thaumaturgy -- and maybe even expand on them. You cited <br>Hitler in your previous writings as a skilled thaumaturge. We all may need to brush up on our personal magical defenses as fascism prepares for a comeback.<br><br><a href=#c8827421145785362246 title="comment permalink">2/26/14, 8:31 PM</a><br><br>

I really enjoyed the history lesson. For all the consternation of the left wing here, most of us on the Conservative (capitol "C") side already view future history as one already past, in 2008..including the new logo. Given the rhetoric and actions of the media and the current political leaders (both sides) against us, ie Tea party, vets, gun owners, etc, all that is left is the fist inside of the velvet glove to reveal itself, but there is 2.5 years left if not more... given the discussions of a third term already. Until then, there are zeros to check, jobs to go to and new friends to make. We may be Rome's last legions, but unlike those poor souls in the 30s and 40s, we have no intention of going gently into that good night nor "getting on the railroad". <br><br>Perhaps those who don't comprehend our worship of those old dead white men will finally understand once the barrel of statism is aimed at them.

Almost all the new Nazi groups in Europe are virulently anti-Jew. It is as if World War Two and Shoah never happened. <br><br>Some parties are very much on the fringe but others like Golden Dawn and Front Nationale have become 'respectable'. They stand up against the IMF and the ECB which none of the ordinary parties are willing to do. These groups are not modernistic and progressive like the NSDAP but more like Ustase. They are simply killers frustrated by the limits imposed by civilized society, they wait for the sanction ... that they might claim the night and drench it with blood. <br><br>There are Nazi-like groups emergent in Ukraine, who were the best fighters and were able to sweep away the elite Ukraine internal security forces: Svoboda and Right Sector.

Already a Rabbi in Kiev has warned the Jews to leave the city, not a good sign in a place that was under the hammer of the SS and Einsatzgruppen. <br><br>None of the new Nazis are going to be able to gain as much traction as the original model b/c no politician or party can pull resources out of a hat. Hitler had vast resources at his disposal in 1933, all gone now. GD and Svoboda will always be beggars at some richer country's table. Greece is Europe's West Virginia, on its way to becoming its Yemen. Ukraine is like Puerto Rico if its lucky it will not become Haiti. <br><br>Another danger is quasi-Islamic militants that are spreading like an infectious disease across Asia and Africa. There is a wide space between what they peddle and actual religion called Islam. They are simply violent psychopaths. In the best of all worlds the Nazis and jihadis would all go off into a desert somewhere and battle each other to the death. <br><br>This is the curse of the time we live in, the end of the era of plenty and eros; now a truly dark age is dawning. Hopefully it won't last too long. That the Nazis and other killers will die off or be discredited. <br><br>BTW: there were somewhere around 40 attempts made on Hitler's life, about fifteen of them before he became Chancellor leaving out his military service in WWI. All it would have taken to spare the world much grief was for one of these attempts to have succeeded .... <br><br>http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.575732<br><br><a href=#c239113005598237865 title="comment permalink">2/26/14, 9:51 PM</a><br><br>

I think thought experiments like this are great to bring to our minds what, exactly, are our ideals and priorities. I've often wondered if people consider democracy a primary or a secondary ideal; if we truly believe in "the will of the people," then our other ideals may well dissolve when a majority rejects them. So far, Americans haven't really had to make that choice (or didn't think about it too hard when they did), but the day may be coming when it does. If 70% of the population wanted to bring back race-based slavery, as an extreme example, I'd like to think that we'd favor the moral choice over the popular choice.<br><br>At the risk of sounding like a loon, I have to admit that democracy, to me, is a secondary ideal. If it's a choice between a democracy going down in flames or a non-democracy sparing us, I'd choose the non-democracy. The problem, of course, is just what you pointed out: if we make that choice, by definition we have given extreme power to a ruling elite, who can choose to do some very horrible things. I don't really have an answer to that, except to say a risky chance of success beats a guarantee of failure.<br><br>It would be interesting to see if someone could pull off this very same thing, using the same techniques as the fascists, and yet NOT succumb to the temptation toward authoritarianism. I can't think of a historical example, though. George Washington might fit somewhat. I would hope that someone like Ron Paul would too, though he doesn't have the charisma for it. Perhaps we should vote for the Archdruid Party and hope you've taken your own lessons to heart!<br><br>As an aside, I published a novel this week. It's a young adult fantasy novel, so this isn't exactly the target market. It does deal with some bigger themes though, particularly an Aristotlean versus a Platonic worldview, and the struggle between the American instincts toward Puritanism and fierce autonomy. I'd be grateful for any support.

One of the other things nobody discusses about German national socialism is that most of its leaders came straight out of the counterculture of their time -- a lot of them were vegetarians, occultists, alternative thinkers of all kinds. That doesn't mean that every avant-garde thinker is a proto-fascist; what it means is that "he can't be a fascist, he's an avant-garde thinker!" is nonsense. <br><br>Diablo, I'll have to read "Kangaroo" one of these days. <br><br>Thomas, I may revisit that in a future series of posts.

Allegedly in a democracy we get to elect our Kings (by a weird, watered-down kind of representation), so we can get rid of the bad 'uns now and then; but then the unbridled accumulation of wealth results in a permanent overclass whose power spans regimes and often generations; it seems in the US today that neither major party can do or say anything that offends its wealthy backers... so we can't really get rid of our bad Kings :-( bummer.<br><br>I think perhaps I'd like best to live in a Constitutional monarchy with an enlightened and benevolent monarch :-) presiding over a rich and diverse ecosystem of guilds, associations, and collectives, with authority devolving to the lowest possible level with the most local knowledge brought to bear on every decision.

It is, of course, always used to advance the argument that right wing Christians, Republicans and/or Tea Partiers are fascists because they drape themselves in the flag and tend to promote (or at least pay lip service to) the values of Christianity. Lacking in these opinion pieces is any acknowledgement that when Long - or Lewis - or someone else - spoke those words, they were referring to values that were thoroughly mainstream at the time. In contrast, the Christian fundamentalism and the extreme flag waving that characterize the right nowadays have become less and less mainstream.<br><br>However, I am of two minds about the fascist/unfascist nature of the Tea Party. Because America is in many respects a conglomeration of different nations, nations with distinct regional borders and distinct regional cultures. And from a political perspective, Americans increasingly live in geographical areas that are more and more homogeneous politically. So in a sense I would almost consider the Tea Party to be successfully fascist on a local level and unsuccessfully fascist on the national level. Successful on the local level because the movement did find considerable support in regions where the inhabitants were never going to be liberal Democrats but who also felt that the Republicans that represented them were not actually in line with their values. The movement certainly has a streak of totalitarian thought, as well as the apparent desire among many of its members to completely remake society in the image of Ayn Rand's turgid philosophy. But not successful as fascists nationally because their values are not mainstream on the national level, because the largest parts of the population, increasingly living in denser urban areas, will never buy into them.<br><br>You asked if we all would end up as part of the cheering crowd in the last scene. No JMG, I don't have to answer that like you said, yet I will answer it anyways. I <b>would</b> be part of the crowd. I would take tremendous joy in seeing the institutions of modern America dismantled, in seeing the corrupt elites of the country dealt with, even if they ended up being dealt with in an extrajudicial manner. I would take great joy in this even though I would <b>know</b> that it was going to make things worse, even though I would <b>know</b> that I was watching totalitarianism in action and even though I would probably be quietly making preparations to leave the country when I saw that happen. But after the frustrations of the past decade I feel like the emotional release would be impossible to resist. I'm rather bothered by the fact that I feel this way, as I'm sure some people reading this will be bothered by it, but I am being honest about what I would do if it all started to happen at the point I am in my life. Yes, I admit it. I am a very angry person.<br><br><a href=#c2517934651871153326 title="comment permalink">2/26/14, 11:52 PM</a><br><br>

However it also strikes me as being parallel (in some respects) to the Bolshevik takeover of Russia in 1918. Granted, the Bolsheviks weren't 'Fascist' per se (and didn't occupy a middle ground), but Lenin the charismatic leader still managed to channel the collective frustration of years of war stagnation in the armed forces and industrial working class. They too had vast grassroots networks headed in Petrograd (through the Soviets), and its own militia. In a country like Russia where power was centralised at the capital from the palace, collapse was simply a farce reminiscent of 1791 France (referring directly to Marx here). At that time the propaganda notion that Lenin was being directly funded and trained by Germany was also disseminated.<br><br>It makes me think that Indian democracy, for all of its chaos and faults, still stands a strong chance of surviving a fascist epidemic. However it's also made me rethink the populist agenda of the AAP and it's newly elected state minister, the charismatic ex-IAS official.<br><br>I think the crucial message we can all take here is that any person or group that claims to solve all of a society's problems through a master plan in a short amount of time is to be distrusted. Anyone who panders to our collective fears and asks for our loyalty for stability and progress is to be distrusted. Most of the readers know that there aren't any permanent solutions to peak oil and climate change apart from preparation. This should protect us well, but you may as well give us some advice on how to survive/escape a fascist regime while you're at it.<br><br>YJV<br><br><a href=#c3165317325236452654 title="comment permalink">2/27/14, 4:56 AM</a><br><br>

The downside is that we have our own issues over here, of course.<br><br>To start with the trivial first: speaking as an anagram myself I thought "Fred Halliot" was setting the bar a little bit low ;-)<br><br>But to the substantive question of when or whether I'd turn away from the NPAPP... my first thought would be sometime around the publication of Halliot's <i>American Kampf</i> and the first stirrings of the street violence... but then again I find I'm still aligned (in real life) with some movements/issues where the notorious Black Bloc show up. So it's a big question whether the street violence is honestly connected to the movement or just someone free-riding for an excuse, or 'false flagging' it. So I had to doubt myself again, would the street-violence turn me back?<br><br>Then it dawned on me - actually, it's the first time I encounter them, that first little gaggle of leafletters on a street corner who would set off my alarms. Because I am allergic to uniforms. I don't even trust the Salvation Army or Boy Scouts. Once I spot a uniform I am on my guard.<br><br>Next point, which no one has overtly referred to yet, but has to be playing something of a silverback in the parlour role.... it's specifically that the NPAPP, like the SA was, is predominantly a YOUTH movement (and I've got enough grey to call anyone under 30 a 'youth' ;-) )<br><br>There is a meme floating around to the effect that the current crisis is becoming an intergenerational conflict, and I consider that a very dangerous meme. If there is no vertical integration between generations the social fabric is already shredded. It makes radical options easier to contemplate, it justifies ideas of sweeping away the old whether it's old social forms, or old people.... anti-semitism may have lost its social acceptability (morfe on this later...) but could 'Boomers' be the new Jews in a generationally-riven USA?<br><br>Finally, I'm also beginning to think the <b>least likely</b> source of a new fascist regime anywhere in the West is that bundle of violent extremists we call 'neo-Nazis' (or who even revel in that name themselves). To these groups the swastika is not anathema, and anti-semitism is still socially acceptable, although to be fair, anti-islamism is more prevalent today amongst those who harbour any hopes for wider acceptance.<br><br>These people will NOT be the source of any future fascist regime simply because they cannot capture the empty centre. Their cover is blown in that regard. Their populism is too unpopular. In a way I suspect 'Neo Nazis' are closer to a Pike and Musket Re-enactment Society - fascinated by the past, decidedly minority interest and outgunned by modern politics.<br><br>One final observation for now: in the UK only 2 parties have raised peak oil as an issue requiring serious consideration. One, of course, is the Green Party. The other was the British National Party... on the other hand, the BNP were (I don't know their current position) climate change deniers in a big way - ie they went for the 'lefty hoax' meme rather than the 'scientifically skeptical' one.<br><br>So I'd be interested to see if any fellow Europeans think our 'far right' groups like the BNP, Wilders lot etc are a real threat or sidelined by their open extremism?<br><br>--... ...--<br><br><br><a href=#c7776135960932331092 title="comment permalink">2/27/14, 5:39 AM</a><br><br>

Of course there is real and valuable behaviour that this word can refer to, but specific referents have been gradually sucked out of the word and it is now routinely used as a nice noise - a sort of sparkly-space-dust that will fix everything. "Leadership" can overcome anything including the absence of basic knowledge and competence. Anything in the world can be solved with "leadership". Yeah sure. It's used in a way that is too baggy to mean anything: anything good is somehow a manifestation of "leadership" (some folk would insist that <i>I'm</i> displaying leadership by modelling dissensus in posting this comment :) The word is redefined on the fly so as to always prove that "nothing is ever done without leadership". Kids applying to university (in the UK at least) are instructed to talk up their capacity for "leadership". It's become what you'd call a "warm n fuzzy" word, and what I'd call a "hooray!" word.<br><br>It wasn't like this when I was growing up (I'm only a couple of years older than yourself) - perhaps because poeple remembered the german and italian words for "leader"? In your thought-experiment, along with the nice young people and the telling-of-unpleasant-truths, the rhetoric is sure to make hay with the need for "true leadership" and whatnot, and hearing that word will trigger a quick squirt of the warm fuzzies for many people - what could be more wholesome? <br><br>(Oh and "the great turning" - don't even get me started on the use of the word "vision")<br><br><br>[second minor point to follow in separate post]<br><br><a href=#c4440169627764624894 title="comment permalink">2/27/14, 5:41 AM</a><br><br>

After all they aren't <i>real</i> uniforms ... we'd spot those as a bad sign. Just "practical" black trousers and smart green tops. Could be a bunch of charity volunteers. And <i>green</i> tops - well, we'd know to worry if it was <i>red</i> and black. The boots? Not odd at all - could be a bunch of community gardeners, or gay eco-advocates. <br><br>The point I want to make here is a side point about the magical properties of clothes. Fact is, I recognize that the clothes - the uniformity and the smartness and the evident effort, would have a positive effect on me. I have insight into my own gut reaction and can to a large extent discount it (or at least I think I can - I know to be wary of my own feelings of exceptionalism). Most people can't. And the magical properties of clothing work on the wearer too.

The danger is having a movement that seizes upon these issues as a pretext to take down the system of governance. <br><br>The issues with the way our government works are real. The problem is immense. It will take some real effort and thinking to free this logjam. But the problem isn't the system itself it is that we have allowed it to mutate into an unproductive mess. <br><br>We can work within the system the framers gave us to clarify the proper role of corporations within our nation. We can remove the cronyism and kickback mentality of DC without disavowing democracy. We can make the federal government more focused and effective without overthrowing the greatest success in self governance in all of history. <br><br>To my mind the real danger is the magical thinking (pardon the pun Brother John) that if we just get our federal system in line with the majority of the nation's citizens then everything will go back to "normal". Normal being the golden age of consumerism, or US global reach, or whatever. That isn't happening. No matter what we do that time has passed. <br><br>But the very real problems with the way our government functions and the insidious role of money within it have made things far, far worse than they needed to be. At least to this point. The "Peak Oil Dynamic" (to borrow a phrase from a well known commenter) or "Peak Cheap Oil", or whatever you wish to call it has only just begun. A quick on its feet, restrained but effective within a narrow band, central government can help make the path we are traveling much easier. The stymied, unfocused, cronyistic one we have can make it much worse than it need be. <br><br>The problem isn't that a power play by the center is wrongheaded.

And I also believe most of us will do pretty much anything to avoid that necessity. We're doing that already, with the oil wars and shale and the money printing and the messing around with numbers. <br><br>So a period of Fascism could easily come as one last chapter in the attempt to maintain the old beliefs in progress, the American way and the possibility of getting back to some sort of normal. It could be the ultimate in putting our fingers in our ears and screaming to block out the sound of reality calling. <br><br>So, yes, I could easily see that happening. But Fascism also needs drama and crisis and movement to maintain its appeal. It's a hideous but temporary thing. It doesn't seem to be a slow and steady phenomenon and it won't be able to deal with energy reality anymore than our current politics can. Energy was the big motivation for Barbarossa after all. And with limits to war in a time of energy crunch and nuclear weapons, I wonder how a Fascist movement would be able to maintain momentum?<br><br>So I still tend towards the slow, messy break-up theory myself, with different things happening politically in different regions of the US, hopefully with time for a good number of us to relearn the basics of local democracy. That seemed to be one potential outcome of your "how it could happen" series.

I read along with trepidation, wondering who the equivalent to the Jews would be in your story, hoping it wouldn’t be the group to which I belong, but since you’ve taken us up only to the equivalent of 1933-34, I think you were right to exclude that variable, particularly in order to get your readers to understand the era in a Zen-koan-like new way, divorced from the usual top two or three words that come to mind when one considers the Nazi era. <br><br>I do wonder though which minority group would be the scapegoat in the “post-1934” continuation of this story, were something like it to come to pass. I’m afraid there’s always a scapegoat. At one point I would have thought it would be gay people, but since every heterosexual now realizes, or will soon, that he or she has at least one gay person in his or her extended family, I find that less plausible than I used to. (The recent, nearly unbroken string of gay-rights victories in the West is overwhelmingly a simple function of more and more of us coming out.) If I had to wager on it, and I realize this is testing the bounds of your post’s topicality, I would say the scapegoat in the United States will be the Muslims among us. They are the most convenient “other,” and their numbers are, again in the U.S., small enough and often isolated enough to serve as this type of scapegoat.<br><br>I also wonder if a scenario like the one you describe even needs a brand-new political party in order to take shape. Since “Republican” and “Democrat” are themselves malleable political terms that have meant whatever people want them to mean in order to win votes over the past 150 years (think, just as one example, of the “Solid (Democratic) South” and George Wallace running three times for president as a Democrat), I’m not even convinced this type of fascist couldn’t take power within the bounds of one of the major parties. He could brand himself a “New New Republican” (or Democrat) and break through stealthily that way. I think of Vladimir Putin also. He has come to power in the usual post-Soviet way and the scene in Russia is still “pre-1934,” but he seems to be playing the long game, and God/Goddess/All There Is only knows what all will come to pass over there in the next decade (or even, with the Ukraine crisis, in the next week).<br><br><a href=#c3775739871347635125 title="comment permalink">2/27/14, 7:59 AM</a><br><br>

I immediately began picturing a wave of support for a group like this hitting my local ADF grove, or spreading through some of my friends in OBOD. If they were a party that was seriously addressing climate change and peak oil transitions, i'm sure whatever issues I had with them they'd probable even get my vote at least once in that 5 year period especially if they promised to combat some of the laws that provide obstacles to personal transitions(ordinances against front lawn vegetable gardens, off the grid housing, livestock, etc.)<br><br>"Antisemitism and overt militarism were socially acceptable in Germany between the wars; they aren’t socially acceptable in today’s United States, and so they won’t play a role in a neofascist movement of any importance in the American future."<br><br>True, but I have often wondered if popular attitudes towards Islam in this country could take a more overtly sinister turn someday given the right circumstances.

It reminds me that the British National Party (BNP), which is the closest thing we have to a fascist party in the UK, are interested in peak oil. I went onto their web site once and found that they have several pages on the subject. Peak oil is a subject that the main stream political parties in the UK pretty much ignore. It is a sad fact that the fascists in the UK are much more clued up about peak oil and the coming crisis we face than the main stream democratic parties. People dismiss the BNP as ignorant bigots. They may be bigots but some of them are not as ignorant as our liberal prejudices would like to believe.<br><br>I don’t think that the BNP represent any kind of threat to democracy in the UK. Their brand is just too toxic.

Much enjoyed the series.<br><br>I must fully admit that you could resurrect Adolf Hitler himself (and a whole army of Hitler Youth with him,) stick them in black and green, (with skinny jeans, no doubt, for the times) and if he toted the tree of life, and acknowledged peak oil and climate change, I'd probably "hold my nose" (literally, no doubt, with all those corpses walking around) and vote for him. <br><br>------------<br><br>So, during my last alien abduction experience, I happened (in between my disinfect and probing) to browse through the most recent edition of the ever-entertaining Journal of Homo Destructus Behavioral Curiosities. <br><br>Thanks to the Distar's universal translator circuit, I was able to read the abstract for a fascinating study of population overshoot. This study used the predictably instinctive response and humorlessness of homo destructus to evaluate overshoot in its simplest, biological form. <br><br>The authors created similar conditions on 18,272 lab planets (EA-AAA through EA-ZZT) with previously deployed homo destructus test populations, by restricting colony growth through limiting access to energy, land and other resources. <br><br>According to the authors, while 100% of test populations experienced violent population reduction significantly in excess of that predicted by reduced carrying capacity, nearly all populations reduced within predicted parameters. <br><br>With the exception of 2 atypical cases (where population was largely limited through democratically enacted "voluntary" suicide) test subjects relied upon violent and non-voluntary means to reduce population to within new carrying capacity. <br><br>Due to the "tribal" instinct to protect the gene chain, 80% relied upon a "genocidal" response against politically vulnerable groups within their societies to determine new resource distribution. <br><br>In the remaining groups, prolonged physical conflict between social groups reduced population to well below resource limits.<br><br>In 100% of cases, resource rationing was enforced by increasing hierarchical control mechanisms, characterized by increased conformity pressures and decreased behavioral and genetic diversity. Decreased individual choice regarding resource access was universal. <br><br>Human emotional response was measured by the dramatically increased incidence of the human call "fascist!," an meaningless and instinctive vocal response to non-voluntary hierarchically enforced resource rationing. <br><br>As my drugs were starting to set in, I vaguely remember the mention of a curiously familiar case of a late-series planet with a particularly brutal genocide. Apparently, researchers became fond of the comical goose-stepping, gesturing and silly mustache of one of its test individuals, who was eventually taken in as a pet by the lead research team....<br><br><a href=#c4239695426677824159 title="comment permalink">2/27/14, 9:13 AM</a><br><br>

A "hard-and-fast" definition, as you say Nolte was careful to avoid. Your first article makes it sound kind-of like the definition of fascism is the system of industrialized liberal democracy which we have now, but then you go to great pains to point out that we don't know what _real_ fascism is like.<br><br>How about this one... drawing on our discussion here, but I am attempting to just completely side-step the current misunderstandings about how Fascism is conservative or relies on business.<br><br>"Fascism" is a pathology of democracy which occurs when a "tyranny of the majority" arises and then political expediency becomes an end unto itself, causing injustice to rebound back against the majority. <br><br>Fascism is a democratic phenomenon -- it occurs when the populace has the expectation of being represented in government, but that expectation has not been fulfilled in many years because the government bodies and/or political parties have become so polarized, ideological, aristocratic, or ossified that the normal business of a representative democracy is left undone. <br><br>Fascism leads to bad outcomes in history because, in its zeal to fulfil needs &amp; wants which have been un-met for a long time, essential features of democracy such as checks-and-balances and minority protections are eventually cast aside in favor of political expediency. In the real-life historical cases, this tendency ultimately leads to the investment of autocratic power into a single executive or leader, at which point the society can no longer be considered a democracy. By that time, the majority in the middle of the populace may well be the target of most of the injustices of the Fascist system. When the first taste of political expediency fails to solve all the problems of a dysfunctional society, the Fascist regime tends to demand a broader and broader reach for its powers of expediency, leading to totalitarianism. However, the origins and the injustices of Fascism cannot be reduced exclusively to the foibles and bad character of the autocrat, since the majority participated in it during its rise to power. <br><br>Because the Fascist movement starts out by attempting to serve the needs and wants of an under-served majority in the middle of the political spectrum, it may be courted by businesses and economic interests, as well as other groups like religious sects; but this is not its defining characteristic. Because it is a form of "tyranny of the majority", it may attempt to scapegoat one or more minorities or sub-groups within the culture for the problems which led to its necessity; but this is not a precondition of its existence.<br><br><a href=#c6483022383192973648 title="comment permalink">2/27/14, 9:14 AM</a><br><br>

How many of the participants in Hitler's cheering crowds were onetime leftists who had been disillusioned by the direction the Soviet Union and the various Communist Parties had taken? That's an actual question; I don't know the answer. I know that Mussolini was a former socialist, and I've read that fascist thinking involved a fusion of syndicalism with right wing ideas that I think begins with Georges Sorel, but I'm not sure. <br><br>Meanwhile, I bet I'm not the only onetime anarchist who left the fold after becoming disillusioned by the extreme authoritarianism and denial of reality found in the movement. How many of us would jump on board with the NPAPP? It makes use of the same color palette (black and green) as Pacific Northwest eco-radicals and it flies a pagan symbol. It promises to deal with all the issues we care about, but it doesn't make us sit through interminable "consensus meetings" or learn new politically correct terms for everything under the sun every time a new crop of angry college freshmen turn up threatening to purge everyone that looks at them funny. (Actually, it probably does do that eventually, but they'll be politically correct terms for <i>different stuff</i>. For a while we won't notice.)<br><br>It may look like all the promise of the failed movements of our youth, with none of the baggage. Honestly, I think I'd jump on board.

The key to the thought experiment is to imagine yourself living it in real time.

How do you know what to do in the moment? <br><br>To me the best protection is as always, to try to block out the emotional appeal and look at what is really being proposed – not just the issues, but what is going to be done to address them and how that would be accomplished.<br><br>The other aspect is to look not only at the specific issues of the day, as those do change over time, but also the governing system that is being proposed. Is it worth changing a system to accomplish a specific goal?

I don't expect a renewal of democracy, even if that could be set in motion, to take power in any obvious way; far more likely, as people relearned how to make democratic process work for them and became less vulnerable to the nonsense that passes for political discourse today, existing parties would be forced to adapt to the shifts at the grassroots.

My reading knowledge of German is still shaky enough that I'll be reading it in the English translation, but I'm looking forward to it. <br><br>Gregorach, if Scotland regains its independence, it's going to be very vulnerable for a while to such things -- newly (re)founded countries very often are.

Your comparison of the current crop of soi-disant "Neo-Nazis" to a pike and musket reenactment society is spot on -- in American terms, perhaps, they might be considered a Society for Intolerant Anachronism. They've got a way to shock their parents and get attention, and that's as far as they're ever going to get. It's those who apply the tactics of historic fascism to the buzzwords and unmet political needs of today that are the ones to worry about. <br><br>Stunned, precisely -- the current babble about the allegedly magical powers of "leadership" can be understood much more clearly if you simply replace the word "leadership" with <i>führerprinzip</i>. As for the uniform, yes, that was the point -- fascist uniforms from the 1920s and 1930s appealed to the fashion sense and popular taste of the time, so the next round, if we get one, will appeal to the fashion sense and popular taste of our time, not theirs. <br><br>Nathan, that's why in both cases I'm advocating for a grassroots-first approach that starts with the individual and the local group, and sets out to establish foundations on which the future can build. It may be too late to prevent the collapse of what's left of democracy in America, but preserving and transmitting the skills of democratic process could allow a restoration later on. <br><br>Lw, I'll consider it, but it would be a very long list. I'd encourage you to start with the sources cited in the posts themselves. <br><br>Nathan, as I mentioned to Thijs, I have reason to think that a national conversation about peak oil may actually take place. More on this in a later post...<br><br>Will, that's an important part of it. The other half, to which you've alluded, is that a regime that comes to power convinced that it can make the world over in the shape of its ideology is likely to use more and more violence as its efforts to do so run into trouble. If the Great Turning and the shining new future Halliot's followers believe in so strongly can't be attained, the temptation to go hunting for the evil people who are keeping it from happening, or to engage in other useless but emotionally satisfying actions of the same kind, can be very hard for a dictatorship to resist. <br><br>Mister R., a lot of people would. <br><br>Yupped, good. Yes, it's entirely possible that a new American fascism could emerge around the idea that if only we do X, Y, and Z, we can keep the comfortable lifestyles we're used to having. <br><br>Robert, exactly. Democracy always involves corruption, compromise, and fumbling; that's why it's so easy, once it jams up (as it does in certain kinds of crisis), to insist that it has to be scrapped. I prefer basic civil liberties, thanks. <br><br>Mister R., I don't consider the idea of a linear political spectrum to be useful, so no, I wouldn't put them on it!<br><br><a href=#c8779157240163818472 title="comment permalink">2/27/14, 10:43 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you for this; I don't think I would have learned to pick up on these signals if I had not been reading your blog.<br><br>I noticed St. Louis gets a role in this story as the headquarters of NPAPP, reminding me of its role as the location of the constitutional convention in your story of the US empire's defeat. It causes me to squirm in my seat more than a little. St. Louisans seem to have an inferiority complex. I like to tease those who have lived here all their lives that the last good thing they think happened here was the 1904 World's Fair. But our fair city being the setting for momentous events and organizations in your stories suggest that we might be a bellwether for the US as a whole. I know we've played a large role as a test market for new products. Do you see us as a test market of sorts for the post-peak, post-empire US?<br><br><a href=#c8170338340162112561 title="comment permalink">2/27/14, 11:44 AM</a><br><br>

You. For. Writing. This.<br><br><br>Seven years ago I was standing in front of the Reichstag, staring at the Memorial to the Murdered Members of the Reichstag, and to this day I can clearly remember the profound effect it had upon me. I am certainly no fan of members of the U.S. congress, but the thought of a rising political machine condemning them to die in concentration camps for expressing their views is bone chilling. The most recent reports coming out of Ukraine indicate strongly that something frighteningly similar could be developing there. It is important to remember that these regimes waste no time moving from their political opponents to members of the public who also happen to have a difference of opinion. Call me a conspiracy theorist if you will, but with the realization that the NSA collects and stores essentially all online activity, I would be lying if I said that I have not thought about the possibility that my activity and viewpoints today could be used against me in some kangaroo court by a similarly oppressive regime at some point in the future. Awareness of the possibility of true Fascism is, in my mind, a major step towards its prevention. (If prevention is even possible.)

Supervisors took the high density option off the table...for now. <br><br>What struck me was the anger and the vehemence of the "concerned environmentalists" (I consider myself to be an environmentalist in theory and long term hands on practice). <br>There was no room for compromise, no room for discussion--their common theme "YOU HAVE TO VOTE YES ON THIS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE". These were mostly older women and a few men. The militancy they displayed and the dogmatic position illustrated to me at least what quasi totalitarianism looks like at the intellectual level at least. <br>Especially noteworthy was when a mother with a stroller stated that her neighborhood's sustainability committee was against the projects.

Clinton was moderate from 94 on, and still would be, much to the countries betterment. However, other famous moderates, JFK or Ike, would be considered "Tea party nut cases" by today's standards. After all, JFK was a Life Member of the NRA, declared by SPLC and numerous news organizations to be a "hate group". No offense, but I probably follow this a lot closer than you do. The rhetoric even matches something that "Fred Halliot" might say. <br> <br>However, you are right, it is 1937, not 1941 but a scan of the local and national news will indicate the Rule Of Law no longer applies and the machinery is in place for some horrific consequences. Who will use it, of course, is still up in the air. I've seen much of the world, including those locations run by autocrats, to me it looks like the frog is already in the pot. Unlike our current empty suit, most of those autocrats don't go out of their way to stir things up due to the law of unintended consequences not being repealed. <br><br>What a mess eh? However, despite this onslaught of bad news, I am more hopeful for the future now more than I have been in a number of years.

For all the money and effort we've spent on this, we could have solved every issue of pollution. It seems to be a way to procure a lifetime of grants and prestige without actually having to accomplish anything. Seems like a huge misallocation of resources to me.

American enemies are muslims, black teenagers packing skittles and those slippery omnipresent terr'ists. The totalitarian tendencies of the current state are plutocratic, so the methods of control are flexible and profit oriented, but the dollar is backed by the most powerful military ever. They don't need to take over. They have more control of more of the world than any regime in history. The problem for them is the potential for global backlash.

By coincidence, perhaps, a friend today suggested that I do just that. I have been convinced for years that neither is ever going to give more than lip service to any of our pressing problems. But my dabbling in the fringes of third party politics has shown me that they are, if anything, even more dysfunctional.<br><br>Now you present a scenario of an exciting, charismatic extra-party movement that sounds pretty much exactly like what I would produce if I had the organizational and persuasive talent to do so. With a major uh-oh. So I'm compelled to ponder.<br><br>The situation in my locality will not make it easy. Our parties have partitioned largely along racial lines. We are a heavily blue section of one of the reddest states in the nation. My sympathies would be more at home with the blues, but being well organized and an actually functioning political machine, it is hard for an outsider, especially a white one, to get into the organization.<br><br>OTOH, it is quite easy for an individual to move straight into a leadership role in the reds, because there is next to no Republication organization here. That's what my friend did: showed up to a county committee meeting, found himself alone with a few friends who made the trip with him, and got elected county chairman.<br><br>However, trying to pretend loyalty to the national ticket in that party would be a bigger fraud than I can imagine.

I may still be able to get some of my now feral bees back.<br><br>Part of the new direction with bees here involves trying to work out how to get the bees to come to me, by simply providing food, water and lodging that suits their preferences. Basically it is an attempt to replicate the natural systems, but in a way that makes it convenient and abundant for me. Obviously, it will take some time and experimentation.<br><br>After a bit of reflection, it may have been the 5 consecutive days of 40C+ degree weather that knocked the existing two colonies around. I noticed that your place in the video looked quite green. This is not the situation here. I'm going to experiment tomorrow and see whether the feral bees - which killed off my existing colonies - can relocate to a new shady location. It should be quite interesting to see what happens.<br><br>The chickens here are located in the dappled shade and they appreciate it, as nothing wants to be in the full sun on a 44.5C degree day (recorded in the shade). I sometimes wonder what happens to chooks in chicken tractors in the full sun. It can't be good for them as even their water is hot. I have to be realistic about the environment that I live in and intense summer days seem to be getting more frequent.<br><br>Hi Steve,<br><br>I'm glad that templates has sparked you interest because as a system, they simply work. If you look closely at the concept of permaculture, what you’ll uncover is templates. It is unsurprising to me that it started off Down Under. Last night there were 4 wallabies, 1 kangaroo and a wombat all happily munching away on the herbage below the house. Right now in the afternoon sun an echidna is happily eating as many ants as it can stuff down its snout.<br><br>However, I'd suggest that you have a read of Bill Gammage's book, "The greatest estate on earth", before we speak further on the matter. Let me know when you have done so.<br><br>Last year, I was in a bit of legal bother because of my land management practices here as it offended the local council’s sensibilities. As a direct result of that problem I no longer speak about any details relating to these matters. Sorry, but despite the good outcomes for the animals here, I've been instructed to cease and desist from taking any further actions. It is a sad outcome as much can be achieved and it is inevitable that a wildfire will soon come through and destroy what the council wants to protect through its complete misunderstanding.<br><br>The white fellas here would hate to admit that they don't know as much as they think that they do.<br><br>Hi Redneckgirl,<br><br>I like your writing. You have been touched by the Great Spirit. A couple of weeks back you echoed Bill's comment about the simple fact that most people wouldn't know their heads from their tails in a natural environment.

It is an unpleasant topic to be sure, but it is an inevitable situation. Nature always balances her books. It is our choices and narratives which determine which of the four horsemen actually does the deed. <br><br>The Great Depression provides another possible outcome too. I'm unsure how attractive grinding poverty is for most people these days, but it is an option. Albeit, one with a less violent outcome than in your possible future scenario. Although as you've previously pointed out, the culture here is somewhat different from US culture. Mind you, the culture here has changed radically since that the 1930's so who knows what may happen as reality fails to meet expectations for people.<br><br>As an interesting observation, I noted recently that Canada has stopped wealthy Asian's, sorry, people without Canadian citizenship, from purchasing property and thus gaining citizenship. Those same people are - I suspect and I'd be happy to be corrected - propping up the high end real estate market here. Interesting times.<br><br>I don't know whether you'd seen the latest <a href=http://www.theage.com.au/business/oecd-warns-of-new-era-of-low-economic-growth-globally-20140221-337n7.html rel=nofollow>OECD world economic forecast</a>?<br><br>By the way, what is it with the US$4/gallon price magic? It reminds me of the rhetoric surrounding the no more than a 2C degree rise in average global temperature meme that I constantly see, despite the fact that the limit has well and truly been passed here. It is somehow as if it was the belief that is important and human actions are somehow secondary, and if we just imagined hard enough…<br><br>I can assure people that if I want fuel here it costs at least 50% more than the US$4/gallon. Yet still life goes on.<br><br>Just sayin.<br><br>As an interesting side note, I spotted a new bird here today: A <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masked_Woodswallow rel=nofollow>Masked Woodswallow</a>.

This entails being rabidly pro-Israel (fear of brown Muslims, Rapture anticipation, and years of watching too many Hollywood movies), rabidly pro-black (in a broad sense of the Anglo "white man's burden" to civilize and improve the others), and rabidly pro-corporation (because corporations are the ultimate expression of business growth).<br><br>It is worth pointing out that these positions are in opposition to both the disaffected libertarian right, and the disaffected peacenik left. Both of these groups share the general belief that the empire should be liquidated and that businesses should succeed or fail on their own merits rather than live on in endless state subsidy. The only point of contention is the role of the state...with libertarians obviously seeing it as limited, whereas the left wants some role for the general welfare.<br><br>I see these groups as also perhaps being more in tune with the limits to growth, even though the full implications will of course escape almost everyone. Still, I don't see these groups as fascist in their intent.

The important point here is that it's not the "political content" and its expression in specific uniforms, ideology etc. that makes a good indicator for a fascist party; as JMG rightly pointed out, this will change according to the opinions and fashions of the time. Rather it's the process and circumstances of how such a party fills a void and comes to power.<br><br>Regarding the comments, I've seen some people here engaging in what Ivan Illich termed "apocalyptic randiness" - the act of describing some fact or development in the most horrible terms possible, followed by others trying to trump that with an even more horrible development. I don't think that's a helpful attitude; it kills your heart and prevents you from actually <i>doing</i> something (preferably something good!).<br><br>One last note about the novel "Look Who's Back" by Timur Vermes: The premise of the book is that Hitler wakes up in 2011 Berlin with a terrible headache and, after coming to the conclusion that Fate itself has teleported him there, pursues a career as a TV comedian "impersonating" Hitler, gaining a large following and using that to influence public opinion according to his ideology. I've read it in the original German version and while it's extremely funny and thought-provoking, it's also full of wordplay, puns and references to contemporary German politics and popular culture. This means that most of its humour is probably lost in translation, unless the translator used hundreds of footnotes. Still, there are many gems that should survive translation, like when Hitler analyses contemporary political parties and comes to the conclusion that the Green party is closest to his beliefs; the reasons he gives are ridiculous, astounding and perfectly logical at the same time.<br><br><a href=#c6719563543629140527 title="comment permalink">2/28/14, 6:42 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you.<br><br>I appreciate that you updated the rhetoric of the fascist movement to reflect the relatively new taboo on overt racism and antisemitism, etc -- it's a subtle touch that makes the whole thing go down much easier for modern audiences. However, I think you're overstating the case:<br><br>"Antisemitism and overt militarism were socially acceptable in Germany between the wars; they aren’t socially acceptable in today’s United States, and so they won’t play a role in a neofascist movement of any importance in the American future."<br><br>The truth is that anti-immigrant sentiment, Islamophobia, and fear of poor non-white Americans have been tremendously effective political strategies for candidates from both major parties in America as far back -- or as recently -- as we'd care to look. One can even pull nominally "progressive" voters into these trap by talking about how the Arabs treat women badly, or how the Chinese don't respect human rights or the environment. Talk about how working class Americans are losing their jobs to illegal immigrants. Talk about black Americans' "cultural pathologies". Maybe they just need a jobs program... in the form of labour camps. Maybe sinister foreign investors need to have their property in the US seized on behalf of Real Americans. Maybe refugees from Central America and Haiti need to be sent back where they came from, after a lengthy stay in an "immigration processing facility". And have you ever noticed all the rats and garbage in Chinatown? Those people refuse to assimilate and they're making life unlivable for the rest of us with their filth and their barbaric, unenlightened values... and on top of that, their hyper-studious kids are taking all the spots in the fancy universities! (Trust me, I've heard this kind of racist garbage come out of the mouths of "good liberals" more than once, without any apparent awareness of how closely it mirrors the Nazis' rhetoric about the Jews.)<br><br>As for overt militarism no longer being acceptable: I'm honestly flabbergasted. The parallels between the German invasion of Poland and the American invasion of Iraq (with full bipartisan support, mind you) are almost perfect. They're certainly identical from the point of view of international law. Modern Americans' appetite for overt militarism is just as healthy as that of Germans in the 1930s, if not more so.<br><br><a href=#c6028144056196765903 title="comment permalink">2/28/14, 7:36 AM</a><br><br>

Remember that "moderate" isn't necessarily a compliment -- as I suggested in last week's post, when both parties are united in the pursuit of a disastrously wrongheaded set of policies, "moderate" simply means "even more committed to those policies than the pseudo-left and pseudo-right." <br><br>As for climate change, that's probably a topic for a post all to itself. The very short form is that Greenpeace and its many equivalents aren't in the business of solving environmental problems -- if those problems actually got fixed, what would happen to their donations, political clout, etc.? If you remember Friar Tetzel, the guy who went around Germany just before the Reformation hawking indulgences -- you committed adultery, no problem, ten thalers and you go straight to heaven anyway -- you know the business model: the people who cut four- and five-figure checks to Greenpeace are buying indulgences for their ecological sins. <br><br>Joseph, that is to say, you're trying to erase the historical reality of fascism so you can keep on using the term as a snarl word for the existing order of society. Sorry, that won't wash. <br><br>Hal, the major parties are pretty well insulated against pressure from the grassroots just now -- though that may change. Are there any third parties that appeal to you?

Major political parties have become largely a mere "choice of one brand over the other" in our present consumerist society, rather than principles on which one might act in one's own life. They offer and provide status and community to the voter, not service to the nation. And without advertising, what will your party's "market share" be?<br><br>However, there is a way out of this dilemma, and it involves putting out a new sort of "advertising" into the few publicly accessible channels that are still open. Parades, for one, and all sorts of other public displays of presence in the streets, in the parks and in all available public spaces. This would require enormous sacrifices of time and work, and significant sacrifices of cash, of the part of several hundred people to put them on in one city. These people would also -- this is even more important! -- to rule all the displays of presence with an iron hand, so that they are firmly kept from ever becoming at all disruptive. The organizers and supporters will have carefully to clean up every mess their presence makes, and thoroughly to reimburse the Powers That Be for any costs and inconvenience they cause. They will also have to completely shut out everyone who comes just to have a blast, make a mess and stick it to the Man. Completely!!! Even by force, if no lesser measure will work, arranged in advance in close cooperation with law enforcement. If you can start by coöpting significant law enforcement officers into the movement, so much the easier. It must be seen as a movement against the political system, not against law and order in general, if it is to have any chance of working.<br><br>Also, if such a movement and its public demonstrations can become a significant revenue source in a city or town's budget (or for its law enforcement establishment), not a revenue sink, it will be looked on with greater favor than otherwise. If it generates enough revenue for the city, it may even become openly welcomed! <br><br>So . . . who will step up to the plate? Will anyone? If no one, or only a few, will do so, then the battle is already lost and the dysfunctional political system has won. And if the firm discipline in what I describe is not to the taste of those who might otherwise do the work, the battle may have been lost long ago. Discipline and "fascism" are not two words for the same thing.<br><br><a href=#c1865904617508535060 title="comment permalink">2/28/14, 9:30 AM</a><br><br>

Does that mean that the nature of the movement really depends on the nature of the leader (i.e. if the person isn't inclined to autocracy then what we get is more like, say, FDR or Lincoln using extraordinary but non-fascist means to get through a crisis)? Or are the flavor of the solutions on offer themselves the difference, and that's how we can tell in the early years?<br><br><a href=#c3045420866114015267 title="comment permalink">2/28/14, 10:28 AM</a><br><br>

Most of the really effective local politicians, the ones who dominate the dialogue, generally use local government as a stepping-stone to higher levels of government.

Here is my best effort so far. You got me thinking. I do this slowly. Please indulge me as I'm probably a week behind.<br><br>[0) The unspoken assumption: People understand that it is in fact the responsibility of the federal government to assist people in meeting their basic needs]<br>1) A critical mass of people are unable to meet their basic needs due to the economic consequences of peak oil.<br>2) There is a common perception of extreme social injustice i.e. the wealth of the nation is not justly distributed; some starve while others feast<br>3) There is also a common understanding that the reason why the federal government cannot meet many people's basic needs is because the political/social system is in need of fundamental reform.<br><br>If these conditions are met, we will likely find political reform movements arising due to peak oil. The reform movement that will be initially most attractive, and so initially politically successful, would likely contain the following elements:<br><br>1) It would stake out the center of whatever political axis, plane, volume, or phase space you care to use as this is where the votes are.<br>2) It would sell some version of the progress narrative (i.e. “We can make things better”) as this is also the votes are.<br>3) It would try to effect, and possibly succeed in implementing, radical political and social reform as this is what it said it would do to make things better.<br><br>The trajectory of the dominant reform movement would as follows:<br><br>1) The movement would form a political party that would obtain power.<br>2) There would be some initial successes. These would likely involve radical redistribution of wealth.<br>3) It too would start to fail in meeting people's basic needs. It would fail because material regress is certain on the other side of Hubbert's Curve. If wealth redistribution efforts kept ahead of overall loss in prosperity, it might take some time to fail, but its failure is certain nonetheless.<br>4) As this new party fails to meet people's basic needs, and in direct proportion to how much it believes its own rhetoric, its efforts will become increasingly radical and so violent, illegal, unjust, and possibly totalitarian.<br>5) The political experiment having failed, people just muddle on more exhausted and disillusioned.<br><br>Having done this far out on the limb of speculation, I might as well jump right off. Here are some my possible take away points:<br><br>1) Even if the dominant reform movement is not fascist (e.g. not centralist, or not totalitarian, or not etc.), the trajectory is the same in proportion to its own delusion.<br>2) The key weakness of all such potential reform movements will be “progress mongering” i.e. they are not based on reality. There is no better tomorrow.<br>3) Once a reform movement gained power, it could chose to be honest and change its public message to “We can't make it better in the long run. We can only make it hurt a little less right now.” and then make lawful and just reforms that focus on having everyone's basic need met. Failure is still certain, there is no material progress, but at least the central complaint of social injustice is largely addressed and more people's basic needs are met. This reduces the violence involved in descent.<br>4) No matter what happens, in the long run we all sit around campfires in our earthen floor tribal long houses singing kumbaya.<br><br><a href=#c3111198719189748374 title="comment permalink">2/28/14, 2:14 PM</a><br><br>

When there is enough to go around, there are benefits to consolidating power at the national level. When times are hard, smaller groups have a tendency to band together to weather the storm while larger groups tend toward scapegoating and genocide. It is an externalization of sorts: if the people who have to die to keep my life good are not people I know or care about, I am more likely to turn a blind eye.<br><br>You suggest that your scenario is relatively likely. I'm not sure I would agree, though I would stand for "possible." The US is a larger and more regionally diverse country than 1930s Germany, Italy, or perhaps any nation that has ever weathered a fascist takeover. <br><br>We are not yet ready for Fred Halliot and the NPAPP. It will take, as you point out, a few more years of intensifying crisis, oil shocks, and rampant unemployment. With that will come a continued shirking of federal responsibility, with more and more programs cut. Local assistance programs and nonprofits, where available, will supplant food stamps and welfare. States and communities will find ways to maintain essential services that lose federal funding. Through its continued failure to accomplish anything meaningful, the federal government will gradually lose relevance.<br><br>The question, in my mind, is whether Fred Halliot will appear before the national identity is too far fragmented for him to energize the populace from coast to coast. If he is too late, the emergence of an autocratic movement somewhere in the country could be the powder keg that begins the process of national dissolution. Of course, if the autocratic state happens to wind up with a significant fraction of the armed forces, what happens next might be equally unpleasant.<br><br>The larger and more populous the nation, the greater the potential for tragedy. It remains my hope that we can transition from a failing empire to a more community-centered form of governance with a minimum of bloodshed. <br><br>Part 2<br><br>There is a global movement for nonviolent resistance to imposition of control - the open-source movement, the "anonymous" hackers, Wikileaks, etc. While the (mostly young) people behind this movement may initially support a Fred Halliot, it will be much harder to cover up death camps and mass executions today than it was in 1930s Germany. At whatever point Halliot dares to unmask himself as an unbridled autocrat, he will face a battle for control of information: a battle that he will be far from certain to win. As you have pointed out before, a military has no power if its rank-and-file soldiers decide to lay down arms.<br><br><a href=#c3618299305726632600 title="comment permalink">2/28/14, 2:47 PM</a><br><br>

I think for your readers who've paid attention, the point is that Fascism might be clothed in something that appears very good.<br><br>A curious second anagram: Halt Oil. Is it possible a future fascism might turn utterly against industrialism?<br><br>One of the troubles I think in predicting the future based on the past is that once peak-human-control-of-energy has passed, many things in the human community appear the same but in reverse. Particularly, it ought to be recognized that it will be a struggle, in some ways, to survive. Probably, the most successful societies are going to be those that function cohesively, that are cooperative - whether they like it or not. Peak-Energy is kind of another way of saying Peak-Personal-Freedom. Many freedoms will have to go by the wayside in order to preserve survival. <br><br>You wrote in the past about something like "intentional communities" and why many failed in the 60's and 70's: too much personal freedom. But the successful ones of the future: might they be rather totalitarian? Maybe not national fascism, but certainly a polity encompassing both personal and public life.

Some of this has to do with their talk of the reality we live in, economic and ecological, but it's also my own frustration with a system that lost the plot a long time ago.

(For all I know, there may be many in the US, but they probably don't use the word "magic" as openly when dealing with our boring economics-oriented government officials.) Oh, if only there was some kind of Harry Potter Council of Wizards who could revoke this guy's license to practice the Craft."<br><br>Cheltenham, where GCHQ is based, is a really interesting town, I lived there for many years and I have an avid interest in parapsychology, so met quite a few members of the local "occult" community. One gentleman and regular member at the public lectures we facilitated on parapsychology, James Ellis, was a quirky fellow; a spiritualist, and once he got to know us, an avid parapsychologist. <br><br>The town has a high level of "paranormal activity", well researched and documented by the Royal Society of Psychical research (SPR), the Cheltenham Psychic Research Group in the early 90's, and other research groups since. Some of the most famous UK hauntings are in this area, like St Anne's, which I had the pleasure of investigating in the 90's with the CPRG. Prestbury, in walking distance, vies for the title of "most haunted village in the UK". James Ellis would often gave researchers the spiritualist perspective on a haunting, and would sometimes help a spirit "move on" if a family experiencing a haunting requested it. When there appeared to be a change in the Spontaneous Case Activity (sounds more respectable than haunting) afterwards, there was a lot of debate over "magic" versus "psychology" as the cause.<br><br>Cheltenham also has a larger occult community than most towns of its size, and it would not surprise me to know that many work there, it's a major employer in the area. Grinder and Bandler's NLP was very popular with the occult circle back in the 90's, so there may have been occults working at GCHQ for decades, occultists who would know how to put magical techniques into the language of psychology.<br><br>To bring it back to my late friend, James Ellis's contributions to humanity only really came out after he died, although many of us knew the truth years earlier. Ellis developed pubic-key encryption while he was working at GCHQ. You can read his story here: http://cryptome.org/ukpk-alt.htm<br><br>Cheltenham not unique. Col. Michael Aquino of the US army, who purportedly works with the NSA, was the head of the Temple of Set for many years. <br><br>There are a number of distinct NLP terms in those JTRIG documents.<br><br><br><a href=#c6647321474842907024 title="comment permalink">2/28/14, 7:31 PM</a><br><br>

As for reviews on Amazon, by all means distrust them -- and I'd be interested in hearing from any readers who have books on those subjects to recommend. <br><br>Thyme, thanks for the links!<br><br>Phitio, yes, I've been watching that. I wonder when the signs saying "Grillo Is Always Right" will go up.<br><br>Fidelius, the phrase "apocalyptic randiness" is a keeper! I've been calling the same thing "apocalypse machismo" for a while now -- "I can imagine a more hideous apocalypse than you can" is the basic theme either way. <br><br>Picador, I did say <i>overt</i> militarism. Americans love to see the US as the world's most peace-loving nation, even while blowing the crap out of other nations around the world; if you went out and tried to encourage people that we ought to just go out and invade Canada to steal its tar sands, you'd get all kinds of backpedaling -- much as though you'd spoken openly about sex in Victorian England. We may well invade Canada and steal its tar sands, but you can be absolutely sure that if we do, there'll be quite a bit of moralizing cant to justify it!<br><br>Bob, if you wanted to demonstrate that you either didn't read or didn't absorb anything I wrote in the last three posts, you did quite a decent job. Sigh...<br><br>Malcolm, I see Putin less as a fascist leader than as something much more traditional in Russian history. The word "tsar" somehow comes to mind.<br><br>Das Monde, nah, it's the fault of the evil space lizards. Sheesh. <br><br>Draft, fair enough. Look for claims that democracy is the problem, that some people are naturally better suited to lead than others, that all we need is the right leaders and/or the right ideas and all our problems can be solved. Those are the markers I expect to see soonest. <br><br>Varun, glad to hear it. I'll look forward to your story!<br><br>Dave, er, I think you need to get out more often. <br><br>Justin, I agree entirely with your basic position. An American fascism of the kind I've sketched out in this post would be a short term phenomenon, because it would be no more able to solve the spiralling crises of our time than any other system. We may still see something of the sort happen on the rough road down.<br><br><a href=#c2544874676644530 title="comment permalink">2/28/14, 8:39 PM</a><br><br>

The touchstone, as I mentioned to Draft, is the attitude of the new party to democratic process; a third party that could accomplish some good will affirm it, and teach people how to use it -- as indeed the Republicans did in Lincoln's time. <br><br>Ian, consider joining your local Grange, or some other community organization that still uses democratic process. Find some old books on how to run a meeting, and when you become an officer -- which probably won't take long -- put them into practice. A few years of that and you'll know enough about democratic process to take things the next step, which is to get involved in local politics in some context or another. <br><br>Agent, no, we don't end up singing "Kum Ba Ya." I'd tear my tongue out first. ;-)<br><br>Mark, my guess is that we're more likely to transition, with or without a fascist interlude, from an imperial government to no government at all, and any more community-centered form of governance will arise later, by way of the usual (and lengthy) interlude of feudalism. I'll be talking about that in an upcoming series of posts. As for the movement opposed to control, er, millions of Germans had access to information about what their government was doing between 1933 and 1945, and the vast majority chose to ignore it. I'd strongly encourage you to read something on the social history of the Third Reich to get a sense of just how steep the psychological barriers are that such a movement would have to surmount.<br><br>Chris, an old-fashioned monastery is in the strict sense totalitarian -- every hour of the day and every action is under the authority of the monastic rule -- so you may well be right. <br><br>Alan, I'm sure a lot of people in an assortment of German and Italian cities had similar beliefs...<br><br>Cathy, here again, it's one thing to circulate information about a charismatic leader, and quite another to get people to absorb it and think about it. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, two good points. (As for your deleted comment, please put through a not-for-posting comment with your email address -- otherwise I have no way to contact you.) <br><br>RJ, thank you. As I've mentioned already, I think we may be approaching a sea change in the public perception of peak oil, for reasons I'll be explaining in an upcoming post. <br><br>Hal, my experience with the Greens is that they're the last place to learn democratic process, as they aren't familiar with it and don't use it. Hmm. In that case, you might look for community organizations, or see if you can hold your nose and join the local party.<br><br><a href=#c1662111610707536877 title="comment permalink">2/28/14, 8:59 PM</a><br><br>

There's some risks of course - but my gut feeling <br><br>is that it is much less than a top-down - or combined effort.<br><br>Here's a few things could imagine would help:<br><br>- Make votes revokable<br>Technical solution: when voting you break a piece of ceramic (made for this purpose), cast one <br><br>half and keep the other. It is highly unlikely another fracture surface will match yours. Even <br><br>for a 1E7 votes. When things go bad you cast the other half as well, which has to be matched up, <br><br>and your vote is revoked.<br><br>- Have candidate penalties for low voter turnout<br>If the politicians can't get enough people to put something in the ballot box it will have <br><br>negative consequences for them. If you feel like it you can consider backing this by compulsory <br><br>voting (which I would not recommend)<br><br>- Experiment a lot more with deliberative systems<br>e.g. much of the craziness the folks at http://liquiddemocracy.net/ are fussing about with. <br><br>There's hand full of others I ran into at some point - but my feeling is that the LD guys are <br><br>making most progress at the time cause they actually use it in a party.<br><br><br>- Consider saving up votes / spending extra votes (and shutting up later)<br>The idea being that someone about to die could arguably have less say in things that pan out <br><br>beyond his horizon. This one is complex and potentially quite dangerous. <br><br><br>But voting is really only one element in a chain of things that could use some tweaking. Of course it would make sense to start on the young end, and let the oldies die in peace.<br><br><br>I would say many of the core concepts that school ingrains into us are very limiting and not suited to the problems at hand.<br>However I am just one more voice in a gigantic shouting match. Therefore I would recommend, diversifying, recording data, discussing metrics, reviewing data. <br><br>My money would be on integration with working life/project based education, alternating with very limited basics in class room, but iterations in short intervals, embracing mutualism vs competition, very high focus on efficiency and rate of learning (retention &amp; multiplication of skills and knowledge per teacher hour). Tests would be unannounced and at wildly different times. Top students would be required to improve below average student's performance for high score. Special recognition awarded (to teacher) when students surpass their teacher. Reduction of the formal difference between student and teacher.<br><br>As for wealth distribution I've been toying with a simple concept based on the notion that most good things do not come from individuals, but cooperating individuals. <br>If you get money you only get to keep 1/5th and have to pass the rest on to at least 4 people, none of whom gets more than 1/5th. The same rule applies to them. <br>Of course this will not me the optimum way to do things, but I have some hope it could create a few useful incentives.<br><br><a href=#c4616734138157607119 title="comment permalink">2/28/14, 10:03 PM</a><br><br>

Very interesting series of posts, even by your high standards. From my UK perspective, I think such an outcome is unlikely here because there seems to be a default inclination (defence mechanism?) in our culture to refuse to enthuse about anything new, even while we might grumble a bit about what's in place. <br><br>Some of this is apathy, for sure, but a good chunk of it is a distrust of new-fangled ways of doing things (support for the monarchy is a good example of this principle in action). The majority of people are conservative with a small 'c', even if they don't vote Tory. <br><br>This can be profoundly irritating in many ways, but I think as times get harder it will prove a valuable barrier against charismatic tyranny. It is also why I don't believe the Scots will vote for independence this year; 'better the devil you know' pretty much sums up the British way. <br><br>The UK Independence Party have shaken things up lately because they are a one-trick pony tapping into a national obsession (the EU), but they have a complete lack of rigour with policy (their leader has admitted that their last election manifesto was 'drivel'), have been regularly ridiculed in the media and will probably find their balloon of hot rhetorical air punctured after an in or out referendum on EU membership, which could well happen before 2020. <br><br>Reading your comment about Greens in the US, I feel duty bound to politely point out that the Green Party here (of England and Wales, with the Scottish Greens very similar I'm sure) are profoundly democratic, with one person/one vote at conferences for all policy motions (and easy access for any member to speak at debates or get involved with policy working groups), along with clear guidance for local parties, not least in selecting candidates to stand for parliament. <br><br>Of course, there is little chance of any great breakthrough for the Greens for the 'better the devil you know' reasons mentioned above, despite the fact that they occupy left-wing territory Labour has vacated in recent decades and have very little competition there. The dedication required for a 'new' party to make headway at a local level is daunting and takes years and years of (often frustrating) effort. In parliament under first-past-the-post? Even longer. And we won't be changing that voting system any time soon!<br><br>Reasons to be cheerful and grumble simultaneously.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Mark<br><br><a href=#c6560480881643056578 title="comment permalink">3/1/14, 1:12 AM</a><br><br>

Unlike most offices, where most things are verboten, we have pretty lively discussions on the subjects of the day. One of the advantages of being in the middle of the country is that we aren't mentally handicapped by the PC nonsense of the coasts. Anyway, this guy feels the same way as you describe and no amount of reasoning will convince him otherwise. Its interesting because his family spent time in the mountains of Greece during WWII with the resistance, so historical lessons have no meaning for him. "It can't happen here." <br><br>Of course, if the current empty suit was any more "moderate", then it would be 1860 all over again, there is a reason the NICS phones have been ringing like mad since 2008. We've been fortunate in that he is just a fool, surrounded by more fools, despite the Nazi rhetoric. However, Connecticut, NY and Cali bear watching for Ft Sumter in the near term... it could get ugly real quick and the people have had enough of the "limo set" who live in gated communities surrounded by bodyguards. <br><br>I honestly hadn't thought of Greenpeace as an organization selling indulgences....interesting take and most likely the correct one, considering their funding sources. Of course, the NRA has been accused of doing the same for their political operation, ie keeping the operation going for profit instead of accomplishing its purpose and disbanding. However, other grassroots organizations are substantially less dedicated to continuing operations and usually push the NRA into doing the right thing in spite of themselves. I'm a member of most of the smaller groups as well since I'm a firm believer in civil liberties. As Malcom X said "Freedom, by any means necessary" <br><br>It amazes me reading this and other blogs that some are willing to sacrifice their rights so quickly. This concerns me a great deal, much more than anything the fedgov does at present. I'd much rather see an amicable divorce of the states than a dictatorship, even one that had a "plan" for peak oil. As you mention, it frequently dissolves onto firing squads and labor camps although of varying scale. Once civil liberties are gone they aren't coming back without bloodshed. <br><br>I also find the focus on race troubling, I really don't think the middle of the country cares any more, intermarriage of all types has changed so much of this. We're much more prejudiced against people from NY, NJ, Chicago, and coastal California than we are against any particular color...call it "guilty until proven innocent". O being black is literally the only thing we liked about him, but of course we're surrounded by cows so we know what manure smells like. He never won a single county here, both times. Most likely, couldn't get elected dog catcher anywhere either. <br><br>I also find the redistribution tendencies troubling. Has it occurred to anyone that there isn't any wealth left to redistribute? After all, its not like the super rich will ever pay up, so its just stealing from your neighbors and always has been. Not to mention that it has created a HUGE criminal/underclass that expects a free lunch to be provided, no matter what. This is color blind as well since it spawns the ghettos to the trailer parks. I grew up in a trailer park so I saw this first hand. Sounds good in principle, but what a disaster in practice. I have numerous arguments with the above coworker about this, results don't matter, only "concern for my fellow man" does. Although my fellow man seems to have no concern for himself, his family and doesn't even bother to be polite to me. <br><br>Thanks for taking the time to answer these. Hope this doesn't come across too much as late night ramblings.<br><br><a href=#c455259397619092003 title="comment permalink">3/1/14, 2:20 AM</a><br><br>

Though I know it was planned all along, I also can't help seeing it as insightfully expanding on the answer to my comments thread question last week.<br><br>I assume that for most people here, the expected nightmare scenario is rather opposite to the Halliot narrative. That is, a politician who others describe as charismatic (but who gives us the creeps) proposes stupid, absurd, objectionable, or horrible things, and millions of our neighbors cheer. (You're right that "let's invade Canada for its tar sands" wouldn't fly, but under various plausible scenarios, "let's <i>get tough with</i> Canada to get them to <i>stop withholding</i> their tar sands" might.) Expected, because we've all lived watered-down versions of it over and over again. So the warning that real danger could look completely different is well taken.<br><br>Besides illuminating how fascism on the rise might look, the scenario might also help foster some sympathy for people who, due to their views of the world and/or their susceptibility to the thaumaturgy, actually have been effectively swayed by recent-day political rhetoric, and been disappointed by the actual results not quite to the point of reading it as the betrayal it was, over and over again.<br><br>Now, after reflecting on this topic, I have to admit some dark thoughts along the lines of Cherokee's (and possibly Raven's, if I'm interpreting correctly). In my mind those dark thoughts are phrased as, "If the game is Musical Chairs, does the tune really matter?" That's me, stumbling over the line between having a sense of perspective, and fatalism. (One simple, and possibly even correct, answer: the game always has been and always will be Musical Chairs, and the tune is all that matters.)<br><br>Anyhow, add my appreciation to Pongo and all the others who have faced the "given the circumstances, would I support Halliot's party?" question head-on. Consider going one perilous question farther: "Given the circumstances, could I be Halliot?"<br><br><a href=#c8790649368149198223 title="comment permalink">3/1/14, 5:34 AM</a><br><br>

Well I can tell you things are not clear cut in a wider context. <br><br>Have a quick look at the "political compass":<br>US: http://www.politicalcompass.org/uselection2012<br>Australia: http://www.politicalcompass.org/aus2013<br>Germany: http://www.politicalcompass.org/germany2013<br><br>To my mind it is very likely that the use of "left right" brings about an antagonism and deadlock that would not exist if it was not used. And before you ask, of course the plane is nothing that will solve the issue - but I think one can start to think of better representations from this basis. Einstein was surely not the first to say something like: “We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.” I know it is hard. It is not a new problem though. <br><br>I know if I'd be coming back from a convention where I had to represent a bunch of people I wouldn't say: "I was sitting in the second column from the right (or even at -5/-5). On the third day I thought about moving two to the left, but no one wanted to switch seats so I just stayed there. I hope that aligns with your opinions." <br><br>Even uneventful times, perceptions of what is left/right/middle have a way of quietly shifting large distances over time. Usually they do this in a "coordinated fashion". The vote distribution does not reflect it - but a few years/decades later decisions like the PATRIOT act make you see that even though the political constellation is more or less the same, something has shifted big time. In my view this (absence of opposition or debate) is often part of the fast track to scary developments.

Considering that the Great Depression and hyperinflation was vital to the rise of the NSDAP &amp; Hitler, wouldn't a similar financial scenario imposed by outside forces play a similar part in a hypothetical Fred Halliot &amp; NPAPP? Considering that the power of all the current political players is based on a torrent of tertiary wealth, wouldn't they be caught flat footed in a financial/debt crisis as the basis of their power goes up in smoke? Many posters here have made the mistake of confusing control/access to tertiary wealth w/political power, yet when push comes to shove and the tertiary wealth disappears, more concrete political power, like you depicted in your NPAPP's grassroots organizing, matters.<br>I'm looking at the Ukraine situation, as well as other international dustups in Asia, thinking that Russia &amp; China's patience with the US is wearing thin, and that the time is coming soon that they're going to cash in their clout and exercise their own "Suez moment" on the US, whether it involves an oil embargo, crashing the Treasury market, or some other measures.<br>@Chris<br>I'm surprised Canada would do anything to rock the boat w/China or India, considering I thought that cozying up to them would be the next logical step, given Canada's history. Loyalists fleeing the US figure in Canada's history the same way that Patriots figure in American history, and Canada is still part of the Crown, and a constitutional monarchy. It was directly under Britain until Confederation in 1867, &amp; the Constitution wasn't patriated fully until 1982. With the fall of the British empire and the rise of the US, Canada became the US closest ally. The next logical step as the US implodes, and one that, given generous immigration laws &amp; significant immigrant communities, was for Canada to snuggle up to the next imperial power, like China or India. I could see the Chinese helping the Canadians build a wall to protect themselves from an imploding US...<br>One very frightening thing to remember about fascism in the US is that there will be no outside power that will feel the US is valuable enough to rescue from itself, the way the Soviet Union and the US (belatedly) felt about Europe. Any fascist movement in the US would be left to run its course without outside assistance to defeat it, which is truly scary.<br>@JMG<br>I'm pretty pessimistic regarding democratic revival in the US, given Americans ignorance of Roberts Rules of Order. (*&amp;#%@!, there's no "third" or "forth" after a motion is seconded) I mean, I can't even imagine how to impose Roberts Rules of Order on any current organization. With everyone valuing everyone's opinion, no matter how inane or irrelevant, and desire for consensus, no matter if everyone has fallen asleep after 12 hours of circular discussion, Roberts Rules of Order is considered downright evil, since it's geared to shut down unproductive discussion as much as facilitate productive discussion.<br><br><a href=#c6407033717163881060 title="comment permalink">3/1/14, 10:41 AM</a><br><br>

As for Green parties elsewhere, I certainly don't mean to cast any oppobrium in their direction; my comment was directed at the US version of same, in which "consensus" (i.e., passive-aggressive manipulation by a faction with an agenda) has taken the place of democratic process. <br><br>Bob, I'm sure your friend at work is just as baffled by the fact that nothing he can say can convince you that you're wrong! As for the redistribution of wealth, though, of course you're quite correct -- I've commented here several times that current stats on wealth inequality are massively distorted by the manufacture of imaginary paper wealth, which is sold to the rich and is generally worth less than the transient magnetic fields it's printed on. I'd like to see somebody rework the statistics on wealth distribution in the US with all the unpayable IOUs, worthless securities, et al. deleted -- it might make interesting reading. <br><br>Thanks also for the links. It was amusing to see the first guy insist that national socialism can't be socialism because, well, because it's not Marx -- as though Marxian socialism is the only kind there ever was or could ever be.

It's precisely when the connection between the people and the parties gets lost that democracies fail, and either get reformed or fall into one or another kind of autocracy; Polybius wrote about this stuff twenty centuries ago.

Especially if you consider complex psychologically influenced systems such as societies?<br><br>Also, arguing about education is a pretty old hobby of mankind. Surely not because there is no merit to it. However even though I might be able to add another twist here and there I doubt, even if my ideas were "better", that it would reflect in the metrics used to measure progress. <br>The metrics are usually a function of values, which are a function of politics, which is (to a degree) a function of how decisions are made. <br><br>Still I like to teach people and there's usually not a shortage of people who like to be taught by me, so I end up doing it quite a lot. But in academia you quickly run into hard limits regarding how things are done. <br>I have thought quite some time about alternatives, and came up with quite many. The umbrella term for it now is "Big Data".<br>Admittedly there is a pretty wide scatter of how things are done in different institutions and places - but mostly progress is done one funeral at a time. So my preferences are indirect, alternative or subversive approaches.<br> <br>In school - how often did you have the opportunity to change your mind about an answer - and earn credit for the fact that you admitted to be wrong the first time around? <br><br>Most of the time collaboration is punished for the simple reason that it messes up the assessment of individual performance (as if that was fundamentally important). Then after a certain threshold it flips and you are required to collaborate and be inspired by (or copy) others.<br><br>When the teacher asks a student a question in class - does the rest start thinking about what they would say, or do they instantly become spectators in a "psychological hierarchy show"?<br><br>How much of the syllabus content learned in school is useful later on? What is the half life of the content learned for exams? What point is there to announce time or scope of an exam? How does it relate to valuing metacognition?<br><br>Do you get credit if you can point to someone in class who knows the answer to a question better than you?<br><br>Isn't getting by without doing your homework a far more helpful skill to acquire in the world we live in?<br><br>Really, I think all this is not independent of how we talk about other peoples perceptions, and how we go about deciding on issues.<br><br>On this note I should probably add, that I very much appreciate what (and how) Cherokee Organics is doing here: Thanks a lot!<br><br><a href=#c1071555573445669438 title="comment permalink">3/1/14, 1:13 PM</a><br><br>

Even many who claim to "get it" don't seem to be getting it from their follow up comments.<br>Then I realized that maybe I did grow up in a different country. Maybe it's because of my age.<br>Now perhaps I'm completely wrong and I don't "get it" either but it seems to me that fascism is primarily a Youth Movement. Meaning that if I were now asked to define the word fascism, I would say that's it's a Youth Movement with certain characteristics that you've outlined to a degree.<br>I think defining fascism as a youth movement is meaningful because it springs from the political center of the youth cohort (16-35 year olds) not the political center of the nation as a whole. That's where, it seems to me, many of the commenters are losing a key piece of understanding which allows them to reassure themselves, “It could never happen here.”<br>I hope what follows will inform them.<br>Being a person under 40 who has lived in 5 different major regions of the US, I can assert that there is, in fact, a rather large unseized political center among young Americans. We have common ground whether we live in the PNW, the Great Basin, the Rust Belt, BosWash, or the Old South and regardless of self identifying as Right, Left, or far more likely indifferent. <br>Many of us see ourselves as having been victimized by the established order of things (economic, political, academic, medical, social)and nearly all of us believe that previous generations have trashed our environmental inheritance.<br>The majority of us perceive that previous generations came to similar realizations but allowed themselves to be bought off, and we know there's nothing real left to buy us off with. In fact we hear our elders and their leaders plotting and moralising our long term enslavement so that they can get the entire payoff they've been promised.<br>We are also near completely ignorant of democratic process and do not have a particularly reverent view of the "Democracy" we've seen practiced in the last 2-4 decades.<br><br><a href=#c1110738349912725225 title="comment permalink">3/1/14, 3:54 PM</a><br><br>

But if you don't put it into circulation, but instead put it all into Bob's pocket, Bob becomes enormously wealthy on paper, but no inflation ensues. Bob can't spend that kind of money, so it just sits in his pocket, which grows into a bigger and bigger bulge.<br><br>We don't have a single Bob, but we do have a stock market (and other financial markets), and as near as I can tell, these are mostly just a big pool of endlessly circulating electronic dollar-tokens. If you give a billion dollars to a defense contractor, a bit of it goes into the economy, but most of it eventually gets diverted into the pockets of many Bobs, all of whom immediately "invest" the money in financial markets. And there it stays, until we have a "market correction" (a bubble burst) that destroys that money. Ergo, no inflation.<br><br>I have no idea how you'd quantify that.

I love how you put history in terms that can be easily understood in terms of our own current situation. All I learned in school was that fascism was a monolithic tyranny of the majority in response to austerity enforced from outside. History is full of examples of people led by valiant heroes who overthrew a malignant monarchy and then established something far far worse, and the origin of the word "tyrant" was from one such group of heroes. Thank you for making it clear what it is that we ought to be watching out for.<br><br>A decade or so ago, when I was first ordained a Shinto priestess, I was approached by a prominent member of the community I was serving, who wanted me to create a new religion to preach environmental ideals and thereby popularize them. Because we had recently witnessed Aum Shinrikyo and I was aware even within myself of a queasiness regarding religions in general because of their capacity for evil, I had already started studying up on where religions go wrong. <br>Rule one is obviously "don't mix religion and politics," and rule two, I decided, was "beware of new religions." The old ones have obvious hang-ups, with bickering and domineering, but within them, you find a core of dedicated people who know how to get past the petty BS and return to the original ideals of helping others. The new ones usually lack this, and it takes time to acquire this ability. I guess you could call me a "conservative" of the old school. My father would roll in his grave--but he was the same!<br>Have you read Andrej Lobaczewski's Political Ponerology? He describes the dynamics of how well-intentioned movements get derailed by people with hidden motives. The key is that well-meaning people within the movement tend to rationalize what is happening, even if it is the opposite of their ideals, and they wind up going along with it.<br>I do not think, however, that popular movements are the only road to tyranny. Lobaczewski said there is more hope for resistance in a regime imposed from the outside than in a home-grown tyranny. It will be interesting (not to mention mortifying) to see how the coup in Ukraine plays out, where it appears a home-grown popular(?) minority is being empowered by foreign interests.<br>OTOH, there are lots of countries where this has happened and nobody cared, because we could rationalize that they were backward.

Hayakawa, who I've considered a particularly prescient linguist - what is it about linguistics in particular that tends to radicalize its theorists?).<br><br>One question - where do you see the Tea Party in all of this? I do not see the progressives in this country having anywhere near the cohesiveness to pull off a totalitarianism even remotely comparable to Germany's NSD (Mussolini's Fascists, viewed outside of the context of WWII, are not that significantly different than Italy under today's PMs), but I could definitely see the Tea Party doing so, especially as the party breaks free from the GOP orbit. I've noticed a distinctly populist spin beginning to re-emerge of late as the party tries to re-establish themselves in the wake of established corporate backers becoming aware that the Tea Party could very readily derail the status quo that these organizations depend heavily upon. There's also been a fairly heavy contingent of Libertarian presence within the TP, most of whom felt very snubbed by the GOP in the leadup to the 2012 election. The Tea Party also shares a number of characteristics with the Weimar Era NSD party - its apppeal to the former middle class watching as their standard of living erodes beneath them, a strong anti-intellectual bias, a definite appeal to veterans, a love of division politics and semiotic flourishes, and a ready intent to rewrite the Constitutional rules, albeit in a very unspecified way.<br><br><a href=#c3416719244429070119 title="comment permalink">3/1/14, 7:24 PM</a><br><br>

What I refer to is the empty, eerie physical infrastructure of a big, hubristic, oversold project all of whose promises failed. I bet we can all think of one. I'm told there's a multi-acre parking lot in Vancouver where no one ever parks; in Nanaimo, a luxury waterfront condo development was sitting 90 percent empty last I saw; there's the famous Chinese amusement park called Wonderland... Add your own examples, but our current world is full of 'em. And we just keep building more. N Korean freeway system? They are all related in my mind, all are the end stage of a boondoggle or fantasy-based planning process, and I don't know what to call them in their pathetic declining years -- maybe a "boondogpatch"? or a boondogpile perhaps.<br><br>They're a symptom of confident planning for futures that don't arrive, and I expect to see more and more of them in the next decade or two. I include the remarkably delusional NSA super-surveillance-disc-farm of recent notoriety, and -- pace all fusion fans -- the ITER gizmo. One day, perhaps not so far from today, people will be scratching their heads as they hike around these things. If things go better than I expect, they'll be saying "what were they thinking?".

I plan on discussing alternative structures for adult education in a later series of posts -- probably not too much later, as the academic industry in the US is closing in on a crisis that may leave half the nation's colleges and universities shuttered for the foreseeable future, and the current colleges by and large don't teach much anyway. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Dwig, fascinating. Thanks for the leads. <br><br>Ares, people all over Europe are talking about the First World War; it's just in what Gore Vidal used to call the United States of Amnesia that we forget about anything older than Khloe Kardashian. <br><br>Unknown, good. That's exactly what I was talking about, of course. <br><br>Joseph, excellent! Yes, at some point in the not too distant future I need to do a post on the way that financial fraud and the inflating and popping of bubbles are the essential other side of quantitative easing -- they take out the excess paper wealth that QE puts in, producing relative stability. <br><br>Mark, thank you. Yes, I had several people forward me the ITER article -- the serene cluelessness of an energy program that pretends that the world's most expensive energy source might somehow keep business as usual chugging along forever is impressive, to say the least. <br><br>Bill, I'm not arguing. <br><br>Khadija (if I may interject), I delete the vast majority of attempted comments like Dave1941's. I used to delete all of them, but some of my overseas readers insisted that nobody could actually be that dumb, so these days I put through one every so often as an educational opportunity, and respond to it -- as I did with Dave1941 -- with a curt dismissal. I don't engage with trolls; it's a waste of breath, and it gives them what they want. (Did you ever see a badly behaved five-year-old throw a tantrum in the middle of the living room just to get attention? I tend to think of my trolls in those terms.) I'm aware that other people prefer other responses to that sort of thing, and if you do something different on your blog, of course, that's your right. <br><br>Patricia, of course popular movements aren't the only road to tyranny. The point I wanted to make is that they can be a road to tyranny, despite the very common assumption that all tyranny must be in the service of the status quo. <br><br>Iuval, well, German national socialism was riddled with ideas borrowed from the New Age of its time, so it's certainly a possibility. <br><br>Kurt, the Tea Party is an example of a very common phenomenon in American history, an outburst of grassroots intolerance on the part of the rural and small town middle classes. You might read up on the history of the Know-Nothing Party as a good comparison. Since such movements are entirely focused on defending the status and perks of a specific class, they don't have the appeal to get beyond the status of minor political party, and run themselves into the ground in a decade or less.<br><br><a href=#c1817194295361358699 title="comment permalink">3/1/14, 8:51 PM</a><br><br>

I like what you are saying about fascism being a youth movement. <br><br>But I wonder if that is just the historical flavour--youth are usually the first to get discarded, but it seems to me the middle-class is being compressed very sharply right now, which may provide many more of the middle-aged to a new fascist movement.

I really like your comment "We all have the strength to endure the misfortunes of others." I will try to watch out for my own racism more.<br><br>But now for a nice anti-racist story, not to absolve, but just because I already mentioned Canada, and this is one of the most awesome things I have ever seen.<br><br>I got on a bus in Vancouver BC, maybe a few years after 9/11. The driver--and I am not kidding--looked like Osama Bin Laden. Not in a "All arab men look the same" or "all people in turbans look the same" sort of way. In a very specific, could have been brothers, looked a lot like Osama Bin Laden sort of way.<br><br>Even for a sensitive 90's guy like myself it was a little disconcerting. <br><br>And then a very drunk man got on the bus and proceeded to berate the driver, for at least ten minutes. He ranted about how the bus was late, he ranted about the transit system, he ranted about the government. He was absolutely stumbling, sloppy drunk, and he belligerently ranted at the driver for a good ten minutes.<br><br>But then he made some comment--and I don't remember the exact words--about the driver being an Arab. Maybe he should go back where he came from, or something, I don't remember. <br><br>The whole bus erupted, like twenty people shouted him down. A man got up and stood threateningly close to him. I actually got a little tear in my eye at the Canadianness of it all. We all tolerated his drunken idiocy until he crossed our line. He backpedalled so fast it was amazing he could keep his feet.<br><br>Anyhow. I don't tell this story to try to justify not shouting Dave1941 down, just because it was one of the nicest anti-racist things I have seen in my life.

Of course this may often go hand in hand with a wave of scandals (as non disclosure agreements fail), in the later stages it gets more quiet again as the "cleansing" is done using other means. I wouldn't be surprised if you could see the dynamics around this gentleman in other settings as well. But by their nature they rarely come to light as nicely as here.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Noske<br>[...] a member of the socialist movement, he used army and paramilitary forces to bloodily suppress the socialist/communist uprisings of 1919. He thus allied himself with forces that would later turn against the republic and ultimately [...]<br>You could argue that his influence lasts until today - especially if you look at the SPD (socialist party) preferred coalition partners.<br><br><br>@Anselmo<br>When reflecting on a cultural predisposition to authoritarian regimes, I would not want to reduce it to a "lack of democratic tradition" in Germany. Sure the English had a head start with the Magna Carta, etc. But if you look at the hanseatic league you'll find some development of consensus decision making - arguably a long shot from democracy, but definitely progress in that direction.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League#Organization<br>Also here and there you can find the odd republic in the 15th century:<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dithmarshen#History<br>To say nothing of Italian Republics...<br><br>I would argue that the 3rd Reich is just one more instance in a long series of failed anti-authoritarian movements in Germany. The list is so long that it really is no surprise these forces don't have a well developed and effective power structure. <br>If you want, it started with bad news from the French Revolution traveling fast and being heard loud and clear in the upper parts of German society (eventually resulting in the blackened, red, and bronze flag - let's not romanticize here - we fly again today), the 1832/1848 revolt where they got thoroughly whipped - again (those with some sense left for the US), a few years respite, at least for non-socialists (Bismarck), before all being lead to the slaughter in WWI by a GWB-class leader. After that if comrade Noske &amp; company did not rat you out, you had your next chance to get off the stage in the Spanish Civil War. Again you could pick which side would do you in.<br><br>Now if you still had not got the memo after regular thorough political spanking, prosecution, outlawing and eventual failure - from the time of your great grand-parents - you were perfectly free to pull a Snowden/Manning/Assange and collect a Nobel Peace Prize, like this gentleman did:<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_von_Ossietzky<br>He was fairly independent of large power blocks and blew the whistle on "extralegal" (because governments don't do illegal things) re-armament of Germany.

I've been steadily making my way through the archives this Winter, and your writing has been a significant source of inspiration and refreshingly nuanced food for thought. This series on fascism and Weimar America has been especially powerful for me. Thank you for your work. <br><br>One thing that my friends and I have found especially frustrating to witness is the whole “culture wars” business that currently dominates political discourse. As a gay man born and raised in Texas, with many family members who would identify as conservative or libertarian, I feel like I've had plenty of exposure to the whole affair on both an intellectual and a visceral, deeply experiential level. <br><br>I think that there are unnamed, unspoken class antagonisms that the culture wars are exploiting and drawing fuel from while obscuring them. Specifically, I see a lot of disenfranchised, rural, poor white people who truly have every reason to be bitter, but who have a really narrow and reactionary analysis of power, which means that their bitterness is easily channeled towards rather useless ends. Meanwhile, they see these smug, (sub)urbane, often middle and upper class people awash in political hypocrisy, who look down on them, calling them backwards, and seemingly imposing their own cultural values via federal government impositions and the ubiquitous influence of the “liberal media,” which would of course be more usefully understood as the corporate media, but isn't.<br><br>The liberals point to the (very real) racism of these right-wing folks while steadfastly denying their own, and choose to focus on a strategy of crusades of political correctness in speech rather than a structural dismantling of racism on an institutional level. And, having thrown their lot entirely in with the Democratic Party, which has long abandoned pretending to have any interest in the well-being of poor people, the issues that are being pushed forward by liberals, such as civil rights for gay people, end up appearing to be rather bougie and out of touch with the day-to-day concerns of the working classes. Meanwhile, the gay rights movement, which was once very concerned with issues facing working class and homeless people, has become focused on securing comforts and privileges for well-to-do gays. One consequence of this is an erasure of the fact that gay people are disproportionally represented among the homeless and the poor.<br><br>This is but one dimension of the phenomenon, wherein a bunch of red herrings are beaten to death by people who might otherwise find some common interests with each other.

What role do you think vigilante groups among civil society could play? Where I'm from, people have been quietly forming the loose outlines of what could be right-wing militias for decades, or at least they certainly like to think that's what they've been doing. How seriously do you take such developments and trends, and how do you think those trends will likely play out?<br><br><a href=#c1825382807701928967 title="comment permalink">3/2/14, 8:19 AM</a><br><br>

Has our social structure really been disrupted to the same extent as Germany's in the 1920s? They had a horrific war fought on their soil; we only have very distant wars fought by a small minority. Sure we have economic troubles that will continue to deepen. But have we really had sufficently fundamental traumas to basically abandon the whole idea of liberty and constitutional government? Plus, may rapidly-growing demographic sectors have quite different views of American and what it represents than the shrinking anglo majority. So maybe we won't continue on a path that reflects our european origins so much?

IMHO, you just outlined the best case scenario, ie the states are left to sort out our own issues.

To me, the only "fascism" that might occur would have to be a "dump them into the sea" movement promising earthquakes so as to be rid of both coasts. This is already occurring on a smaller scale in NY, CO and Cali with the "divorce" movements. As I said, flyover states are prejudiced against the coasts and vice versa. <br><br>@Khadija<br>I saw this comment and was offended as well, however IMHO, the worst response is to provide a soapbox for the offender, it only encourages this kind of thing. Of course, the MSM promotes this craziness due ratings. However, there is an extreme double standard at work here, reference Justice Thomas' remarks recently and the responses to it. While our current empty suit might not have a job as dog catcher, I assure you that Col West is quite popular, same for Herman Cain. The writings of Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams can rightly be called the ideological godfathers of the Tea party/constitutional movement, although as JMG has stated this may be short lived or co-opted. If I may recommend a little known author, Star Parker has some interesting insights on racism that you may not have considered. Given LBJ's statements and reasoning behind the Civil Rights and various other acts, I think you would be surprised where in the country that you are actually welcome. Cowards burning crosses are properly greeted with hi-power rifles as Robert F. Williams showed in the 50s and 60s. <br><br>We all have friends and relatives that occasionally say ignorant things, plus none of us are immune to doing the same. Freedom of Speech requires that all of us be offended at times, and tolerate it quietly. We all have our "touchy" issues...ie your feelings on racism reflect mine on redistribution. However, being offended should never get in the way of honest and thoughtful discussions/debate.

This is the high Middle Ages, the time of scholastic philosophy and improvements and shipbuilding and agriculture.

Look at pictures of a representative gothic cathedral, Lincoln, or Chartres, or Wells. Note how many statues, stained glass windows inside and outside. Call to mind that everything was made by hand. Look up demographic estimates of populations of France or England at the time. Then ask yourself how, in an allegedly stratified society where everyone knew his or her place from birth, the cathedral builders ever found enough artisans to make the windows and the statues, at what almost every scholar of architecture agrees, is the highest artistic standard?<br><br><a href=#c1444932288890442164 title="comment permalink">3/2/14, 3:47 PM</a><br><br>

I'd point out, though, that there's silence and then there's silence; there's the silence that condones and approves, but there's also the silence that ostracizes and dismisses. That latter is part of this blog's culture; as a longtime reader, you'll no doubt have noticed how often irrelevant blather from conspiracy theorists, cornucopians, etc. gets the verbal equivalent of a rolling of the eyes, followed by what an older generation used to call the cut direct. The same principle applies here. <br><br>There's a strategy behind that approach. Have you by any chance read Worth Weller's book <i>Under the Hood</i>? It's basically the chronicle of Brad Thompson, who joined the Ku Klux Klan and rose to the rank of Indiana Grand Dragon before shaking himself out of it and becoming a decent human being again. One of the things Thompson described was the sheer emotional rush that comes from hating and being hated. He and his buddies would put on their bedsheets and go someplace and start shouting their racist nonsense through bullhorns, and they'd quickly draw a crowd that was shouting insults back at them -- and they loved it. The experience of being hated, of being the total focus of attention of an enraged crowd that mirrored their own hate back at them, was as addictive as a drug. <br><br>I'm pretty sure that rush is one of the core motivations of internet trolls, racist and otherwise. Certainly when I give them no more attention than I would give a turd on the sidewalk, they generally creep away in short order -- and I wonder whether the people who, with the best intentions in the world, believe it's essential to confront and call out racism wherever it appears might actually be feeding the thing they think they're fighting. <br><br>John, that's an interesting point. Still, I suspect in most parts of the country, you'd be more likely to get a fascist movement going if you promised to get rid of California and Californians!<br><br>Cherokee, it's a counterspell -- and one of the things it counters is the thaumaturgy of the self-proclaimed "great leader" who insists he can lead us all to Utopia. As for the belief that the country is already controlled by an omnipotent evil elite, well, that same claim was made back in the Weimar Republic, by, among other people, the Nazis -- their version of "the 1%" was "the Committee of 300," which still gets some play in conspiracy theory websites these days. <br><br>Latefall, thanks for reposting -- yes, Blogger eats things sometimes. That strikes me as quite a plausible parallel. <br><br>Jld, nah, the US puppet regime in the Ukraine is a standard banana republic thug-ocracy, the sort of thing we used to install in Latin American countries all the time. <br><br>Das Monde, funny. I prefer the ones that don't wear turquoise track suits, but that's just a matter of taste, I suppose. <br><br>Ay Kay, excellent. Yes, there's a great deal of unspoken class warfare in the US today, and the "culture wars" nonsense serves as a stalking horse for that -- middle class liberals don't like to talk about the fact that they've maintained their standard of living since the 1970s by throwing the American working class under the bus, while what's left of the working class doesn't want to talk about class warfare for fear of handing rhetorical weapons to the classes below them. My guess, though, is that the ongoing collapse of resistance to gay marriage marks a watershed in the way social conflicts get framed in the US, and that new battle lines may be drawn in the next decade or so.

If you know or if anyone reading this knows of any going on, please share!<br><br>Despite not being sure on how exactly that might manifest itself here, I have felt moved to make certain preparations all the same. Specifically, I've been training in civilian self-defense, and am in the process of becoming a certified instructor. My goal is to be in a position to offer accessible, sliding-scale, donation-supported trainings in self- and collective-defense to LGBT and queer people here in Central Texas by the end of this Summer. My ultimate goal is democratization of the knowledge and skills, and to support other aspiring teachers who want to serve the various communities that they are a part of. <br><br>I don't know where all of this is going, but it seems to be a big part of the path that I am on. One thing I have been trying to hold to is this: I don't want to approach this from a place of fear - or, at the least, I don't want my fear to take control of me. I don't want to serve my fear, or the fear of others. That's as hard a thing to do as any, I've learned, especially given the profound amount of violence I've experienced growing up here. I respect and value where my fear has come from and some of the things that it has to teach me, but I also recognize its destructive power and know that fear can come with a whole lot of baggage from the legacies of Whiteness, enculturation into the Othering of poor rural people, and a regrettable upbringing in the apocalyptic culture of Mormonism, among many other things. For all these reasons and more, I try to hold a critical awareness of the role that fear plays in my heart and mind in general and with thoughts of the future in particular. <br><br>Ultimately, I think folks who have really faced down all the legacies that haunt this continent know that they've never really been put to rest and are hard at work as we speak, and that it's highly unlikely that they won't be playing a big role in the times to come. I'm constantly wondering what can be done to prepare for or undermine the possibility of a rise in vigilante violence targeting vulnerable people, in particular. I think there are probably all kinds of things that can and should be done, and a number of things that probably should not be done as well (things to be learned from history, etc). I'd like to hear if you or anyone else has anything to say on that...<br><br>Meanwhile, it's been a miserable, uncharacteristically cold day here, and I have enjoyed spending it cooped up in my room and going through the archives of your blog. It's been really great. Thank you for your work!<br><br><a href=#c7813035406781967466 title="comment permalink">3/2/14, 5:50 PM</a><br><br>

I appreciate it.<br><br>@Myriad,there's no need for any apologies.<br><br>@Ruben, I apologize in advance for my long-winded reply to your comment.<br><br>I agree that right now, this very moment, is the time to start building community. At the risk of further ruffling feathers, I would submit to you that this protective "umbrella" has <i>already</i> started going away. And that the possible future members of a potential American Golden Dawn are already in existence. They just don't have the sort of overt influence currently possessed by the Greek organization. Yet. [And hopefully, not for a very long time. Best of all would be never.]<br><br>From what I can tell, certain trends are already in motion, there just aren't any announcements. And these trends aren't playing out according to the neat little scripts that pass for current political discussion in the country. Various minority groups are oppressed in one context; and oppressors of other minority factions in other contexts.<br><br>Here's one example of what I mean. Ay Kay said, <i>"Meanwhile, the gay rights movement, which was once very concerned with issues facing working class and homeless people, has become focused on securing comforts and privileges for well-to-do gays."</i> While the well-to-do [White] gays who appear to control the gay rights movement focus on issues that affect affluent gays, the whirlwind of <a href=http://rodonline.typepad.com/rodonline/hatecrimes/ rel=nofollow>violent hate crimes</a> committed against Black gays and lesbians in the African-American community continues.<br><br>Meanwhile, the <a href=http://thesocietypages.org/colorline/2008/11/12/racism-and-other-issues-among-gay-marriage-supporters/ rel=nofollow>racism noted among White gay marriage supporters</a> continues.<br><br>Meanwhile, at least one noted gay WM activist-pastor and his partner felt the need <a href=http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_war_on_gays_20120528 rel=nofollow>to flee the South and seek refuge in California</a>. I doubt they're the only gays or lesbians who are quietly running away from Southern or rural regions of the country.<br><br>While affluent [White] gays appear focused on celebrating various celebrities coming out, the ground is shifting under their collective feet. In a bad way. This seems clear to me even as a straight woman. I think this shifting ground applies to a lot of folks, including those who aren't members of minority demographics.<br><br>The time to assemble one's community or personal "tribe" is right now. <br><br>A couple of years back at an African-American blog, a guy said that he felt BW were being “programmed” to artificially want marriage; and asked somebody to explain what “real” value marriage has.<br><br>I asked him to do the following thought experiment. To picture himself becoming homeless as a result of a Katrina-like emergency, or something that lasted longer such as The Great Depression. I asked him, among the following list of persons, who would be most likely to feel some obligation to help him and take him in during such an emergency? And who would be most likely to feel obligated to help him over the long run?<br><br>1-Total strangers?<br>2-Neighbors?<br>3-Work acquaintances?<br>4-Friends?<br>5-His one-night-stand's parents and extended family members?<br>6-His casual girlfriend’s parents and extended family members?<br>7-His out-of-wedlock-child's mother's parents and extended family members?<br>8-His wife’s parents and extended family members?<br><br>He didn’t have an answer. It always amazes me when people don't see the relationship between a lack of solid connections to other people and homelessness, hunger/food insecurity, etc.<br><br>Kindest regards,<br>Khadija<br><br><a href=#c5047329197775001048 title="comment permalink">3/2/14, 6:21 PM</a><br><br>

From the homeland it is all too clear that we used to send our criminals to Oz and our fanatics to America. My own bloodline looped out to Oz and back, so please take what I say with a pinch of salt there ;-) My however-many-greats grandaddy would have swung if he'd stayed home....<br><br>US politics I find particularly confusing: one lot calling the others 'socialists' when to my mind the choice between them is right-wing or even more right-wing; red on the right and blue to the left - where did that come from???; 'conservatives' who are really radicals, 'progressives' who go nowhere new, States rights trumping human rights ... aagh, it's all too much! Really makes me wonder how much European politics is misunderstood over there, too.<br><br>Anyway, to the point: fascism as a populist movement. Britain doesn't have a particularly distinguished record on this front. Firstly, please don't imagine Wallis Simpson was the *real* reason Teddy 8 went west in 1936. I (on the learned advice of of a historian friend) believe he was advised that the British 'people' wouldn't accept a Nazi sympathiser on the throne should the by-then-inevitable war begin (this is a good point for tinfoilers to ask questions about the failed assassination attempt in July 36...) <br><br>Admittedly Mosley had a few working-class followers, but by and large, British fascism of the 1930s revolved more around stately homes and landed titles. One or two government ministers had to be 'promoted sideways' so that their allegiances cause minimal embarrassment, too. Poor Oswald always imagined himself a shoo-in as the Third Reich's go-to-guy in the event of a successful outcome of Operation Sealion. Alas, Adolf always regarded him as a joke and apparently preferred the aforementioned Teddy for his sockpuppet when the time came.<br><br>So, the question is, given that fascism is a revolutionary and populist trope, why were so many British aristocrats (the true-blooded definition of 'conservative' if there ever was one) were so attracted to Nazism in the 1930s? Was it the jaded naivete of aristo youth, or just a case of 'anything but Bolshevism'?<br><br>Anyone interested in the unholy mess that was British politics in the 1930s can find no better starting place than googling 'Mitford', the whole spectrum in one family ;-)<br><br>One last thought: for those wrestling with the idea of whether the current situation is fascist or not might do well to look up the idea of the "Deep State" - seems to tie together the security state and economic oligarchy - I'm not decided yet, but looks convincing on first sight.<br><br>Final final: Putin has played a blinder again. My guess, it will end up with no war, but Crimea will be part of Russia again. They will not give up Sevastopol. Anyway, who was it said in 2008 "Ukraine is not a country"? Go on, guess......<br><br>--... ...--<br><br>Spooky captcha: crusades mlitio<br><br><a href=#c632749807131015122 title="comment permalink">3/2/14, 6:24 PM</a><br><br>

The word <i>realpolitik</i> comes readily to mind. <br><br>Steve, I put that into Star's Reach because that's one of the things that happens quite reliably in dark ages -- ethnic divisions that used to be major political issues dissolve, as people do what they have to do to get along and survive together. That's why, for example, the ramshackle population of refugees who ended up in the western mountains of the old Roman province of Brittania dropped all their old ethnic labels and started calling each other <i>Cumbrones</i>, "fellow-countrypeople" -- that's <i>Cymry</i> today, the word the Welsh use for themselves. <br><br>Tony, it's exactly because fascism was an aristocratic affectation in Britain that it could be, and was, crushed so easily by the political establishment. It had no real roots, no appeal to the masses, and so no actual strength. My guess, though of course I wasn't there at the time, is that it was the last gasp of the old aristocracy as the last of its former power was being pried out of its hands by the new ruling class of business magnates.<br><br><a href=#c5753436256450230340 title="comment permalink">3/2/14, 9:12 PM</a><br><br>

The most important things I hear tend to be from word of mouth: I'm from Chicago, which has a large number of different ethnic populations. I have friends, professional colleagues and general acquaintances who are 1st &amp; 2nd generation ethnic Americans. They know that I'm very interested in hearing about developments in their [or their parents'] countries of origin. So they make a point of telling me about the things they hear from relatives who still live in their countries of origin.<br><br>In terms of the Golden Dawn situation, a couple of my friends are Greek-Americans. Last summer one of them went on a long vacation in Greece with her husband &amp; kids. Her parents and her husband's parents are all Greek immigrants. She and her husband are fluent, native speakers in Greek. They stayed with various relatives in different parts of Greece while they were visiting. <br><br>Quick summary of their impressions of Greece last summer: She saw indications of a lot of free-floating anger, &amp; disturbing Golden Dawn-related street activities while staying with relatives in Athens. She said the overall atmosphere was also economically distressed but emotionally healthier (less scary and on-edge) in a village where another set of her relatives live.<br><br>I don't have any answers other than to emphasize how important it is to assemble a mutually supporting group, collective, community, "tribe," whatever one wants to call it. From everything I've heard and read, self-defense (and other types of) training is good. Having a group you can count on is vital. Lone wolves don't make it.<br><br>On a practical level, I've found many of the posts by <a href=http://shtfschool.com/security/suburban-survival/ rel=nofollow>this blogger (who is a survivor of the Balkan wars)</a> to be eye-opening.

I wasn't aware of that, but it seems to me now to be an obvious tactic. It's what I'd do anyway... It is very interesting and I'll have to read up on that history.<br><br>I mentioned that poverty is a viable option to the scenario that played out in your essay.<br><br>However, I might have mentioned that many years ago I was put in charge of a company which had been rocked by both fraud and dysfunction with a brief that it had to get back onto a sustainable and functional footing - somehow. Not an easy task and possibly responsible for some hair loss!<br><br>I know you like third options, so I thought that it may be worth mentioning the one that I took at that company which is what I politely call, "a reality talk". I took every single stakeholder aside and discussed the problems openly and mapped out some difficult choices and asked for them to seriously consider those.<br><br>After some time, the business was put back on a sustainable footing. However, it involved costs for all stakeholders, myself included.<br><br>It worked for a few years, but not long term because the owner eventually decided to strip mine the business for tax reasons, but that's a whole different story...<br><br>Perhaps once facts on the ground for the majority no longer match the rhetoric, a "reality talk" dialogue with the public could be opened. It has the added advantage of working with the system as it stands in place.<br><br>Isn't this what happened in the US during the Great Recession? Obviously such a change would have to curb the worst of the corruption whilst at the same time lowering the populations expectations.

Situation there is very complicated, resembling some ways pre-split Yugoslavia. First of all, West and East Ukraine do not have lot in common. In the West there are large parts that never belonged to the Russian Empire proper, like Subcarpathian Rus and Galicia. These areas were annexed by Russia after the Second World War, mostly but not exclusively from Poland. In the East there are territories which have been purely Russian since the 18th century like Crimea, Odessa in the South and whole of the East. They were artificially thrown together by all-unionist Communist Party during Soviet era. Crimea was attached to Ukraine only in 1954, command to this move was given by head of Party Secretariat Nikita Hruštšov . Of course this was purely polite gesture with no true meaning at all back then, as local state-level hybrid Party machineries were under unwavering rule by all-unionist Party, KPSS. As CCCP fell, present-day Ukraine was born with deep fault lines already build in. I believe that the birth of Transnitria "independence" with it's rather peculiar government was the first manifestation of that fault line. Transnistria, that's the place to be...<br><br>Even if 2004 election was 51-44 to Juštšenko and the 2010 election was 49-45 to Janukovytš, the electoral breakdown by oblasts reveals a rough 50-50 split among the population. Still, only three out of more than 25 regions showed a 50-50 split. Instead one can observe clear geographical fault line splitting Ukraine in two. The West around the city of Lviv support for Juštšenko at rates of more than 90%. The East showed precisely the opposite numbers, with Donets oblast giving 96.2% for Janukovytš in 2004. The oblasts show a striking split in the middle as well, if they are reaching to both sides of ethnic fault line geographically. As banker fro politicians, Rinat Akhmetov was ”persuaded” earlier this year to withdraw his support from Janukovytš, door was left open for open streetfighting. <br><br>There are quite interesting characters among original protesters, like Svoboda leader Oleh Tiagnibok. I presume those readers of this blog who are wholeheartedly supporting Ukraine freedom fighters, would label him as ”extremist” if he would live in the US, so deeply are grappling irons of Western liberalism been embedded into their souls. I personally take no sides in this one. Then there is of course this ”right sector”-movement among protesters. Membership of it and ”the firm” among Kiova Dynamo supporters seems to be almost identical. For those uninitiated in European football, ”the firm” means militant, organized fighting wing among supporters of any football club, which actively seeks confrontations with ”the firm” among rival club's supporters during and after football matches. <br><br>I have long known that those guys are tough, ready to take and give some punishment, but I never thought they would initiate the revolution. We live in the strange world, indeed. <br><br>There would be a lot more to say about situation in that long-suffering region of Great Steppes, but I actually just mean to say that situation in the Ukraine seems to be very muddy and chaotic if one has actual background information, instead of Ingsoc approved PC news. Any sensible division into ”good guys” and ”bad guys” is hard to do for the outsider. Everything is complex and brittle, and roots of sectarian hatred are buried very deep into the fertile soil of the past, moistened by blood spilled in huge, huge amounts. Sad situation, indeed.<br><br><a href=#c7428147919127786432 title="comment permalink">3/3/14, 7:16 AM</a><br><br>

What freedom of speech requires is that we never try to suppress offending speech, either by state power(censorship) or by some other means. I completely regard it as my power and privilege, and others' power and privilege, to challenge offending speech with speech. (Although 'Don't Feed the Trolls' is still almost always wise policy.)

Even Mr Greer dismissed it as simple snarl and that isn't far wrong. Both the American Left and Right treat it that way today but in its original context it has a very carefully constructed definition and I have seen a lot of comments in the last three weeks that very strongly bring this definition to mind.

The States/West has never been perfect, but we're in danger of losing everything due to all this "wallowing in sentiment". Excellent way to put it BTW. <br> <br>@Unknown Deborah<br>The difference between "extremist" and "hate" groups is merely a matter of terminology and they have called Civil War re-enactors "Neoconfederates" and the "border vigilantes" just want the law enforced so this country isn't destabilized. I do as well, and my wife is a Mexican citizen. <br><br>As you say, the NRA gives everyone a chance to speak, we aren't selective but truly a single purpose organization. GOA tends to take the longer view, ie play chess rather than checkers. <br><br>Regarding JFK, he was much more "extremist" in his views than for example, Reagan when he was governor of Cali. Yes, at one time the NRA did support basic controls (GCA68) and assisted with the implementation the NCIS (94?). However, that level of trust no longer exists, on any level, so welcome to the unintended consequences. Plus, we know this path just doesn't work, ask Chicago or even better....the new Detroit police chief. This knowledge is the legacy of the crime ridden 70s and 80s. Most of the laws presently being overturned/thrown out were passed then. Its important to remember that high school sports traditionally had rifle teams competing with Springfields and Garands, not the ugly Evil Black rifles" or as its know in the community... "poodle shooter". <br><br>Ike wasn't angry because things weren't where they are now....I'm not that old, but from reading about him appears he was a man of principle and high integrity. I'd be okay with high <b>corporate</b> tax rates as well, but that horse has already left the barn.....Wall Street has already cannibalized Main Street on a bipartisan basis. <br><br>@Khadija. You're welcome. I'm a big fan of Selco's blog as well, very informative on the little things. Being stationed in Germany in the 90s, I missed going to Sarajevo by a coin flip....I got to go to France instead. My coworker who did go had quite a few horror stories. If you can find the storied about cop who "adopted" the 7 orphans, its a very good one. Redemption and the human spirit manifests itself in strange and wonderful ways, even in the middle of hell. <br><br><br>For those who like to degrade the "South" or flyover country, here's how we see you, expressed more eloquently than I can.

Just as the attempted coup against Gorbachev was used by an ambitious Yeltsin to break apart the Soviet Union, I fear that some ambitious regional US politician will take advantage of a deep and acute crisis to propel himself to leadership, not of the US as a whole, but to a regional successor state by fomenting a breakup of the US. The sentiments I've read here and elsewhere - mistrust or contempt for those coastal elites/Southerners/flyover country/Yankees/Texans/Californians/New Yorkers - will be used to lure enough people into thinking that they'd be better off divorced from the rest of the nation. If that then takes place, the economic crash would be so severe that I could easily see several of the successor states turning fascist, especially since the Constitution would have been abandoned by that point. <br><br>Just a thought, but one inspired by all the regional hatred I've read in the last few years.

Snarl words are frequently used to shutdown/derail legitimate discussions by would be tyrants or those who profit from problems remaining unsolved. Any community requires tolerance and none of us are immune from the occasional "foot in mouth" disease. What may be offensive to me, may not be to you but everyone should be able to voice their opinions, within JMG's rules as moderator, without worrying about touching off a firestorm. After all, this isn't Zerohedge, where destructive criticism has evolved to a high art. <br> <br>If Khadija lived in my neighborhood and sounded a "powder alarm" because some morons were burning a cross, or had similar plans, in her yard, I'd be happy to show up and properly "welcome" them, so would most of my neighbors. <br><br>Judging by the content of her old blog, she'd be a good neighbor which is more than I can say about some people I deal with everyday, even though I may have more in common with them on the surface, like the coworker I mentioned.

If not, you realize, you've just undercut your own claim that silence isn't an appropriate or effective tactic. ;-)"</i><br><br>Oh yes, I saw your comment. I try to think before speaking. {smile} And I needed to take some time to think through my reactions to your comment. While also meditating on my reactions to Bob Smith's serene assurances that racism is no longer a significant issue in the middle of the country. Not to single him out; that's a claim that I see and hear with increasing frequency. Typically from White men. Somehow, I don't see or hear that claim being made by many African-Americans.* <br><br>[*Side note: The type of right-wing and/or Republican and/or self-proclaimed "conservative" African-Americans that Bob cites are generally perceived by mainstream African-Americans as a combination of quislings, grifters and hirelings who will say whatever their White conservative paymasters want them to say. They're not respected; and for the most part, the only people who cite or care about their utterances are non-Black, conservative outsiders. They are non-entities among mainstream African-Americans.*] <br><br>Again, at the risk of ruffling feathers:<br><br>In terms of the <i>"It's all good now, forget about all that past yuckiness, nowadays we're 'post-racial' in "Heartland America"</i> assertions: It's very easy for (presumably) straight White men to assure those folks who don't fall into those categories that racism and other forms of bigotry are no longer a significant factor. <br><br>Well . . . I wouldn't be willing to bet my emotional well-being (much less, my physical safety) on that. Some of my relatives were pioneers in integrating a previously all-White suburb. I wouldn't wish their or their children's experiences on anybody. How would the "typical" straight WM know how racist his area is? He's not one of the people who would be subjected to it.<br><br>I suspect a similar dynamic applies to your argument about <i>"the verbal equivalent of a rolling of the eyes."</i> That sort of a response to a racist White troll might be sufficient to maintain an environment that's reasonably safe for you and other straight WM. Because you're not among the primary target demographics of a racist White troll.<br><br><a href=#c8144195292217732705 title="comment permalink">3/3/14, 8:57 PM</a><br><br>

The absence of a firm rebuke allows the needle to keep getting pushed further and further in terms of acceptable public behavior.<br><br>Our different views are probably based on having a different set of experiences. I feel that certain types of trolls should be given a more stern rebuke as they're quickly sent packing out the door (and out of the conversation). <br><br>Like I said earlier, I agree that it's not good to feed the trolls and let them derail discussions. And that it's not good to give trolls the emotional high of a protracted verbal fight. <br><br>However, you can afford to be gentle and subtle with racists. Because they're not a threat to you. Similar to how---on a purely individual level---men can better afford to be gentle, subtle, and serene when responding to comments from male commenters in support of rape, domestic violence, etc. Of course, a healthy man doesn't like that type of talk, but it's not a threat to <i>his</i> personal security.<br><br>When I was actively blogging, I found that I couldn't afford that type of subtle and gentle response. Neither can many others who are members of targeted demographics. <br><br>I don't know how menacing your trolls are to you (I hope and pray not at all). From what I can tell, women bloggers are more likely to have menacing and threatening trolls. This was discussed in the Washington Post article <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/29/AR2007042901555.html?referrer=emailarticle" rel=nofollow>Sexual Threats Stifle Some Female Bloggers</a>. <br><br>A verbal eye roll was not sufficient to get some of my previous [deranged sexist Black male] trolls off my online back. Nor was it sufficient to discourage them from trying to harass other [women] commenters. Other African-American women bloggers I knew had similar experiences with deranged sexist trolls. More than a few of us had to invest in IP-tracking software, and exchange IP addresses of particularly nasty and threatening trolls that were popping up at our blogs. <br><br>Ultimately, an FBI field office was contacted. And then, somehow . . . mysteriously, the bulk of the deranged sexist trolls regained enough of their sanity to discover that perhaps their prior behavior was unacceptable. <br><br>It seems the couple of sternly chastised trolls apparently spread the word to other deranged sexist wannabe trolls that . . . just maybe . . . certain types of behaviors are unacceptable. And so the harassment stopped as pertains to the circle of BW bloggers I was acquainted with.<br><br>So, when I hear folks like Bob make tranquil and serene comments about <i>"Freedom of Speech requires that all of us be offended at times,"</i> my reactions are based on a whole different set of experiences than what he's probably had. Again, not to single him out---I'm singling out his arguments because I hear them a lot from WM who've apparently never seriously been on the receiving end of various "isms." <br><br>And Bob's point of view makes sense for somebody in that position. Let me stress that I'm <strong>not</strong> condemning his point of view because it works for him; and makes sense in <i>his</i> context. I'm simply saying that it doesn't make sense or work for <i>me</i> or others who are similarly situated.<br><br>Similarly, JMG, I hear you. I "get" what you're saying. In terms of racist trolls, the gentle verbal eye roll is probably sufficient to maintain an atmosphere that's tolerably safe for you and others who are similarly situated (straight WM). I don't believe the gentle verbal eye roll is sufficient to maintain a public atmosphere that's tolerably safe for me (and others who are similarly situated).<br><br>Kindest regards,<br>Khadija<br><br><a href=#c5133425194227342107 title="comment permalink">3/3/14, 9:06 PM</a><br><br>

One thing most US citizens don't understand, if my limited experience about them is correct, is how huge and interconnected these shadow organizations revolving around football clubs are in Europe. Clubs are representing some locality and some segments of people with ferocity not seen in long time in actual politics. I never thought they would go political, but now it has happened. It seems that in the Ukraine they have tipped balance of world politics to direction it would not have gone without them. Escalation of violence at protests was mostly attributed for ultras, aka firm boys, of FK Dynamo Kyjiv. That's amazing feat for a football firm, to change course of the world history.<br><br>Being regular attender of my local football club's games and after seeing many matches with international adversaries with quite intense atmosphere, I have tried to capture at least little bits of that raw emotion and feeling of belonging characteristic for European football stadiums. Mostly it's positive thing, but when things get out of hand, well...then they truly get out of hand.<br><br>I deleted my earlier post trying to do this, because I do not want to offend anyone at your side of the pond. That seems to be quite a hard task for a person coming from my background, American taboos and sensitivities being alien for me.

Even worse was that it was solely directed at me, who was merely the closest authority figure to hand.<br><br>However, they miscalculated because at that point I responded immediately by sacking (a beheading! hehe!) the most annoying and clearly the biggest threat to me and thereby making an example for the remainder that I was not be tooled with.<br><br>It was a lesson that was absorbed by the remainder without further explanation too. I was disturbed too that it gave me their loyalty, at which point I then had to change hats and put on my healer hat and rebuild them into a functional team and company - along with all of the other problems.<br><br>I got to see the world for a few moments of my life without all of the social niceties which make it a pleasant place to be.

If you imagined an archetypal British pub, this one really isn't far off: it serves real ale, has a blazing log fire all winter, and is popular with locals from all walks of life, from high court judges, to directors of MNCs, through to bricklayers, agricultural labourers, and the permanently unemployed - with everyone interacting equally.<br><br>On this occasion, as I sat in my usual seat (being a regular), the table next to me was occupied by a group of men I'd never seen before. The dominant character was clearly a fleshy man in his fifties. He was surrounded by a group of younger men, and there was definite edginess to them all. To my astonishment, over the next couple of hours, a procession of other regulars came over to greet this man with a deference I simply didn't associate with them.<br><br>Someone later clued me in, in a whisper. This was a senior member of the local 'firm' of football hooligans, with his minders.<br><br>At the time, I'd recently been reading here on TAR about the role of communities and networks in an age of decline. (It was that discussion that possibly led to me coming to Russia, but that's another story). I'd been thinking about the role some of the established local networks, such as the Young Farmers or the local fox hunt, might play. I suddenly realised that I had completely overlooked that an organised and extremely violent group already existed in the city only a short drive away; any consideration of managing collapse in my local community was going to have to consider their proximity.<br><br>So, Juhana: yes, you've put your finger squarely on an issue that most European countries will need to think hard about.

As a Hispanic male, I have heard plenty of racist sentiments coming from both whites and blacks and in my experience, both groups appear to be equally inclined towards racist attitudes about other ethnicities and races. There’s plenty of racism and bigotry to go around, and no group is blameless or immune to these tendencies. Sadly, Martin Luther King’s dream of a society in which people are judged not by the color of their skin but the content of their character is likely to remain a dream, because it goes against some of the deepest instincts of the human species.<br><br><a href=#c4633695706171617092 title="comment permalink">3/4/14, 2:12 PM</a><br><br>

Note that "classical liberalism" seems to be "the magic bullet" in this argument. Assume I would run into a fallacy of ambiguity (e.g. "No True Scotsman") if I was to ask.<br>Strongly doubt that the biological concept of "extinction" is used used in a helpful manner in this case. "Hibernation" comes to mind, but would also not fit the bill in this case I decide. Wonder if "American" would include e.g. Ecuadorians and there is still hope for the second part of the argument. Read the term "meritocratic" with another set of alarm bells going off. Am actually moved significantly closer to commenting again, as I have some beef with how this word is being bandied about. Don't know what RINOs are (look it up later an am happy to report another "No true Scotsman"). Am further disinclined to comment as I don't know the acronym.<br>Note how the term "go Nazi" sounds a bit strange. Not sure why exactly.<br>Read the next bit. See a nation centered "solution", that is supposed to work by "externalizing costs". Then see a metric of dubious value (IQ), especially in connection with political decisions. Note the continent of Africa being ever so slightly suggested to be an original net source of problems. Could not help but think of this:<br><br>"Who wrote of the "impeccable economic logic" of dumping the west's "health impairing" toxic waste in "under polluted" Africa, because the resultant cancers wouldn't have time to develop in a population with such a low life expectancy ?"<br><br>"Lawrence Summers, as Chief Econonomist for the World Bank, in a leaked memo, December 12,1991.

On an abstract level I acknowledge I am racist myself. <br><br>After after that, I am more than a little insecure about all this, and wonder where I "would draw the line" in an abstract or general sense. After much back and forth, I can't really say. Also I tend towards there not being anything that beats the golden rule (which is a bit limping in this case because there's racism involved - i.e. assuming we are NOT alike). I've drawn the line a few times already and see if I can derive something from that. Throwing burning tires on a train track to stop neonazis arriving at a demonstration makes me queasy looking back. Glad I did not do it myself, but only attended the counter demonstration (also after it was outlawed, but that's another story). However if I had done it I'd likely be just as glad about it. I feel, that it should significantly depend on the fact that someone else feels threatened - in so far Khadija has another point. <br>Going back to dave1941's comment on the other hand, I would say, even though there is clearly racism in the reasoning of this argument, it is not of the typically dominant kind. E.g. here the Jews and Asians should be ranked over the "Americans". So from a Michiavellian perspective I would be tempted to let this stand, or point dave to some "classic neonazis" so they can figure this out using their preferred methods. Also this makes me an similarly threatened victim (in theory). Last point is that the "may" in dave's comment could be interpreted as either only a capability or a "free pass". Although his nickname would suggest the latter.<br><br>Bottom line:<br>I have to pick my struggles. I like to focus on "good" constructive struggles others won't or can't do, and leave the "destructive" ones for other people as long as possible.<br>To my mind, when people like Khadija ask for support, it is a good time to think long and hard about if it is time to "get down and dirty". I also want to encourage them to ask often and early.<br>In this case my conclusion was: not now, not here. <br><br>Even though I try hard to value differences in perspective and thinking process, I couldn't help but feel like a victim of a doorbell prank after "stooping down" to see who is there. <br>JMG makes a point of having a reflected dialogue, but at times opens the door of the ivory tower to let in a troll or two, which I think is a very, very good idea. It illustrates very effectively his "dowdy and our of date" concept, and at times even indirectly adds value to a discourse. <br><br>@Khadija: I hope you can follow my reasoning. If you have questions or would like me to expound on points I'll try. I hope we wouldn't have to have this conversation - but I am glad you speak up.<br><br>@Bob Smith: I read the Dixie way! All the way to the end. It wasn't easy for me. But I think it'll do me good eventually. However this seems like another one of those institutionalized conflicts that some people feel they need for their identity or their purpose in life. This particular text has the redeeming feature of some decent humor that also allows for some self satire. And you only posted a link - which was very considerate. <br><br>Oh, also, in dave's comment there was aspect of "scientific truthiness" + meritocracy in there. Something is being measured and arguments made at least partly on this basis. I assume I don't have to drone on this.<br><br>@dave1941: If I misunderstood you I am sorry, and you might want to clear things up?<br><br><a href=#c1174880941490843402 title="comment permalink">3/4/14, 3:20 PM</a><br><br>

For example, we aren't worried about global warming, but about the coal fired power plant next door or our favorite hunting grounds instead. Its not so much NIMBY as "fix your own problems first", although NIMBY does play a part sometimes. <br><br>Another part of it is literally tribal loyalty, but tribe is much more complex than race these days, it can come in the form of neighborhoods, church groups, in-laws, school/military/work buddies etc... I grew up in Maine, which was very segregated in every which way, but in the 20+ years I've lived down south, the combinations of shape, size, color, sex, wealth, etc... I've seen are mind boggling. Supporting groups or individuals that are not of our tribe, well, I hate to say it but we just figure that its their tribe's job. The same idea applies to charity, "take care of your own house first". <br><br>The common denominators that I've seen though are culture and being polite, which are far more important than race IMHO. Occasionally, I do minor work for a lesbian couple, since the lack of guy around makes things like minor bathroom repairs major and expensive. While I'm fixing whatever, we usually take politics or current events. Its always civil and polite, we're free to disagree and no one gets their feelings hurt. Certainly none of the shrill nonsense like you might hear on TV or elsewhere. If someday they want to get married, well that's their business not mine. So much for the big controversy, but they aren't going out of their way to be offensive to everyone either. <br><br>My wife and I live in a mixed neighborhood and I'm not going to say that if someone showed up with "bass-thumpin" music, it wouldn't bring out my inner "Archie Bunker", but I'd feel the same way if Motley Crue moved in next door too..."there goes the neighborhood". However, if either said "Good morning sir" politely and stayed that way, my initial attitude would be erased. One of my AA neighbors has a beautiful(!) teenage daughter, and we joke about which boyfriend we are going to have to "sacrifice" so the others stay away. He borrows tools occasionally too, which is a HUGE level of trust. With him, the same thing applies as the lesbian couple, they are one of "mine", so I'm happy to help in whatever way necessary.<br><br>Regarding why you don't see this out of typical progressive-talking WM, well my brother is one and although he talks a lot about "community", I'd hate to have him as a neighbor, related or not. He wouldn't help a 90-year old change a tire. I don't get it either. Too self absorbed or no sense of duty maybe? I have no idea, but if you figure this one out, let me know ok? <br><br>Regarding your previous comment, the one thing that the lesbian couple and I overwhelmingly agree on is that domestic violence and sex crimes should be capitol crimes. Glad to hear that the FBI resolved this, but IMHO all women should have "little friends" (from Scarface). A cell phone and a cop 10 minutes away isn't much comfort when these types of things happen so please consider it, have a good night.<br><br>You too JMG!

Another dynamic that is often missed because American political discourse focuses on stale, canned binaries are various forms of intra-group racism. <br><br>While attending my magnet high school, I watched while some of the Puerto Rican students slurred Mexican-Americans by referring to them as <i>"___-backs."</i> Meanwhile, some of the Mexican-American students referred to Puerto Ricans as <i>"n-words"</i>---all while knowing that this would especially enrage many of the "Whiter" Puerto Ricans (many of whom were quite racist toward Black Puerto Ricans and other Black Latinos).<br><br>I also noted that if you want to anger more than a few Latinos from cultures that still have indigenous populations (who seem to be stuck at the very bottom of these societies), one of the quickest ways to do so was to refer to them as <i>"Indians."</i> <br><br>Then there were the Filipino students who somehow felt they were of higher status than other Filipinos because some of their relatives <i>"looked pure Spanish."</i><br><br>There's also the English-language immigrant Muslim publications that publish marriage ads in which people specify that they are seeking <i>"fair-skinned"</i> potential spouses for themselves or their children. From what I've seen, the ads placed by Indian-American Muslims and Pakistani-Americans tend to be the worst with this. Both groups seem to have a lot of skin-shade racism operating among themselves.<br><br>All of which flies in the face of the popular African-American (AA) Muslim talking point when evangelizing among AA Christians that Islam is [purportedly] less racist than Christianity. [I happen to be Muslim. Other Muslims are often not pleased when I comment on these internal contradictions and displays of racist hypocrisy.]<br><br>Let me move on to the intra-group racism within my own ethnic group. The ugly reality is that there's a LOT of skin-shade racism among African-Americans (AAs). <br><br>In previous eras, AAs were much more honest about that. In order to join various AA sororities, fraternities, and be admitted into various AA-held social parties, an African-American had to be lighter than a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_bag_party rel=nofollow>brown paper bag</a>.

Similarly, in terms of Native Americans, some of those nations held African-Americans as slaves, such as the Cherokee Nation. And there are still problems between the Cherokee Nation and the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_freedmen_controversy rel=nofollow>Cherokee Freedmen</a>.<br><br>There's plenty of racist mess flying around in all directions. All at the same time.<br><br>All of which is why, as far as I'm concerned, there are no clean hands in terms of any group's or culture's histories.<br><br>It seems to me that the number and quality of one's connections to other people will become increasingly important during the Long Descent.

The rest (whether it's black vs. white, Christian vs. Muslim, Hutu vs. Tutsi, Catholic vs. Protestant, healthy vs. zombie, etc., etc.) is just how we choose sides for our own protection and to recognize the Other that would kill us if we didn't kill them first. Rationalizations abound about the ancient offenses to be redressed, or hypothesized purity, inferiority, or favor of deity, but in the end, maybe it's just a way to know on which side to put the stranger. If we develop personal bonds within a community (regardless of traditional categories of race, etc.), then we'll draw the lines differently: friend or foe? Inside the wall, or outside? <br> <br>So, let's see if we can't avoid exceeding our world's carrying capacity in the first place... but that capacity currently depends on cheap energy, doesn't it?<br><br><br><a href=#c2561292546667171232 title="comment permalink">3/4/14, 6:48 PM</a><br><br>

I seem to remember that you can tell who is currently the top dog by who controls the prisons. AFAIK that would be the Russian mafia in Germany. But I would assume they'd need some serious backing if push comes to shove. The elite is just too eager to go back to their favorite hobby. The import mafia should have a better logistics capability though but they are usually tribe organized and typically are fairly visible as well. This may turn out as weakness when the thresholds get lowered, "due process" holds no one back anymore, and people would appreciate a scapegoat or two. The rocker clubs (and neonazi orgs) seem to have their organizations and support structure a bit more ship shape it seems to me. Also they have a larger pool of locals to levy and integrate relatively quick via youth movements etc. I believe some of the rocker clubs have at least some cultural and staff overlap with the neonazis as well. <br><br>Interestingly the hools are a fairly strong phenomenon in eastern Germany especially, but think they lack the organization and will to power to be anything else than a recruitment pool. I could imagine this is different further east.<br><br>Last but not least there's increasing circumstantial evidence that the neonazis were kept close to critical political institutions, right from Gehlen, through Gladio, to the NSU stuff going on today. <br><br>On the "far left (e.g. Antifa, Anti-Germans)" there certainly are potential individuals, but the scene as a whole (currently) lacks the necessary ruthlessness by a very long shot. Also they like to perceive themselves as victims and be "against something". That really doesn't get you anywhere close to power. The party "the Left" (mostly leftovers from the GDR) is currently still kind of cute and helpful as a real opposition party, but they have a few people in there with long enough fangs to hold onto power if they get close enough.<br><br><a href=#c8952033352549291070 title="comment permalink">3/4/14, 6:56 PM</a><br><br>

I perceive such a situation as patently bad. <br>1. It is quite likely that it won't be easy to figure out where you stand as constellations are shifting over night. <br>2. Typically leaders will want unflinching and unquestioning loyalty to their "cause". Opting out will require communication the cost/benefit ratio convincingly. In a volatile situation leaders may also be impervious to reasoning. <br>3. The "causes" are often free of any ballast civilization would bring with it. <br>4. There's a bunch of jobs to keep people busy of course, such as human shield for looting the neighborhood. But even if you knew where you stood, it wouldn't do you much good in such a case.<br>5. The incentives for collaboration vs competition may easily flip on a very basic level. Trust evaporates with a positive feedback loop. A threat is assumed, no matter what. The implications for who will make progress, who won't, and who will just go away in such a situation are pretty far reaching. <br><br>And one more cautionary note on Selco's acquaintance adopting the 7 orphans:<br>1. He was a cop. Possible even one that talked to people. I assume he could read people somewhat.<br>2. He probably had a very good chance to check the kids out in (bonding) stress situations when he had locked them up a couple times before.<br>3. You don't hear the story of the 6 orphans and the bad apple. <br><br>Some other suggestions (no guaranty as I don't really know what I am talking about):<br>Install tor, use e.g. duckduckgo instead of google.<br>Have a look at historical secret organizations. <br>Don't pick German ones if you want to survive. <br>I would suggest for example the nihilist movement in 1860s Russia.<br>There's some simple and effective pen &amp; paper codes that can be mashed with industrial tech or done simple. <br>Get lots of nasty (fake) kit that can scare people off.

To keep this short I wont go into situation in Greece or elsewhere, but straight to the question.

But by the Grace of God, I had a change of heart. <br>Thinking of the lingering dissatisfaction and unhealed wounds, thinking of a question somewhat like a twist of Freud's question, What do black people want? I realized that a level playing field and "tolerance" is too low a bar for the human heart. What is required is love and appreciation. <br><br>I am not into color blindness; I love black people for their unique qualities and I am utterly grateful that by God's Grace I have seen them. Due to my profession and to having my heart opened, I believe I have on a few occasions been in a position to experience something very few white people have - to be in the presence of a large group of black people at their finest as the only white person, but who were yet completely relaxed in my presence. <br><br>I am a connoisseur of human sweetness. Black love is the finest of wines.<br>If JMG will indulge me, I would like to show you a poem I wrote about 15 years ago and have shown to only one person, my sister.

I'm already familiar with some of them. I'm not familiar with others. Since we'll all be moving on from this thread soon when a new post is published, here's my immediate response:<br><br>I feel that there's a lot of over-intellectualizing in many of the online conversations that deal with what could soon be life and death issues. To put it bluntly, I suspect that a lot of audience members who assume that they're "safe," assume that they wouldn't be among the first ones targeted by an American-based fascism, and assume they have their bases covered in terms of thriving despite the ongoing Long Descent are mistaken. <br><br>I enjoy discussing abstract theories as much as the next person. Nevertheless, I'm focused on practical matters with this sort of topic. To my way of thinking, all the energy expended discussing the No True Scotsman logical fallacy, etc. are worse than useless if one is the sort of person who will passively sit around talking about No True Scotsman while a Kristallnacht is in progress (or taking shape).<br><br>@Ruben,<br><br>Oh, that's funny (about the "Pinko Rednecks"). {chuckling}<br><br>@Bob Smith,<br><br>You said, <i>"At the risk of sounding simplistic, I think its due to us "Bubbas" being much more locally focused than generally given credit for."</i><br><br>That's common sense. Charity begins at home (as you mention later in your comment).<br><br>You said, <i>"Another part of it is literally tribal loyalty, but tribe is much more complex than race these days, it can come in the form of neighborhoods, church groups, in-laws, school/military/work buddies etc...[ ] Supporting groups or individuals that are not of our tribe, well, I hate to say it but we just figure that its their tribe's job. The same idea applies to charity, "take care of your own house first"."</i><br><br>I think the "tribal" aspect is the key to all of this. And the most important message I tried to communicate to other African-American (AA) women at my previous blogs. Anybody who wants to thrive needs to be part of at least one functioning, mutually supportive "tribe." <br><br>As things stand, far too many Black women in the U.S. are investing their time, energy and material resources into vampiric "tribal" groupings that do nothing for them. Except drain them of their resources. A tragic example of this dynamic was the death of a West Indian immigrant named Esmin Green. Here's the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/07/nyregion/07funeral.html?_r=0" rel=nofollow>NYT article</a>.<br><br>My outrage isn't focused only on the hospital, I want to know where were her Black church people??!! After giving so much of herself to that church, why was she by herself in her hour of need? When a crowd of relatives and friends show up with a patient, hospitals tend to treat that patient better. Because they know there are people who actively care about that patient.<br><br>Bob, now here's a (probably unexpected) point where our political views probably overlap. One of the things that I've always disliked about "mainstream" self-proclaimed AA (mis)leaders like Rev. Jackson is that they're calling on some other men (namely, White men) to step in and fix their "tribe's" problems. <br><br>Most of what that type of leadership does consists of aggressive panhandling for WM to step in and fix the AA community's problems. That's unmanly and shameful. During the 1960s, Elijah Muhammad quite correctly ridiculed and scolded mainstream AA male leaders for that.<br><br><a href=#c7260280671103615218 title="comment permalink">3/5/14, 6:48 AM</a><br><br>

When I've visited the South I've had to get out of the Big Unfriendly Northern City mental habit of being somewhat startled by total strangers (both Black and White) greeting me with a cheery <i>"How you?"</i> (said with a charming regional drawl). Part of the package with the Bubbas &amp; Bubba-ettes is a general cultural pattern of being polite. <br><br>You said, <i>"Regarding why you don't see this out of typical progressive-talking WM, well my brother is one and although he talks a lot about "community", I'd hate to have him as a neighbor, related or not. He wouldn't help a 90-year old change a tire. I don't get it either. Too self absorbed or no sense of duty maybe? I have no idea, but if you figure this one out, let me know ok?"</i><br><br>Again, speaking in gross generalities: Chivalry seems to be part of the cultural package with "tribal mentality" Bubbas and "Vinnie Barbarinos" (big city ethnic Joe Six-Packs). A lot of my professional colleagues have "Vinnie Barbarino" roots. Some of them hang onto their Vinnie Barbarino tribal cultures as they ascend the professional hierarchy and become judges. <br><br>[Especially the Greek ones. Every Greek-American attorney I know has at minimum some basic knowledge of Greek; sends their kids to Greek-language weekend schools/classes. And makes an active effort to ensure that their high school and college-age children socialize with other Greek-Americans their own age. To increase the odds of their children marrying another Greek American.]<br><br>The ethnic professionals I know that hang onto their "tribal" culture tend to act with the chivalry and neighborliness you described. The ones that don't---well, I also wouldn't want them as neighbors. Once somebody discards their "tribal" culture, chivalry and neighborliness also seem to fly out the window. I don't know why that is.<br><br>You said, <i>" Glad to hear that the FBI resolved this, but IMHO all women should have "little friends" (from Scarface). A cell phone and a cop 10 minutes away isn't much comfort when these types of things happen so please consider it, have a good night."</i><br><br>I was blessed to grow up with "little friends;" and I'm blessed to have them now. {smile} I don't feel comfortable going to my "little friends" and putting them at risk over matters that are manageable by other means. Because almost anything can quickly spiral out of control and turn into a life or death incident. Or one that involves significant prison time for those involved.<br><br>That's the thing about tribal interactions. The "stand-up" men of one's tribe are literally priceless. A thoughtful lady doesn't want to risk them unnecessarily. I learned that in high school. <br><br>There was an incident toward the end of high school in which I happened to complain about an individual that nowadays would be called a stalker. I just assumed that, at most, there would be a verbal confrontation and maybe a fistfight. It never occurred to me that a "little friend" might set fire to the front of the stalker's parents' house at night and shoot at the stalker as he ran out the back door. Thankfully, there were no arrests and no major injuries (and no major damage to the stalker's parents' house). But that episode taught me to be cautious about getting "little friends" involved in problems. <br><br>@Onething, thank you. {smile}<br><br>Kindest regards,<br>Khadija<br><br><a href=#c6181922159533632798 title="comment permalink">3/5/14, 6:55 AM</a><br><br>

Skin color is just the clearest way to define this stratification of power but I've seen wealth and regionalism used too. I think this is a partial explanation of why people aren't able to properly form communities. The habits of community require the acknowledgement of ingroups and outgroups, which is a thing we're all taught to reject. Since for a very large part of this country's history the outgroups were black. I would say that every generation since the 50's has had the habits of community shamed out of them, to the point that the majority of people in my generation don't even know what the word means. <br><br>The most obvious example of this is voting, but it goes far deeper than that. In India we all do business with our community through a system of debt and obligation, basically reciprocity. From my observations it is considered taboo to even consider doing business in a similar manner in the US. Most communities in the US won't even talk about wealth, power, and security. In Indian communities it is very common for us to sit around tea discussing salary levels, job opportunities, investment opportunities, and etc. We talk about politics in much the same way. This improves the ability of our community (cast) to adapt to changing social environments. If you do not even talk about the thing how can you learn about it? How can you plan for your security or your prosperity if you cannot discuss it with your kin?<br><br>Oh and radical individualism probably doesn't help either. <br><br><br><a href=#c6867262397770955806 title="comment permalink">3/5/14, 10:59 AM</a><br><br>

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c338773249407713322></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/15994266142251087480 rel=nofollow>ay kay</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Part One<br><br>Hey Folks,<br><br>It is true that, as some folks have pointed out here, that racial or ethnic <i>prejudice</i> can likely be found among any given grouping of people to some extent or another. <br><br>One thing that I do feel is important to keep in mind, however, is that there is a big difference between racial or ethnic <i>prejudice</i> and <i>institutional racism</i>. Though these two things are interwoven and related, they are distinct. <br><br>Much public, mainstream discourse around the word “racism” focuses on racism as a phenomenon of individual or collective prejudice that can manifest itself in various forms of verbal and physical violence. Archie Bunker was an iconic personification of this understanding of racism as prejudice grounded in ignorance. Indeed, he's become one of the most often referenced archetypes during discussions of racism. If the problem is understood as one of individual or collective prejudice grounded in ignorance and a lack of exposure to folks with different backgrounds, then it is easy to see how many would assume the solution is the dismantling of that cultural prejudice on an individual and collective level using an array of strategies that we are all familiar with: corrections to one another's choices of vocabulary, public shaming of people who openly share their prejudices, curriculums focused on multiculturalism, etc. <br><br>There's much to be said about whether or not these tactics are truly effective at accomplishing what they are purportedly meant to accomplish, but what I want to focus on upholding is this very commonly neglected truth: that the United States has been structured, since before its inception, on a foundation of white supremacist racism, and that foundation isn't just cultural, but <i>material</i> and <i>institutional</i> in its form. <br><br>I am institutionally privileged as a white male in ways that many others are not, and that has played and continues to play a tremendous role in the structure of my life, my day-to-day experiences, and a whole constellation of things that I could too easily take for granted as “just the way things are.” To be clear, it isn't the <i>only</i> thing that structures the flesh and contours of my life, my experience, and not just because there's a huge (endless?) list of adjectives that also have some qualifying force in my life: English-speaking, born in the U.S. during the 1980s, raised in a middle class household, openly gay, living in the South, etc. There are of course a million things that don't have anything to do with these big-picture “categories of experience” that inform who I am, the quality of my life, and the things that I take for granted. <br><br>That said, being a white male plays a huge role. There is no monolithic white male experience, but there are many general commonalities among the experiences that white men have had historically and in the contemporary as a social group. Race might have been a cultural construction, but it has been a powerful one. The story of white supremacist racism was a powerful one in shaping the contours of our world, but that story has backed up and been backed up by the creation of an equally powerful set of economic and political arrangements that privilege white people over people of color in general.<br><br><a href=#c338773249407713322 title="comment permalink">3/5/14, 1:52 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c4257179911734119194></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/15994266142251087480 rel=nofollow>ay kay</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Part Two<br><br>The general point I'm trying to make is this: racism is not just about prejudice, it is about <i>power</i>. Whatever prejudices an African-American person has against White people or Latino people, that person's prejudices are not backed by the full force of the state the way that a White person's prejudices are, to name it one way. <br><br>And moving beyond this whole discussion of prejudice altogether, the whole infrastructure of the United States has been geared toward the (ongoing) genocide of Native peoples, the (ongoing) economic exploitation of African-Americans, etc. <i>This</i> is the kind of <i>institutional</i> racism that is not undone because of the adoption of this or that vocabulary, or the erasure of this or that prejudicial way of thinking. This is the kind of thing that can only be dismantled on a systemic level, which is probably the major reason that public discussions on racism focus on the comparatively superficial topic of “offensive speech.” <br><br>This is why conversations that get caught up in whether or not something like what dave1941 said is offensive or not, or what one should or should not do in the face of “offensive speech,” seem a little misguided to me...or at the very least, missing the point. <br><br>I want to back what Khadija has said, and to speak from a more personal place: when I hear someone yell the word “faggot” in a public space, whether or not it is directed at me (which it often is), my being offended or not has very little to do with my body's most basic response, the visceral feeling that immediately floods my muscles and bones: a palpable sense of pure fear for my safety and well-being, and the safety and well-being of other people like me. <br><br>That I have been physically and verbally attacked for being gay since I was 10 years old certainly informs that fear, but I can assure you that, regardless of their particular level of exposure to physical violence, most <i>any</i> openly gay or lesbian or transgender person knows what I'm talking about. <br><br>That is because we recognize, on an almost instinctual level, how unsafe the world is for us, how quickly the world can turn on us in what might otherwise seem like a normal day going about our lives: going to the grocery store, paying the bills, out on a date (for straight folks reading this: how many times do you fear for your physical safety for no other reason than you are out on a date with your significant other and doing normal young couple things, like holding hands?). We also recognize the various micro-aggressions that make our environments feel all the less safer for us and others who are similarly targeted. <br><br>We also recognize that when people are silent in the face of these micro-aggressions (which can become very physical very quickly), we are all the more vulnerable. When people are silent, that silence can be the difference between life and death. <br><br>When someone spews hateful rhetoric, it is not the <i>offense</i> of what he says that is distressing. It is the power of the words that we wield when we tell each other stories about who we are and the nature of the world we live in. It is the fact that some of us wield more power than others when we do so. It is the fact that words such as his have a relatively higher degree of being backed on an institutional level than anything an African-American might have to say about a White person, to name an example. It is the fact that, in general, people of color are far more likely than white people to be the target of real, institutional violence during the Long Descent. It probably won't look like david1941's fantasy, but we can expect the spirit of his words to manifest in more ways than one during the coming times, and on a level that many White people living today might find genuinely shocking to witness again. And when institutionally vulnerable people come under verbal and physical attack, the complicity of others makes it all the more likely that they won't come out okay on the other side. <br><br>These are things that must be kept in mind.<br><br><a href=#c4257179911734119194 title="comment permalink">3/5/14, 1:59 PM</a><br><br>
