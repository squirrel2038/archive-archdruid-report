<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week’s post, with its uncompromising portrayal of what descent into a dark age looks like, fielded the usual quota of voices insisting that it’s different this time. It’s a familiar chorus, and I confess to a certain wry amusement in watching so many changes get rung on what, after all, is ultimately a non sequitur. Grant that it’s different this time: so?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s different every time, and it always has been, yet those differences have never stopped history’s remarkably diverse stable of civilizations from plodding down the self-same track toward their common destiny. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It may also have occurred to my readers, and it has certainly occurred to me, that the legions of bloggers and pundits who base their reasonings on the claim that history has nothing to teach us don’t have to face a constant barrage of comments insisting that it’s the same this time. “It’s different this time” isn’t simply one opinion among others, after all; it’s one of the basic articles of faith of the contemporary industrial world, and questioning it reliably elicits screams of outrage even from those who like to tell themselves that they’ve rejected the conventional wisdom of the present day. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yet that raises another question, one that’s going to bear down with increasing force in the years ahead of us: just how will people cope when some of their most cherished beliefs have to face a cage match with reality, and come out second best? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Such issues are rather on my mind just at the moment. Regular readers may recall that a while back I published a book, <a href="http://www.llewellyn.com/product.php?ean=9780738713199">The UFO Phenomenon</a>, which managed the not inconsiderable feat of offending both sides of the UFO controversy. It did so by the simple expedient of setting aside the folk mythology that’s been heaped up with equal enthusiasm by true believers in extraterrestrial visitation and true believers in today’s fashionable pseudoskeptical debunkery. After getting past that and a few other sources of confusion, I concluded that the most likely explanation for the phenomenon was that US military and intelligence agencies invented it out of whole cloth after the Second World War, as protective camouflage for an assortment of then-secret aerospace technologies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That wasn’t the conclusion I expected to reach when I began work on the project; I had several other hypotheses in mind, all of which had to be considerably modified as the research proceeded. It was just too hard not to notice the way that the typical UFO sightings reported in any given decade so closely mimicked whatever the US was testing in secret at any given time—silvery dots or spheres in the late 1940s, when high-altitude balloons were the latest thing in aerial reconnaissance; points or tiny blobs of light high in the air in the 1950s, when the U-2 was still top secret; a phantasmagoria of flying lights and things dropping from the sky in the 1960s, when the SR-71 and the first spy satellites entered service; black triangles in the 1980s, when the first stealth aircraft were being tested, and so on. An assortment of further evidence pointing the same way, not to mention the significant parallels between the UFO phenomenon and those inflatable tanks and nonexistent battalions that tricked the Germans into missing the real preparations for D-Day, were further icing on a saucer-shaped cake. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To call that an unpopular suggestion is to understate the case considerably, though I’m pleased to say it didn’t greatly hurt sales of the book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the years since <i>The UFO Phenomenon</i> saw print, though, there’s been a steady stream of declassified documents from US intelligence agencies admitting that, yes, a lot of so-called UFOs were perfectly identifiable if you happened to know what classified projects the US government had in the air just then. It turns out, for example, that roughly half the UFO sightings reported to the Air Force’s Project Blue Book between 1952 and 1969 were CIA spyplanes; the officers in charge of Blue Book used to call the CIA when sightings came in, and issue bogus “explanations” to provide cover for what was, at the time, a top secret intelligence project. I have no reason to think that the publication of
<i>The UFO Phenomenon</i> had anything to do with the release of all this data, but it was certainly a welcome confirmation of my analysis.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The most recent bit of confirmation hit the media a few weeks back. Connoisseurs of UFO history know that the Scandinavian countries went through a series of major “flaps”—periods in which many UFO sightings occured in a short time—in the 1950s and 1960s. The latest round of declassified data confirmed that <a href=http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-28143994>these were sightings of US spyplanes</a> snooping on the Soviet Union. The disclosures didn’t happen to mention whether CIA assets also spread lurid accounts of flying saucer sightings and alien visitations to help muddy the waters. My hypothesis is that that’s what was going on all the way through the history of the UFO phenomenon: fake stories and, where necessary, faked sightings kept public attention fixated on a manufactured mythology of flying saucers from outer space, so that the signal of what was actually happening never made it through the noise. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Many of my readers will already have guessed how the two sides of the UFO controversy responded to the disclosures just mentioned:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>by and large, they haven’t responded to them at all. Believers in the extraterrestrial origin of UFOs are still insisting at the top of their lungs that some day very soon, the US government will be forced to ‘fess up to the reality of alien visitation—yes, I field emails from such people regularly. Believers in the null hypothesis, the claim that all UFO sightings result from hoaxes, illusions, or misidentification of ordinary phenomena, are still rehashing the same old arguments when they haven’t gone off to play at being skeptical about something else. That’s understandable, as both sides have ended up with substantial amounts of egg on their face. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, the believers in the extraterrestrial hypothesis were right about a great many more things than their rivals, and they deserve credit for that. They were right, for example, that people really were seeing unusual things in the skies; they were right that there was a coverup orchestrated by the US government, and that the Air Force was handing out explanations that it knew to be fake; they were even right in guessing that the Groom Lake airfield in Nevada, the legendary “Area 51,” was somehow central to the mystery—that was the main US spyplane testing and training base straight through the decades when the UFO mystery was at its peak. The one thing they got wrong was the real origin of the UFO phenomenon, but for them, unfortunately, that was the one thing that mattered. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The believers in the null hypothesis don’t have much reason to cheer, even though they turned out to be right about that one point. The disclosures have shown with uncomfortable clarity that a good many of the explanations offered by UFO skeptics were actually nonsense, just as their opponents had been pointing out all along. In 1981, for example, Philip Klass, James Oberg, and Robert Sheaffer claimed that they’d identified all the cases<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>that Project Blue Book labeled as “unknown.” As it happens, they did nothing of the kind; what they actually did was offer untested ad hoc hypotheses to explain away the unknowns, which is not exactly the same thing. It hardly needs to be said that CIA spyplanes played no part in those explanations, and if the “unknown” cases contained the same proportion of spyplanes as the whole collection, as seems likely, roughly half their explanations are wrong—a point that doesn’t exactly do much to inspire confidence in other claims made on behalf of the debunking crusade.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So it’s not surprising that neither side in the controversy has had the least interest in letting all this new data get in the way of keeping up the old argument. The usual human reaction to cognitive dissonance is to exclude the information that’s causing the dissonance, and that’s precisely what both sides, by and large, have done. As the dissonance builds, to be sure, people on the fringes of both scenes will quiely take their leave, new recruits will become few and far between, and eventually surviving communities of believers and debunkers alike will settle into a common pattern familiar to any of my readers familiar with Spiritualist churches, Marxist parties, or the flotsam left behind by the receding tide of other once-influential movements in American society: little circles of true believers fixated on the disputes of an earlier day, hermetically sealed against the disdain and disinterest of the wider society. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They have the freedom to do that, because the presence or absence of alien saucers in Earth’s skies simply doesn’t have that much of an impact on everyday life. Like Spiritualists or Marxists, believers in alien contact and their debunking foes by and large can avoid paying more than the most cursory attention to the failure of their respective crusades. The believers can take comfort in the fact that even in the presence of overwhelming evidence, it’s notoriously hard to prove a negative; the debunkers can take comfort in the fact that, however embarrassing their logical lapses and rhetorical excesses, at least they were right about the origins of the phenomenon. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That freedom isn’t always available to those on the losing side of history. It’s not that hard to keep the faith if you aren’t having your nose rubbed in the reality of your defeat on a daily basis, but it’s quite another matter to cope with the ongoing, overwhelming disconfirmation of beliefs on which you’ve staked your pride, your values, and your sense of meaning and purpose in life. What would life be like these days for the vocal UFO debunkers of recent decades, say, if the flying saucers had turned out to be alien spacecraft after all, the mass saucer landing on the White House lawn so often and so vainly predicted had finally gotten around to happening, and Philip Klass and his fellow believers in the null hypothesis had to field polite requests on a daily basis to have their four-dimensional holopictures taken by giggling, gray-skinned tourists from Zeta Reticuli? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For a living example of the same process at work, consider the implosion of the New Age scene that’s well under way just now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the years before the 2008 crash, as my readers will doubtless remember, tens of thousands of people plunged into real estate speculation with copies of Rhonda Byrne’s meretricious <i>The Secret</i>
or similar works of New Age pseudophilosophy clutched in their sweaty hands, convinced that they knew how to make the universe make them rich. I knew a fair number of them—Ashland, Oregon, where I lived at the time, had a large and lucrative New Age scene—and so I had a ringside seat as their pride went before the real estate market’s fall. That was a huge blow to the New Age movement, and it was followed in short order by the self-inflicted humiliation of the grand nonevent of December 21, 2012. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who don’t happen to follow trends in the publishing industry may be interested to know that sales of New Age books peaked in 2007 and have been plunging since then; so has the take from New Age seminars, conferences, and a galaxy of other products hawked under the same label. There hadn’t been any shortage of disconfirmations in the previous history of the New Age scene, to be sure, but these two seem to have been just that little bit more than most of the movement’s adherents can gloss over. No doubt the New Age movement will spawn its share of little circles of true believers—the New Thought movement, which was basically the New Age’s previous incarnation, did exactly that when it imploded at the end of the 1920s, and many of those little circles ended up contributing to the rise of the New Age decades later—but as a major cultural phenomenon, it’s circling the drain. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the central themes of this blog, in turn, is that an embarrassment on much this same scale waits for all those who’ve staked their pride, their values, and their sense of meaning and purpose in life on the belief that it’s different this time, that our society somehow got an exemption from the common fate of civilizations. If industrial society ends up following the familiar arc of decline and fall into yet another dark age, if all the proud talk about man’s glorious destiny among the stars turns out to be empty wind, if we don’t even get the consolation prize of a downfall cataclysmic enough to drag the rest of the planet down with us—what then? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve come to think that’s what lies behind the steady drumbeat of emails and comments I field week after week insisting that it’s different this time, that it has to be different this time, and clutching at the most remarkable assortment of straws in an attempt to get me to agree with them that it’s different this time. That increasingly frantic chorus has many sources, but much of it is, I believe, a response to a simple fact:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>most of the promises made by authoritative voices in contemporary industrial society about the future we’re supposed to get have turned out to be dead wrong. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Given the number of people who like to insist that every technological wet dream will eventually be fulfilled, it’s worth taking the time to notice just how poorly earlier rounds of promises have measured up to the inflexible yardstick of reality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of all the gaudy and glittering technological breakthroughs that have been promised with so much confidence over the last half dozen decades or so, from cities on the Moon and nuclear power too cheap to meter straight through to120-year lifespans and cures for cancer and the common cold, how many have actually panned out?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Precious few.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Meanwhile most measures of American public health are slipping further into Third World territory with every year that passes, our national infrastructure is sinking into a morass of malign neglect, and the rising curve of prosperity that was supposed to give every American acces to middle class amenities has vanished in a haze of financial fraud, economic sclerosis, and official statistics so blatantly faked that only the media pretends to believe them any more. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For many Americans these days, furthermore, those broken promises have precise personal equivalents. A great many of the people who were told by New Age authors that they could get rich easily and painlessly by visualizing abundance while investing in dubious real estate ventures found out the hard way that believing those promises amounted to being handed a one-way nonstop ticket to poverty. A great many of the people who were told by equally respected voices that they would attain financial security by mortgaging their futures for the benefit of a rapacious and corrupt academic industry and its allies in the banking sphere are finding out the same thing about the reassuring and seemingly authoritative claims that they took at face value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For that matter, I wonder how many American voters feel they benefited noticeably from the hope and change that they were promised by the sock puppet they helped put into the White House in 2008 and 2012.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The promises that framed the housing bubble, the student loan bubble, and the breathtaking cynicism of Obama’s campaign, after all, drew on the same logic and the same assumptions that guided all that grand and vaporous talk about the inevitability of cities on the Moon and commuting by jetpack. They all assumed that history is a one-way street that leads from worse to better, to more, bigger, louder, gaudier, and insisted that of course things would turn out that way. Things haven’t turned out that way, they aren’t turning out that way, and it’s becoming increasingly clear that things aren’t going to turn out that way any time this side of the twelfth of Never. I’ve noted here several times now that if you want to predict the future, <a href=../../2014/01/the-song-of-snallygaster.html>paying attention to the reality of ongoing decline</a> pretty reliably gives you better results than trusting that the decline won’t continue in its current course.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The difficulty with that realization, of course, is precisely that so many people have staked their pride, their values, and their sense of meaning and purpose in life on one or another version of the logic I’ve just sketched out. Admitting that the world is under no compulsion to change in the direction they think it’s supposed to change, that it’s currently changing in a direction that most people find acutely unwelcome, and that there are good reasons to think the much-ballyhooed gains of the recent past were the temporary products of the reckless overuse of irreplaceable energy resources, requires the surrender of a deeply and passionately held vision of time and human possibility. Worse, it lands those who do so in a situation uncomfortably close to the crestfallen former UFO debunkers I joked about earlier in this post, having to cope on an everyday basis with a world full of flying saucers and tourists from the stars. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Beneath the farcical dimensions of that image lies a sobering reality. Human beings can’t live for long without some source of values and some sense of meaning in their lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s why people respond to cognitive dissonance affecting their most cherished values by shoving away the unwelcome data so forcefully, even in the teeth of the evidence. Resistance to cognitive dissonance has its limits, though, and when people have their existing sources of meaning and value swept away by a sufficiently powerful flood of contradictions, they will seek new sources of meaning and value wherever they can find them—no matter how absurd, dysfunctional, or demonic those new meanings and values might look to an unsympathetic observer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The mass suicide of the members of the Heaven’s Gate UFO cult in 1997 offers one measure of just how far astray those quests for new sources of meaning can go; so, on a much larger scale, does the metastatic nightmare of Nazi Germany.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I wrote in <a href=../../2014/07/in-handful-of-dust.html>an earlier post this month</a> about the implosion of the sense of political legitimacy that’s quietly sawing the props out from underneath the US federal government, and convincing more and more Americans that the people who claim to represent and govern them are a pack of liars and thieves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So broad and deep a loss of legitimacy is political dynamite, and normally results within no very long a time frame in the collapse of the government in question. There are no guarantees, though, that whatever system replaces a delegitimzed government will be any better. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
That same principle applies with equal force to the collapse of the fundamental beliefs of a civilization. In next week’s post, with this in mind, I plan on talking about potential sources of meaning, purpose and value in a world on its way into a global dark age. </div>

One can see it at sporting events: pro baseball players are now wearing jerseys designed in military camouflage. Last year we went to an NFL football game and were treated during the pregame ceremony to an actual swearing-in of National Guard recruits. It seems that all our national holidays, even the recently celebrated Independence Day, have become days to "honor the sacrifices of the men and women in our armed forces." (I'm expecting to see the same attitude and expression this coming Thanksgiving--a national observance as far removed from honoring the military as I can think of.) I could give plenty other examples that I and others I know have witnessed. It's almost as if the military services have become the chief source of our national identity, and I'm not exactly sure how that happened.<br><br>As an aside, I don't need to remind you, of course, that rampant, uncontrolled militarism and nationalism were one of the sources of the powder keg that blew up when Archduke Ferdinand was killed a century ago. Therefore, this increase in militarism has me concerned. But that's not why I'm writing this today. It seems that the military is one of the chief things people are still hanging onto in the troubled times we are facing.<br><br>You've written in detail about the vulnerabilities of the high-tech weaponry of our supposed invulnerable armed forces.

In fact, that's the group where I first used the Pinku-Sensei identity. As one of the debunkers, I can give an explanation for why we would dig in. Even though your explanation is a perfectly naturalistic one that has been supported by the evidence, it would kill the debunkers to admit that the saucerheads, as we called them, were right about anything, especially a government coverup. We got called "paid government disinformation agents" regularly, which both annoyed us and amused us, as we were doing it mostly for the LULZ. We could always count on a hilarious spittle-filled reaction from the saucerheads when we teased them. That was our reward.<br><br>Fortunately, the UFO enthusiasts were a harmless bunch, if very loopy.

Their stubborn refusal to adapt to the things they hope are not true or the over eagerness to change to absolutely any values that offer solace no matter how insane they are. I’ve picked up a few philosophical points from eastern traditions in the one of the noble truths of Buddhism which tells us the source of all suffering is expectations. Having a mindset that shifts our thoughts too far to the future can be just a detrimental as one that focuses too much on the past or present. Finding the balance or the middle path or “the way” through life without falling off of both sides of a narrow trail with steep falls on both sides seems to be the most reasonable path in my opinion.<br> <br> I find stories of the past quite comforting whether it is history or anthropological records. The idea that humanity is sliding down the per capita energy curve towards a state much more the rule rather than the exception in human history puts me at ease. I think it’s a very human thing to be comforted by the idea that even in suffering or turmoil you are not alone. This is different from more typical romantic “back to nature” notions because I have enough of a scientific understanding of the past to balance the considerable positives with considerable negatives. Finding a narrative that makes sense and has a greater coherency seems paramount to me. In some way, I have found the opposite meme, “It is really isn’t different this time, it’s completely normal actually” to be appealing. Finding these calming narratives brings me an inner tranquility that strengthens my motivation and resolve in everyday life. As we do slide down that per capita energy curve the world becomes as much bigger place as it takes more time to navigate since we have less energy, and this re-expansion of the world can be exciting. <br><br> So I have two questions for you at this moment. Do you have any plans to go more into depth discussing the American Caste system you have briefly alluded to in comments? Ever since you mentioned Americas obsession with necrophilia I have slowly been seeing it more in my own life. Your steampunk Victorian era post got me thinking about the way we hide the inner workings of things which steampunk seems to oppose. Exposed piping is ugly, everything must be covered, finished coverings are emphasized and wiring or other “workings” are minimized. Why do you think it is that society seems to think the same of wires, pipes or even water treatment plants as they do of women’s breast, embarrassing things meant to be hidden? It is almost like the wizard of OZ man behind the curtain, where our inventions and achievements lose their luster as soon as how they work is revealed?<br><br><a href=#c3614756152430545535 title="comment permalink">7/16/14, 8:28 PM</a><br><br>

Whether that culture fits the facts on the ground is something else all-together and not something that people really want to think about. Following it saves them having to consider the consequences of their actions.<br><br>Plus there is the very large benefit that if the culture is proven to be faulty, then they get to blame someone else! That is no small benefit. Using electricity sourced from nuclear power, but concerned about the waste – well don’t worry, if it gets out into the environment, it’s not your fault (I’m being sarcastic).<br><br>I generally don't put much value in status anyway, so it was an easy thing for me to try how the dominant culture fitted and then discard it completely. It wasn't hard, but it did take a long, long time to find something else to place my value system on. That transition time is really difficult.<br><br>The difficulty of that transition also forced me to consider how my new value system fitted the facts on the ground. It fits well, but has left me with the clear understanding about how precarious our relationship with nature actually is. People, I reckon, traded reality for certainty. Dunno, but that's what I reckon, and it also is the basis as to why they'd accept potentially dodgy authoritarian leadership promising a return to the land of milk and honey over the realities of a bleak and impoverished future.<br><br>Phew, where did all that come from?<br><br>By the way.

Then they could donate their body for research in bio-fuels in order to pay for the procedure to be done by people in spotless white technician coats. The only thing I wish for is more time, a luxury apparently that will be in short supply. Thinking about it on the way to work this morning, the way it seems to me is that most people will do well to have a dozen or so reliable skill sets in their bag: organic gardening, small engine repair or ability to master an old technology gone out of "date", animal husbandry of some kind, basic medicine and knowledge of the body, firearms, and then of course one or two of their very own specialities, which will set them apart and allow them some freedom and development, like paper-making or black smithing.<br><br><a href=#c7015873458374499359 title="comment permalink">7/16/14, 8:56 PM</a><br><br>

Concerning UFOs <i>consent</i> being that it was strange grey people, not spy planes. <br><br>The <i>manufacture of consent</i>; implanting specific memes so deluded thoughts become the vogue of society is a government art that has been practiced in America with great finesse for a hundred years now. Beginning with the Committee on Public Information making the American people hate the Germans in WW1. <br><br>The delusion that history is a one-way street going to a glorious future has been also been pushed by government. Pushed as part of the self-serving endless economic growth archetype delusion. Those who govern have been self serving liars and as you say all the manufactured promises pushed upon us have been false. <br><br>Bringing in the new age movement to demonstrate that we are spiritually bankrupt and that most everything our society believes in is a fairy tale was forceful.<br><br>The meme of a glorious future has been pushed upon us and it makes people stop thinking. It is as you say a thought-stopper and it shapes a meek population. Thinking we are exceptional is also a thought-stopper which promotes a well behaved, docile, compliant, and obedient population. <br><br>Someone pulls strings. Dead wrong authoritative voices pull strings. Strings which delude us into thinking we are unique. Unique and exempt from laws of the universe which would dispute the glorious future of sunshine and rainbows lie.<br><br>But we are not unique and it is not different this time. We go forward enthralled in blind delusion like all other civilizations that have fallen before us. Blind to the laws of the universe, laws which will be our demise. Authority produces poison memes which seal our fate with blindness to reality. <br><br>Human beings can’t live without meaning yet unfortunately, as you have observed, false meaning can fill that boundless craving for meaning if cognitive dissonance is not too great.<br><br><a href=#c5387327305238742604 title="comment permalink">7/17/14, 12:10 AM</a><br><br>

That's what my wife likes to say when I question things like our ability to pay for housecleaning or a second child.<br><br>Well, guess what. The universe is not under contract to provide. And neither is the government, or our relatives, or some other benign, generous, avuncular entity.<br><br>This is a harsh reality. But paradoxically, we need to be gentle with ourselves and others on a certain level. Yes, the lessons from the past are there for us to see, and we are foolish to ignore them.<br><br>But we also need to remember we don't live in the future. As the various 12-step programs like to say, we need to take things a day at a time, change the things we can, accept the things we can't (and know which is which). Within that is plenty of positive action, much of it described here on TADR, including giving up one thing, learning one thing, and preserving one thing (hope I got that right) as well as the series of posts on green wizardry. <br><br>Although the time has likely past where we as a society can do much to make our transition in the physical realm "softer," there is still time to offer our friends and neighbors succor during the coming years, by leading with example. <br><br>That said, there is a reason denial is in the human toolbox for dealing with unpleasant realities--it can really suck being in the vanguard and knowing in your gut what's coming down the pike with no brakes in sight.<br><br><a href=#c584984494857461711 title="comment permalink">7/17/14, 4:39 AM</a><br><br>

I certainly look forward to Thursday mornings! <br><br>This said, I must express some reservations about this week's blog (and also about your book <b>The UFO Phenomenon</b>):<br><br><i>Warum es einfach machen, wenn es so schön kompliziert werden kann?</i> Meaning: I think you oversimplify the UFO question. For a start, it's not a dichotomy. True, there are the debunkers, represented by The Church of Fundamentalist Materialism, initially known as CSICOP (later renamed as CSI) and the believers (with widely varying beliefs, actually, from the hard-core nuts-and-bolts guys to the more or less religious contactees), but there is also a more scientifically inclined group of people in between (represented by, say, the late J Allen Hynek or Jacques Vallee or MUFON. Here, in Sweden, we have UFO Sverige (http://www.ufo.se/) which is actually one of the world´s best UFO organisations with a very large and well-renowned archive; see http://www.afu.se/afu2/). <br><br>My own interest in the issue began in 1952, when our daily paper published a drawing, depicting Adamski's alleged venusian (dressed in a pilot suit, which I duly coloured brown). The subject has been with me over the years. Therefore, I am frequently annoyed at media's ignorance and attitude towards UFOs. This compelled me to compile, almost twenty years ago, a <b>Brief History of UFOs</b>:<br>http://www.math.kth.se/~trygger/ufo.html, which you may (or may not) find somewhat interesting. The site was last updated a dozen years ago, so certain later developments (e.g., the late John Mack's books or the historical background in <b>Wonders in the Sky</b> by Aubeck and Vallee) are not covered. <br><br>Even so, it's a bit hard to believe that the USAF (or CIA or NSA) was involved in the Robur type airship ”flaps” of the late nineteenth century or the ”ghost rockets” over Sweden in the thirties (it seems you are confusing these with observations of ”daylight discs” in Norway in the fifties) or even the ”foo fighters” observed by both German and Allied pilots during WWII! <br><br>I could go on, but the ADR is probably not quite the right forum for a digression about UFOs. I just want to point out that even though the cover-up explanation very likely covers a number of the observed cases, it's probably not the whole truth and nothing but the truth. My own feeling, for what it is worth, is that ”there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy”. I certainly <i>hope</i> that this is true!<br><br><a href=#c4820092298665211825 title="comment permalink">7/17/14, 5:42 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not sure if any of the failings of our educational system are more pronounced than in the area of history. They may have heard of the fall of the Roman empire, but that was a single event, it happened a long time ago, and what has it to do with us? Most of our population believe that history began in 1776 when the Pilgrims signed the Constitution on Thanksgiving, and then we beat the Red Coats at some tea party. There is no sense of history before that, and less interest, and if some small number have any thoughts of “collapse” or “revolution”, it is in the sense of a reset to what our venerated “Founding Fathers” designed.<br><br>I'm sure many people have seen various examples of the currently popular genre of apocalyptic collapse-themed media productions, but those are just science fiction fantasies, and besides they require nuclear wars and/or zombies. So the end result is a society with no sense of history, no ruins or evidence of past civilizational failures, no exposure to what a real collapse would entail, and no concept at all that such a thing could ever happen here. The beginning stages of collapse are already here, but when it becomes impossible to ignore will the result be merely cognitive dissonance, or some sort of shock and panic? But shock and panic are short term emotions – what does that turn into when the thing grinds on and on, year after year? It is such a long journey from there to any sort of constructive reaction.<br><br>Without a sense of history, this society is primed to fall for any and all of the traps that await – including forms of fascism as you have described.<br><br><a href=#c1752389010242073532 title="comment permalink">7/17/14, 6:10 AM</a><br><br>

I think the abducting "Grey" aliens are merely the latest guise of our old friends from the Kingdom of Faerie. The theme that emerges most prominently in the old legends about the Faerie folk is how much they love to mess with humans. Also, a careful read of Whitley Strieber's visitation-accounts makes it pretty clear that the beings he is encountering are not extraterrestrials but rather visitors from what would appear to be the fourth dimension. <br><br>I have heard this dimension described as a place where reality is rather less dense and heavy and way more fluid.

It describes the growth rate seen during the Industrial Revolution in America, and then anticipates where it "should" have been from 1979 to the present. <br><br><i>The overall picture is one of accelerating geometric growth since the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution: doubling times of 80 years, then 49, then 44, then 28, and then 28. A techno-realist would have expected a further doubling to $57,388 in 28 years–from 1979 to 2007–as 28-year doubling appeared to be a feature of the modern mass-production research-and-development-based American economy. And a techno-optimist might have speculated that ever-shorter doubling times were a feature of ever higher-tech economies.<br><br>They would have been disappointed. 2007 saw American real GDP per capita not at $57,388 but $49,310.6–a 16% gap relative to reasonable expectations as of 1979. And, of course, after 2007 things really went into the toilet: Projecting growth forward from 1923, 1951, and 1979 to 2014 would have led us to expect a 2009-dollar real GDP level right now of $68,246.2. We are going to have $50,295.0–a 35.7% gap...when we compare the $28,694 real GDP per capita level of 1979 with the $50,295 we have today and the $68,246.2 that is the extrapolated 1923-1951-1979 trend–well, we have had barely as much as half the economic growth since 1979 that back in 1979 we expected.</i><br><br>http://equitablegrowth.org/2014/07/16/post-1979-shortfall-american-economic-growth-rough-survey-focus-july-16-2014/<br><br><br><a href=#c6777252736255824901 title="comment permalink">7/17/14, 7:07 AM</a><br><br>

In every other way, we are pretty much the same as everyone else down the good old historical timeline. When the Maya or Minoans collapsed, the human suffering was traumatic, but that was as bad as it got and the suffering stayed local.<br><br>We, other the other hand, have unforgiving, forever technologies. For instance, hundreds of cooling ponds filled with thousands of spent fuel rods along side hot reactors are scattered all over the world, though mostly in the northern hemisphere. We would not need a dark age, just a dim one, where the lights went out only in a few "lucky" places, to turn these under-maintained reactor sites in perpetual poisoning machines. We could have a world of multiple Fukushimas producing mass die offs and tweaking DNA replication for hundreds of thousands of year.<br><br>My concerns go on to non-nuclear technologies as well. As maintenance falls off and universities stop producing bright, young engineers, the vast square footage of chemical production and storage facilities will go un-monitored and un-managed. This stuff can kill us, as well as the rest of the biosphere, just as dead as decaying radiation.<br><br>Since I live in Los Angeles, I am concerned about the millions of tons of cargo in and laying just off the Ports of LA and Long Beach. What happens when there is no more money, no more letters of credit and those ships are simply abandoned at anchor. We could have a witch's brew of cargo that does not play well together just waiting for the chance to leak free and rumble in un-manned ships so near to shore.<br><br>If any of my concerns have weight, it would certainly put an evil twist the idea that, "We just can't live without our tech."<br><br><br><a href=#c7542926654319994363 title="comment permalink">7/17/14, 10:03 AM</a><br><br>

Still, I've noted other people talking about that same sense, so you may well be right. <br><br>Trog, people in the far future will almost certainly consider us stark staring mad. <br><br>K-dog, the genesis of the UFO as a cultural icon was a considerably more complex phenomenon than the manufacture of consent, and the military and intelligence interests who manufactured the thing were at least as much responding to popular culture as they were creating it. A deception on that scale requires telling people what they want and expect to hear -- and so the people being deceived have a remarkable degree of control over the resulting deception, even though they don't notice that that's what it amounts to. <br><br>Nuku, I certainly have, and you might have noticed some of those concepts in the last few years of posts. <br><br>Raven, Jung's work is to my mind critical for understanding why UFOs metastasized from a stunt to confuse the Soviets into a cultural icon of massive importance. <br><br>Jason, bingo. If you subtract the fraction of GDP that's purely financial in nature from the annual figures, you get a very telling graph...<br><br>M, I hope your wife's faith that the universe will provide doesn't leave her starving in a gutter. Such things happen in times of economic contraction. <br><br>Brian, thanks for the Chris Hedges piece! I'm not sure I'd recommend living in Boston on any kind of carbon budget, for what it's worth, but we each make our own choices. <br><br>Robert, now maybe you might take a moment to read my post and think about what it says, rather than shutting your eyes and plugging your ears and belting out a thoughtstopper. <br><br>G Ruda, of course the tangled mess of experiences that have been heaped together into the socially constructed category of "UFO experiences" include a great many things other than US (and other) military and intelligence activities under a saucer-shaped veil of deception. It's the category itself that was more or less invented by the US government, and that category has served as a strange attractor for a dizzying assortment of phenomena. Since this was a blog post rather than a 60,000-word book, I had to simplify somewhat; you might find my book worth reading if you want to follow up on the argument, though.<br><br><a href=#c3369921984747922542 title="comment permalink">7/17/14, 10:23 AM</a><br><br>

As you pointed out in a previous series, science has linked its destiny to <i>Progress</i> and, in addition, scientists are modern priests that facilitate Progress to happen. So I wouldn't be surprised if some anti-science movement arises and starts to blame us of preventing the world's Progress (I'm researcher in chemistry)<br><br>@KevPilot<br><br>According to Wikipedia: "Over 500 atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were conducted at various sites around the world from 1945 to 1980". As a result of that, a study suggested that around 11,000 deaths were caused by nuclear fallout(mainly by cancer).<br><br>A report published by The Chernobyl Forum in 2003 estimated in 4,000 deaths (again due to cancer) caused by Chernobyl disaster. The population residing in contaminated areas was 5 million (Wikipedia).<br><br>So if we consider that there are over 450 nuclear power plants in the world and if, worst case scenario, all of them collapse and the number of deaths caused by each of them is 100 times higher than Chernobyl (400,000), that would give us a total death toll of 180,000,000. That's 3% of the world population, still very far from extinction.<br><br><a href=#c2289247146918257308 title="comment permalink">7/17/14, 11:00 AM</a><br><br>

I read a lot of the books from "both" sides. But as I grew up, as an amateur astronomer and meteorologist (along with botanist, zoologist, geologist, pretty much anything outside) I noticed a stark pattern. Astronomers, professional and amateur, don't see UFOs. Meteorologists and storm spotters don't see UFOs. In other words, the people who spend the most time studying the sky, in great detail and with extensive knowledge underlying their observations, don't see these things. <br><br>Meanwhile, though, observing the culture at large, I reached similar conclusions as you did even though I never read your book (sorry.. by then I was mostly on to other things). I realized how convenient it would be for the government to covertly encourage the UFO mania, and also make sure the mainstream viewed them as crackpots, in order to provide cover for their own development of novel flying things. <br><br>So there was a bit of a quandary here... if the government was flying strange things in the sky and encouraging people to think they were extraterrestrial spacecraft, why didn't astronomers and meteorologists also see these things? Or, perhaps, they did, especially those who lived near proving ranges, and recognized them as unusual craft of terrestrial origin, concluded correctly that it was some military thing, and that it was therefore not of interest, not worthy of noting or reporting, and indeed best just ignored unless it got in the way of the thing they really wanted to see. Perhaps these mystery lights that the general public reported as making sudden zigging and zagging maneuvers, they recognized as normal aircraft shooting missiles at targets. I know from my own experience with birdwatchers, that once that speck in the sky is determined to not be a bird, they quickly lose interest in what other things it might be and point their binoculars elsewhere. Sharp, trained observers also tend to have a restricted search image, and filter much else out as noise. <br><br>You also learn as an amateur naturalist that the average person is a HORRIBLE observer. They don't know a tornado from a wisp of fog, an eagle from a pigeon, Venus from a telecom satellite, a sundog from a nuclear test, a labrador retriever from a "black panther," or a salamander from a rattlesnake. This does make it tempting and easy to dismiss their observations of just about anything without giving them serious thought. <br><br>So how this might all apply to the analogy with the peak oil/ long decline phenomenon... I'll think about that more.<br><br><a href=#c1460886215616094649 title="comment permalink">7/17/14, 11:08 AM</a><br><br>

(There are others, Dmitry Orlov's Communities that Abide for one. Nevertheless, to investigate these matters in our culture today means to rebel, to be a doubter, pessimist, denialist... these are the impressions I run against most often.)<br><br>Now maybe our history books are wrong, but it seems to me - materially speaking - even the lower middle classes (an everyone above) in the western world, and the privileged enclaves of client states or resource rich states here and there - live better than any pharaohs or kings ever. But for most of them, without the respect. That is, it's just stuff.<br><br>That's different this time.<br><br>It's not going to last. That's the same as every other.<br><br>It's just super-duper hard for people to persist in thinking like humans do, when their basic programs, instilled as their first rational memories at the cognitive (dogmative?) and pre-cognitive levels, involve the persistence of their core beliefs.<br><br>You talked about this in the series about religion as progress. It's a belief system confirmed to some extent by material evidence. This makes it stronger. Arguably, when the material evidence starts to collapse, the belief structure will reveal itself to be weaker than those based on non-material sources of meaning.<br><br>I'm not convinced about "disembodied intelligences" having never had that experience. I've had things that could be interpreted as hints in that direction - meaning-giving perceptions outside of the scope of the cult(ure) of Progress - non-material experiences; but they could just as well be creations of my mind. <br><br>One of the chief among those has been as a care-giver for an elderly man (a growing segment of occupation in a world where property (particularly land) owners have a lot more and everyone else is gonna do whatever they can to pay the rent - hinting at the progress toward a new, post-industrial feudalism, as the central government starts splitting apart).<br><br>He is a 98-year old former nuclear physicist and professor who was adopted as an infant and raised by two school teachers in western Kansas during the Great Depression. I don't suppose I need to do much to explain the synchronicity involved - although there are other more personal signs.<br><br>In him, I am seeing the reversal of the growth process: how layers of cognitive ability get shed like petals falling from the flower - and not always in an orderly reversal of the path of their accumulation as an infant, toddler, small child and so on. Right now, he does the best emotionally when we sing to him familiar nursery rhymes like "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" and "the Itsy Bitsy Spider." (both of which have synchronistic meaning to me.)<br><br>All of those nursery rhymes are among the most primary programs our minds are fed just as they begin to acquire language functions. the content is not all that important at first, and hardly understood; the form, the sound, is what matters more, early. Later in life, those strongly imprinted memories can explode with poignancy. They do not do so, however, for my wealthy elderly charge. Increasingly, the abstract fades; all he knows is the sound. I imagine he will likely die as many do who die peacefully, like the fading sound of OM; like the Tao flowing inward.<br><br><br><a href=#c679363918119143544 title="comment permalink">7/17/14, 11:23 AM</a><br><br>

But as one civilization dies, others are just in their youth or infancy, they will grow to their stature climbing among the bones of their progenitors, eating what can be of scraps of remains. the overlap can be a point of meaning-giving "optimism": while the one dies, the other is coming to life. Well... sort of, maybe... there is also the long winter...<br><br>It's primitive stuff. It'll blow a hole clean through the whole artifice of beliefs inherited. I don't know that every generation of individuals has to do this, but certainly we, (at least some among us) do - that is, going through the process of belief systems getting burst to smithereens like a mushroom exploding and spewing its spores.<br><br>The challenging question of course is, "why even bother? I'm smart enough to go on for awhile sucking the blood off the dying body, making no preparations for some successor culture, and who cares about the ones who can't? Who cares about the future? It doesn't really exist yet. Eat, Drink, and Be Merry - for tomorrow we will all be dead."<br><br>This is a lot of what I see among the adherents of the Law of Attraction, The Secret, what have you... they're a little happier just pretending, and seem equipped to perpetuate the current behaviors that are creating the problem by saying, "if the compost hits the fan, I'll be happy to be gone." Fair enough then. I'm not at all just a little peeved about that attitude. But it is prevalent.<br><br>Is that not at core essentially nihilism? A good friend has been going to these Landmark seminars - perhaps you and some of your readers are familiar. they say, "life is Empty and Meaningless." And then somehow motivate people to pursue their wildest dreams (which usually involves a more lucrative job, or a world tour, or something like that). it appears to me to be just another of the economics of "demand creation." Is it so hard to be happy where we are and with what we have? <br><br>Does this not hasten and worsen demise? Isn't that an attitude a lot like the one that makes a person's death worse by endlessly trying to escape from its inevitability - on par with people's mania for prescription medications without the needed concomitant behavior changes?<br><br>In our civilization, I do suspect a lot of this hocus pocus has to do with further empowering those who already have power. The growing split between the elite and the proletariat of which Toynbee speaks. For now, in many cases, people only trust when they personally benefit; otherwise, the trust fades.<br><br>It is possible to "Eat, Drink, and Be Merry" without being a total scumbag to the longevity of ecosystems, trust between classes, respect for people's dignity. But not in American culture. to combine the apparent contraries of sustainability and hedonistic merriment can be a lonely counter-culture. People ignore that Epicurus advised a life of near-poverty: the more pleasure when only a little can be taken away.<br><br><br><a href=#c463337883704106559 title="comment permalink">7/17/14, 11:24 AM</a><br><br>

Back in 2002 - before I stumbled onto the whole peak oil scene – I remember grappling with the fundamental question of just how could life as we experience it, be so very different from 99 percent of history? I was thinking of course of the technological progress that has transformed every aspect of our culture (man on the moon, neuroscience, skyscrapers, and daily rush-hour gridlock, etc. etc.). How is it that I, the grandson of a poor immigrant, subsistence farmer could be found in this “post-modern” urban lifestyle of abundance and waste? <br>My point is that in so many ways, so many things are so very different. By default (understandably) we assume our trajectory also must be different. <br>Thanks to you and a handful of other writers, I understand these differences in the context of energy and ecological cycles etc. So like I say, I agree that ultimately, as different as things appear to be, our situation is not without precedent – and the assumption of linear progress but an illusion.<br>As a side note, with that question haunting me, and growing doubts about sustainability I happened upon a radio interview with Richard Heinberg who was in town for a lecture, which I attended.

I’m sure you’ve already read it, but it’s certainly worth a gander in the light of this week’s discussion. It’s such an on the nose example of the sort of thinking that drives the suicide cults, totalitarian uprisings, and apocalypse movements you so often write about that if I didn’t know better I’d think someone had written it as an intentional piece of satire. . It’s got it all, the great evil that we can save the world by vanquishing, the canned polemic (he even calls you a vest-pocket version of Sauron), and to end it all, a counter-spell to the protective spell you offered near the beginning of your series on magic (“there is no brighter future”) in the form of a Carl Sagan quote “A still more glorious dawn awaits.”<br><br>It would actually be funny if there weren’t so many examples of charismatic speakers standing in front of desperate starving crowds and enthralling them by chanting those exact same words down through the ages always to the same effect. One of my grandfather’s favorite sayings was that old attage that used to be part of the conventional wisdom “if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.” He spent his teens muddling through a depression and his twenties fighting in a war both caused by promises of a brighter future, he spent the rest of his life in a cold war with an empire that was built on the same sorts of promises, and up until the day he died he taught me never to trust anything that promised a better future than it could deliver. It’s interesting, and a little scary, that offering such a basic, commonplace bit of cliché fortune cookie wisdom in the form of a protective spell against the totalitarian regimes and cult leaders of the future is already capable of inspiring rants like this one. We got really lucky with our current president who promised hope and change to cheering crowds and gave us a mediocre rerun the last 20 years worth of American politics. I worry about what will happen to people like the author of that blog, or to those of my friends and loved ones who speak so desperately and passionately about “saving the world” when a would-be savior comes along promising change and actually delivers.<br><br><a href=#c8316878557439486885 title="comment permalink">7/17/14, 12:51 PM</a><br><br>

In fact, it will seem so impossible as to actual prove for many the existence of God, if only because it must be the doing of an angry omnipotent power because surely nothing else has the ability to so perfectly destroy the immutable fabric of earthly existence.<br><br>(As an aside, God is a dear friend of mine and I've asked her about that, and she swears up and down she doesn't give two figs about what we do and never did, and frankly would prefer that we just keep her out of our nightmares, thanks.)<br><br>The upside to all this (perhaps a latter post will address the upside as you see it) as I see it is that -- after destroying everything and forgetting even more -- people in the West are about to launch themselves on a new journey of discovery. Essentially, starting over from scratch. Anyone who has tried their hand at any of the arts knows that sometimes if a piece is not coming together you may just have to start over, and this is not a bad thing at all, and realizing that it's just not working is something you do quickly the more experienced you are knowing you just have to cut your losses so as to go forward on a better footing.<br><br>Civilization was a good idea.

I'll be covering the point again at great length in an upcoming post, where we'll be talking about the toxic radiological and chemical legacies of the industrial age.

The text is rather short.), but my main points/objections are these:<br><br>1. <i>There are not just two camps</i>: rigid debunkers and nutty believers. There are also people in the middle who try to approach the subject without prejudice: objectively and scientifically. This is a rather precarous position: no funding, enemies on all sides. Plus bad treatment by ignorant journalists.<br><br>2. <i>The phenomenon is by no means new</i>; it has been with us (in various forms) since time immemorial. It might certainly be true that the US military has tried to use it for its own ends and it might also be true that this attempt has been (partly) successful. This does not mean, however, that the military invented the phenomenon – or even the ”flying saucer”. (Actually, flying discs existed in the SF literature in the thirties.) Moreover, it is important to distinguish between a UFO – an Unidentified Flying Object – and a ”flying saucer” which is obviously an identified object (manned by aliens, of course. BEMs, most likely ...). Personally, I'm only interested in the former category.<br><br>Fact is, I <i>have</i> read your book (I mentioned it in my previous comment) as well as quite a number of other books on the subject. And I really don't like to say this, but after having enjoyed some of your other books, I was rather disappointed with the UFO book. It seems to me that you exclude aspects of the phenomenon which you find too weird (like, say, Joe Simonton and his alien pancakes, the Betty Luca Andreasson affair, Antonio Villas-Boas' alien seductress or cases in John Mack's books) and which tend to contradict the cover-up hypothesis. (We must also ask ourselves whether we are dealing with a world-wide cover-up: UFOs are observed all over the globe, not just in the US of A.)<br><br>Finally, contemplating the alleged (and sometimes even documented) feats of UFOs (e.g., invisibility and extreme acceleration - or are we maybe dealing with a fourdimensional object, passing through three-space (c.f. Flatland)?), it might perhaps be wise to recall Clarke's third law: "<i>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic</i>". Our present knowledge of the laws of the universe are probably far from complete!<br><br>In conclusion: I don't think the case is closed.<br><br><a href=#c2213117672933300007 title="comment permalink">7/17/14, 3:15 PM</a><br><br>

I personally have spent far more time looking at the sky that the average person, day and night, and never seen a "UFO" among all the remarkable things I have seen. One of the stranger things I have seen in the sky was a stealth bomber, but this was after they were declassified, I knew what it was, hence it was not a UFO. It is indeed a most unusual looking thing, with a size, shape, distance, and speed that are quite hard to assess even in full sunlight. <br><br>But to the bigger point, what do my contemplations suggest about how people will see peak oil? Well, the equivalents of astronomers et al. would be technical experts who have detailed knowledge and experience. They might be expected to be more able to see through the mass hysteria and government disinformation to the actual phenomena as they unfold. But they might be inclined to lack a big picture, focusing on the details of what is happening within their own specialization. If it's "just a bird," an astronomer is not going to pay attention. And vice versa with the ornithologist. <br><br>The general public, one might think, will never "get it." They will not be able to tell the difference between peak oil and biblical prophecy, international banking conspiracies, immigrant hoards, solar flares, etc. etc. They'll just have to learn to deal with the effects without ever actually "believing" why it's happening. And they will probably reach for the explanation that makes them feel the most special and/or threatened (it's always a hostile alien spaceship, never a stealth bomber belonging to their own nation's air force). <br><br>Which doesn't leave very many people who will be interested in an accurate large-scale picture of the processes. Nor many other people who will be interested in what those few people might have to say. <br><br>So it looks like we can expect people to act the way that people act!<br><br><a href=#c3443497899795099942 title="comment permalink">7/17/14, 3:34 PM</a><br><br>

Wheeler</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>@Mister Roboto,<br>I agree that there is something behind the alien abduction phenomenon. However, I would like to point out that, using for the most part the same techniques, people who go looking for alien abductions find alien abductions, people who go looking for childhood sexual abuse find childhood sexual abuse, likewise for angels, satanists, past lives, near death experiences, astral projections, etc. So while I do think there is an actual phenomenon there, I think a lot of the interpretation is molded by the researcher.<br><br>@JMG,<br>In a way, I find the alienists refusal to incorporate the new data to be the more disturbing, because your explanation doesn't necessarily disprove their beliefs. They can still hold, albeit completely without evidence, that these were actually alien technologies that the military was testing, so then they get to be right on all counts. And that becomes much tougher to debunk.<br><br>This is particularly relevant to collapse because it is very analogous to a strain of cornucopianism. They acknowledge all the constraints that dwindling resources place and accept that radical changes in lifestyle will be required. However, they believe that with the "appropriate" technology, life in the post-industrial future will be even better than it is currently. I mention this because I do have one foot in this camp; I believe it is technically possible.<br><br>However, we go back to the question of whether or not it is truly different this time. I think ultimately both sides are self-defeating. The ones who insist that it is different are the ones that will make sure we go down the same path that every other civilization has gone down. More interesting, though, is the "here we go again" crowd, like you. JMG. By learning from history and preparing for the coming dark age, we can significantly change the ultimate outcome. Which of these forces ultimately prevails is pretty much unknowable ahead of time.<br><br><a href=#c8350452896178408303 title="comment permalink">7/17/14, 3:46 PM</a><br><br>

You also seem to have missed the point, which I made in my earlier response to you, that while certain classes of odd human experiences have occurred for many centuries -- a point, btw, I also made in my book -- defining them as "UFO phenomena" is a modern habit, and (I would argue) derives from the Cold War-era disinformation project. I have no objection if you wish to disagree with me, but it would be helpful if you would pay attention to what I'm actually saying.<br><br>Bill, well, that's usually a safe bet!<br><br>John, hmm. I don't see myself as saying that we can change the ultimate outcome; I'm trying to say that we can adapt to the ultimate outcome in ways that are less self-defeating than the ones that are currently popular. Either way, down we go. <br><br>Mark, thank you! I'd be grateful if you could mention that to those of your friends who like to read; word of mouth is the only way a book from a small publisher with no ad budget is ever going to get a decent readership. <br><br>Onething, nah, I've met some of the people who do crop circles. Jim Schnabel's <i>Round in Circles</i> is probably the best introduction to the phenomenon. <br><br>1ab, you know, that never occurred to me, but you're right -- it's an even better metaphor than I'd originally thought. <br><br>Kutamun, if the helium beings did invade, it might explain all the squeaky-voiced machismo in DC these days. <br><br>Bear, John Keel's books were faves of mine back in the day, and <i>The Mothman Prophecies</i> is still something I go back and reread from time to time, for the sheer raw weirdness of it. That aside, it's been pointed out repeatedly that he embroidered his stories more than a little for effect -- a common habit of good storytellers. <br><br>Candace, good! Yes, that's a very exact parallel. <br><br>Rapier, UFOs are very much about cognition -- also the way that the categories we use to sort out perceptions shape what we perceive. Once the category "UFO"<br>was invented, all kinds of formerly unrelated human experiences were sucked into the cultural vortex thus created, and the result was one of the great mythic narratives of the 20th century.<br><br><a href=#c7393295333966157704 title="comment permalink">7/17/14, 8:36 PM</a><br><br>

Terrible, terrible, news.<br><br>What's frightening is the ramping up of anti-Russian rhetoric in the Western media. Before the fires have been extinguished or the dead collected, the drums of war are being beaten louder. <br><br>I think of the legal maxim: <i><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cui_bono rel=nofollow>cui bono</a></i>, who benefits? Neither Russia, nor the Federalist rebels, benefit in any way from this. There's no reason why they would do it.<br><br>It may have been a terrible accident; there's some evidence emerging that a Federalist SAM unit mistook the plane for a government military cargo plane.<br><br>On the other hand, it's been well documented that Blackwater and other mercenaries are present on the government side...<br><br>To make the connection with this week's post. I reached adulthood slightly before the end of the Cold War. It was good, then, to feel that we were on the side of right, of freedom and democracy. Then the Cold War ended, and we got the peace dividend: Western societies became a great deal more affluent, everything became better, and the New Age scene reflected this. A bright new world was emerging...<br><br>... except that it wasn't. We reached Peak Oil, we got caught up in short, sharp conflicts that turned into prolonged and bloody struggles in the dust. Asian competitors arose. Our moral primacy was lost, our material comfort started to become harder to maintain, and our faith in our leadership (political and economic) was lost.<br><br>This is uncomfortable. Suddenly there were no easy, off-the-shelf beliefs to have. Questioning, doubts, no easy answers.<br><br>The answer, perhaps, is war. Then there can be a return to easy Manicheanism.

Very sensible creatures too - not up for adventure at all - and in the fictional world they'd probably be closely represented by Hobbits! They have very poor eyesight, but an incredible sense of smell, so Fatso the wombat would have poked his or her nose out, taken a sniff of the cold air and snow. Possibly a snowflake may have even landed on that upturned nose? In a pique of true sensibility and proper discretion, she would have turned that nose right back around and gone back to bed. <br><br>Weather conditions yesterday and today can only be described as truly wombat sub-optimal.<br><br>Incidentally, they have the largest brain to body ratio of all of the marsupials.<br><br>Baby wombat is now very familiar with using the concrete drain which channels water from the road under the driveway and onto a swale at the very top of the shady orchard. She is like a big furry pipe cleaner!!! Possibly I made a wombat highway?<br><br>It is really fascinating that you are having a cool summer. The climate is really quite variable and the more stuff we chuck into it, the worse it gets.<br><br>Hi Cathy,<br><br>Thanks. Yeah, the snow is really novel and exciting. <br><br>Please don't melt though! 114F is hot, even for here. That is the absolute worst day of summer sort of temperature here.<br><br>Realistically a person cannot be outside during the hours of about 1pm to about 4pm on that sort of a day. I hide in the house (which has no air conditioning, but does have overhead fans which are very effective).<br><br>Tell you what though, last week an AU$500m class action was won against the power companies for the Black Saturday bushfire in Feb 09 which apparently began in Kilmore East and was apparently due to an electrical fault as apparently the overhead wires were overloaded - apparently due to over use of air conditioning devices in domestic situations. I'm not privy to the details, but only hearsay... (sorry for the disclaimers).<br><br>Anyway, the power companies have a novel solution to the whole heat wave / fire risk thing. Simply cut the power to high risk areas and it takes away that risk entirely. Simple and very effective and it has been communicated to people living up here.<br><br>Still, I enjoyed the snow too. hehe!<br><br>How weird was it seeing lots and lots of citrus fruit hanging off the trees in the snow too. A lovely lady that I know takes dozens of my citrus fruit and turns them into the most beautiful lemon butter/curd. Oh yeah, it’s good. The rest are eaten fresh.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c6391131681015032303 title="comment permalink">7/18/14, 2:53 AM</a><br><br>

I read a piece about what is known as the 'enlightened generation' in Japan, this quote gives the idea "They were born in the late 1980s on up, when their nation’s economic juggernaut, with its promises of lifetime employment and conspicuous celebrations of consumption, was already a spent historical force. They don’t believe the future will get better—so they make do with what they have. In one respect, they’re arch-realists. And they’re freaking their elders out." The article is at http://japanamerica.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/on-japans-satori-sedai-enlightened.html<br><br>Here in the UK, 6 years after the crash and 4 years into the Government's austerity programme the general public don't believe the BS spouted by the Government about the recovery, they can see from their own experience that things are not getting better. However most people do not have an inkling of how much worse it is going to get in the future.<br><br>Joanna Macy's work on apathy, the represssion of thoughts and feelings about how bad things really are in the world is highly relevant to this theme. I have seen you comment negatively in the past on her idea of the Great Turning, which could be seen as a fantasy which denies the reality we are facing, but I think there is a great deal of value in her 'Work that Reconnects' as a personal and community tool-kit for facing up to the challenges of our situation as a society.<br><br>I know things are going to get worse than better but that's not going to stop me trying to live the best life I can as a citizen of the Earth.<br><br><a href=#c6852678766623338685 title="comment permalink">7/18/14, 3:15 AM</a><br><br>

I tend to believe that perception is an interaction between our senses and our minds. When something unexpected is seen, our mind often leaps to conclusions, and provides a pattern that 'fits'. As individuals we can have favourite patterns, which we are more likely to fit to inconclusive sense data.<br><br>In fact I've done that myself, today, and it reflects how thoughts that have been on my mind actually pre-disposed me to 'see' one thing rather than another. <br><br>On closing my garden gate I saw a slug perched on the frame - it was the right shade of brown, right size and shape, and was obviously hiding in a shady spot. After all, it rained overnight, and it has been a very 'sluggy' year in the garden. But when I looked again, I saw it wasn't a slug at all, but a chip of wood - no doubt a piece of wind-blown mulch from the garden path. So I decided to dislodge it, and I found it had no weight to it, and it fluttered down like a leaf towards the ground. It had *obviously* fallen off the over-hanging cherry tree, which develops and sheds a few brown leaves... Then, before it hit the ground, it opened its wings and flew away. I did apologize to the moth, both for disturbing it, and for so misidentifying it. <br><br>If I had just turned my back at first encounter, I would still be convinced now that it had been a slug. My expectations at each stage drove my perceptions. I know how my senses can be unreliable in that way, and tend to take extraordinary claims of any sighting with a big dose of 'perceptual error' salt. <br><br>At each step I was 100% convinced of the item I saw, even down to a narrative that justified it. And of course, all anyone else has is a second hand account on the internet. Who can be sure I'm not covering up the discovery of an alien, silicon-based lifeform?<br><br>The power of a pre-digested narrative to colour unexpected perceptions should not be underestimated, whether that narrative is UFOs, elves, faeries or angels; unstoppable progress or inevitable die-off.<br><br><a href=#c8204470548645913224 title="comment permalink">7/18/14, 5:03 AM</a><br><br>

Forty years ago, we certainly did have some influence, but no longer, it seems.<br><br>Of course our political and military leaders, diplomats, and government officials haven't caught on yet. They're still pretending we're a moderating influence there, oblivious apparently to the reality.

My daughter was completing several distance learning leaning high school projects yesterday. All were due midnight last night and she was overwhelmed with the tasks before her at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. All the angst, doubt, anger, and panic a 14 year old girl is capable of were on display. These were amplified by her desire to watch the movie her siblings were watching. <br><br>Dealing with this sort of thing is stock in trade for parents of teenagers: just calm the limbic system first so the prefrontal cortex can do its job once it starts to get its required share of the brain blood supply … damned hierarchical brain. Normally this would all be water off a ducks back for me except the subject matter of her tasks did prick me and I could not help share some of her emotional state. I dealt with this by rototilling in some buckwheat for our bees.<br><br>Her assigned tasks involved finding a real job to apply for, writing a resume specific to that application, writing a cover letter for the resume, and writing a thank you letter after the imaginary interview. Her tasks, of course, are practice for the real thing. Now a 14 year old girl has virtually nothing in the way of training, education, or experience to get a foot in the door. Driving this point home was the ultimate point of the exercise i.e. start getting what you need now. Yes, but for what?<br><br>You can see the problem. <br><br>But its worse than just the absence of future jobs as the subject of this week's essay makes clear. Its the death of a certain type of hope and a whole value system that hope implies. My in-laws, long a go, decided to stop talking about the state of the world and the future in front of their grandchildren (my kids) for fear of stealing their hope. Later my father-in-law later decided to stop talking altogether about such things to his wife for fear of its effects on her mental health. <br><br>An acquaintance of mine used to work with first nations kids in remote locations. He said he could see the light gradually go out of their eyes as they got older and started to realize, no, they were not going to be an astronaut, or even a fireman. <br><br>What worked for me may not work for my children. As I see no clear road ahead for them, I'm afraid for them. The doors are closing. All I can see doing right now is to work both sides of the fence: prepare them for the standard route of work in the professions via conventional (and unconventional – home school) education as well as involve them in working a sub-subsistence organic “farm”.<br><br>On the bright side, all my kids and I went for a walk yesterday (before the psychodrama) to test and expand their knowledge of local wildflowers and medicinal herbs. Later we collected wild strawberries and mint. After our walk, we coaxed our ducks to eat out of hands and then went swimming with them in our pond. It was a beautiful day. <br><br>P.S. Note the requisite positive ending forced by flipping the chronology. <br><br>P.P.S. Actually, there is a real happy ending as my daughter got her assignments in by the midnight deadline … just.<br><br><a href=#c877647489693664545 title="comment permalink">7/18/14, 5:57 AM</a><br><br>

I, like JMG have Asperger's, so some of the more subtle nuances of social interaction tend to evade me. Still I do see what everyone is talking about. I think there is a part of it, at least in America that relates to the obsession with independence and individualism that is such a part of our cultural mythos. There's a major part of it that is technological though. When everyone you meet is immersed in their phones, it can be hard to relate to them. The generation that’s coming of age right now never knew a world without the internet, had a television instead of a parent, and most of their social interaction has been with non-player characters in videogames. We’re a society of media stimulation junkies, and it’s making it very, very difficult for even the most neurotypical children to interact. I used to do a lot of volunteer work and mentoring with teens and young adults on the Autism spectrum and noticed even more of it there, where almost every kid I worked with had a crippling videogame addiction. I think that’s one of the many reasons that JMG is so insistent on cutting back on the media stimulation. I do have to disagree with Mister Roboto though when he says that’s something that’s going to get worse rather than better. People are social mammals and we survive in groups, and on the downside of the slope learning how to work with other people is going to be a matter of life and death. And I expect that those suicide cults Greer talks about in this week’s article will get a lot of their membership from people whose only alternatives are dying alone surrounded by silence. One of the places people draw meaning is from each other, and I imagine in a world were that no longer be done from a bedroom computer interacting with computer programs, building strong, resilient, localized networks of trustworthy people through religious communities, volunteer organizations, friendships, etc. and getting as much of the social sphere of life back into the real world as possible is going to be a pretty good adaptive strategy right along with being more discerning and more sparing with the films, games, and other media we take in.<br><br>On an unrelated note… to get ready for the series on Dark Ages, I’ve been looking at lots of graphs of various indicators of the health of a civilization over the course of the past century and noticed that apparently every single statistic had something happen… presidential approval dropped, GDP growth slowed, the number of people on welfare rose, unemployment fell into a rapid descent, and oil prices rose rapidly and crashed, then everything promptly went back to following its regular pattern. I can’t for the life of me remember anything interesting or noteworthy happening then.

The last year has included a lot of mourning and isolation as I have been forgetting even the language of progress. As I forget that language I find myself at a loss to communicate with many others where progress was the traditional story and touch stone of communication. Some days or weeks my light grows dim and I wait, with decent patience, for it to come back and guide me toward another attempt and trial, trying various ways of being in a declining and desperate society. <br><br>Humans rarely thrive alone for long periods, and when they do thrive truly they bear strange fruit. And even in a city it is easy to be alone when there are no other players in the same story as oneself at a gathering. <br><br>I am active with the Rainbow Gatherings, among that people the dying culture is called Babylon. How like Babel sounds most attempts at discourse which try to dive at all beneath the surface. Babylon is a phatic expression, but also a stinging diagnosis; and the Bible's own story is a very succinct picture of a civilizations downfall. Sadly the Rainbow Gathering exist largely as a dependent on the feed trough, and has very similar vices to its estranged Patron culture. To its credit it is a very impressive test bed of refugee camp technologies: material and social both; and a seed bed for many different breeds of new stories and meanings, some of which I am better disposed towards than others.<br><br>The horror that has been so hard the last year is learning to bear being believed when I deny progress, it is not the experience the young preacher I once was anticipated. Because with the death of one story babel is the first succession. Even where facts are the same, even where interpretations are the same, if the speakers have no intentions, inspirations, to share speech feels so vain. What stories will we have to invent now? Who might be moved by what? Which pain will be the one which breaks the will of cynicism, and teaches the next world's reverence and piety?<br><br>Many of my inspirations are robbed from this blog, many from the history of Philosophy, some from bloody headed frustration at certain over common petty inspirations. <br><br>Now I seek out those whose inspirations are close enough kin to my own that we can communicate. This Sunday Fort Collins will have a small gathering of gardeners and would be early adapters a Hedge Of Wizards; I hope that some good seeds will germinate there, at least we will plant a few trees.<br><br><a href=#c2392729195985747591 title="comment permalink">7/18/14, 9:13 AM</a><br><br>

Talk about jumping on bandwagons. Next he'll be starting his own rock band: Archie Druid and the Snallygasters. :-)<br><br>Albert Budden was an English UFOlogist who turned sceptic in the 1990s. He actually went to meet "experiencers" and interviewed them. He was astonished at how often they lived near to electric pylons, or TV transmitters, or both. His theory was that they had become allergic to electromagnetism. He deduced that their hallucinations were a symbolic attempt by their subconscious to warn them, using modern archetypes, that their body was in fact being invaded by something alien: electromagnetism. Why were the beings, when seen, smooth and grey? Because the experiencers' minds were superimposing these hallucinations over their reality. Just as a PC has only limited memory and power to render a screen, so the mind did not have the power to provide a heavily detailed hallucination.<br><br>Budden tells of a fever he once had, when he had hallucinations of a plague of rats scurrying about the bottom of his wardrobe. The symbolism of disease was similar to that of the experiencers who believed their body was being invaded. Budden, who died in 2010, wrote a few very readable books in the 1990s, expounding his thesis.<br><br>As JMG suggests, UFOs (or some cases) come down to cognition or consciousness. Though nominally atheist, I can't claim to know everything that goes on in the universe, nor the extent of our consciousness. Occasionally, I've even myself had stunningly exact minor premonitions of banal events that happened the next day. I initially put them down to extreme coincidence or intuition, but over the decades there have been about eight such, so I am more open-minded now. <br><br>UFOlogy is highly entertaining, but we will never know how far technology can advance in unreachable parts of the universe. Here on Earth, signs are that there aren't many decades of advance left.<br><br><a href=#c5693457816968987558 title="comment permalink">7/18/14, 11:17 AM</a><br><br>

Have you noticed that we're already up to 100 comments? <br><br>Stephen, anywhere the US has military bases and an intelligence presence, it's worth investigating how many UFO sightings might have been cover for US aerospace activities. Australia has both, last I checked, and its military in the Cold War was pretty much a US subsidiary -- you had boots on the ground in Vietnam, as I recall. <br><br>Bogatyr, once Russia declined to accept the role of conquered province suitable for looting that the US tried to assign it in the Yeltsin years, a collision was inevitable. The US is in steep decline, and any serious shock to its ability to exert its power and keep the wealth pump running could trigger a massive domestic crisis; thus the blustering and bullying coming out of DC just now. No, I don't think this is going to end well, either. <br><br>Cherokee, I hope to meet a wombat someday. They sound like remarkably charming creatures. <br><br>Anne, your last sentence expresses exactly the attitude I hope to encourage with this blog.

I'm glad that Macy's doing something more useful at this point!<br><br>Bill, thanks for the info. <br><br>Tony, exactly -- which is why so much of this blog, and my new blog as well, are focused on the power of narratives. <br><br>Don, as I mentioned to Bogatyr, the US is in steep decline and probably not far from serious domestic crisis. The loss of any effective power to shape events in the Middle East is one very significant symptom of that. <br><br>Agent, I certainly remember my own adolescent meltdowns, so I can relate! It's got to be a massive challenge, getting kids ready for the future headed their way when so many other people are trying to get them ready for one that's never going to arrive.

I've tried to discuss that here in various ways, but there are no easy answers.<br><br>Gunnar, er, no costs? Ahem. So it's not going to cost anything to scrap all the infrastructure of the industrial world that depends on petroleum (and isn't suited to anything else), and find some other way to do such little tasks as growing food and getting it from the farm to the dinner table? You do your cause no service by ignoring the immense challenges that a transition away from oil is going to require. <br><br>Ice Torch, Michael Persinger has written some fascinating papers and a good book on the ways that electromagnetic fields can set off hallucinations by triggering various odd events in the human nervous system; he makes a case, and I think it's a good one, that some of the dizzying diversity of things that have been lumped together under the culturally constructed category "UFO phenomenon" may be caused by that. As I argue in my book, one of the main reasons that phenomenon has proved so resistant to study is that a vast number of unrelated things have been treated as though they're all aspects of the same thing.

What makes this example a particularly apt illustration of the time we live is that BOTH sides use "progress" as the underlying framework for their belief system. Either progress in the form of highly evolved beings more technically, ethically, morally advanced who will save us (new age/saucerhead) or progress as the march towards the freeing of the intellect from debased superstition (debunkers).<br><br>Without the cult of progress both beliefs deflate, as does Marxism, and New Age philosophy.

It would explain a few things... <br><br>Eric, by the summer of 2012 the various patches that had been slapped onto the US economy in the wake of the 2008-2009 crash were wearing thin. That's when the Fed launched unlimited quantitative easing -- basically, spinning the printing presses to cover th US national debt. Thus the dip and the sudden recovery. <br><br>Alan, exactly. Every source I've read on the F-35 that isn't beholden to the manufacturers or the Pentagon says its a total dog. The official name of the plane is "Lightning II;" in my forthcoming novel <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i>, the Air Force personnel that have to deal with it call it the Lardbucket. <br><br>Violet, exactly. If the narratives everyone uses to define and make sense of their lives are grounded on the monomyth of progress, and that goes away, everything's up for grabs -- and one likely consequence is that a great many people will not survive the transition, in one way or another. <br><br>Bill, that's par for the course for a religion whose followers no longer really believe in it -- you crank up the volume, in a hopeless effort to drown out your own doubts. I see a lot of that going on in the Neopagan scene right now, for that matter. <br><br>Rapier, there I think you're wrong. The US economy depends, more than those of its rivals, on being able to pump in flows of wealth from the rest of the world; the generation of chaos is to my mind far more likely to be the product of a fatal mismatch between the fantasy world of Washington DC and the real world that surrounds it, than of some coordinated plan. But I've talked about that at quite a bit of length in previous posts, and my book <i>Decline and Fall</i>. <br><br>Bill, it's possible.

You should try WA State, where I believe more than 40% of the population is among the 'nones'. Pagans aplenty out here.<br><br>I also believe that Christianity has lost mimesis among the young. We recently gathered with many nieces &amp; nephews, all 20-somethings, and they all seem to regard that said religion with almost an "ewwww" mentality (and many were not from the Pac NW, either). <br><br>I actually had mixed feelings about that. Although I am not a Christian, over the years I've come to appreciate the large amount of good that the churches do in the communities in which I've lived. There are a few organizations (largely nature/wilderness-based/earth-skills ones) that have arisen in some places that seem to function in the same type of role, but I still see many more communities where churches have not been replaced by anything, really, and I find that concerning.

A story on this same shootdown in ITAR-TASS - correct location, a/c misidentified: http://en.itar-tass.com/world/741164 "DONETSK, July 17. /ITAR-TASS/. Militiamen of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) brought down a military transport Antonov-26 (An-26) plane of the Ukrainian Air Force on the outskirts of the town of Torez, eyewitnesses said.<br><br>A missile hit the An-26, it fell on the ground and caught blaze, they said.<br><br>On July 14, militiamen of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic downed another An-26 of the Ukrainian Air Force."<br><br>It's pretty clear that it was a tragic mistake; and the pilot of the a/c shouldn't have been flying over a known war zone so that his airline could save some money on fuel. I hope That Malaysian Air's days as an airline are numbered...<br><br>One would hope that the responsible elements of the National Security State would have this figured out by now and would accordingly tone down the rhetoric.<br><br>2. As for UFOs, I thought I saw one myself back in 1972 when I was a kid, one of the stars in the sky appeared to be moving oddly... so I called in a UFO report to the local SAC base, and I told them where in the sky it was, and they got a visual on it, too, but they could absolutely not pick it up on radar. At that point, they hung up, and about 3 minutes later I heard a bunch of jets go to their afterburners - they scrambled their fighter wing... The next morning an Air Force colonel came over to the house and asked me just what I saw and I told him, and he said they thought it was a Russian spy plane, but in the future, leave off the UFO reports please and thank you. Now I wonder if it wasn't one of ours with a stealth coating or something like that.<br><br><a href=#c2647407958685715445 title="comment permalink">7/19/14, 12:43 AM</a><br><br>

Apologies if this may anticipate future posts.<br><br>Reduction in access to fossil-fuels and all that come with them and access to money will not necessarily be a completely bad thing. When Cuba lost over half of its oil imports due to the fall of the Soviet Union 1990 it went through an instant Peak Oil and had to make significant adaptations - localising facilities such as health care &amp; education and growing food without industrial agriculture. People actually got fitter from eating more healthy food &amp; walking more. There is a great film about this http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814275/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl <br><br>In Western society we have overabundance, leading to what has been termed Affluenza, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affluenza we have an epidemic of obesity and a host of associated diseases such as diabetes, heart disease &amp; cancer due to having excessive amounts of food especially fatty, sweet foods available which our ancestors did not have. We have conspicuous consumption and waste of resources. We have vapid mass media entertainment for the masses. But we are not healthier or happier as a result, in fact the reverse. Studies show that people are happiest at a pretty modest income level. Many of us who have downshifted by choice or by being forced to by circumstance have a better quality of life as a result. Check out http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/sustainable-happiness/the-good-life-doesn2019t-have-to-cost-the-planet<br><br>However I am quite aware that this really only applies if you still have some money to live on and there is a still a reasonably functioning infrastructure, which is going to be less and less the case as time goes on. Since we hit peak money as well as peak oil in 2008 the pie has got smaller, the rich are clinging onto their share whilst everyone else is getting less. In particular the poor, sick, disabled and elderly are being thrown out of the boat. In the UK we have had an explosion of food-banks as benefits have been ruthlessly cut and even when people can get jobs they are often on zero-hours contracts with no guarantee of income. Many sick &amp; disabled people have been assessed as fit to work under a flawed assessment procedure, some of whom have died shortly afterwards. The health service is having to make massive savings which in the mental health service I work in means budget cuts of 5% year on year, which will be over 20% in 5 years, so services are being cut. The cuts to social services budgets are even more drastic. And all of this is in one of the most affluent countries in the world.<br><br>I am aware this is just the start of the downward curve. At some point in the next few years we will get another major financial crash, as predicted by Nicole Foss at the Automatic Earth http://www.theautomaticearth.com/ things could go south in a hurry when it comes, we can't really afford to prop up the banks the way we did last time, your thoughts on what to expect when the next crash happens will be really useful.<br><br>I and my husband are doing what we can to adapt to declining income and spiraling prices for energy &amp; food and to prepare for the worse to come. We have an allotment and grow a lot of our own fruit &amp; veg, we have a few acres of woodland so can produce fuel for our woodburner and can forage for fruit &amp; herbs which grow there. We live a healthy lifestyle to reduce the risk of avoidable lifestyle related diseases. We practice Druidry &amp; Buddhism which helps make us emotionally resilient for the challenges we face and provides an alternative source of meaning &amp; purpose to that of mainstream society and a community of like-minded people who think the same way. We can't save the world but we can do our bit to look after our piece of it.<br><br><a href=#c2619896341548673021 title="comment permalink">7/19/14, 3:07 AM</a><br><br>

But when I got there, no one wanted to talk about any such thing. They were much too busy trying to keep a roof overhead, keep the daughter in school, the son out of the army and find a place to store 100 kilo of potatoes for the winter.<br><br>There's no doubt that many people did not survive the dry run for collapse that was mid-nineties Kazakhstan. Male life expectancy was dropping to the mid-fifties and most of that had to do not just with material suffering, but the ripping away of life's sureties - salaries, certificates, positions, status all lost their value and that hit middle aged men the hardest. Vodka and automobiles culled that herd.<br><br>But one advantage the Soviet people had was that they'd almost all given up on the monomyth of Soviet progress. There was no collapse of an ideology to study, because it had been hollowed out to just another bit of habitual theater.<br><br>So the reaction (and the long-established practice) was to hunker down, and do their best to ignore anyone who was rash enough to rave about a new myth - capitalism, Islamism, nationalism, socialism or whatever. The state was happy to encourage that for the most part.<br><br>In the current US, as I ignore the pundits and the boosters and talk to regular people, I find very little faith in the myth of progress. Yes, your analysis is correct that it's the accepted default mode, and people don't really have cognitive alternatives other than to wish for it to be true. But they don't seem to believe it. The faith is broken at least when it comes to their little part of the world - and for many even in the big picture.<br><br>When the failure of Progress becomes too obvious to ignore, there will be plenty of your saucer-head dead-enders.

In the 1940s and 1950s, there were a lot of occult explanations in circulation, via the contactee scene and the early New Age movement -- "serious" histories of the UFO scene don't like to talk about those. In the 1960s, you had the heyday of the "hardware hypothesis," the notion that UFOs were nust-and-bolts spacecraft from some other world; the 1970s saw the "New Wave" in UFOlogy, with people such as John Keel and Jacques Vallee reviving the ideas of Charles Fort and suggesting that the universe was basically nuts; then in the 1980s, with the popularization of the abductee phenomenon, you had one very popular wing of the movement go in for paranormal explanations while another hewed tightly to the "hardware hypothesis." It's a complicated history, and still awaits a good cultural historian. <br><br>Anne, while you're certainly right that many people in the industrial world have so much wealth it's bad for them, have you ever tried suggesting that they give up a significant fraction of it, say, half?

It looks like he talks crazy stuff 50% of the time and then the other half mentions the unmentionable topics that concern the population like welfare, university fees - he even throws in the old chestnut that he was on welfare at one stage. He is gaining in popularity and currently hold the balance of power at a Federal level. One to watch for sure, I always have an unsettled feeling when I hear him. It appears that he is pursuing a strategy of simply disrupting the activities of the politicians and standing by whilst they self-implode… To be brutally honest, the federal politicians can’t complain as they have fostered a toxic environment over the past decade. I would have thought that the Prime Minister, of all, people should have understood the golden rule of: “Do unto others”…<br><br>I reckon the two main political parties here (and I include the Greens in with that) are in serious danger of throwing themselves into irrelevance simply because they are comfortable with their current status. Meanwhile the world changes around them. It is distressing to listen to them argue with each other, because somehow they lose themselves in that comfortable old argument and forget why they are there in the first place. They are there to serve the population. It is not hard and it is a message that they would do well to consider and tone down the rhetoric and get on with the job at hand.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c5147652898785859435 title="comment permalink">7/19/14, 5:42 PM</a><br><br>

There are so many signs: evangelicals now drinking, gambling, and supporting gay people openly and without reservation, particularly among young evangelicals. I mean, if you abandon beliefs that until recently you proclaimed were essential to your faith, abandoning the faith will follow soon after. What's the point of going to church if you're not going to condemn gays, gambling, and liquor. Another encouraging sign is the way other evangelicals have given up on changing society, believing society to be hopelessly corrupt. This self-cloistering is a good sign as far as limiting the effect of evangelical fundamentalism on the greater society.<br><br><a href=#c6964709808725434664 title="comment permalink">7/19/14, 6:33 PM</a><br><br>

I think I approached such a state while driving once. I was going like a bat out of Hades on a winding country road and realized that for a moment time seemed to slow down and my perceptions were razor sharp. It was like I could see every piece of rock, every crumb of soil in a cut bank as I briefly slowed and went around the curve. I still have some moments, un-called and un-sought, when I am out in nature. I cherish them when I see a dragon fly in mid flight or a wild canary eating milkweed seeds. Precious moments that give me joy and I miss them because there have been so few the last couple of years.<br><br>@ AlanfromBigEasy, The funny thing about modern people is they think that something has to be newer, bigger, more complex and more expensive in order for it to be more effective. Your example is not a new one. Some twenty years or so ago, I believe it was Boeing built a fighter jet that was fast, agile, easy to fly and easy to repair. It was also less expensive then the hi-tech jet sold to our military at the time. NONE of our less affluent partners would buy them because it wasn't the top of the line like 'our jets.'<br><br>In my humble opinion newer, more expensive and more complicated to operate doesn't mean better by any stretch of the imagination.

I see a lot of people in PO community suffering from confirmation bias, they are always looking for stories which confirm their worst fears. I haven't seen many people saying, oh I was wrong, here's my updated view. (I suffered from the same for some time and I no longer browse the same blogs over and over.)<br><br>2. Collapse is inevitable yes and it's not that much different this time but coping strategies will vary radically from one nation to another. For example learning farming makes zero sense for me because I will be competing with hundreds of millions of farmers.<br><br>3. Prior knowledge helps in survival but it's mostly people who have the right kind of attitude who make the cut, applies to PO as well. Ignorance is sometimes bliss indeed.<br><br>4. Disappointment and anger have very little to do with poverty and everything to do with expectations. For example it's mostly middle class people who rebel (because they feel cheated).

I'm guessing then that when there's a major crash like the one in 2008, instead of looking for the types of recovery patterns we've seen following any of the crashes that happened in the 20th century (crash, recovery, expansion) will be replaced by something more like the 2008/2012 pattern (crash, partial recovery, dip, recovery, plateau).

Fresh eyes from the outside ie from Eastern Europe - bring new approaches and new perspectives. <br><br>Though, IMO, the most effective lies are the simplest. These lies go viral, they infect the country's cultural software, replicating through the decades. <br><br>To me, one of Wall Street's foundational lies was this: that paying a mortgage is forced saving. I've heard this lie for as long as I can remember. People build their lives around this lie, they pour enormous resources into it, entire industries depend on it. <br><br>Systems built on lies don't survive. And so we had the financial crisis and US housing crash. But even so I still hear the lie. People won't let go of it. Like the cockroach, this lie has enormous resilience. <br><br>Is paying principal and interest the same thing as putting aside a portion of your monthly pay into a saving account? Of course not. It's absurd. But be careful what you say for people will defend this lie vociferously. <br><br>And a very clever lie it is because it builds the foundation for new lies. For example, if you can believe that home equity is the same thing as cold hard cash in the bank then it's just a small step to believing that inflating stock prices are the same. Neither are a replacement for putting cash in the bank but people will believe to their dying breath that they are. <br><br>That, I think. is the secret of this foundational lie, that its destructive power is in its ability to not only maintain its own existence but also to found new lies, that is, to mutate and adapt to novel circumstances. I have to applaud the originator, in getting people to believe this lie, he simultaneously got people to think of themselves as intellectually agile financial sophisticates thus guaranteeing the lie's success and survival. <br> <br>Would Russian and eastern European liars have the sneaky, under-handed genius of Wall Street?

It's the standard behavior of a pop religious movement that's about to implode.<br><br>Cathy, thank you -- that's very promising indeed. <br><br>G Ruda, nah, it'll just have an implant somewhere...<br><br>Zaphod, in southern Oregon you have to worry about drought, major forest fires, and the chance that the next big subduction quake will hit during your lifetime. If those don't bother you, it's not a bad option. Me, I wanted someplace that's expected to have steady rainfall straight through the arc of climate change, where real estate costs are below rock bottom and social networks haven't been completely shredded by the pressures of consumer culture; I also wanted a place that's already undergone economic collapse, since that way it would have much less distance to fall. That's why I left southern Oregon for the north central Appalachians. <br><br>Anne, if people in Britain are expecting hard times ahead, they may actually have an easier time of it. It's the mismatch between expectations and reality that breeds real trouble. <br><br>Wiseman, welcome back! Those observations are useful for those of us who don't live in India, for that matter. <br><br>Ervino, where on earth do you get that? "Schadenfreude and cupio dissolvi" are not things that interest me -- like any other attempt to make history serve as a justification for emotional states, they're not helpful. My attitude hasn't changed; human beings are what they are, the universe is what it is, and those who want to do something other than run face first into the brick wall of the future need to get over themselves and start dealing with the very difficult future that's imminent. <br><br>Eric, the other thing to keep in mind is the mismatch between statistics and the reality on the ground. The statistics turned up in 2012; for most Americans, though, bad times just kept getting worse. No doubt the GDP will be hitting new highs fifty years from now, when most Americans live in shantytowns and electricity and running water are rarities. <br><br>Roger, I don't see the real estate lie as foundational -- it derives from a deeper set of assumptions about progress and economic growth. There was a time when sinking your money into a house payment actually did make financial sense; my father profited mightily from that, over a period of time extending from the 1960s to the 2000s. It's just that at this point, things have changed, growth is over, and what once worked has now become a lethal trap. <br><br>Shane, fascinating. I wonder how much of the Right will pick that up.<br><br><a href=#c6806540050601850110 title="comment permalink">7/21/14, 12:01 PM</a><br><br>

Harry Truman argued more than a half century ago that most politicians are little more than glorified prostitutes and there is something to be said for this point of view. I have noticed that there has been a growing sympathy on the Right for Russia and Putin, in part because post-Soviet Russia is now seen as the champion of traditional and conservative values. There are a number of right-wing American intellectuals, including Pat Buchanan and William Lind, who have become openly pro-Russian.

It's a little tricky to catch all the implications of this term by a single English word, but they imply a constant readiness to fight, even to attack, in defense of their independence, a distinct lack of deference toward any non-Cossack or central government or authority, and something of what in English is called "loose cannons."<br><br>In short, groups of fighters ungovernable by outside authority, quick to fight, and as heavily armed as they can manage, even beyond whatever the law or the central government may allow. We have people somewhat like that here in the USA, too, but they generally lack the heavy firepower that appears to have become widely available after the collapse of the USSR and the loss of central control over some stores of military weaponry.<br><br>Short version: in the West such a use of military weapons systems to down a plane would normally be an overt or covert action of some government.

The (metaphysical) planes are viewed as discrete multidimensional spaces, that may or may not intersect with the plane of our primary existence, in the way that two curving 2D planes in 3D space may or may not intersect with each other. This applies whether you are talking about quantum mechanical multiverses, which do not intersect, or metaphysical realms, which may intersect (depending on your belief system).<br><br><a href=#c2583236969536067597 title="comment permalink">7/22/14, 6:30 AM</a><br><br>
