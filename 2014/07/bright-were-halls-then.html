<div class=MsoNormal>
Arnold Toynbee, whose magisterial writings on history have been a recurring source of inspiration for this blog, has pointed out an intriguing difference between the way civilizations rise and the way they fall. On the way up, he noted, each civilization tends to diverge not merely from its neighbors but from all other civilizations throughout history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its political and religious institutions, its arts and architecture, and all the other details of its daily life take on distinctive forms, so that as it nears maturity, even the briefest glance at one of its creations is often enough to identify its source.</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Once the peak is past and the long road down begins, though, that pattern of divergence shifts into reverse, slowly at first, and then with increasing speed. A curious sort of homogenization takes place: distinctive features are lost, and common patterns emerge in their place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That doesn’t happen all at once, and different cultural forms lose their distinctive outlines at different rates, but the further down the trajectory of decline and fall a civilization proceeds, the more it resembles every other civilization in decline. By the time that trajectory bottoms out, the resemblance is all but total; compare one postcollapse society to another—the societies of post-Roman Europe, let’s say, with those of post-Mycenean Greece—and it can be hard to believe that dark age societies so similar could have emerged out of the wreckage of civilizations so different. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s interesting to speculate about why this reversion to the mean should be so regular a theme in the twilight and afermath of so many civilizations. Still, the recurring patterns of decline and fall have another implication—or, if you will, another application. I’ve noted here and elsewhere that modern industrial society, especially but not only here in North America, is showing all the usual symptoms of a civilization on its way toward history’s compost bin. If we’ve started along the familiar track of decline and fall—and I think a very good case can be made for that hypothesis—it should be possible to map the standard features of the way down onto the details of our current situation, and come up with a fairly accurate sense of the shape of the future ahead of us. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All the caveats raised in <a href=../../2014/07/in-handful-of-dust.html>last week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> post</a> deserve repetition here, of course. The part of history that can be guessed in advance is a matter of broad trends and overall patterns, not the sort of specific incidents that make up so much of history as it happens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Exactly how the pressures bearing down on late industrial America will work out in the day-by-day realities of politics, economics, and society will be determined by the usual interplay of individual choices and pure dumb luck. That said, the broad trends and overall patterns are worth tracking in their own right, and some things that look as though they ought to belong to the realm of the unpredictable—for example, the political and military dynamics of border regions, or the relations among the imperial society’s political class, its increasingly disenfranchised lower classes, and the peoples outside its borders—follow predictable patterns in case after case in history, and show every sign of doing the same thing this time around too.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What I’m suggesting, in fact, is that in a very real sense, it’s possible to map out the history of North America over the next five centuries or so in advance. That’s a sweeping claim, and I’m well aware that the immediate response of at least some of my readers will be to reject the possibility out of hand. I’d like to encourage those who have this reaction to try to keep an open mind. In the posts to come, I plan on illustrating every significant point I make with historical examples from the twilight years of other civilizations, as well as evidence from the current example insofar as that’s available yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus it should be possible for my readers to follow the argument as it unfolds and see how it hangs together.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course all this presupposes that the lessons of the past actually have some relevance to our future. I’m aware that that’s a controversial proposal these days, but to my mind the controversy says more about the popular idiocies of our time than it does about the facts on the ground. I’ve discussed in <a href=../../2014/03/american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html>previous posts</a> how people in today’s America have taken to using thoughtstoppers such as "but it’s different this time!" to protect themselves from learning anything from history—a habit that no doubt does wonders for their peace of mind today, though it pretty much guarantees them a face-first collision with a brick wall of misery and failure not much further down time’s road. Those who insist on clinging to that habit are not going to find the next year or so of posts here to their taste.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They won’t be the only ones. Among the resources I plan on using to trace out the history of the next five centuries is the current state of the art in the environmental sciences, and that includes the very substantial body of evidence and research on anthropogenic climate change. I’m aware that some people consider that controversial, and of course some very rich corporate interests have invested a lot of money into convincing people that it’s controversial, but I’ve read extensively on all sides of the subject, and the arguments against taking anthropogenic climate change seriously strike me as specious. I don’t propose to debate the matter here, either—there are plenty of forums for that. While I propose to leaven current model-based estimates on climate change and sea level rise with the evidence from paleoclimatology, those who insist that there’s nothing at all the matter with treating the atmosphere as an aerial sewer for greenhouse gases are not going to be happy with the posts ahead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I also propose to discuss industrial civilization’s decline and fall without trying to sugarcoat the harsher dimensions of that process, and that’s going to ruffle yet another set of feathers. Regular readers will recall <a href=../../2014/01/a-bargain-with-archdruid.html>a post earlier this year</a> discussing the desperate attempts to insist that it won’t be that bad, really it won’t, that were starting to show up in the flurry of criticism each of these weekly essays reliably fields.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s even more common now than it was then; nowadays, in fact, whenever one of my posts uses words such as "decline" or "dark age," I can count on being taken to task by critics who insist earnestly that such language is too negative, that of course we’re facing a shift to a different kind of society but I shouldn’t describe it in such disempowering terms, and so on through the whole vocabulary of the obligatory optimism that’s so fashionable among the privileged these days. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m pretty sure, as noted in the blog post just cited, that this marks the beginning of a shift by the peak oil community as a whole out of the second of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross’ famous five stages, the stage of anger, into the third stage of bargaining. That’s welcome, in that it brings us closer to the point at which people have finished dealing with their own psychological issues and can get to work coping with the predicament of our time, but it’s still as much an evasion of that predicament as denial and anger were. The fall of a civilization is not a pleasant prospect—and that’s what we’re talking about, of course: the decline and fall of industrial civilization, the long passage through a dark age, and the first stirrings of the successor societies that will build on our ruins. That’s how the life cycle of a civilization ends, and it’s the way that ours is ending right now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What that means in practice is that most of the familiar assumptions people in the industrial world like to make about the future will be stood on their heads in the decades and centuries ahead. Most of the rhetoric being splashed about these days in support of this or that or the other Great Turning that will save us from the consequences of our own actions assumes, as a matter of course, that a majority of people in the United States—or, heaven help us, in the whole industrial world—can and will come together around some broadly accepted set of values and some agreed-upon plan of action to rescue industrial civilization from the rising spiral of crises that surrounds it. My readers may have noticed that things seem to be moving in the opposite direction, and history suggests that they’re quite correct.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Among the standard phenomena of decline and fall, in fact, is the shattering of the collective consensus that gives a growing society the capacity to act together to accomplish much of anything at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The schism between the political class and the rest of the population—you can certainly call these "the 1%" and "the 99%" if you wish—is simply the most visible of the fissures that spread through every declining civilization, breaking it into a crazy quilt of dissident fragments pursuing competing ideals and agendas. That process has a predictable endpoint, too:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>as the increasingly grotesque misbehavior of the political class loses it whatever respect and loyalty it once received from the rest of society, and the masses abandon their trust in the political institutions of their society, charismatic leaders from outside the political class fill the vacuum, violence becomes the normal arbiter of power, and the rule of law becomes a polite fiction when it isn’t simply abandoned altogether. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The economic sphere of a society in decline undergoes a parallel fragmentation for different reasons. In ages of economic expansion, the labor of the working classes yields enough profit to cover the costs of a more or less complex superstructure, whether that superstructure consists of the pharaohs and priesthoods of ancient Egypt or the bureaucrats and investment bankers of late industrial America. As expansion gives way to contraction, the production of goods and services no longer yields the profit ot once did, but the members of the political class, whose power and wealth depend on the superstructure, are predictably unwilling to lose their privileged status and have the power to keep themselves fed at everyone else’s expense. The reliable result is a squeeze on productive economic activity that drives a declining civilization into one convulsive financial crisis after another, and ends by shredding its capacity to produce even the most necessary goods and services . </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In response, people begin dropping out of the economic mainstream altogether, because scrabbling for subsistence on the economic fringes is less futile than trying to get by in a system increasingly rigged against them. Rising taxes, declining government services, and systematic privatization of public goods by the rich compete to alienate more and more people from the established order, and the debasement of the money system in an attempt to make up for faltering tax revenues drives more and more economic activity into forms of exchange that don’t involve money at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the monetary system fails, in turn, economies of scale become impossible to exploit; the economy fragments and simplifies until bare economic subsistence on local resources, occasionally supplemented by plunder, becomes the sole surviving form of economic activity</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Taken together, these patterns of political fragmentation and economic unraveling send the political class of a failing civilization on a feet-first journey through the exit doors of history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The only skills its members have, by and large, are those needed to manipulate the complex political and economic levers of their society, and their power depends entirely on the active loyalty of their subordinates, all the way down the chain of command, and the passive obedience of the rest of society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The collapse of political institutions strips the political class of any claim to legitimacy, the breakdown of the economic system limits its ability to buy the loyalty of those that it can no longer inspire, the breakdown of the levers of control strips its members of the only actual power they’ve got, and that’s when they find themselves having to compete for followers with the charismatic leaders rising just then from the lower echelons of society. The endgame, far more often than not, comes when the political class tries to hire the rising leaders of the disenfranchised as a source of muscle to control the rest of the populace, and finds out the hard way that it’s the people who carry the weapons, not the ones who think they’re giving the orders, who actually exercise power. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The implosion of the political class has implications that go well beyond a simple change in personnel at the upper levels of society. The political and social fragmentation mentioned earlier applies just as forcefully to the less tangible dimensions of human life—its ideas and ideals, its beliefs and values and cultural practices. As a civilization tips over into decline, its educational and cultural institutions, its arts, literature, sciences, philosophies and religions all become identified with its political class; this isn’t an accident, as the political class generally goes out of its way to exploit all these things for the sake of its own faltering authority and influence. To those outside the political class, in turn, the high culture of the civilization becomes alien and hateful, and when the political class goes down, the cultural resources that it harnessed to its service go down with it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Sometimes, some of those resources get salvaged by subcultures for their own purposes, as Christian monks and nuns salvaged portions of classical Greek and Roman philosophy and science for the greater glory of God. That’s not guaranteed, though, and even when it does happen, the salvage crew picks and chooses for its own reasons—the survival of classical Greek astronomy in the early medieval West, for example, happened simply because the Church needed to know how to calculate the date of Easter. Where no such motive exists, losses can be total: of the immense corpus of Roman music, the only thing that survives is a fragment of one tune that takes about 25 seconds to play, and there are historical examples in which even the simple trick of literacy got lost during the implosion of a civilization, and had to be imported centuries later from somewhere else. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All these transformations impact the human ecology of a falling civilization—that is, the basic relationships with the natural world on which every human society depends for day to day survival. Most civilizations know perfectly well what has to be done to keep topsoil in place, irrigation water flowing, harvests coming in, and all the other details of human interaction with the environment on a stable footing. The problem is always how to meet the required costs as economic growth ends, contraction sets in, and the ability of central governments to enforce their edicts begins to unravel. The habit of feeding the superstructure at the expense of everything else impacts the environment just as forcefully as it does the working classes:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>just as wages drop to starvation levels and keep falling, funding for necessary investments in infrastructure, fallow periods needed for crop rotation, and the other inputs that keep an agricultural system going in a sustainable manner all get cut.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As a result, topsoil washes away, agricultural hinterlands degrade into deserts or swamps, vital infrastructure collapses from malign neglect, and the ability of the land to support human life starts on the cascading descent that characterizes the end stage of decline—and so, in turn, does population, because human numbers in the last analysis are a dependent variable, not an independent one. Populations don’t grow or shrink because people just up and decide one day to have more or fewer babies; they’re constrained by ecological limits. In an expanding civilization, as its wealth and resource base increases, the population expands as well, since people can afford to have more children, and since more of the children born each year have access to the nutrition and basic health care that let them survive to breeding age themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When growth gives way to decline, population typically keeps rising for another generation or so due to sheer demographic momentum, and then begins to fall. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The consequences can be traced in the history of every collapsing civilization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the rural economy implodes due to agricultural failure on top of the more general economic decline, a growing fraction of the population concentrates in urban slum districts, and as public health measures collapse, these turn into incubators for infectious disease. Epidemics are thus a common feature in the history of declining civilizations, and of course war and famine are also significant factors, but an even larger toll is taken by the constant upward pressure exerted on death rates by poverty, malnutrition, crowding, and stress. As deaths outnumber births, population goes into a decline that can easily continue for centuries. It’s far from uncommon for the population of an area in the wake of a civilization to equal less than 10% of the figure it reached at the precollapse peak. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Factor these patterns together, follow them out over the usual one to three centuries of spiralling decline, and you have the standard picture of a dark age society: a mostly deserted countryside of small and scattered villages where subsistence farmers, illiterate and impoverished, struggle to coax fertility back into the depleted topsoil. Their goverments consist of the personal rule of local warlords, who take a share of each year’s harvest in exchange for protection from raiders and rough justice administered in the shade of any convenient tree. Their literature consists of poems, lovingly memorized and chanted to the sound of a simple stringed instrument, recalling the great deeds of the charismatic leaders of a vanished age, and these same poems also contain everything they know about their history. Their health care consists of herbs, a little rough surgery, and incantations cannily used to exploit the placebo effect. Their science—well, I’ll let you imagine that for yourself. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And the legacy of the past? Here’s some of what an anonymous poet in one dark age had to say about the previous civilization: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Bright were the halls then, many the bath-houses,</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
High the gables, loud the joyful clamor,</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Many the meadhalls full of delights</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Until mighty Fate overthrew it all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Wide was the slaughter, the plague-time came,</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Death took away all those brave men.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Broken their ramparts, fallen their halls,</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The city decayed; those who built it</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Fell to the earth. Thus these courts crumble,</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And roof-tiles fall from this arch of stone.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Fans of Anglo-Saxon poetry will recognize that as a passage from "The Ruin." If the processes of history follow their normal pattern, they will be chanting poems like this about the ruins of our cities four or five centuries from now. How we’ll get there, and what is likely to happen en route, will be the subject of most of the posts here for the next year or so. </div>

I for one am particularly eager to hear an outsider's take on climate change. It's important to my field, so in some sense I'm a professional. I'm an Engineer who does a lot of development work and planning, mostly on the coast, so I have access to the original scientific studies as well as the governmental policy responses. Lately following the various studies and predictions regarding climate change has become a lot like following the pop-science headlines about health and diet: for every serious scientific study, there's an equally serious and pedigreed study that says something completely different and incompatible, so it's hard to come away with any coherent understanding. Of course I can't promise I'll take your synthesis as gospel, but I'm sure you are not disturbed by that. I'm interested in anyone who wants to explore the whole picture instead of this or that detail.<br><br><a href=#c4651078471174608252 title="comment permalink">7/9/14, 5:28 PM</a><br><br>

Other American cities - the ones that survive in some form because they are located in a place where the available resources make it logical to maintain a city - will be like Jerusalem, where municipal building projects have to be undertaken with the cooperation of archaeologists because they tend to dig up so many ancient artifacts.<br><br>2) Depictions of American culture, and the culture of the rest of the industrial world, will be recognizable as a genre or subgenre in whatever the dominant pop culture mediums of the day are, but they will be twisted into whatever form the creatives of that era find suitable to their needs and would thus seem strange - even farcical - if any members of our own society could manage to be alive to see them. It will include works that mix and match elements of disparate decades that shouldn't go together, either through historical ignorance or a gap in the historical record or creative expediency - ie, you'll see characters dressing in 70's fashions but acting like 50's stock characters with some surviving fragment of 90's pop music playing in the background. You will also see elements of the now dead culture depicted in ways that would seem completely blasphemous to us now; think of the way horror movies have twisted Egyptian religion around for cheap thrills (the ubiquitous walking mummy avenging the defilement of his tomb), or countless depictions of Roman civilization in Hollywood costume epics, most of which said much more about the values and norms of the era in which they were made than they did about actual history.<br><br><a href=#c3098363272397049215 title="comment permalink">7/9/14, 6:09 PM</a><br><br>

The problem is always how to meet the required costs as economic growth ends, contraction sets in, and the ability of central governments to enforce their edicts begins to unravel."<br><br>I opened my lecture in my environmental science class on human population just this Monday using a graph of the human population for the past 2000 years to make this exact point. First, I describe how civilizations with effective central governments work very hard to increase human carrying capacity but the collapse of those governments results in a dramatic decrease in population as the carrying capacity falls. I then direct the students' attention to the fall in total human population that runs from 400 CE to about 700 CE on the graph. That's when the Western Roman Empire collapsed and Rome went from a city of more than one million in the late Fourth Century CE to 30,000 by the late Sixth Century CE. It never got above 50,000 throughout the Middle Ages.<br><br>Furthermore, the total population of the European portion of the Western Empire fell from 19.5 million to 12 million between 400 CE and 650 CE. The Eastern Empire didn't collapse, but its population fell over the same period from 28 million to 16 million.<br><br>http://www.tulane.edu/~august/H303/handouts/Population.htm<br><br>That collapse and decline on just one of four or so Eastern Hemisphere empires can be seen clearly on the graph, and it makes a strong impression on the students.<br><br>As for what caused that decline even in the Eastern Empire, you nailed it when you wrote "epidemics are thus a common feature in the history of declining civilizations." One of them was Justinian's Plague, which reversed the Eastern Empire's attempt to reconquer what was once the Western Empire.

For those familiar with 'World system Theory, ala Emmanuel Wallerstein, I live in the 'periphery,' ie a backward rural area, that never got fully integrated into the 'core' of the country's bustling metropolis, San Jose. At best the bureaucracies couldn't completely manage things out here. from crime to drugs to illegal deforestation, for any number of reasons things were never completely under control Now with the crash in the local tourism and gringo-second-home industry, plus economic pressures at the national level, you can see the symptoms of unraveling. Scattered incidents of lightly armed groups engaged in wanton and unpunished defiance of the "rule of law' are just two things that come to mind. It's not hard to imagine how things would devolve as the road to decline becomes steeper. On the good side, people really know and look out for each other, and shifting to a system of exchange is not such a leap from where things are still at in the fairly healthy remnants of an agricultural economy.

Coaxing fertility back into the soil is an enormous challenge. You left me with thoughts about how the ancient Greeks found the ecological limits of an export economy - the hard way.<br><br>A cheeky mate of mine said to me once: "Only those who have fallen off, can know for sure where the cliff actually is and everyone experiences it differently". He was referring to mental health matters, but the quote is apt (I believe) in this circumstance too.<br><br>Once I became aware, I've always felt that the practice of industrial agriculture was a sign of decline for sure. My gut feel is that only nature itself can now repair the vast damage we've inflicted on the soils and planet itself and it will happen in her own sweet time.<br><br>We could possibly speed up the soil and land restoration process through the vast growth and/or application of green manures and/or crops, but unfortunately we can't actually do that and eat at the same time. Plus we'd probably be inclined to eat the seeds instead.<br><br>Which is why I'm sitting here on a dark winters Thursday - it is lunchtime here - with no lights on, but with the computer happily whirring away.<br><br>I chose a different path to obtain access to energy sources that the majority of our culture doesn't really want to think too much about: Small scale solar electric; firewood; solar hot water; deep organic soils; onsite water collection; and local food etc. All of those are either local energy or an expression of that local energy. They're all good, but they just don't look or work like how you'd expect them - or have become used - to. Plus it takes a long time to get used to living with their foibles. I'm still learning...<br><br>You know I occasionally get an: “I feel really sorry for you dude” sort of response when I describe conditions here. The last time a few weeks back was a collector for a very large and well known environmental charity.

Good fishing, fresh water, shelter from the worst of the weather; a natural spot for habitation.<br><br>Fast-forward to the invasion of North America by various Europeans. The Brits, the Spanish, the French, even the Russians were wandering around the coast of what is now BC (tells you who won that round, eh), naming and claiming. The whitefellas have arrived.<br><br>Now comes the industrial revolution and fossil fuel; coal is "discovered" (i.e. a native guy told them about it, big mistake on his part), the steam donkey and other devices make their appearance, and Great Britain's requirement for cheap rations for WWI's soldiers throws the fishing industry into high gear and scatters canneries all over the coast. This trend slows down again during the Depression but kicks up as soon as "better times" come along (they weren't better times if you were a salmon). And eventually by the late 40's, early 50's, there is an explosion of whitefella life and culture and activity on the rugged and remote coastline of BC.<br><br>Canneries everywhere, traditional (they seem small now) trollers, driftnetters and gillnetters crowding the ports, logging operations all the heck over the place. And Namu is a bustling centre with a large cannery, a classic 50's diner, stores, dormitories, fuel dock, the works.<br><br>Fast forward just a wee bit (it doesn't take long); fish population much reduced, overcapitalisation putting the independent small boats out of business as the increasingly expensive licences get bought up by big money. Activity slows, the gold rush is faltering. By the 80's, communities are dying; people leave, homes stand vacant; the government officially condemns and destroys entire neighbourhoods in Ocean Falls. Old cannery sites and logging camps are abandoned. Namu is eventually sold (way cheap) to a private investor.<br><br>The idea of course was to situate a fishing/tourist camp there. But it didn't really work out. A couple of caretakers lived there (I visited during their tenure), growing potatoes in between the rattling old corrugated iron buildings, selling a bit of fuel to the occasional passing boat.<br><br>[continued]<br><br><a href=#c6977680519388477028 title="comment permalink">7/9/14, 9:16 PM</a><br><br>

Old boardwalks had rotted away; portions of the docks were no longer secure to walk on (and were succinctly labelled "NO" -- just that one word -- by the caretakers). One small generator still ran in the huge shed, next to the sleeping carcasses of a half dozen huge ones; one bare lightbulb shone above it day and night. Wire cages between the buildings held tomato plants, potatoes, cabbages. It was a post-peak-oil movie set; sheets of corrugated iron flapped sadly in the wind, and the evocative, all-too-human scents of rust and diesel mingled with the organic saltchuck smells. A small tramp freighter listed against the dock, barely afloat, rusting away quietly like a far-gone addict huddled in a stairwell. We never saw the caretakers in person, just the signs of their presence.<br><br>Just 3 or 4 years later, Namu's disintegration is accelerating (as such things do). The caretakers have given up and gone elsewhere. No one's minding the store. The docks are rotting away. Coastal marine biologists express concern about the fuel oil, chemicals, etc. which are inevitably heading towards the saltchuck. A team visits and pumps out the dying freighter now and then, but without their attention it too will sink (along with whatever contaminants it contains). The once-tall ice house has collapsed onto the freighter, which doesn't help :-) <br><br>The private owner can't afford the massive effort required to clean up Namu. The local band would like to buy the site back (after all, it was theirs for 10,000 years before the Anglos showed up) but not in its present, contaminated, degraded condition. And they certainly can't afford the cleanup. The government staunchly refuses to discuss the matter or admit that there's a problem. The cannery company? don't make me laugh. Long since defunct. No one, it seems, is responsible.<br><br>It seems a perfect parable to me of civilisational decline; the resource extraction outpost abandoned in place, never cleaned up, forgotten. A local writer summed it up when the caretakers left: "Namu Uninhabited for the First Time in 11,000 Years."<br><br>What a brief, strange, feverish, dangerous and poisonous flower was industrial civilisation, to usurp and interrupt 11 millennia of continuous inhabitation and then leave the place more or less *un*inhabitable.<br><br>Multiply Namu by 100, by thousands, by millions, and I think I see the pattern of the long decline. I also think I see a trajectory that accelerates as it sinks.<br><br><a href=#c3653595867085269356 title="comment permalink">7/9/14, 9:29 PM</a><br><br>

My working title is <i>Dark Age America: A Future History of the North American Continent 2050-2550 AD</i>. <br><br>Cole, most likely it won't be either-or, but both-and: there will be those who leverage existing resources and power structures, and those who build new ones, and in different cities and different periods, one or the other will be the more influential. I'll have a fair amount to say about this in a future post. <br><br>Boneyard, you're not so far off -- the Visigoths were permitted to enter the Roman Empire legally, and then were treated so badly that they turned on the Romans, with results you probably know about.

The mass migration from agricultural areas to cities happened on the upswing of industrial civilization due to the replacement of human labor with cheap fossil energy. I find it hard to believe that this trend will not reverse during the collapse, as hungry urbanites and suburbanites stake tenuous claims on fields of weeds left idle when economic collapse and dwindling oil combined to destroy the industrial monocultures.<br><br>2. A few science-driven fields, including genetics and computer engineering, continue to develop "new and improved" products as the economy falters around them. I suppose that eventually, like the fizzling space race, they will become nothing more than expensive curiosities. <br><br>3. No previous civilizations have had an equivalent of the Internet, allowing for immediate communication across borders. I suppose it could be an early victim of collapse, relying as it does on a fragile network of wires and hubs that is easily severed by power cuts or sabotage. On the other hand, the hacker generation is coming of age, and I would be not at all surprised to see some form of long-distance communication (ham radio based?) surviving far into the future and perhaps modified to allow Internet-like data transfer.<br><br><a href=#c5604295910582181783 title="comment permalink">7/9/14, 11:11 PM</a><br><br>

We did not fall into a Dark Age yet – there was stuff like the Marshall Plan and American suzerainty over Middle East oil, and industry defied gravity with oil and plastic and super-boats of iron ore and German and Japanese ‘miracles’ etc.<br> <br>But the non-existence of ‘our’ Empire was puzzling. Before our working classes went under the ‘bus’, to use your handy phrase, I remember a working class bloke in a pub seriously ashamed that ‘we’ were not the ones who were dealing with Vietnam and had left it to the Americans. And popular newspapers had a succession of stories from late 1940s about some game-changer when at one-leap ‘we’ would be ‘Great’ again. There was early on a giant version of our WWII bomber that was going to be the civil aviation winner of the near future. It was called the Brabazon. I think there was a Lord Brabazon in the background – more than daft. Later there was the Comet and then Concorde (though the latter was really French). There was a long sequence of wonder drugs for transforming our rather poor health. There was The Commonwealth. There was nuclear power. The list continues ad nauseam into my old age.

On the way up, as complexity increases, there are options for differentiation, hence a mature culture can become something unique and distinct; take that away and the society must become more and more constrained by basic factors like population dynamics, thermodynamics and ecology.<br><br>I've been thinking that this somehow relates to a society being unable to 'save' itself once decline begins. One thing I first really grasped about 10 years ago was that the internet, by increasing 'communication', was actiually destroying consensus through an intellectual/ideological process of Balkanisation. Though it's possible to 'communicate' with more people more easily, what in fact occurs is a complete ghettoisation of thought. People stick to their self-reinforcing tribes (or venture out as flame warriors to defeat the dragons of heresy in the ghettoes of opposing thought...)<br><br>Hence, with consensus destroyed, no two people live in the same world, never mind a whole society sharing a few about itself. It's bit of a chicken-egg, or horse-cart placement problem. Does decline produce this fracturing of worldviews, or vice versa? Either way, when the society has no common prognostication of what's wrong, there's clearly no way it can derive a common plan of action to 'save' itself. It all becomes a bit chaotic, in the Lorenzian sense. Somewhere in a basement a moon-landing denier flaps his wings on the internet, and twenty years later a whole continent ceases to believe in evolution, gravity and apple pie. There's no chance to save the old society, the best hope is to hasten the birth-pangs of the new. Except there's a new version of the new, to each his own vision.<br><br>Maybe after a suitably Homeric time-lapse, people will be sitting around campfires reciting epic poems about the final defeat of the old monster that ravaged nations and led away millions as slaves and sacrifices.

I see that at a smaller scale here, where social and political life is mostly organized around the churches. Still there are many community groups that are non-denominational and people do mix in those. They of course are the only ones really open to us. Also interesting, the old-fashioned rule of not discussing religion and politics in social settings still seems to be largely observed around here, though it is considered hopelessly passe in the urban/suburban world. Two of the couples we know who are best friends with each other and very active with animal rescue and animal cruelty issues are diametrically opposed in the current U.S. political spectrum.

Just about any term can be, if used, overused, and misused in that way with that intention. It's kind of like the evolution of euphemisms, where the euphemism becomes synonymous with the original term, so a new euphemism needs to be coined. A new term is meaningful for a while, then it eventually can just evolve into a bit of linguistic noise, or an off-the-shelf identity label.

(Currently re-reading Ecotechnic Future – very good!) One thing that I notice sometimes happens when we’re all discussing this – your timeline of “several centuries” seems to get lost, and folks start talking about collapse as if it’s gonna happen in ten years. In fact, it’s happening now – but the “dark ages” you are predicting to be farther off, right? I’m trying to focus both on adjustment to the constricted economy, and also to practicing/recording skills that need to be passed on somehow, because I won’t live to see any kind of Dark Ages.

Just last night I was at a poetry critique group and someone brought in a poem in which she tried to list each of the positions viz a viz climate change, but at the end, where she mentioned the doomers, she couldn’t resist a flip comment, suggesting an unconscious knee jerk reaction. But I was much more surprised that she was even writing about it – so I’m beginning to see, as you are, some of the “bargaining” attitude coming up.<br><br><i>In response, people begin dropping out of the economic mainstream altogether, because scrabbling for subsistence on the economic fringes is less futile than trying to get by in a system increasingly rigged against them.</i><br>I’m already beginning to see this in the rural area where I’m living… some handyman ads indicate cash only, with others it’s word of mouth, but the same thing. People have stopped arguing about whether to follow rules that seem to actively constrict their lives while embittering the higher-ups, and just focus on staying under the radar.<br><br><i>Where no such motive exists, losses can be total: of the immense corpus of Roman music, the only thing that survives is a fragment of one tune that takes about 25 seconds to play,<br></i><br>Apropos of that, there is a short audio clip of what they say is the oldest music ever found – written in cuneiform, and played by the researcher who uncovered it:<br>http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2006/12/the_oldest_song.html<br><br><i>Populations don’t grow or shrink because people just up and decide one day to have more or fewer babies; they’re constrained by ecological limits.</i><br>a current example :NHK World, Japanese tv online, has a series running about the government’s attempts to get more Japanese women to have babies, since the population is unbalanced young/old… but due to the declining economy, they’re not doing it despite “incentives”… <br><br>@Cherokee Organics: <i>All of those are either local energy or an expression of that local energy. They're all good, but they just don't look or work like how you'd expect them - or have become used - to.

And there are at least a few of them that are interested in appropriate tech with practical utility: One family recently gave a presentation about their home-built rocket stove.<br><br>If the phenomenon continues to thrive, I would expect makerspaces to be likely candidates as culture-bearers of the mechanical and information arts.

Not so much the Saxons, who tended to build in wood rather than stone, but the left-behind erstwhile "Roman Citizens" scrounging whatever they could re-use in an attempt to keep the home-fires burning, bereft of the benefits of Imperial infrastructure. And I can't help drawing parallels, as our leaders attempt to pull up the drawbridges behind them and make further cuts to the little support available to those in need. More &amp; more people are finding out that it can indeed happen to them, when illness or accident befalls them, and that not everyone who receives state help is a workshy layabout. It's more subtle than the withdrawal of the Legions, but it's happening... they are being left behind too, in a different way.<br><br>And people are slowly becoming more aware of it, though it's not the done thing to admit it in public. But we all know someone to whom this is happening... several private conversations I've had lately make me think that trust in our "betters" has been eroded clean away now, and people are starting to think for themselves, instead of blindly believing what we're told &amp; following the crowd. Maybe there's a little glimmer of hope there, or maybe it's the dawning of the darkness...<br><br><a href=#c5713274980795122011 title="comment permalink">7/10/14, 9:12 AM</a><br><br>

Two other things can happen. <br><br>When the empire weakens, its territory can be conquered and incorporated into some other empire. Or the vitality of the culture can revive before native political organization declines from the equivalent of kingship to something less complex.<br><br>An example of the former would be the Indian subcontinent, which keeps getting incorporated into one empire after another without ever becoming so impoverished or disorganized that it entirely loses roads, cities and literacy. <br><br>For the latter, I would propose Persia. I have a general impression that Persia has been successively part of several civilizations, the Biblical one, the Sassanian, the Byzantine and the Islamic, without ever lapsing into barbarism and always being either the central power of its empire or a wealthy province.<br><br>I'm not predicting that the US will have such luck, but perhaps some parts of the industrialized West might.<br><br><a href=#c5520054000640739080 title="comment permalink">7/10/14, 10:00 AM</a><br><br>

Still, you're right that it would be a very good place to be, one to three centuries from now. <br><br>Mark, the first two of your three things happened before -- cities always metastasize in the latter years of a civilization, and technological improvement is normally the last metric to topple over into visible decline. As for the internet (and its putative sustainable replacements), I'll be discussing the role of information technologies in previous dark ages and extrapolating from there -- the short form is that better means of preserving and transmitting information can make the bottom of the descent a little less severe, but they don't change the overall pattern.<br><br>Toro, okay, gotcha. I won't even inflict light beer on slugs! You can find the three inundations in books on Atlantis by Lewis Spence and other writers of the Theosophical era. <br><br>Joe, I've talked about that repeatedly in previous posts. The short form is that catabolic collapse does in fact include a time metric, though it's not an obvious one: the more resources a society has built into its existing capital, the longer it can stretch out its decline by cannibalizing its existing capital as a source of raw materials. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Quercus, thank you!<br><br>Roger, well, yes -- and that's one of the reasons I've put so much emphasis on the preservation of useful knowledge. <br><br>Phil, it's a common habit in the wake of a fallen empire.

I see the Baby Boom as the demographic result of the full onset of the petroleum age, a normal reaction to the torrent of cheap resources petroleum so briefly provided. <br><br>Will, that's fascinating. If such ideas are beginning to spread in those circles, there are things that we may be able to accomplish that would otherwise be out of reach. More on this in an upcoming post. <br><br>Zaphod, er "James"? <br><br>Escape, it isn't the first time. The Middle East turns into a powderkeg at regular intervals, and a spark is rarely far to seek. <br><br>Bill, that's good to hear. I suspect a lot of the current political labels, as you suggested last week, will dissolve once it becomes painfully clear that they were only relevant to an age of expansion. <br><br>Hawkcreek, not a shortening of the dark age, no, but the better the information technology, the less dark things get at the bottom of the arc. The thing that keeps advanced technology from staying in use in a dark age isn't usually technical in nature, it's social and economic -- a point I'll be covering in detail as we proceed. <br><br>Cathy, thanks for the updates -- useful to hear! As for the climate denialists, I get them here fairly often; I've tried spraying, but it barely slows them down. ;-)<br><br>Bill, I consider the emergence of the Maker movement to be an extremely positive sign; if it keeps on growing, that and the burgeoning farmers market/community supported agriculture scene may well turn into the seedbeds of the economy we'll have at the conclusion of the next big round of crises. <br><br>Thriftwizard, it's the dawning of the darkness. What often tends to be forgotten by historians is that for ordinary people, the dark age is often an improvement from the last years of the falling civilization. <br><br>Bear, I don't expect to see the nukes fly generally, though I'd be amazed if we get through the next fifty years without seeing a couple of cities vaporized. My sense, for what it's worth, is that you're mistaken about the US elite; they don't want war, they want to maintain some shreds of America's former global power and wealth, and are blustering and blundering more and more frantically. They won't invade another nation, because they know -- and so do most other countries -- that the US economy is too far gone to support anything but bullying weak Third World nations, and a major war against a well-armed opponent would almost certainly result in an American defeat, and the sudden implosion of what's left of US power. More, much more, on this as we proceed. <br><br>As for the hacker generation, as far as I can see you're spot on. The best and the brightest among today's 20-somethings aren't going into computers -- a lot of them are WWOOFing on organic farms and spending their off hours in Makerspaces.

If there is a difference, it is that the Industrial Age is a global empire, with all of the industrial economies entwined through rampant globalism. And, of course, the emerging nations are already caught up in that. Those not involved in the industrialized phase are victims of the colonialism of the rest, and pretty much already at the bottom of the hill, down which the rest are racing.<br><br>Consequently, there will be nobody around to conquer anyone... we will be in free fall, together.<br><br>And of course, John. Sorry - I just finished conversation with son-in-law, James, who cannot be called Jim or Jimmy, and who was doing a book report on "The Singularity is Near" - borrowed from yours truly.

There isn't a single continent on the entire planet that isn’t in constant, instantaneous communication with the rest of the world and even the least industrialized countries are still tied to the fate of industrial civilization due to the impacts of human overpopulation and soil degradation. That seems to mean that there isn’t a “somewhere else” left for us if that sort of total loss happens. For the Byzantines Rome didn't completely fall until the siege of Constantinople during the crusades, for the Arabs, the end of the Roman monopoly on trade in the Mediterranean meant Islamic merchant fleets could build a thriving civilization of their own and develop many of the scientific and magical traditions that would come to define the Renaissance in Europe. Meanwhile Eastern Asia shrugged at vague rumors of trouble across the mountains while the civilizations in the Americas never even knew there had been a Rome in the first place. That's the way it's always been with every other civilization we know about. While one part of the world is experiencing a dark age, some other civilization somewhere else remains unaffected.<br><br>Will the interconnectedness of the human world today, and the level of global communication we have today affect the kinds of knowledge that are lost, which areas suffer the most loss, the totality of that loss, or how much continuity there will be between our civilization and the civilizations of the future? It feels like it could go either way… a future civilization speculating about a mysterious race of land carvers who left no records behind, or a bottleneck effect where every single civilization of the future traces its history back to this one. Or… maybe industrial civilization isn’t as all encompassing as it seems to be. Maybe the civilizations that will preserve the bset of what we’ve created, who will step up and thrive as industrial civilization slips into its dark ages, and will plant the seeds of any ecotechnic future that might wait beyond those dark ages will sprout not from the ruined capitals of our world, but from a few scattered villages on the fringes of it. Places where people have never seen a car or a piece of currency but still have generators that power radios and isolated bits and pieces of Western medicine and science passed on from missionaries, peace corps activists, and field scientists.<br><br>I'm reminded of my favorite passage from "How The Irish Saved Civilization:<br><br>"What will be lost, and what saved, of our civilization probably lies beyond our powers to decide. No human group has ever figured out how to design its future. That future may be germinating today not in a boardroom in London or an office in Washington or a bank in Tokyo, but in some antic outpost or other -- a kindly British orphanage in the grim foothills of Peru, a house for the dying in a back street of Calcutta run by a fiercely single-minded Albanian nun, an easy-going French medical team at the starving edge of the Sahel, a mission to Somalia by Irish social workers who remember their own Great Hunger, a nursery program to assist convict-mothers at a New York Prison -- in some unheralded corner where a great-hearted human being is committed to loving outcasts in an extraordinary way.”<br><br>-Thomas Cahill<br><br><a href=#c9126423849808629095 title="comment permalink">7/10/14, 12:06 PM</a><br><br>

They are deliberately breaking apart carefully chosen small countries and sowing disorder to steal resources. Iraq was to lock down their oil. Libya and Syria are about oil. Afhanistan was to build a gas pipeline from (Turkmanistan?) behind it through a couple other countries, to the sea. US troops are already set up along the planned pipeline route. The Ukraine is an attempt to get control of their pipeline from Gazprom to Europe and install a tollbooth.

I really admire your ability to keep all the plates spinning. Lots of folks sanity depends on your weekly offerings, especially since the oil drum went away, <br><br>Been following your blog for many years. I'm in my mid seventies and believe I commented here a few years ago, but can't be certain. The "paradise of memory" does not have perfect recall. <br><br>Anyway, regarding your latest offering here and on your new blog Well of Galabes. Yup, we gonna go down. Magic is certainly going to be an important element in our future and gaining an understanding of all its ramifications is important. I am reminded of Tenn. Williams famous line about magic as quoted in these few lines from his play Streetcar Named Desire. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr1uonv3ZOI I often wonder if Mr. Williams would have agreed with your definition.<br><br>As you proceed with your posts over the next year or so I will be interested to see how your various scenarios of decline agree with another of my favorite bloggers who is no longer active, Jay Hansen. In summary here is a synopsis of the behavioral loop he describes:<br><br>Step 1. Individual and group behaviors are biased by the MPP to generate maximum power, which requires over-reproduction and/or over-consumption of natural resources (overshoot), whenever systemic constraints allow it. Individuals and families will form social groups to generate more power by degrading more energy. Differential power generation and accumulation result in a hierarchical group structure.<br>Step 2. Energy is always limited, so overshoot eventually leads to decreasing power available to the group, with lower-ranking members suffering first.<br>Step 3. Diminishing power availability creates divisive subgroups within the original group. Low-rank members will form subgroups and coalitions to demand a greater share of power from higher-ranking individuals, who will resist by forming their own coalitions to maintain power.<br>Step 4. Violent social strife eventually occurs among subgroups who demand a greater share of the remaining power.<br>Step 5. The weakest subgroups (high or low rank) are either forced to disperse to a new territory, are killed, enslaved, or imprisoned.<br>Step <br>6. Go back to step 1.<br><br><br>Regards to all the the outstanding commenters.<br><br>cheers,<br><br><a href=#c2586580487438310965 title="comment permalink">7/10/14, 1:04 PM</a><br><br>

One of the common criticisms of the the Kubler-Ross stages as a therapeutic model is it suggests and orderly progression through the stages and the implicit suggestion that the therapist should push the patient through the stages. Working from those assumptions quite frequently backfires.<br><br>I wonder if a lot of the criticism you rightly anticipate just comes from people wanting to think about proactive steps they can take more than dwelling on the negative. The way I think of it is that it's like coming to terms with your own mortality, which is basically what we're talking about on a grand scale. Accepting that you will one day die and there's nothing you can do to prevent that is a very healthy thing which ideally everyone should do. It leads you to make better decisions and make the most of the time you have. On the other hand, doing something like researching the progression of microbes and insects that will one day consume your decomposing corpse, making a lurid poster of said organisms at work, and hanging it in your bedroom is basically just macabre and is neither a particularly healthy or productive means towards the end goal of coming to terms with your mortality. It's coming to grips with reality in a certain narrow way, but at the same time it doesn't particularly help that much as far as making positive and productive changes. It's more just dwelling on the distasteful aspects that actually won't meaningfully impact you and that you have no real power over anyway. This latest post kinda reminds of that to be honest.<br><br><a href=#c6833172317489909785 title="comment permalink">7/10/14, 2:50 PM</a><br><br>

But the Archdruid’s observation about the similarity of declining civilizations and dark ages to one another also reminded me of a haunting passage from “Spengler’s Future” by the American historian and philosopher John J Reilly, who passed away at the age of 58 in 2012. The following is from the introduction to Part III: Decline and Fall.<br><br>“This is the time after the [civilization has passed its high point], a period when most civilizations begin to seem more and more alike in their decay. Certainly they suffer from uncannily similar misfortunes. Every characteristic task which a civilization might have hoped to achieve was accomplished in previous epochs. In this period, every great civilized society, no matter its pretensions or its hopes, its goodwill or its actual accomplishments, must "join the majority." No matter the level of technology theoretically available, there has always been an appalling consistency to the lives of ordinary people in every settled society. This study of the fate of civilizations is about nothing more than an interruption in this common level of human existence, the passing season of fantasy and hubris which constitute civilization.<br><br>None of this lasts. Nothing has changed. The universe is holographic; every point of space subsumes every other point. Past, present and future are always accessible. Heaven and Hell are coincident. How could anything ever be different?” <br><br>Spengler’s Future and many of Reilly’s other works are available here: http://web.archive.org/web/20120728111001/http://www.johnreilly.info/<br><br><a href=#c36902784303010228 title="comment permalink">7/10/14, 3:44 PM</a><br><br>

Of course those two things consolidate millions of chemical and physical components and the biomass and metabolism of millions of species of organisms. But still in the big picture you need to think about enhancing both. Green manure builds up storage; so does imported manure. Ruminants increase the internal flows of nutrients, speeding up the cycling between biomass/mineral/biomass. But they don't build up storage. Turn the ruminants loose in a sandbox, and you get starved cows laying on top of sand. Unless you feed them from outside sources, in which case you are really just using them as manure spreaders. Which if you have a source of external feed, works just fine. Tilling increases flows, which is why it both stimulates plant growth (short term) and depletes fertility (long term). <br><br>There's 20 gazillion details involved here, but the basics are that you need to have nutrients/organic matter coming in from somewhere (in the case of green manure, somewhere = the atmosphere), and you need to have nutrients released from biomass back into circulation. This can be done by microbes or by elephants. And you need to not have nutrients leaving more slowly than they are coming in. Any system you think of should be examined from this framework. <br><br>In this context, the fragility of conventional agriculture is because there are very limited internal storages, and all the flows are imported via a petroleum-derived macroeconomy. So cut off the inputs, and you rapidly run down to nothing.<br><br><a href=#c6827353568798162352 title="comment permalink">7/10/14, 7:59 PM</a><br><br>

Like everyone else they depleted their resource base (soil fertility) with growing population and intensive maize agriculture. Second, they built out of wood, in a climate where wood does not persist for centuries the way stone does to leaving things for Victorian archaeologists to study.

For a professional programmer, it's nothing too bad or onerous, but put yourself in the shoes of a 10 year old kid who doesn't really think that abstractly. Who's just playing around.<br><br>For example let's say we want to write directly to the screen in Windows, I mean as direct as you used to could do with the earlier and more primitive machines (like say, the Commodore 64). You need to know not only the DirectX API, you need to know about COM too. COM. Something that was written by, for and of the CompSci PhD crowd. Something that even a good chunk of the professional programming community says is too complex for them to understand properly. And you're going to ask a 10 year old kid, to understand COM first before he can even begin to scribble on the screen the way you used to back in the good old days?<br><br>And on the MacOS side of things, it's not much better. In some ways it's worse - you have new APIs, you have old APIs, the old DirectDraw API got replaced by Quartz I think? Or was it the other way around? My MacOS memory is not as good, even there, the Apple II was much much much simpler for a kid to get a hold on, that anything today.<br><br>It's like all those old dirt roads that people like you and me learned how to drive on, they're all replaced with high speed pavement with traffic signals and higher speeds - and no room for a kid to play anywhere without blowing things up.<br><br>And it shows when you see them interact with modern computers, all the working parts are covered up now, they have no real understanding of what's going on anymore.<br><br>Only remaining route left are things like the Arduino, where for the most part everything is exposed and there no overly burdensome abstractions to thwart a child. Even there though, the main loop is hidden from you, you get called instead, so if you want to do anything even remotely interesting you'll have to know how to create your own state machine to remember what happened between calls.

As I remember, Rome reached peak imperial tribute in 117 then started to fall into decline about a decade or so later with the invasion and loss of Scotland. The last emperor of Rome was deposed and replaced with a feudal king sometime in the 470s and that event officially marks the end of the Western Roman Empire (though Classical civilization went under around the turn of the 5th century when the empire was split in two and most aspects of Roman culture and religion outlawed in the wake of the Gothic Wars. Either way that's almost 300 years of civil wars, plagues, invasions, assassinations and economic upheavals between the onset of decline and the beginning of the dark ages.<br><br>The Babylonians took between 150 and 300 years from peak to collapse too depending on dating system, the Mayans took a little under 300 years... And the Egyptians a little over 150 once they got an empire going.

Well done, it sounds like the land is under good stewardship.

Even cardboard has useful quantities of boron in it!<br><br>&gt;What do you think about intensively managed ruminant herds?<br><br>I read in a book by Peter Andrews on the topic of land restoration Down Under in that he met an old time farmer who gave him this bit of advice: "Keep 10 sheep when you can feed 10 sheep". That tends to reflect my thinking as well. It is not hard and fast though because you can build soil fertility as described above through the simple act of importing feed - from somewhere else. If you look at Joel Salatin's systems (really nice bloke too) that is how they build soil fertility. They also practice consistently moving herds around – all of the time. The native wildlife does this function themselves here and I don't have to think about it very much at all. Perhaps once a year I have to drop the herbage – well before the bushfire season.<br><br>Mind you, I bring in feed for the chickens too, but am slowly working towards obtaining, trialling and growing replacement feed. Every day I collect greens and herbs for them and am getting a feel for what they like and what can grow easily and reliably here. Plus I have to understand how to reproduce those plants. Plus the chickens free range too for a time each day – even today in the rain.<br><br>Intensive practices are at the heart of some of the problems in modern agriculture, but it doesn't necessarily have to be that way.<br><br>What do you reckon about those types of systems?<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c530361154132761195 title="comment permalink">7/11/14, 1:45 AM</a><br><br>

What inspires them is not the hope of a final separation from the realities of nature, life, history and time, but a conscious and delighted participation in these realities—not the promise of salvation, but the reality of homecoming.”<br><br>By placing our lives within the broader context of the life and death of a civilization, and that civilization itself within the broader context of the life and death of human kind, the life and death of this planet, and ultimately the rotational cycles of the cosmos and the eternal principals that move it. What you see as macabre, others see as the very meaning and beauty of life, which is the enduring power of nature itself and the fact that humans have the privilege to be a part of that dance… and to actively participate… telling its stories and singing its songs. Looking back at the final poem about the ruin in this week’s essay, I’m reminded of this quote:<br><br>“What is a ruin, after all? It is a human construction abandoned to nature, and one of the allures of ruins in the city is that of wilderness: a place full of the promise of the unknown with all its epiphanies and dangers. Cities are built by men (and to a lesser extent, women), but they decay by nature, from earthquakes and hurricanes to the incremental processes of rot, erosion, rust, the microbial breakdown of concrete, stone, wood, and brick, the return of plants and animals making their own complex order that further dismantles the simple order of men. […] A city is built to resemble a conscious mind, a network that can calculate, administrate, manufacture. Ruins become the unconscious of a city, its memory, unknown, darkness, lost lands, and in this truly bring it to life. With ruins a city springs free of its plans into something as intricate as life, something that can be explored but perhaps not mapped. This is the same transmutation spoken of in fairy tales when statues and toys and animals becomes human, though they come to life and with ruin a city comes to death, but a generative death like a corpse that feeds flowers.”<br>-Rebecca Solnit<br><br><a href=#c5558120154560070980 title="comment permalink">7/11/14, 6:13 AM</a><br><br>

They only increase the rates of nutrient cycling. And harvests of animal products represent a flow of nutrients out of the system that has to be replaced. This does not make animals bad, it is just something you need to take in to account. The same (net nutrient flow out) is true of potatoes and anythine else you harvest. Even beans, which provide their own nitrogen, take other mineral nutrients away from the system when you harvest them. <br><br>In general on soil restoration-- a decade or two of fallow can also be good for soil reclamation, even if the fallow is entirely unmanaged (just let the weeds take over). Whichever nutrients are in short supply, whatever plants are best at retrieving/fixing/accumulating those nutrients will have a competitive advantage. Plus there's indirect evidence that free-living nitrogen fixing microbes (cyanobacteria) also get to work in barren and fallow soils pretty much as soon as the sun rises and provide a significant amount of long-term nitrogen accumulation. We have some old cropped soils low in fertility and organic matter; after 12 years of "neglect" (in the eyes of my neighbors) the wild blackberries have gotten fatter and the plant cover thicker, indicating that the nutrient cycles are getting well-established again without my having to lift a finger. <br><br>The acreage of depleted cropland that will become unproductive as industrial petroleum-based farming becomes less viable will be vast. I expect most of it will just have to be left to its own devices, covered with mile after mile of invasive weeds. We spent a century depleting the natural fertility of these lands with massive diesel-powered machines. We won't be able to actively heal it all with just our muscles and hand tools. We'll just have to work on the smaller intensive plots, while natural processes gradually grow something resembling soil again on what are now sterile, infertile culture media that provide little more than physical support for plants that are fed petroleum.<br><br><a href=#c4986581649233255672 title="comment permalink">7/11/14, 7:00 AM</a><br><br>

Reading your essays, the commentary discussions that follow, and as much of the recommended ancillary material that I have time for, it occurs to me that there are two linked features that are prime aspects of both civilizations and dark ages, viz., communication and zeitgeist.<br>I do not know if communication is a pre or co-requisite, but all civilizations and empires, have open and relatively safe lines of communication from end to end. Under the Mongols, the silk roads opened up so one could travel from Damascus to Beijing in safety. Under Claudius, you could travel from Britain to the Levant; within North America, from Florida to Anchorage, we can cross the continent assured of complete safety (parts of Detroit and Chicago notwithstanding).<br>At the same time, the zeitgeist of the civilization exudes a sense of confident trust. I don’t know if that is a pre or co-requisite of open communication, but it is certainly synergistic: no traveller fears the inhabitants will seize them; inhabitants do not fear the passing travellers, come to trade, and not plunder. There is a bold courage and a confident sense that wars are disruptions to the ordinary flow of peaceful trade.<br>In contrast, dark ages, as you point out, are a time of fragmentation and I would say the zeitgeist is defined by fear. Communication is almost nonexistent, insular communities fear the arrival of strangers and it is dangerous for anyone to travel. Trade is almost impossible across multiple political entities, each taking a portion of goods as a toll; populations crash because a single raiding party can wipe out annual food supplies and leave a starving population chronically vulnerable to disease. Small wars are constant; quiet peaceful prosperity elusive. <br>Again, I do not know if these are co or pre-requisites, but if the current political and religious gridlock and increasingly divisive tensions breaking into more violent clashes across the globe are any indication, civilizations cease to exist when fear replaces confidence, when communication and the exchange of ideas stops and when the hoary image of small groups of frightened peasants, huddling in their farm awaiting the next raid from a passing war-band become the norm. The war-bands form from people afraid of their neighbours, the people are afraid of raiding war-bands. Frightened people do not share ideas on the best way to coax more grain from the soil, or how to maintain fertility.<br>I envision a great wheel, one that takes centuries to turn, from insular fear to open confidence and back again. During the confident time, there is an expectation that things will become easier, more comfortable for the next generation. During the fearful time, the expectation is that someone else will take all these comforts away so hoarding and defensiveness become endemic.<br><br><a href=#c4369256837700845833 title="comment permalink">7/11/14, 7:46 AM</a><br><br>

Most of these are large and deep rooted crops which bring up nutrients from subsoil. I am wondering what place crops like fodder radish might have in a good rotation, for example, fodder crop, to be fed to chickens or large livestock and composted and some eaten by the farmer, followed by a legume, followed by a greedy feeder, such as cauliflower or tomatoes.<br><br>I don't think there was any such thing as a "Biblical Civilization", unless one means the Canaanites who built cities in what are now Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine. The civilization around Susa and the recently excavated city being called Arratta is still little known. It was frequently invaded and controlled by Summerian and Babylonian kings. Persia, after the conquest by Medes and Persians, never succumbed to invasion until the coming of the Moslems in about the 8thC AD, and even after that, retained many of its' traditional folkways and institutions. One of the more surprising things one learns reading about ancient Egypt is that human settlement there was much more recent than in Syria and Anatolia, for example. some of the continuously occupied Syrian cities, such as Aleppo and Damascus were already millennia old when settlers began trickling into the Nile Valley around, if memory serves, 5500 to 4000 BC.<br><br><a href=#c6867939684419400616 title="comment permalink">7/11/14, 8:10 AM</a><br><br>

The moundbuilders were probably in their last days by the time Soto arrived there.<br><br>In Amazonia there was also a culture of complex pottery and composting pits (the Amazonian soil is incredibly poor, one must mix slash-and-burn with compost to be able to farm there) that by the time the jesuits explored had alredy collapsed and dissapeared.<br><br>I belive the changing climate since the late middle ages combined with excessive growth killed these early civilizations like it did the Pueblo, may have forced the turks out of Altay in Asia and may have something to with the agricultural collapse in Egypt during the Fatimids.<br><br>And the current climate change will have similar effects: civilizational collapse in some places, nomad hordes in others.

You never see the deluge coming. The Goths sacking Rome? Hah, that'll be the day! <br><br>The place that my family came from was a society where people stayed put in the valleys of their birth. Nothing much changed over the generations except that once in a while one brutal regime would be replaced by another. <br><br>People lived in stone farmhouses that had been there since the beginning of time or so it seemed. And worked soil that had been farmed for the last 6,000 years. They went to churches that were built on the site of pagan temples that had been built on top of neolithic shrines that stood on the holy places of the earliest hunters. <br><br>And then the deluge, that is, the 20th century and war and revolution. The ancestral valleys were de-populated, the farmhouses left to ruin. The old country is now educated and urbanized, the age-old peasant dialects forgotten or taught as heritage languages. <br><br>Our families in the New World are racial and ethnic composites. All of us speak English. None of us are farmers and nearly all of us (including those still living in the old country) are university educated professionals. All in the space of one generation. <br><br>So it doesn't surprise me that hardly a scrap of Roman music survives. Or that the loss of knowledge can be total. I think that often-times when people pitch the old ways they do it in a hurry, necessity dictating the pace of change. When Rome was ascendent, how long did it take for Latin to take root in Gaul - on both sides of the Alps? Not long I'll bet.<br><br><a href=#c5090123697070534963 title="comment permalink">7/11/14, 11:04 AM</a><br><br>

In all honesty I feel like Spengler helped free my soul a little, provided a light to see deeper into prepossessions and also elucidate the larger historical trends that are likely irregardless of my stake in a particular outcome.<br><br>I can see now why you are watching the fracking bubble so closely; according to Spengler the Age of Caesars begins after both democracy is killed by money and then money itself implodes. If our monetary system implodes that would likely opens the door to a return to what Spengler call the "formlesness" of history. How, as you opened this essay with, civilizations in decline become increasingly similar as they approach dark age.<br><br>Recently, I've been thinking about the fragmentation of culture along class-lines in terms of black holes. As an object moves towards a black hole the accelaration acts on the two ends of said object unevenly - the side closest to the black hole is moving much faster than the side furthest away. This leads to the object being torn in two. As the gravity and acceleration increase this process repeats until, theoretically, the atoms themselves are torn to shreds, the object rendered formless.<br><br>Working at an upscale organic farm I see this process in slow motion - our costumers for the most part are way more privledged than the people who work here. No one who works here could afford to buy the food we sell, instead we eat what the costumers pick over. Within the farm there are the downwardly mobile children of the middle class and devoutly religious recent immigrants and a constant murmuring of class-tension between the two groups.<br><br>As the gravity of the dark ages starts to tear apart the fabric of society I imagine an enormous amount of factionalization in the years ahead, mediated more and more frequently with violence, until of course, the social differntiation that characterized our Civilization is rendered formless,and there is a return to the "rule of blood," peasants and nobility.<br><br><a href=#c3654506044616659505 title="comment permalink">7/11/14, 11:47 AM</a><br><br>

You didn't even have to use assembler if you didn't want to, all you had to do was PEEK and POKE to various memory locations and you could see what you did and what it produced.

And only then can you start PEEKing and POKEing, except you have to do it C++, you can't just sit there at an interpreter prompt and do it anymore.

Religious and fraternal<br>organizations large and small confer specialized titles on their leadership. The title doesn't necessarily have the same basis or import in every organization that has ever used it. <br><br>E. g. in some denominations of Wicca the unpaid leader of a close-knit group of about a dozen people has the formal title of Lady or High Priestess. Lady in this context is not a claim of hereditary privilege, and High Priestess does not imply a grand temple full of acolytes in the neighborhood. Either title does usually indicate that the holder studied and worked for some years, has personal qualifications for the position, and has the respect of her colleagues. Within traditional Wicca these points are perfectly understood; not necessarily so outside them.<br><br><a href=#c9175775803607754899 title="comment permalink">7/11/14, 1:53 PM</a><br><br>

Thus, Mark Luterra writes:<br><br>"No previous civilizations have had an equivalent of the Internet, allowing for immediate communication across borders." <br><br>However, Graham Robb recently reminded us of Julius Caesar's observations that the Gauls whom he conquered could do just that by use of the human voice and carefully chosen high places. One reviewer of Robb's book summarizes how Robb figured out how this might well have worked:<br><br>"One example will suffice. Certain references in Caesar’s writing indicate that the Gauls operated a vocal telegraph, composed of strategically placed teams yodelling news overland to one another, which passed messages at a speed nearly equivalent to the first Chappe telegraph in the 18th century. To judge how this might have worked, Robb takes himself off to the oppidum above Aumance, near Clermont-Ferrand, where he reports on the car alarms and the whirr of traffic still audible across countryside four kilometres away.<br><br>He goes further. Aumance was one of around 75 places once known by the name Equoranda, a word with an unknown root that resembles the Greek and Gaulish for 'sound-line' or 'call-line'. All the Equoranda settlements Robb visits turn out to be on low ridges or shallow valleys, and would, he writes, 'have made excellent listening posts'. Examined in this light, one word in Caesar’s account becomes fruitful: he observes that the Gauls 'transmit the news by shouting across fields and regios', a word that can be translated as 'boundaries'. An ancient Persian technique for acoustic surveying, still current in the 19th-century south of France, involves three men calling to one another and plotting their position along the direction of the sound. Put the pieces together and you end up – or Robb does – with 'the scattered remains of a magnificent network' that could have acted not just as a telegraph system but as a means to map the Druids’ boundaries on to the earth.<br><br>It’s a magnificent piece of historical conjecture, backed by a quizzical scholarly intellect and given a personal twist by experiment."<br><br>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/10372050/The-Ancient-Paths-Discovering-the-Lost-Map-of-Celtic-Europe-review.html]<br><br>Nor is this the only such system of long distance communication known.

Rubbing my hands in anticipation actually. By the way lately I have the feeling I am "converting" people I run into like crazy - if they aren't converts already... <br>By the way this movie works quite nicely for many of my audience: http://www.incubatepictures.com/notomorrow/tnt.shtml - best if it just pops up on youtube and they don't have time to read the title :). You are in the refs. Oh, and guess what kind of comments get a lot of likes in the English version? The author calls it "whataboutery". <br>If my "converts" actually start doing something as a direct consequence of this is another matter though I am afraid. I think mostly they start not doing certain things - which may be just as good. The ones that aren't freaked out too much are generally pointed here for some more in depth commentary. <br><br>@Renaissance: Very nicely put. I tried to get this point across in earlier comments, but your way is a pretty simple and effective check. Maybe it could be turned into a song?<br><br>@Bill Blondeau here's someone thinking very much along your lines: http://bollier.org/blog/bauwens-invites-pope-francis-help-maker-economy<br>Also, the historical context that Bauwens gives to this dovetails extremely well with what hase been discussed in the last few threads here. Traveling maker-sisters, role of religion in conservation of knowledge, modern monasteries, mutualisation, and all of it in pretty actionable format. <br>I've been a bit of a maker for some time now and my perception is that a push for "for benefit (not profit) non-authoritarian commons" makes a lot of sense, especially now. I'd hope there'd be a few less shiny robots and a few more upcycled Growerbots and basic items being worked on, but you take what you get. I see much of the real value in making people collaborate and think for themselves. <br><br>@Cherokee (carry over from last week): I hadn't heard of the Toyota War, but I am not too sure I get your point. My tentative answer is this: Toyota War should really be named Toyota Campaign. It was heavily supported by the French - also without that MILAN system your average encounter with tanks sitting in a desert is a lot less fun for your side. Even if you have a bunch of light vehicles with, say RPG-7s. The other point is history has in more than one instance that demonstrates the Sahara desert is well suited for mechanized maneuver warfare - especially if you know the area, and the concept of Schwerpunkt. Morale is another factor not to be underestimated (especially in African conflicts). <br>My original point was pertaining more to wars of attrition, and limitations of maneuver warfare in a modern context (e.g. Lebanon 2006), and re-use of UXO. I could imagine this for the "dark ages" with contested energy dense regions/high carrying cap regions, transportation choke-points, all this playing out with highly asymmetric technology.<br><br><a href=#c601994742587158153 title="comment permalink">7/11/14, 3:07 PM</a><br><br>

What makes us think we need an specialist for everything?<br><br>My own training is unfortunately incomplete, due mostly to the typical father-son divide that arises during adolescence. However, there are many tasks that I could handle given the motivation and tooling. I know for a fact there are engineers at this building in the same situation, or even they have overcome the same challenges and are much more competent than myself.<br><br>I wonder if there's the interest to rise to the challenge. Some sort of hacker space, but focused in doing home repair stuff instead of computer stuff.

There were two younger folks that would fit quite well in the "hacker generation" label as described here. Those expressed awareness and a sense of discomfort from lacking what once was considered basic manly skills. There was also a not so young guy, inquiring in the possibility of borrowing tools and exchanging tips now and then.

All three got discouraged as soon as I let them know the number of responses to the original message.<br><br>My take is that while this demographic has their hearts in the right place, their perception of the world is for the most part still fixated in the Myth of Progress. Since their day to day revolves around an industry that is for the most part still growing and still sharing a part of the bounty with the hands-on-deck, so to speak, most don't see as a productive use of their time to learn who to fix real stuff with your own hands.<br><br>The challenge now is how to engage the few that might be interested.<br><br><a href=#c5813003581285708877 title="comment permalink">7/11/14, 11:21 PM</a><br><br>

Now factor in the very high likelihood that the grid won't go down in any easily recognizable way -- rather, service to some areas will become unreliable, or get shut off completely, while others remain supplied with power. Over time, the areas supplied with power by the main will get smaller, while secondary local grids spring up in areas that have energy resources that can support them. Two centuries from now there may still be some places in the US that have electricity coming out of wall sockets. How does that affect your metric? <br><br>Renaissance, thank you. <br><br>Jcummings, you're misstating my viewpoint -- and of course that's common enough, since it cuts straight across so many of the habitual thought patterns of our age. I'd encourage you to notice how often, when people start saying "But it's different this time," that's immediately followed by an attempt to drag the conversation back to the familiar ground of progress vs. apocalypse: "it's different this time, and therefore we're still on our way to the stars" or "it's different this time, and therefore everything's going to crash to ruin all at once." <br><br>Those points of view are already being discussed almost everywhere. I suggest it's worth considering another possibility -- that it's no different this time -- and I'd point out that so far, predictions based on the suggestion that it's no different this time have been one heck of a lot more accurate than those that stayed comfortably settled in the mythic territory of progress and apocalypse. I'd also point out that, as I noted in <a href=../../2014/03/american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html rel=nofollow>an earlier post</a>, it's a lot easier to avoid confirmation bias if you start with the assumption that you can test your predictions against the past, and then try to adjust for novel conditions, than if you start from the assumption that it's different this time and the past has nothing to teach you. <br><br>That said, by all means fill in those supposed blanks as you wish. I'd just like to encourage you to think about whether you're filling in said blanks with something more useful than warmed-over religious mythologies in secular drag. <br><br>Raymond, they're not hungry enough yet.

Organic farming is viewed more as a boutique item then an answer to the problem of hunger.<br><br>One of the primary reasons the farm I work at is so expensive is the huge efforts put into quality control. Sure, a half pint of strawberries is $6.50 but only about 25% of ripe strawberries are perfect enough to find their way into the half pint container. <br><br>My estimate is that 70% of the produce here is wasted. 25% is sold and 5% is eaten by the workers. That other 70% finds its way to the gargantuan compost piles.<br><br>This is one business strategy, and it seems adaptive now. The farm grosses huge amounts of income, is able to maintain an impressive collection of infrastructure and employs scores of workers. <br><br>An interesting point is I've heard from a coworker is that some organic farms in the area have attempted, and failed, to make ends meet growing dry beans. There isn't a market yet for bulk staples.<br><br>Of course, as you point out in your essay Rueben, eventually the bubble of globalisation will pop. When there aren't lentils from India and quinoa from the Andes there will be a market for dry bulk items, which I imagine will be the cash crop of most farms. A little bit later shipping costs will become prohibitively expensive and there will be a local market for bulk.<br><br>I imagine, too, that a pound of locally grown pinto beans will be much more expensive than lentils from the other side of the world since they won't be coming to us via the iniquities of imperialism. Still, people will buy them if they have money to spend and any alternative is magnitudes more expensive.<br><br>My guess is that when economic conditions change the business practices of organic farmers will change accordingly. Some of that will probably be identical to your stance, Bill, of simply growing for yourself. Others will probably grow bulk, and there will probably even continue to be CSAs and and farmers markets in urban areas for years to come selling $6.50 half pints of strawberries to the well-to-do.<br><br><a href=#c25515775920514730 title="comment permalink">7/12/14, 4:46 AM</a><br><br>

We know it is doomed to fail but is leaving us with a terrible legacy of contaminated land &amp; water. We can live without fossil fuels, though the disruption caused across the world by the loss of these as an energy source is going to be massive, but we can't live without water.<br><br>This is why here in the UK many of us are actively resisting the roll-out of fracking and other unconventional gas &amp; oil extraction techniques, we are a small, densely populated country, we can't afford the impact on our land and water to have 1000's of wells spread across the 60% of the country which the government is opening up to fracking.<br><br>We hope we can delay and slow down the roll-out of fracking in the UK long enough for the bubble to burst and the industry to be stopped by lack of investment. We are working on a physical and magical level to protect our land from fracking, as part of an international network that is succeeding in protecting many places from this toxic industry in the USA, Australia and elsewhere.<br><br>But there are many whose land and water has already been contaminated, so some of the knowledge we need for the future will be about how we deal with this.<br><br><a href=#c7594314724880940999 title="comment permalink">7/12/14, 5:02 AM</a><br><br>

When I go to these places, be they local farms or local artists, usually I see trucks, grid power, air-conditioned houses, etc. And if you are going to value your time at $10/hr or even $2/hr to try to support this way of life, your prices are going to be too high for the middle and lower thirds of American households' incomes.<br><br>Ruben and Violet -- if you are not already familiar with him, you might be interested in Jeff Poppen a.k.. the Barefoot Farmer and his philosophies of farming and living. I discuss this some in my own blog here:<br><br>http://bbill.blogspot.com/2011/06/powering-happy-hippies.html<br><br>That post includes links to some of his stuff directly. Basically, he thinks the commoditization of agriculture is absolutely wrong, farm produce should not be sold, it should be distributed free to the community. He is a proud and unrepentant old-school hippie. He has quite radical views of agriculture and society, which I find very interesting. And they may well be a reasonably good economic model for a workable "dark age" community in future centuries. <br><br>As an aside, I became aware of him when I moved here in 2002 and strangers on the street kept asking me if I was him. He had done some shows for local public TV hence his face was known. When I eventually went to his place for one of his festivals I figured that would be the one place I would not be mistaken for him... wrong!

Thanks for that. <br><br>I've had the same concerns, since increasingly we rely for income by selling various herbal products mostly to relatively well to do customers at Farmer's Markets. People that my dear father referred to as having more money than sense. Perhaps a little unfair, but it gets to your point about localism and expensive artisan products, funded by globalism.<br><br>Firstly, is it cynical to make money this way? I don't think so. It's just an exchange of value - I'll sell a fancy herbal tea and be paid for it with industrial wealth. I don't worry about it too much, but others might have deeper ethical concerns I suppose.<br><br>Secondly, this is just a transitional thing, right? As we do down the road aways, we'll all be living a lot smaller and scratching a living. Localism will be a default, imposed on us by reality, not a choice. So I see the current market for local/artisan products as a great opportunity to learn something new and helpful for the future, and to be kindly paid for by the froth of the current system. That's also OK to me, as long as I'm learning something that could continue to be useful in a more resource constrained future. So, growing/selling food and herbs is probably a good thing; becoming a local pedicurist, may be not so. Although who really knows? The economic viability of one's chosen set of skills is going to have to be worked out in the future, once we get there I guess.<br><br><a href=#c2673614429729249892 title="comment permalink">7/12/14, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

I'm happy it's here! I expect it to be fascinating, and a nice compliment to my current reading of <em>Star's Reach</em>.<br><br>I wanted to make a quick point about the internet, information technologies, and "It's different this time."<br><br>The internet really isn't that big of a deal. It's just a medium for transferring information--every once in awhile of the non-porn, non-celebrity gossip variety.<br><br>It's a convenient medium if you have access to it, granted, and it's fiddled about the edges of how we transmit information, but it's just a tool.<br><br>I think people conflate the information available on the internet with the internet, but that's inaccurate. The internet is just a vehicle for that information. It's nothing in and of itself. And disembodied information, to be honest, can be quite limited in its usefulness. Anyone who gardens or, say, makes yogurt should be able to attest to that. Disembodied information is a template from which to create experience. Experience is where the real knowledge lies. That's one of the differences between information and knowledge.<br><br>The internet's value is in the information itself and the internet did not create that information. It simply is one more method for us to express and transmit it to others.<br><br>Whenever we talk about some good aspect of the internet, we're actually talking about other human beings and other cultures. We're talking about the knowledge, communication, and cultural artifacts that come from other human beings, <em>not the technological devices that bring it to us</em>.<br><br>The internet's just a medium. It's nifty in certain ways, but that's about it.<br><br>I'm all of 33 years old and I remember well the world without the internet. It was a bit different, but mostly the same. The family garden that I helped water and harvest as a kid grew pretty much the same as my garden does now. The phone conversations I had sitting in the kitchen on our corded telephone were much the same as the conversations I have now--except I could hear my co-conversationalist a heck of a lot better on the old corded telephone. (I'm back to that now at my new place. Long live landlines.)<br><br>When the internet goes, the knowledge and information and cultural artifacts it currently carries will continue to exist. They won't go with the internet unless we decide to allow them to. We're talking, after all, about human knowledge and human artifacts. If we're willing to continue to transmit them, they'll survive.<br><br>The internet is both nifty and awful. But it's not all that important.<br><br><a href=#c836153967371099001 title="comment permalink">7/12/14, 10:07 AM</a><br><br>

In other words scarcity of food, and the right types of food, has a population-decreasing effect beyond the single individual subjected to it.

It reminds me of the writings of Charles Eisenstein, whose ideas on the gift economy Poppen seems to be putting into practice. What's more, the apparent success of his farm suggests that it could work out for a wider range of goods and services, including my own. As an artist I'm only too acutely aware that the moment you try to commodify art, charging enough money for it to support even a very modest living by current standards - well, it just dies on the vine. Whereas in a community like Poppen's, perhaps I could afford to offer my work as a service, like a musician performing for the pleasure of all. <br><br>I also like very much that Poppen is a proud unrepentant old-school hippie.

When De Soto went through the south I have absolutely NO DOUBT that they carried Swine Flu with them. The culture of the mound builders might have been in decline but likely wouldn't have been vastly affected by De Soto's passage in anyway until the flu struck the tribes. That was an old story time after time for American tribes. It was a virgin field epidemic washing in tides across the continent. In fact the builders of the ruler straight canals (of I think it is in the Pantanal in Brazil? Not sure!), were a huge tribe supporting a city of hundreds of thousands. They NEVER saw a European face and became extinct, unknown to the European colonizers.<br><br>As someone with obvious <br>American Indian background, (I'm not a pure blood), I have disputed the myth about how much land was 'unexplored' or unused by indigenous people. I feel confident that much more of it was utilized in ways Europeans were ill equipped to recognize.<br><br>In the "This Time It's Different" game I can think of a single event that really would create a fast collapse world wide and that would be a Carrington Event. It would definitely grease the skids and be catastrophic for the USA as well as most other highly developed countries. Obviously not so much for 'third world' countries.

One of the movies that illustrates how the plains tribes viewed the migratory herds was Dances With Wolves. They would send out scouts looking for the herds to reappear. The herds didn't have fixed routes they followed. They did follow the grass. I agree with you that close confinement is the destruction of the soil and basically a plague on the health of the animals confined. All grazing animals do better when they have a larger expanse to graze.<br><br>As far as how dangerous buffalo/bison can be I can give you two examples, the first from the completion of the railroads. A migratory herd crossed the railroad tracks in their thousands and some engineer in his arrogance blew the whistle of his gen-u-wine steam engine to get the herd to move faster. A bull felt himself insulted and assaulted the engine which in that era weren't what they are today. The bull de-railed the engine. He broke his neck in the process but he was powerful enough to de-rail a steam engine. A more modern example of short tempered buffalo occurred in Yellowstone Park about ten or twenty years back when a German tourist decided he'd pet himself a buffalo. BAD IDEA! He didn't survive the experience being tossed more than twelve feet into the air. Buffalo can be domestically raised but at heart are still wild animals, something to keep in mind when around them.<br><br>Frankly I would love to see elephants turned loose in the south to run wild but I don't expect to ever see it happen. Not in this lifetime anyway.<br><br>Those animals imported to Australia with padded feet like lamas, alpacas, vicunas, in fact all cameloids originated on the American continent, along with the horse. The continent has gone through extremely dry conditions geologically speaking.<br><br>Wadulisi<br><br><a href=#c6815550546259079799 title="comment permalink">7/12/14, 8:22 PM</a><br><br>

That's roughly the sense I had, as indicated by my comments about the collapse of public health measures as a necessary factor in population declines. Still, this is an issue that I was planning on researching anyway for this series of posts.<br><br>Lens, as I see it, we're past the point at which world government would have been an option. Not all civilizations, pace Toynbee, end in a Universal State. As the availability of cheap concentrated energy declines, disintegration and relocalization are the core themes to watch for. (I've read Wagar's book, btw, and was massively unimpressed.)<br><br>Anne, no argument there, except that the UN is overly optimistic. We're not going to feed seven billion people with organic methods, or any other methods, for more than a short time -- that's one of the reasons why depopulation will be a major feature of the centuries immediately ahead of us. That said, once fossil fuels and other agrichemical feedstocks run short, organic methods are the only option left, and preserving the techniques is a crucial issue at this stage of the game.<br><br>Rapier, nah, you're neglecting all the other aspects of maintaining and exerting power. If you've got a modest amount of electricity, for example, but no access to raw materials needed to build and maintain core modern technologies, the electricity's a useful advantage but not a game-changer. In making sense of the future, it's important to remember that "technology" isn't a single thing; you can have one part of it -- say, a working electric grid over a town-sized area -- but lack many other parts of it, and the resulting technological bricolage is going to have possibilities and vulnerabilities that differ sharply from those of today's technological suite. More on this as we proceed.<br><br>Alan, I'm fond of Thomas Friedman's comment that what we're facing isn't global warming but global weirding. On pure thermodynamic grounds, I'd expect increasing energy in the global climate system to produce more extreme divergences, not uniform warming. Next time you talk to Dr. Friday, though, could you see if he can recommend some sources along these lines that are accessible to the nonspecialist?<br><br>Bill, utterly unsurprising.

Five pounds of cucumbers are five pounds of cucumbers, regardless of the exchange rate of the $. That is an advantage in a coming financial collapse, and protects you against the ravages of the marketplace, such as hyperinflation. The goal should be to go from being a consumer to a producer, limiting your exposure to the marketplace, and getting away from the monetary market to other non-monetary methods of exchange. Americans are stereotyped as "thinking only in $'s", and I'm finding it is just as true in green, locavore, organic, permaculture, homesteading circles. I've been disappointed in my search locally to find many into permaculture/organics/homesteading that are focused on business/profit/market/commodification. It's like we're talking different languages. It's not so much even as a negative judgement on my part, so much as a disappointment that we're not "talking the same language" and have vastly different goals. Those who I've been gravitating towards and getting to know are those who, you might say, have more of a Green Wizardry bent, focused on shortening their supply chains, getting as much as they use/need away from the monetary market, and producing as much as they can themselves. I've been volunteering for a local community garden organization that focuses on low income food deserts in my city. It's a great educational opportunity for people. I think that it's a tragedy if low income people feel that their only option is cheap, processed, agribusiness food, and that eating organic, locally raised foods is too expensive for them. Personally, I know that I can't afford the expensive, organic, local products that are marketed to high end consumers. I hope that after a financial collapse or whatever is in store, the farms and growers that are now focused on marketing to high end consumers can retool as subsistence farmers based on local needs and means, but I have my doubts. I realize that old habits die hard, but it is interesting to observe the transition between the old, capitalist based way of doing things and the new ways to come.<br>@Wadulisi,<br>a Carrington event would be disastrous, and would accelerate the process of decline, since, at this point and time, many things would not be rebuilt, however, all everyone knows right now is based on modern technology, so after such an event, you can bet that the powers that be would put as much energy as they possibly could into restoring as much of the grid as possible.<br><br><a href=#c2208457793500657325 title="comment permalink">7/13/14, 2:04 PM</a><br><br>

The rebuttal suggested that the causality runs the other way, citing various examples (eg China) where population restraint was followed by prosperity. The idea being that a subsistence economy can never afford to invest in industrializing if every peasant has 10 kids, but they can afford it with 2 or 3 kids. Of course this also relies on the new-fangled medical disruption of the death rate so the peasants don't need 10 births to ensure 2.1 adult offspring. <br><br>But both directions of this relationship are plausible in the right conditions. Having children in an industrial society is much more expensive than for a peasant, so after industrialization, contraception and maybe some cultural shift, it makes sense to have less children. <br><br>The conditions of global industrial decline and energy scarcity are another matter, so I don't see why these population effects, observed over the last century, should be expected to continue serenely when resource availability has reversed. <br><br>In general, all critters from yeast to blue whales try to grab resources and convert them into their own species' biomass.

That combined with the declining natural growth the USA have since the 70s ( all the growth it had in pop was consequence of migrants ) will surely make way for both oportunistic calls for illegal emigration ( for the cheap labor ) and for a increased chance of a small event to cascade into a well armed group of either "natives" or migrants to go insurgent. Besides that, the current trend of abandoned houses ( that will go worse ) added to migrants ( people moving unchecked is a infectious disease nightmare scenario ) will surely bring old diseases back along with new ones . In the long run, it is sure that the USA will suffer a long depopulation, with all the consequences you can imagine ... and this is still in the time where I think there will be some kind of political centralized control. <br><br>It is even possible that the USA might survive for long ( give or take some centuries of civil wars in between ), but the next century or so will surely not be a good ride for the USA ... A decay fast enough to be noticeable in a lifetime, but slow enough for maintaning the isulsion of steady state or some localized growth.

Given what I know of European folklore ( especially the Portuguese one, that is surprisngly sparse on references to Romans for a Romance speaking country ... all the olden days stories involve "Lusitanians" ( catch all word in this context for the pre-Roman population ) or "Moors" , with barely no "Romans" or "Visigoths"/"Suebi" ), that feeling was not shared by the bulk of the ex-Roman population. <br><br>In other words, much of the nostalgia literature we see from time to time from those days regarding the romans is actually barely disguised envy about how they could not live a fictionalized "Roman good life" ( the wording of the poem makes me think that the author was viewing the Roman life like if came out of a typical rapper video ) or build anything in the scale the romans did by the part of someone that was from the ruler class, whhile the common person was not exactly eager to get back to the "good ol'days". Not that the envy of the old ones is not important in post collapse days: we could argue that most of the European history is driven by the inferiority complex the post roman european rulers felt of those gigantic roads and aqueducts they saw ... it might simply not be the prevalent view ;)<br><br><a href=#c1069777614375222992 title="comment permalink">7/13/14, 4:32 PM</a><br><br>

Over here in the UK I can see increasing alienation between the majority of the people and the political class. I don’t think that this has reached the same level as in the US, due to the fact that we still get beneficial services from our government like the National Health Service. But in my experience there is defiantly a growing disconnect between the promises of progress and the reality on the ground, which is even being noticed by people who think that peak oil is some kind of essential oil or something that you use in cooking.<br><br>There is of course one way that the political class may be able to save itself. That is by admitting the truth of the situation we are in and acting in accordance with that truth. The Political Classes did start to get it back in the 1970 (e.g. President Carter), but completely forgot about it when the neoliberals got into power in the 1980’s and the oil prices went down. Jared Diamond also cites examples from the past where societies have prevented collapse by changing course. Therefore such an outcome is possible. It may mean that the Political class will get poorer, but that may be better than the prospect of hanging from a lamp post. I remember we talked about the possibility that another crisis like the one in 2008 may wake the political classes up, when you were in London last month. (Hope you enjoyed your beer). It will be interesting to hear what you have to say about this possibility in upcoming posts.<br><br>Please note that I am well aware that we missed out on the chance of an easy transition 30 years ago, and that any attempt to deal with this crisis won’t stop us from getting a lot poorer than we are now. Our present industrial society is toast. I am also aware that an attempt by the political class to deal with the situation may be overwhelmed by a tidal wave of crisis. However the way that you navigate your way down the reverse slope of Hubberts curve will determine the state that we will be in once we reach the bottom. If we keep on throwing ourselves off cliffs and falling down crevices then we will arrive at the bottom in a pretty awful state. <br><br>Anyway I have started gardening this year, because even on a best case scenario the future is going to be pretty rough.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c3454437008571271107 title="comment permalink">7/14/14, 7:02 AM</a><br><br>

Perhaps you have already discussed this in previous post, if so, my apologies. My question to ponder is this: Can humanity actually survive another dark age? <br><br>I ask this because we, in our time, are unique in human history only for our technology. In every other way, we are pretty much the same as everyone else down the good old historical timeline. When the Maya or Minoans collapsed, the human suffering was traumatic, but that was as bad as it got and the suffering stayed local.<br><br>We, other the other hand, have unforgiving, forever technologies. For instance, hundreds of cooling ponds filled with thousands of spent fuel rods along side hot reactors are scattered all over the world, though mostly in the northern hemisphere. We would not need a dark age, just a dim one, where the lights went out only in a few "lucky" places, to turn these under-maintained reactor sites in perpetual poisoning machines. We could have a world of multiple Fukushimas producing mass die offs and tweaking DNA replication for hundreds of thousands of year.<br><br>My concerns go on to non-nuclear technologies as well. As maintenance falls off and universities stop producing bright, young engineers, the vast square footage of chemical production and storage facilities will go un-monitored and un-managed. This stuff can kill us, as well as the rest of the biosphere, just as dead as decaying radiation.<br><br>Since I live in Los Angeles, I am concerned about the millions of tons of cargo in and laying just off the Ports of LA and Long Beach. What happens when there is no more money, no more letters of credit and those ships are simply abandoned at anchor. We could have a witch's brew of cargo that does not play well together just waiting for the chance to leak free and rumble in un-manned ships so near to shore.<br><br>If any of my concerns have weight, it would certainly put an evil twist the idea that, "We just can't live without our tech."<br><br><a href=#c8859413222737385795 title="comment permalink">7/14/14, 9:48 AM</a><br><br>

To not assume leadership if that was your role and you were capable of doing it might be considered dereliction of duty. Such a criterion builds social cohesion into a group.

He was a scop -- that is to say, a professional poet and musician who made his living providing entertainment to a warlord -- and if he was literate at all, it was probably a matter of knowing the runic alphabet and not much more. The old Anglo-Saxon poetry, like the poetry of most dark ages, was orally composed and transmitted for a good long time before it was written down. His forefathers were Saxon barbarians, the people who killed the guys who sat in the baths and sipped wine.

Are a lot of people going to die because of the radioactive and chemical wastes we're currently dumping into the biosphere, or putting in places where they're certain to be dumped into the biosphere? Of course. Are those effects going to be evenly distributed in lethal doses over the entire habitable surface of the planet, or even of the present-day United States? Of course not. <br><br>Radionuclides and toxic chemicals are not supernatural forces; their patterns of dispersion and bioaccumulation are well understood, and -- as I'll be explaining in a future post -- the predictable result of their distribution in a deindustrializing landscape of ruined nuclear power plants, long-abandoned chemical factories, and vast tracts of land that have neither of these things on them, is a collection of regional and local "hot spots" that will kill the unwary for decades, centuries, or millennia into the future. I've suggested more than once that ten thousand years from now, the sites of today's nuclear power plants will be surrounded, at a safe distance, with cow skulls on sticks, as a reminder -- part of the local shamanic lore -- that an evil power unleashed by the wicked people of the distant past dwells there, and will kill those who disturb its rest. <br><br>Your Los Angeles example is a good one.

One of the reasons the Jews and the Greeks got along so badly is that the Jews thought of the Achaemenids as their saviors, and the Greeks thought of them as the invaders who had to be fought to a standstill at Thermopylae and Marathon. <br><br>Tony, are you familiar with C.L.

There are so many empty cargo containers after China unloads manufactured "goods" at our ports, it's cheaper to ship the alfalfa crops back in those otherwise cargo-less containers at the lower prices China pays, than to ship within or beyond California to other states even at higher per-ton alfalfa prices. Another example of the wealth pump turned on us as they suck up our basic commodities cheaply while selling us finished industrial products we can't/don't make any more (and of course a lot of junk we don't need as well). <br><br>So in this case we're also selling them our precious and dwindling agricultural water supply cheap, in the form of alfalfa, rather than keeping those nutrients as well as their monetary value here where the crops are raised. Third world, here we come....<br><br><a href=#c3222939026814097074 title="comment permalink">7/15/14, 12:18 AM</a><br><br>

The city of Pasadena experienced a severe windstorm (worse than the typically fierce Santa Anas we get around these parts of Southern California each year) that knocked out power over a wide area about a year ago, much of that due to trees blown over on power lines. <br><br>The power company was working around the clock to restore power to everyone, but some helpless sorts in one neighborhood that went a few days without electricity were crying to the local news media about being stranded and abandoned in their suburban homes, sitting in the dark, cut off from the world, dead cell phones and laptops, no microwaves to cook with, etc. <br><br>Of course they could have walked a few blocks out of their neighborhoods (downed trees meant they couldn't DRIVE out yet, horrors!) and plugged in at the nearest Starbucks or other such businesses (or - GASP! - the local library!) in areas that had power restored, but reading their tales of woe, they might as well have been on a deserted island. <br><br>Lawsuits against the power company are still in progress - as if the company controlled the wind? It's not as if the whole city went dark for days, but they felt entitled to 24/7 utility service at home no matter what was going on outdoors. Not just inconvenienced, but suffering mental anguish and fear to that degree? That level of helplessness from urbanites so locked into their technobubble while surrounded by neighborhoods in easy reach by foot or bike that had power? And their reaction that someone else needs to be blamed, sued and otherwise held responsible for their few days of inconvenience does not bode well for segments of our populace managing to function during the frequent and lengthy blackouts in times to come, or for the elected officials and power company honchos they'll be blaming and seeking retribution from. <br><br>You'd think with the barrage of public service messages, TV news, school events, etc. we have here about how to prepare for the aftermath of earthquakes, these folks might have been a bit better prepared to make it through a mere power failure, but no. Granted it was relatively few households reacting this way but -- really??? <br><br>Would it help to hand out copies of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy emblazoned with "Don't Panic" in large friendly letters? Do they even know where their towels are?<br><br><a href=#c809057881267692994 title="comment permalink">7/15/14, 1:03 AM</a><br><br>

As a guitar player, I take so much for granted today - availability of everything from strings up to amps and all points in between. I've made a couple of solid body electrics in my time (they were not good), but at least it can be done in a basement workshop. Meanwhile, professional luthiery is hanging on in the US, although primarily at the very high end of guitar prices. I play mainly old blues, acoustic and electric, and would love to see it continue in some way. Would be terrible if Robert Johnson got forgotten all over again. Learning, playing and passing it on is one thing, but would love to hear what you think musical technology will look like a couple of hundred years from now.<br><br><a href=#c3741743341438488805 title="comment permalink">7/15/14, 9:58 AM</a><br><br>

When Rome was ascendent, how long did it take for Latin to take root in Gaul - on both sides of the Alps? Not long I'll bet."<br><br>Although Cisalpine Gaul was largely Romanised in culture and so on quite early (though Roman writers of the early empire could still be nervous about a "tumult among the Gauls" there), when it was threatened by the (eventually repelled) third century barbarian invasions the besieged cities there were still praying to Celtic gods for help and thanking them when it arrived (according to Gibbon). And wikipedia strongly suggests that Transalpine Gaul was mainly Romanised when it was <i>as a consequence of</i> the successful fifth century barbarian invasions, since up until then Gaulish customs had survived in the country and only the cities had been Romanised, but the population spill then from the cities into rural idiocy was sufficient to tip the culture countrywide (whereas Britain lost its Romanitas along with urban life, whether because the proportions of Romanised and peasants were less advantageous or because the peasantry had been less "precooked" into almost being Romanised). Iberia is an interesting case, in that it was less disrupted during the crucial period, so that much city life continued and the Romanising effects were able to continue flowing from the cities even after the barbarians arrived.<br><br>Tony f. whelKs wrote: "It does of course beg a corollary: 'if it's clever, but doesn't work, it ain't clever'"<br><br>That's not quite true. There have been a <i>lot</i> of clever ideas that didn't work but were still clever, because eventually something else changed so that they did work. For instance, the ball point pen was a clever idea that didn't work, all the many times someone came up with the idea - right until Mr. Biro invented the eponymous biro, which had the right kind of ink and the right kind of alloy for the nib (it was that last that had to wait for other work to arrive).<br><br><a href=#c8204209952793359719 title="comment permalink">7/16/14, 6:24 AM</a><br><br>

The thing is, we can ask if there ever have been times in the past when it was different, i.e. when there were criteria from other collapses but a collapse didn't happen then after all, and then see if anything from <i>those</i> matches our situation. Clearly, we will not find our data among cases of historical collapses.<br><br>Were there any near misses? I think there may have been, though it is hard to be sure since it could be argued that they weren't heading for a collapse that they avoided, they just weren't heading for a collapse at all. But the early third century seems to have about the same the requirements for the fall of Rome as its actual fall did, and late 18th century western Europe reached a peak of living standards (level and distribution, both) that had often been reached elsewhere, briefly before a collapse, only western Europe got the spread of industrialisation instead (it "should" have had a successful but temporary resistance to the late 18th century revolutions while legitimacy remained in enough areas to fight back, then a collapse in the 1840s when all legitimacy had gone - but some countries had been lifted up by new wealth by then and kept their perceived legitimacy, and others had reactionary elites with enough new strength from new techniques to prevail without it).<br><br>Well, if we <i>can</i> find times when it was different, are there common features we can look for among them that we can either rule out, recognise as present, or seek to apply to our own case?<br><br><a href=#c2731553857957487599 title="comment permalink">7/16/14, 6:41 AM</a><br><br>

I feel like that's a lens that, being relatively "objective" and well-grounded is a great tool for sharpening thought, not to mention that it's so very interesting. Any time you make explicit the ways in which expressions of human culture may be adaptive (vel non) in a context of energy descent, or when you otherwise ground the discussion ecological and evolutionary terms, I feel like we get such crisp renditions of the big picture that the learning and the pleasure are both multiplied. Speaking of which, the second blog looks to be a wonderful counterpoint and amplification of the big picture in JMG thought, as exemplified by the lovely, ecologically-termed aphorism that I'll take the liberty of quoting it in case anyone's not yet checked out the new blog:<br><br>"As long as you’re doing the same sort of things that other mammals do, you’re unlikely to get into too much trouble.
