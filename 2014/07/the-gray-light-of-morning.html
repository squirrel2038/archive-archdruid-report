<div class=MsoNormal>
I try to wear my archdruid’s hat lightly in these essays, but every so often I field questions that touch directly on the issues of ultimate meaning that our culture, however clumsily, classifies as “religious.” Two comments in response to <a href=../../2014/07/bright-were-halls-then.html>the post here two weeks ago</a> raised such issues, in a way that’s relevant enough to this series of posts and important enough to the broader project of this blog to demand a response.</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of them—tip of the aforementioned archdruid’s hat to Repent—asked, “As a Druid, what are your thoughts about divine purpose, reincarnation, and our purpose in the eyes of God? What do you think future ‘ecotechnic’ societies have yet to achieve that will be worthwhile to pursue, that our descendants should suffer through the dark age towards?” The other—tip of the hat to Yupped—asked, “What do you do if you see the big picture of what’s happening around you? How did those early adopters of decline in other collapsing societies maintain their sanity when they knew what was coming? I don’t think I have the mind or the temperament to tell myself stories about the transcendent meaning of suffering in an age of social collapse.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those are serious questions, and questions like them are being raised more and more often these days, on this blog and in a great many other places as well. People are beginning to come to grips with the fact that they can no longer count on faith in limitless technological progress to give them an easy answer to the enduring questions of human existence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As they do that, they’re also having to confront those questions all over again, and finding out in the process that the solution that modern industrial civilization claimed to offer for those same questions was never actually a solution at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Psychologists have a concept they call “provisional living.” That’s the insistence, so often heard from people whose lives are stuck on a dysfunctional merry-go-round of self-inflicted crisis, that everything they don’t like about their lives will change just as soon as something else happens: as soon as they lose twenty pounds, get a divorce, quit their lousy job, or what have you. Of course the weight never goes away, the divorce papers never get filed, and so on, because the point of the exercise is to allow daydreams of an imaginary life in which they get everything they think they want take the place of the hard work and hard choices inseparable from personal change in the real world. What provisional living offers the individual neurotic, in turn, faith in the inevitability and beneficence of progress offers industrial society as a whole—or, more precisely, faith in progress used to offer that, back when the promises made in its name didn’t yet look quite so threadbare as they do today.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There was always a massive political subtext in those promises.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The poor were encouraged to believe that technological progress will someday generate so much wealth that their children and grandchildren will be rich; the sick and dying, to dream about a future where medical progress will make every disease curable; the oppressed, to hope for a day when social progress will grant everyone the fair treatment they can’t reliably get here and now, and so on. Meanwhile, and crucially, members of the privileged classes who became uncomfortable the mismatch between industrial civilization’s glittering rhetoric and its tawdry reality were encouraged to see that mismatch as a passing phase that will be swept away by progress at some undefined point in the future, and thus to limit their efforts to change the system to the sort of well-meaning gestures that don’t seriously inconvenience the status quo. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As real as the political subtext was, it’s a mistake to see the myth of progress purely as a matter of propaganda. During the heyday of industrialism, that myth was devoutly believed by a great many people, at all points along the social spectrum, many of whom saw it as the best chance they had for positive change. Faith in progress was a social fact of vast importance, one that shaped the lives of individuals, communities, and nations. The hope of upward mobility that inspired the poor to tolerate the often grueling conditions of their lives, the dream of better living through technology that kept the middle classes laboring at the treadmill, the visions of human destiny that channeled creative minds into the service of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>existing institutions—these were real and powerful forces in their day, and drew on high hopes and noble ideals as well as less exalted motives. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The problem that we face now is precisely that those hopes and dreams and visions have passed their pull date. With each passing year, more people have noticed the widening gap between the future we were supposed to get and the one that’s actually been delivered to our doorstep; with each passing year, the voices raised in defense of the old rhetoric of perpetual progress get more defensive, and the once-sparkling imagery they offer for our contemplation looks more and more shopworn. One by one, we are waking up in a cold and unfamiliar place, and the gray light of morning does not bring us good news. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It would be hard enough to face the difficult future ahead of us if we came to the present moment out of an era of sober realism and close attention to the hard facts of the human condition. It’s far harder to find ourselves where we are when that forces us to own up to the hard fact that we’ve been lying to ourselves for three hundred years. Disillusionment is a bitter pill at the best of times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When the illusion that’s just been shattered has been telling us that the future is obliged to conform to our fondest fantasies, whatever those happen to be, it’s no wonder that it’s as unwelcome as it is. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Bitter though the pill may be, though, it’s got to be choked down, and like the bitter medicines of an earlier day, it has a tonic effect. Come to terms with the fact that faith in progress was always destined to be disappointed, that the law of diminishing returns and the hard limits of thermodynamics made the dream of endless guaranteed betterment a delusion—an appealing delusion, but a delusion all the same—and after the shock wears off, you’ll find yourself standing on common ground shared with the rest of your species, asking questions that they asked and answered in their time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Most of the people who have ever lived, it bears remembering, had no expectation that the future would be any better than the world that they saw around them. The majority of them assumed as a matter of course that the future would be much like the present, while quite a few of them believed instead that it would be worse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Down through the generations, they faced the normal human condition of poverty, sickness, toil, grief, injustice, and the inevitability of their own deaths, and still found life sufficiently worth living to meet the challenges of making a living, raising families, and facing each day as it came. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s normal for our species.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Buying into a fantasy that insists that the universe is under an obligation to fulfill your daydreams is not. Get past that fantasy, and past the shock of disillusionment that follows its departure, and it’s not actually that difficult to make sense of a world that doesn’t progress and shows no interest in remaking itself to fit an overdeveloped sense of human entitlement. The downside is that you have to give up any attempt to smuggle the same fantasy back into your mind under some other name or form, and when some such belief system has been central to the worldview of your culture for the last three centuries or so, it’s always tempting to find some way to retrieve the fantasy. Still, falling in with that temptation<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>just lands you back where you were, waiting for a future the universe is serenely unwilling to provide.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably worth noting that you also have to give up the equal and opposite fantasy that claims that the universe is under an obligation to fulfill a different set of daydreams, the kind that involves the annihilation of everything you don’t like in the universe, whether or not that includes yourself. That’s simply another way of playing the game of provisional living: “I don’t have to do anything because X is supposed to happen (and it won’t)” amounts in practice to the same thing as “I won’t do anything until X happens (and it won’t)”—that is to say, it’s just one more comfortable evasion of responsibility.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are more constructive ways to deal with the decidedly mixed bag that human existence hands us. If I may risk a significant oversimplification, there are broadly speaking three ways that work. It so happens that the ancient Greeks, who grappled just as incisively with these issues as they did with so much else, evolved three schools of philosophy, each of which took one of these three ways as its central theme. They weren’t the only ones to do that in a thoughtful fashion; those of my readers who know their way around the history of ideas will be able to name any number of examples from other societies and other ages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>I propose to use Greek examples here simply because they’re the schools with which I’m most familiar. As Charles Fort said, one traces a circle beginning anywhere. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first of the three approaches I have in mind starts with the realization that for most of us, all things considered, being alive beats the stuffing out of the alternative. While life contains plenty of sources of misery, it also contains no shortage of delights, even when today’s absurdly complex technostructure isn’t there to provide them; furthermore, the mind that pays close attention to its own experiences will soon notice that a fairly large percentage of its miseries are self-inflicted, born of pointless worrying about future troubles or vain brooding over past regrets. Unlearn those habits, stop insisting that life is horrible because it isn’t perfect, and it’s generally not too hard to learn to enjoy the very real pleasures that life has to offer and to tolerate its less pleasant features with reasonable grace. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the approach taught by Epicurus, the founder of the Epicurean school of philosophy in ancient Greece. It’s also the foundation of what William James called the healthy-minded way of thinking, the sort of calm realism you so often see in people who’ve been through hard times and come out the other side in one piece. Just now, it’s a very difficult philosophy for many people in the world’s industrial nations to take up, precisely because most of us haven’t been through hard times; we’ve been through an age of extravagance and excess, and like most people in that position, we’re finding the letdown at the party’s end far more difficult to deal with than any actual suffering we might be facing. Get past that common reaction, and the Epicurean way has much to offer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If it has a weakness, it’s that attending to the good things in life can be very hard work when those good things are in short supply. That’s when the second approach comes into its own. It starts from the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>realization that whether life is good or not, here we are, and we each have to choose how we’re going to respond to that stark fact. The same unlearning that shows the Epicurean to avoid self-inflicted misery is a first step, a clearing of the decks that makes room for the decisions that matter, but once this is taken care of, the next step is to face up to the fact that there are plenty of things in the world that could and should be changed, if only someone were willing to get up off the sofa and make the effort required. The second approach thus becomes a philosophy of action, and when action requires risking one’s life—and in really hard times, it very often does—those who embrace the second approach very often find themselves saying, “Well, what of it? I’m going to die sooner or later anyway.”
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the approach taught by Zeno, the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy in ancient Greece. It’s among the most common ways of thought in dark ages, sometimes worked out as a philosophy, sometimes expressed in pure action: the ethos of the Spartans and the samurai. That way of thinking about life is taken to its logical extreme in the literature of the pagan Teutonic peoples: you will die, says the Elder Edda, the world will die, even the gods will die, <i>and none of that matters</i>. All that matters is doing the right thing, because it’s the right thing, and because you’ve learned to embrace the certainty of your death and so don’t have to worry about anything but doing the right thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course the same choice can express itself in less stark forms. Every one of my readers who’s had the experience of doing something inconvenient or unpleasant just because it’s the right thing to do has some sense of how that works, and why.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In a civilization on the downward arc, there are many inconvenient or unpleasant things that very badly need to be done, and choosing one of them and doing it is a remarkably effective response to the feelings of meaninglessness and helplessness that afflict so many people just now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those who argue that you don’t know whether or not your actions will have any results in the long run are missing the point, because from the perspective I’ve just sketched out, the consequences don’t matter either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Fiat iustitia, ruat caelum</i>, as the Roman Stoics liked to say:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>let justice be done, even if it brings the sky crashing down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So those, broadly speaking, are the first two ways that people have dealt constructively with the human condition: in simplest terms, either learn to live with what life brings you, or decide to do something about it. The first choice may seem a little simplistic and the second one may seem a little stark, but both work—that is, both are psychologically healthy responses that often yield good results, which is more than can be said for habits of thought that require the universe to either cater to our fantasies of entitlement or destroy itself to satisfy our pique. Both also mesh fairly well with the habitual material-mindedness of contemporary culture, the assumption that the only things that really matter are those you can hit with a stick, which is common to most civilizations toward the end of their history.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The third option I have in mind also works, but it doesn’t mesh at all with the assumption just noted. Current confusions about the alternatives to that assumption run deep enough that some care will be needed in explaining just what I mean. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The third option starts with the sense that the world as we normally perceive it is not quite real—not illusory, strictly speaking, but derivative. It depends on something else, something that stands outside the world of our ordinary experience and differs from that world not just in detail but in kind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since this “something else” is apart from the things we normally use language to describe, it’s remarkably difficult to define or describe in any straightforward way, though something of its nature can be shared with other people through the more roundabout means of metaphor and symbol. Elusive as it is, it can’t simply be ignored, because it shapes the world of our ordinary experience, not according to some human agenda but according to a pattern of its own. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d encourage my readers to notice with some care what’s not being said here. The reality that stands behind the world of our ordinary experience is not subject to human manipulation; it isn’t answerable to our fantasies or to our fears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The viewpoint I’m suggesting is just about as far as you can get from the fashionable notion that human beings create their own reality—which, by the way, is just one more way our overdeveloped sense of entitlement shapes our habits of thinking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As objects of our own and other’s perceptions, we belong to the world of the not quite real. Under certain circumstances, though, human beings can move into modes of nonordinary perception in which the presence of the underlying reality stops being a theory and becomes an experience, and when this happens a great many of the puzzles and perplexities of human existence suddenly start making sense. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a certain irony in the fact that in ancient Greek culture, the philosophical movement that came to embody this approach to the world took its name from a man named Aristocles, whose very broad shoulders gave him the nickname Plato. That’s ironic because Plato was a transitional figure; behind him stood a long line of Orphic and Pythagorean mystics, whose insights he tried to put into rational form, not always successfully; after him came an even longer line of thinkers, the Neoplatonists, who completed the job he started and worked out a coherent philosophy that relates the world of reality to the world of appearance through the lens of human consciousness. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Platonist answer isn’t limited to Platonism, of course, any more than the Stoic or Epicurean answer is found only in those two Greek philosophical schools. Implicitly or explicitly, it’s present in most religious traditions that grapple with philosophical issues and manage not to fall prey to the easy answers of apocalyptic fantasy. In the language of mainstream Western religion, we can say that there’s a divine reality, and then there’s a created world and created beings—for example, the author and readers of this blog—which depend for their existence on the divine reality, however this is described. Still, that’s far from the only language in which this way of thinking about the world can be framed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Epicurean and Stoic approaches to face an imperfect and challenging world, as already discussed, take that world as it is, and propose ways to deal with it. That’s a wholly reasonable approach from within the sort of worldview that those traditions generally embrace. The Platonic approach, by contrast, proposes that the imperfect and challenging world we encounter is only part of the picture, and that certain disciplines of consciousness allow us to take the rest of the picture into account, not as a policy of blind trust, but as an object of personal experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>As already suggested, it’s difficult to communicate in ordinary language just what that experience has to say about the reality behind such phrases as “divine purpose,” which is why those who pursue such experiences tend to focus on teaching other people how to do it, and let them make their own discoveries as they do the work.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Knowing the rest of the picture, for that matter, doesn’t make the imperfections and challenges go away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>There are many situations in which either an Epicurean or a Stoic tactic is the best bet even from within a Platonic view of the cosmos—it’s a matter of historical fact that much of the best of the Epicurean and Stoic traditions were absorbed into the classical Neoplatonic synthesis for exactly this reason. The difference is simply that to glimpse something of the whole picture, and to pursue those disciplines that bring such glimpses within reach, provide a perspective that makes sense of the texture of everyday experience as it is, without expecting it to act out human fears and fantasies. That approach isn’t for everyone, but it’s an option, and it’s the one that I tend to trust. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
And with that, I’ll set aside my archdruid’s hat again and return to the ordinary business of chronicling the decline and fall of industrial civilization. </div>

Yup this is pretty much exactly how I'm trying to live my life these days (with all three approaches you've just described). Perhaps too, as you might have hinted here, the third Platonic approach demonstrates the limits of reasoned argument in trying to convince people to act. One can be rationally convinced all they like of the realities of peak oil/ climate change etc but in my opinion if all they see is the material world around them, what is the point? this of course is where the Platonic approach comes in handy. To see ones experience in other worldly contexts as well as one of this world.<br><br>Just another relevant point, I recall Toynbee in a A study of history describing how the process of creating new civilizations/ cultures is initiated by people responding to a difficult challenge of some kind, whether this is a difficult environment, a difficult political situation or something similar. Hence, I believe this could be another source of motivation for people living in today's world. Creative responses to challenges presented by the world today can hopefully lay the seeds by which new future civilizations/ cultures can rise up once again.

Like any good piece of wisdom, it means many things. Sometimes that insight feels like a loss and a grief and I want to quibble about criteria. Other times I know it to mean, don't fall for the blandishments of false and rosy futures. More often lately, the incantation aids a basic stoicism in me that wants to live in the REAL world, and embrace that realness. There is no brighter future - but there is this future that you get. And that's enough. Be with this one. Work with this one. And today I say it - there is no brighter future - because I want to stop mourning over the possible futures we wasted, the biosphere we're wounding, the human potential we're squandering - and again find pleasure and joy in open-eyed living - crafting what we can, with what we have.

Neo-Confucianism teaches that human beings inherently already know what is good, and all study is simply a matter of bringing one's natural goodness to the fore (similar to what Socrates called anamnesis). The orthodox method was to study goodness in books, consider whether it was natural, and then try to put it into practice. This is what a lot of people already do here, and they might label it Stoicism or whatever.<br><br>Wang Yangming disagreed. The radical thing that he said was that <i>knowledge and action are one</i>. What is read in books is not knowledge. If you think you understand the right way to live but you aren't living that way yet, then you don't really know how to obey your natural goodness. When knowledge is real it determines your next action with total certainty. In other words, <i>your next action has already been determined by the knowledge you actually possess</i>.<br><br>Most people reading about peak oil think they are learning about options for making important decisions in the future. But for Wang Yangming, this does not qualify as learning. Actually, there is no knowledge outside of practice: “If you want to know bitterness, you have to eat a bitter melon yourself.”<br><br>Wang's unorthodox school was bitterly hated in Korea and eventually pushed aside in China as a bunch of troublemakers, but his philosophy became part of the radical political currents in Japan that caused the Meiji Restoration in 1868. When Yukio Mishima attempted to take over the Japanese government in 1970, he had published an essay about Wang Yangming just a few months before. Now, JMG, you can tell me this is simply an elaboration on Stoicism, but Stoicism didn't cause any revolutions recently. :)<br><br><a href=#c7779622647571036340 title="comment permalink">7/23/14, 6:19 PM</a><br><br>

The failure of that icon of the Jetsons' future to appear has really disappointed people who took it seriously.

If I wore a hat I would tip it back! <br><br>I have two points to add. The age of cheap energy seems to be the ultimate bubble, in terms of more energy/stuff/stimulation (MESS?), for human civilization. We may see ourselves at some sort of progress zenith right now, but a few decades of history will change that perspective. So is the bursting of collective faith in the inevitability of material progress also the bursting of the ultimate religious bubble? I can see humans in future generations embracing new religions, but for many of this generation, and for a few beyond, it will be hard to find a new religion so grand as the religion of human progress. I can see some of us expending a good deal of religious fervor in trying to revive the MESS, but I can't quite see what could compete with that grand illusion for our deepest attention other than a fairly simple, personal, focus-on-the-basics sort of path. A path in fact of the sorts you outline.<br><br>Secondly, of those three paths, I wonder if spending some time in one of the first two would be good preparatory steps for moving on to the third? Common threads of practice of the first two seem to be calming down, being a little quieter, more disciplined and getting over oneself to some degree. And in doing so, making space perhaps for something a little more mysterious to come in?<br><br><a href=#c7834640566505982461 title="comment permalink">7/23/14, 7:26 PM</a><br><br>

The third Grand Archdruid of AODA, Dr. Juliet Ashley, used to present people with what her students took to calling the Ashley Technique. It consisted of two steps: (a) figure out what your problem is, and (b) either do something about it, or learn to live with it -- one or the other, take your pick. <br><br>Elizabeth, that's really a subject for <a href=http://galabes.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>my other blog</a>. <br><br>Avery, the Stoics haven't caused a lot of revolutions lately, but they were sufficiently troublesome in Roman times -- the last time, please note, that they were an organized school -- that a number of emperors banished them en masse from Rome. I suspect Wang Yangming and Epictetus would have gotten along fabulously once they got past the language barrier. <br><br>Enrique, an accessible scholarly introduction is Gregory Shaw's <i>Theurgy and the Soul</i>; once you've read that, the writings of Iamblichus and Proclus are basic to the sort of thing I'm discussing. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, I've also heard -- and used -- "Dude, where's my jetpack?" It's an important issue, since the vast majority of the promises made so freely since 1950 or so about the glorious future of high technology have proven dead wrong. As more people notice that, the religion of progress is going to land in very, very deep trouble. <br><br>Yupped, yes, and in fact it makes sense to work through both of them as part of a preparatory discipline. That's one of the things that gave rise to mature Neoplatonism -- useful techniques from a range of sources became a propaedeutic for the transformative work.<br><br><a href=#c2826714461918915972 title="comment permalink">7/23/14, 7:58 PM</a><br><br>

Colorado suffered from the "Ursa Minor Beta" effect (Douglas Adams reference) - it was the place you went to live the good life, leave your troubles behind. So the sort of provisional livers who really did get off their rears and make the big change wind up in places like that... only to discover they are still themselves, and all their troubles came along with them. Now, in poor rural Tennessee, the provisional livers hit crises where they come to terms with the fact that things never are going to change, this is their life. <br><br>In both cases, the result is a very sad aspect of the local demographics. I'll just say that if you look through the obituaries, you see a lot of men in their 40s and 50s who died at home, with no additional information provided. <br><br>On beyond alternative ways to live, I think we might oughta put some pondering into how the "provisional livers" could come to a soft landing when their world evaporates out from under them.

I've never really managed to rebuild it. While the rational part of my mind works well enough to disassemble my own ideology and pick apart everything I once held sacred, the irrational parts of me continue to behave just as they did before, and I find I've fallen into a sort of quasi-nihilism in which there really isn't anything I believe in or assign any value to.

I left my job as a lecturer in business because I'd become deeply dissatisfied with it. I did try to include Peak Oil in my discussions, and a few students got it, but to most it was just crazy talk to be tuned out. It would definitely have been infra dig to discuss it with colleagues.<br><br>Now it becomes clearer that rather than being an educator and mentor (which is why I went into academia), I was being expected to act as a priest of progress. Teaching critical thinking was of rather less importance than maintaining the facade of a great future, obtained through an increasingly expensive education. This must be how a vicar feels in the pulpit when he's already lost his faith...<br><br>The cognitive dissonance I experienced wasn't resolved simply by leaving 'the faith' of academia. Like @grebulocities, I still haven't quite worked out what should replace it.<br><br>Still, the theme of this week's post is timely. I do have plans; I am getting off my backside and getting something done to make them happen - but walking away from the religion of progress cost me a lot, materially. <br><br>I'm fortunate that I've had a lot of exposure to Chinese thought, in its mixture of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism. That helps a lot. It's good to see knowledgable scholars of Asian thought chipping in in the comments, supplementing JMG's base in Western thought (which isn't meant to be a criticism).<br><br>@S0phia Inkpen: I spent a lot of time in Singapore, and heard the same saying: "If you can't change the world, change your thinking". It's been useful - as "There is no brighter future" will be!<br><br>Anyway, I still try to use the tools I was taught in Business School to frame some of the discussions here in a way perhaps more acceptable to the mainstream.

How do you arrive at that cut off? To me it looks as though the philosophical and physical-economic underpinnings for all that really only got started around two hundred and fifty years ago, and were still widely disputed until decades later. Think of the timing of the Industrial Revolution and the Whig Theory of History or the Revolutionary movements; those weren't yet around in the first half of the 18th century, and in that period anyone faced with the last of the English Enclosures or similar definitely knew that change wasn't inherently always improvement.<br><br><a href=#c9039433793481199142 title="comment permalink">7/23/14, 11:31 PM</a><br><br>

I have concluded that any observed mismatch between theory and reality is neither temporary nor anomalous and indicates toxic waste of time and effort to pursue whatever snake oil is being pedaled.<br>If (theory) works, then as we implement (action) to bring about (goal) then (situation) will begin to and increasingly approximate (ideal). <br>Anything else is a glittering fairy castle defended by a monster-filled moat that is not just a passing phase and you shall not pass.<br>That said, that fairy castle of the imagination is still a beautiful place to gaze upon and I take inspiration from several imaginary fantasies to motivate myself to get off the couch and do something in the real world. That something falls far short of the fantasy, but I know that. I keep that fact firmly in mind at all times. What does happen, is that I achieve interesting results in which I can take pride.<br>For example, am I the Worlds Greatest Cavalryman? Not a chance. Am I having fun playing Errol Flynn with skill-at-arms on horseback? Absolutely. I love to practice against targets while mounted, because it's what the World's Greatest would do (if he existed) and so, it's what I do.

Likewise all the leather-work skill that comes with the horse furniture repair (and some pretty leather things, too). And the basic woodwork skills. And the gumption that comes from just doing something.<br>Not sure exactly which school of thought that fits into, but it works for me.<br><br><a href=#c444504210010183772 title="comment permalink">7/24/14, 12:45 AM</a><br><br>

Not just dreams and visions (being awake but so relaxed one experiences a whole other level of reality beneath or beyond the physical) but also events and encounters which seemed to cross over and bleed into our waking world as well (with multiple witnesses and so forth, without drugs.) <br><br>I had my very first visions as far back as age 3, they escalated in my teens and early 20s, and declined to a low but steady clip now in my 40s. I've met others who had the same, and I've also met those with mental afflictions such as schizophrenia, and the difference is quite stark. I later was fortunate enough to meet a couple of people who helped me negotiate my own dreaming mind and explore with more purpose and will, as well as understand more of what these odd encounters were all about. <br><br>One overwhelming piece of information that got conveyed to me repeatedly in my various experiences was that the future of our modern world was not going to continue on like most think. I swear some MIND attached to the world (though I wouldn't call it "Gaia" necessarily) gave me the impression that nature reacts to our bending it beyond its normal capacity and eventually it snaps back violently like the proverbial branch. I had visions of the weather systems of the world changing in the 70s before such things were much discussed (and I was a child then.) That's just one piece of many. Now I'm watching some of those things come to pass and others seem to be lining up to do so. <br><br>I feel like most of what you say here regarding the future is old news on some level. Yet my rational mind benefits from the way you explain things that my intuition grasped a long time ago. I'm no wispy wishful thinker, with notions of being some special savior dancing through my egoistic mind. I just know that:<br><br>~ I need to focus on what I can do and then do it, staying alert and adapting as I go.<br><br>~ I need to be a good person to the best of my ability, regardless of the outcome of that, though "winning" is more important to most people. If only because I have that power to do good if no other, and to give up that power in the world is to embrace cowardice and the loss of self-respect.<br><br>~ I must face these challenges like an adventurer in a story, because we are all heroes and heroines in our own stories. The story is the point, and right now the world needs us to step up. It DOES matter, we ARE watched-- by something. It may not seem like it counts, but it all counts.<br><br>I share this here even though I know I'm inviting scorn and derisive laughter by doing so. I don't mention it ordinarily, but I'm not the only one out there that comes to such conclusions through odd experiences. Why do some people have these experiences and not others? That I can't answer. I don't get it either and I don't feel particularly wise or special or worthy. Just plugged in to more subtle things sometimes.

For example, see this book: "Growth Makes You Happy: An Optimist's View of Progress and the Free Market":<br><br><i>"Many economists feed today's pessimism with regard to the future. Peter De Keyzer is a welcome exception. Yes, there are problems, but this book shows that there are also solutions. There is reason for optimism." - Professor Paul De Grauwe, London School of Economics "The economy has to keep growing." So says top economist Peter De Keyzer. In his view, a free market and intelligent growth are necessary for our continued wealth and well-being. Better yet: economic growth is the only recipe for guaranteeing more freedom and more prosperity for all. Nevertheless, after nearly five years of crisis, one no longer seems to believe in economic progress. Growth Makes You Happy is a solidly argued plea in favour of more optimism, more risk, less collectivism, and more freedom.</i><br><br>Defensive much? Can anyone imagine such a book even needing to be written thirty or forty years ago? Would there have even been an argument? There seems to be more than a whiff of desperation here. I think defenders of growth and progress are increasingly on the ropes. Their latest argument is that even though inequality within each country is increasing rapidly, inequality worldwide is decreasing, which makes it all okay.

I’ve been struggling with the universal “What can I do” question mightily since I retired two years ago. I have used most of the approaches you set forth in the essay, and I find for now a sort of Stoic/Teutonic approach tempered by the mystical experiences you allude to serves me best. After some casting about, I’ve decided that for the time being my energy is best spent supporting the local public library. It’s my “lighthouse” project.<br><br>I live right down the road from you in Berkeley Springs, and during the past year there was a significant struggle here over funding the public schools from local taxes. Schools in West Virginia receive a significant share of their funding from county taxes, and the perennial school tax levy was initially defeated. The opposition stressed that the schools were donating tax dollars to “non-educational activities” like the public library and the arts center. The schools successfully regrouped and proposed a reduced levy, which narrowly passed, but did not contain funding for the library. As a result, the library’s annual budget was reduced by nearly a third, staff was downsized from 6 to 4, and the library’s hours were reduced to 31 hours per week.<br><br>I was working as a volunteer at the library during this period and it was difficult to comprehend that many local people wanted to “save tax dollars” (i.e. lower their taxes) by throwing the schools, library, and arts center under the bus. It doesn’t seem to have occurred to them that they were also throwing their property values under the bus. <br><br>On a personal metaphysical level, I find myself drifting from Druidry towards a more Norse frame of reference. I think the economy in this country will implode sooner rather than later, and there will be a lot of very unhappy people who are heavily armed and whose only agenda will fall on the warlord side of the map, and they will run head on into a government that is placing more and more emphasis on “domestic security.” It may just be in my own mind, but I find the Druid toolbox lacking in many survival skills - political, economic, and physical defense of communities, forging tribal alliances, and other Realpolitik situations I foresee coming down the pike. The current troubles in the Ukraine and Middle East suggest that business as usual is drawing to a close.<br><br>Ray - I think the link you suggest between Stoicism and a sense of justice is very important. My own sense of justice was developed over 20 years as a trial attorney in the criminal courts, working both sides of the street. Most recently, I have found examination of the Norse god Tyr very rewarding.<br><br><a href=#c2322780223643889428 title="comment permalink">7/24/14, 6:48 AM</a><br><br>

Paid for the courses by working in contrast to my siblings. That self-sufficency gave me escape from the tryanny of 'Family Expectations'. Fast forward almost 4 decades...a few careers, two fine grown up children with jobs and their own homes, a delightful second wife for 15 years who is a partner in every sense of the word, and I seldom leave my property or change my/our simple pursuits. The occasional lunch in town is a lovely treat and good enough. <br><br>I have had the experience of watching my mother age. We are also involved with in-laws decline. In my mom's case it was a few belongings and a ride to an extended care facility as we could no longer care for her Alzheimers bevaviours any longer. We were all suffering, her most of all. She is now at a being of perhaps an 8 month old...needing to be dressed, unable to communicate anything, spitting up pureed food, getting smaller by the day. Many parts of her no longer work...from bowels to eyes....feet to hands. Yesterday, I watched her sense something tickling her nose...a piece of fluff, and she was actually able to reach up and push at it with trembling hand. I couldn't believe it!<br><br>This sounds depressing and dreadful, but it has been a gift of sorts. As I approach 59, after a life of hard physical work and the usual stress overloads, I am conciously living to appreciate every aspect of my life that I can. Every meal is fine and I give thanks. It is a joy when my feet don't hurt with arthritis and I am re-discovering stretching in the morning. The rainy winters that drive people to all-inclusive indulgences as a right and expectation simply take my hand to the shop to build furniture. A meal made from what we grow or catch is a source of pride and joy. A visit by family and friends is a special treat as is the occasional phone call. <br><br>In re-reading this I understand I am trying to describe the evolution of my own philosophy and sense of values. Much of who I am is simply baked in with the recipe, but the word 'deliberate' comes to mind. From that unfolds choice, responsibility, and simplicity. I just saw a big black bear wandering on the gravel bar across the river....looking for dead pink salmon.

As to purpose, perhaps one is to learn to live within the limits of nature, learn when to use our brains to create something and when to let it be. The delusion that we had an unlimited supply of oil is not really different than the extensive hunting of whales for their oil went on just before that.<br><br>There is absolutely no fundamental reason that human beings cannot better themselves through time. One of the distinguishing characteristics of human beings is the ability to know our own history and accumulate knowledge and experience. Lately, I have been paying attention to theories of catastrophism, cometary bombardment and other issues that may have caused such devastation that we lost that accumulation, much like the fall of Rome but on an even greater scale. <br>Two things: intermittent catastrophe and human greed are the only reasons I see that we do not advance, and I do not mean in the way of the modern myth of progress toward endless increase of wealth through extraction.<br>****<br>" the assumption that the only things that really matter are those you can hit with a stick, which is common to most civilizations toward the end of their history."<br><br>Really?! If so, it's a most interesting pattern...<br><br>As to the third method, that is the one I pursue. Sometimes I am struck with a perception that is difficult to describe, but in which I suddenly see this reality around me as incredibly odd! I'm also struck with certain parallels with our so-called waking reality with our dream reality. The times when I begin to lucid dream are when I am tipped off that the dream situation is just too odd or has a recognizable pattern from prior dreams, and so I realize I am dreaming. I believe that there are layers of consciousness, and this waking one is certainly more 'real' than my dreams, but has many similar characteristics. A man difference is that while my dreams seem to be largely the product of my own mind, this waking reality is for the most part a shared dream, and thus we are not the authors of it, and certainly not the sole authors. I think there's a kernel of truth to the idea we create our own reality, but taken at face value it is like telling a water drop that it is creating the ocean.<br><br>Lastly, one does have a greater chance of finding that which one seeks than if one does not seek it, and there is a barrier toward sincere seeking in this culture due to materialism or scientific materialism. Getting glimpses of the deeper reality is more likely if one trains one's mind to be able to think in ways that allow for its perception. I'm not talking about taking on some sort of belief like a religious story, but for example it takes a whole different internalized way of thinking to be able to "see" that perhaps consciousness is the root of reality and not matter.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c3572025592586434766 title="comment permalink">7/24/14, 8:11 AM</a><br><br>

Such an appeal definitively rules out the subscribing to some form of ethical relativism, whether its basis is in the individual, or in some corporate aggregation of individuals that is less than the sum total of all humanity, in all times and all places.<br><br>Second, your appeal to a broadly Platonic perspective on human existence and experience as providing a psychologically healthy basis for living in our times merely reinforces your implicit appeal to the objectivity of morals and values. Plato’s chief concern in elaborating his metaphysical theory of transcendent Forms seems to have been his profound consternation with the relativists of his day, such as the famous Sophist Protagoras (to whom is ascribed the famous relativist epigram that “Man is the measure of all things”).<br><br>Third, I bear witness to the eminently rational and intellectually defensible tenability of the classical Judeo-Christian framework in addressing the sorts of concerns discussed in your post. I make no attempt at an apology for the truth of this framework in the present context; perhaps I will at some point start my own blog to take on the task of doing so in a manner aptly suited to the times in which we live. <br><br>I only declare at this time that I have found the Judeo-Christian standpoint to be robustly defensible, on the basis of having spent fully two decades in subjecting the central claims associated with that framework to the severest forms of skeptical inquiry.<br><br>As a result of all that, I am a Nestorian Christian.<br><br><a href=#c1385694150064066499 title="comment permalink">7/24/14, 8:35 AM</a><br><br>

Animal: be beautiful; soulish man: be good; spiritual person: seek the Grail." - Peladan<br><br>This remark I have long valued came to my recollection this morning in relation to the three paths in your post.<br><br>As I was falling asleep I was thinking of this 'difference of kind' you spoke of concerning the plane preceptable to the well trained Platonist. It reminded me of Bateson's levels of learning. It's been awhile, and my books are all in storage, but I think I recall that the 3rd level (learning to learn to learn) can be simplified as learning to perceive a different world, learning a fundamentally different operational narrative. This seems to me very related to the limited experience I have has through practicing esoteric techniques.<br><br>Once that has happened then perception takes a qualitative change, the worlds one can perceive become contingent, in Bateson's manner of speech the Realm accessed by those tools operates at a different logical type than the worlds of naive experience we live in as a default mode.<br><br>Reflecting, I don't think the codified ethics of a Stoic path would satisfy the itch which is the greatest challenge for me.<br><br>The failing of the stories and tablets I was raised with has made in necessary for me to find new stories to live with. It is most likely better to seek those new stories like a grail, woe upon the one who does not seek but is found! <br><br>In my imagination is a world where Captain Picard awakes to find his life on the Enterprise was a dream and the planet he lives on an ailing world. He joins Avatar Aang, Zarathustra, Berry, A Taoist Sage, Dr. Faust, and Gandolf to explore a toxic jungle helped by Nausicca of Wind Valley; to hide seeds and train guardians, that the most creative discoveries of the dying world might germinate in the world to come; that the lessons one era will suffer for will be available to their greatest grand children.<br><br>Those stories I encounter which acknowledge the limits of progress I can feel their roots delving into me, like slum children speaking a pidgin, I find that pidgin religion is forming in me. This is the most important thing, is how those seeds germinate and what ecosystem they may take part in.<br><br>One cannot serve two masters however without serious cognitive dissidence, and I still live where Man rules, and am indentured to that monster by his Ring of Wealth which moves enforcers for his way across the land he occupies all around. One of my favorite squats is likely to be developed next year :(<br><br>Oh well, my garden thrives, volunteering furthers, my studies progress, meditation is less elusive than it was a year ago, and my stores are sufficient for 6 months of the standard of living I am acclimated to; especially now that the cursed lease which tied me to a ticky tack house is about to expire.<br><br>In truth, seeing people who are beginning to collapse and being nearly powerless to help them is the only part I suffer. The help they ask for is a vanity as they struggle to fight forces that will not budge. <br><br>It is good to be a Beautiful Animal, for it makes one fundamentally healthy, and the Knight seeking the Grail must not forget to enjoy the lute and a cloud, and many flowers, or his spirit will not be nourished enough to endure the sight of horrors which dwell in the waste land.<br><br>@Bill Pulliam<br><br>You have hit Colorado's nail, traveling I see people who think this is the promised land.

It is difficult for me to articulate this, but let me try.<br><br>So there is the modern world, which we all know is at the brink of a reality check. There is the natural world, which the human world is merely a part of, which one can be attuned to by gardening, foraging, being in nature, studying nature. Then there is the "whatever it is" the "brahma" "solid ground of being" "the great whatever beyond human understanding" -- which mystics and shamans have entered but which is hard to describe in words. <br><br>When I was 20 (I am 26 now) I began seeking enlightenment, I was taken under the tutelage of TAT (http://tatfoundation.org/) which is kind of like a mystery school, they advise celibacy, meditation and solitary retreats. I did some of that, but eventually it just didn't feel right. Then I got into permaculture, music, wild food, which gave me practical practices that gave me a better understanding of the world that I could touch, taste and see. There are still times when my longing for the eternal breaches my satisfaction with life, but it is fleeting and there seems like no tangible way to enter it. It seems like the upward path dismisses the body, the natural world, but I find the natural world and the body beautiful and sacred. Do you have any advice for how to reconcile or integrate these seemingly opposing paths?

With accumulated power, with skill of brain and hand, strength of youth, hope, enthusiasm, courage and an adventurous spirit impatient to seek the fortune of the unknown, your careers will be crowned with abundant achievement. I am concerned, however, lest these careers may be from the beginning so self-centered and self-absorbed as to be thrown out of relation to the claims and needs of your fellow-men. Remember that the world's centre of gravity does not fall within the little area of self, but far outside of self in the great human mass of which the individual is an insignificant part. <br>You have not caught the spirit of humanistic culture in your studies here if you go forth from us at this time lacking in human interest and human sympathy. The humanities are not concerned merely with the thoughts of men long dead and gone, but with the living present also, and with the problems of the hour which press upon us with their insistent demand that we stretch forth our hands in the midst of the evil and misery about us, to help and to save. This present age is one of a great awakening as regards the social conscience of man. Indifference to human need is today the unpardonable sin. The world is looking for you, is waiting for you to fall into line with the gathering forces which are making for a better manhood and womanhood.<br>You, enlightened, self-sufficient, self-governed, endowed with gifts above your fellows, the world expects you to add and not to subtract from its store of good, to build up and not tear down, to ennoble and not degrade. It commands you to take your place and to fight your fight in the name of honor and of chivalry, against the powers of organized evil and of commercialized vice, against the poverty, disease and death which follows fast in the wake of sin and ignorance, against all the innumerable forces which are working to destroy the image of God in man, and unleash the passion of the beast. There comes to you from many quarters, from many voices, the call of your kind. It is the human cry of spirits in bondage, of souls in despair, of lives debased and doomed. It is the call of man to his brother. This is your vocation: follow it in the name of God and of man. The time is short, the opportunity great; therefore crowd the hours with the best that is in you."<br><br><a href=#c7549203850352510364 title="comment permalink">7/24/14, 11:48 AM</a><br><br>

Being a student of history, it all clicked for me and made a lot of sense. That is not to say it didn't turn my world upside down, because it certainly did- I was a young twenty something that just graduated college, and I often feel like what I had drummed into me by 20 plus years in the American education system and was suddenly tossed out the window.<br><br>But I was also fortunate, as I was following blogs by you and other peak oil thinkers. I also happened to be reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. Motivated by those words of wisdom, and coming to grips with the reality of our time, I rejected the now usual path of a privileged suburban child (sitting at home in my parents house, sending out resumes everywhere in the vain hope someone would hire me and pay me enough to live the standard American dream life). Instead I took the plunge into organic farming and apprenticed on a small organic vegetable farm an hour north of NYC. <br><br>That feels like ages ago, but I'm still apprenticing and farming here in the Hudson Valley- I now work at a large biodynamic and organic farm, and I help to manage the beef and dairy cow herd. The hours are long and the pay is meager, but I carry the words of the stoics with me. The work is just and good (or at least it seems to me that it is), and it must be done, so I do my best at it. I also find that the Epicurean/Stoic tactic of enjoying the simple things in life to be an immense aid in overcoming the delusions of progress. Nothing brings a smile to my face like watching a newborn calf frolic about on pasture for the first time, or sitting down to a meal with my fellow apprentices, where most of the food on the table was produced here on the farm. <br><br>I still find myself grappling with fear and anxiety over the future, but then I remember the words of Marcus, and I focus on trying to do what is right. Your blog is also an immense help, especially to a young person like me trying to make sense of the times we live in.<br><br>Thanks for all you do, JMG.

There is now contradiction between terrain and map, and that drives people insane. That shotgun meal Bill Pulliam described is very common feature among those blue-collars kicked out of the wagon here in the Europe also. Why would those guys, numbed by their own despair, care about delicate tastes and high-minded opinions of current secular religion? Is not more primordial message or creed something that can resonate better with their wounded egos, rising their self-image? <br><br>It's kind of shame, because I have noticed most upper-middle-class Westerners grossly underestimate comfort level that can be achieved with refitting industrial resources.<br><br>Human creativeness can build relative comfort of living even under the war conditions, which are far worse than economic contraction because other dudes are trying proactively kill and torture you after raping your daughters, instead of just bleeding your finances dry. <br><br>For example, in Bosnia, UN Blue Road bringing supplies was closed from time to time by paramilitaries. Riding there was no party ever, but there was times when it was just cut off totally.Inside cut-off ethnic enclaves people used to float "mini centrales", if they had access to river. They were paddle-wheels made out of wood, barrels and parts from cars and washing machines. The river turned these into paddle-wheel generators, creating small current. The current they gave pulsated and was uneven, but it still was used to power electric devices. It was also common habit for people to retrofit their houses, emptying walls to the brick layer and then putting on plaster, concentrating heat sources and insulation around small area of house. It gave one or two livable rooms, while other rooms were abandoned. Very cheap way to retrofit living space. And food logistics... Oh man. There was gardening, for sure. Also in areas like Goradze people made what can be only called "food quests", making night trips without lights through snow covered mountain ranges to Grabak outpost, getting food back to their enclave. They walked, and they carried food on their backs. It was real do or die-trip, I have understood. Convoys travelling at feet through darkness and snow, while trying to avoid enemy patrols, to bring food back to their families... Finnish band visiting there was so touched by that scene that they made even a song about it. I attach a link to that song to below. Human beings are just so incredible under pressure. It brings the best and the worst out of them. It has been done many times after 90's. Industrial society has unraveled, and some people have survived. Not without scars, both mental and physical, but survived. It is not like technical skills needed for that are hold by some enlightened ecologically thinking minority. Quite the contrary, actually. At least in Eastern Europe most low-income wage earners are capable to supplant their modest wage by foraging, fishing and growing some useful crops.<br><br>So adjusting material demand for unraveling industrial landscape can be done. But ideological and spiritual messages coming as side deal along those adaptations tend to be harsh ones. As situation in world politics is going crazier and crazier, those adaptations are probably a lot harder than they need to be. <br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWdq6TUnS8k<br><br><a href=#c8590108676616060394 title="comment permalink">7/24/14, 12:46 PM</a><br><br>

If more people weren't terrified of experiencing anything their culture tells them not to experience, they'd likely have similar stories to share, for that matter. <br><br>Raven, thanks for the verse!<br><br>Endovelicon, maybe so, but there's more to the Platonic option than the cultivation of wisdom -- or, perhaps, more to the cultivation of wisdom than meets the eye. <br><br>Kutamun, it is indeed a crossroads -- but going down to the crossroads is always a chancy thing; you never know what you'll meet there...<br><br>Sheep, well, Schopenhauer himself was quite the bon vivant, fond of gourmet meals, women, theater, and playing the flute. I find his work highly readable and usefully annoying -- a little philosophical Epicureanism, as distinct from his habitual sort, might have gotten him a less unbalanced notion of what the Will is, and how it might be worked with constructively. (As it was, that development had to wait for Eliphas Levi.)<br><br><a href=#c4798702271618800062 title="comment permalink">7/24/14, 1:33 PM</a><br><br>

We're at a point that responsible scientists are seeing the potential of mankind to end all life forever - no possibility for recovery. But if the end is merely the end of the world (as we know it) there are those of us that aren't impressed. We're not that pleased with the way things are and we're not that happy with the prospect of it continuing in this way forever.<br><br>So, if things fall apart, they can then be rebuilt.<br><br>Inconvenience, pain, even misery are no issues. They are just indicators that something is wrong and pointers in the direction of what needs to be done to rectify the matter.<br><br>There are plenty of people who enjoy periods of inconvenience, pain, and misery - it's called camping. People leave their comfortable homes and head out to the wilds, for what? - why, to see new things! There is so much out there that you have to leave your convenience, pleasure, and security behind to see and experience and there are those of us who think it's all worth while.<br><br>Neophilia is a personality trait that has been studied. One study broke it down into four factors: exploratory excitedness, impulsivity, extravagance, and disordiliness (I would say chaoticness).<br><br>A neophile might, therefore, look forward to the "cold light of a new dawn" with somewhat more enthusiasm because it would offer new possibilities (factor 1) arising from the chaos (factor 2).<br><br>It seems to me that the other character traits that would lead some to a positive assessment of the future might be wildness (instead of domestication), liberality (instead of conservativeness), and connectivity to and a faith in nature that could act as an anchor as society falls apart (instead of the historical dogma that humanity is above and separated from nature).<br><br>Regardless, there are some of us that are watching for the fall with some expectation of good things to come - not cold light, not dismal skies, not interminable pain, hardship, and misery.<br><br><a href=#c8558908888536752146 title="comment permalink">7/24/14, 2:13 PM</a><br><br>

The man spent 25 years combing through many of the ancient biggies both East and West, and found much more interaction than had been noticed during the great expansion of Western Empire in the last 300 years or so. <br><br>A key insight there, in my view, was the similarity between the ancient Orphics and Jains, progenitors in many ways of the original religious traditions both East and West: the acknowledgement of reincarnation (perhaps the embodied person's way of recognizing spirit is one inhabiting many bodies); concepts of karma (another commenter here called it "stickiness"); still, there are differences of course.<br><br>I am endlessly tempted to keep looking further back in the history, toward some original seed "Way" from which we have descended and having done so become so entangled in struggle and conflict.<br><br>It is not the answer, but I began practicing yoga about 10 years ago for health reasons. It did turn into a more spiritual path over time. It is Epicurean: the simple delights of the body remove the needs for so much of the grandiosity and conquest that has made Western culture so powerful and so vapid. Yoga is somewhat stoic: anybody can do it, when bare necessities are met (thus it is a more just way.) <br><br>As I've mentioned before, though I've not experienced disembodied intelligences, I have experienced so many meaningful coincidences in time - that it gives me pause, and perhaps I'll be open to seeing them in the future. I suspect their voices, though eternal, are too quiet compared to the hum-drum we've created for a blink of the cosmic eye. Further study will perhaps help me to know what to look for.

One way of talking about your experience is that you've learned to take life as it is, rather than insisting that it ought to be something else and getting upset because it doesn't listen. <br><br>Onething, I see betterment as the privilege of individuals, not of humanity in the mass, but there are religious issues involved in that assessment which are better discussed in my other blog. <br><br>Nestorian, do you really think that insisting on that point over and over again will somehow make it true? As you know, I don't believe in "an objective and transcendent moral order," and I have no problem whatsoever seeing great value in following a moral code that is inevitably personal and perspectival, not objective or transcendent. I understand that you don't get that, but the broken-record routine really isn't helpful, you know. <br><br>Ing, of course -- you can never be anything but yourself, with all the history and baggage that entails. It's purely a matter of looking at the world each morning and saying, "Okay, what do I do now?"<br><br>Yourmindfire, that's interesting. I may have gotten it from Philip, who's a practicing psychotherapist -- but I recall reading it in a couple of books on the subject of psychology from the 1960s and 1970s. I'll see if I can track it down. <br><br>Lewis, glad to be of help. <br><br>Jcummings, you can't know for a fact what's going to happen seven generations in the future. So? Give it your best shot, and count that as good. <br><br>Rhisiart, I read Campbell's stuff the first time you recommended it, and if I may be frank, I wasn't impressed. If you find his ideas useful, good, but please don't proselytize. No, I don't "need to" study his ideas; I have plenty of teachings and teachers I prefer to work with. <br><br>Yossi, curiously enough, I've written <a href="http://redwheelweiser.com/detail.html?id=9781578634897" rel=nofollow>a book on that very subject</a>. <br><br>Edward, you can spend a good long time studying that book, and you won't run out of things to learn from it. <br><br>Deborah, thank you. I find Tarnas' work insightful, though traditional mundane techniques (as in Ramesay, for example) are more my style!

There are plenty of mystery schools that don't see any point to that approach. You might find <a href="http://redwheelweiser.com/detail.html?id=9781578634897" rel=nofollow>this book of mine</a> of interest in that regard. <br><br>Elle, that's not Stoicism, it's a good old-fashioned sense of honor and responsibility, the sort of thing you don't see much of these days. As a first step on the Stoic path, though, it's not a bad one at all. <br><br>Rebecca, get that lab set up -- you may save a lot of lives. As for Cumberland, Sara and I had a long list of factors, starting with low real estate prices, regular Amtrak service, and a fairly tolerant local culture, and going down from there to such fine details as access to decent tea. Cumberland has most of what we had in mind, very much including the tolerance -- it has an annual drag queen pageant, for example. <br><br>Andrew, thank you! I think Marcus Aurelius would have been pleased to hear about your journey. <br><br>Juhana, of course the spiritual dimension is the hardest of all! Most people can tighten their belts and deal with hard times. It's when you start asking the hard questions about the meaning, value, and purpose of life that people run off in a panic to the nearest source of easy answers, or put a bullet through their heads. Thus the theme of the last year or so of posts here. <br><br>Iuval, there are plenty of human societies that haven't gotten into the empire trip, and plenty of others that have. I expect that in the deindustrial future, that will continue to be the case -- that there will be some empires and some non-imperial states, some eras of war and some of peace, some times of relative freedom and some of injustice and oppression, and so on.<br><br>Tony, thank you and I'll put him on the list of stuff to get to as time permits. <br><br>Wolf, well, when you get what you're asking for, I hope you find that you actually wanted it.

It has to do with the question of why the indigenous peoples (in almost any country) are always regarded to be at the very bottom of the social rung(s). <br><br>I don't say this lightly. I've read and followed, through various means, this topic for some years. Last year, I read that the indigenous peoples of Vietnam (I didn't even know Vietnam HAD indigenous peoples, although I don't know why I thought they wouldn't) are, as usual, widely considered to hold the least desirable social status. Same - even today - in Latin America, and I won't get into America's history &amp; present here.<br><br>It makes me wonder...does it really come down to something as simple as indigenous peoples view themselves as PART of the world, not necessarily higher than any other part, versus the 'modern' world, which sees humans as being at the TOP of the natural world and able (and obligated) to make the natural world serve human's desire to live at the top of the pyramid?<br><br>On one hand, I feel rather stupid for asking this question. It seems obvious. But as I've become more educated on this topic, the depth and breadth of deliberate and prolonged cruelty visited upon native peoples (some of it makes you sick), the lingering attitudes that are still in place today, and the overall denigration of those who once lived "primitive, stone-age" lifestyles, makes me wonder why there has been - and still is - so much energy put into ensuring these people stay marginalized (witness the natives in the Amazon who are currently trying to protect THEIR land from ranchers and loggers). And I wonder if it really all comes down to one world view threatening another world view (the view that humans are part and not dominant), and if that is enough to fuel centuries-long subjection and maltreatment. If so, wow.....what the insistence that humankind IS entitled can result in for those who insist that humankind is NOT entitled is pretty breathtaking. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c3876490685970285334 title="comment permalink">7/25/14, 9:14 AM</a><br><br>

I'm on a survival forum and keep up with several other groups and they're divided about half and half between preppers, who are stocking up supplies for big disasters, and people who just live their day to day lives but educate themselves about how to respond to certain disasters.<br><br>We're pretty sure that economic disaster is immanent. The problem is that something else might happen first. Big news on Yahoo for the last couple of days is that a solar storm barely missed us in 2012 that might have blown out all our technology. The way people are playing around with chaotic processes in nature, I'm not sure if they'll end us by trying to stop tornadic storms in the southeast, clean up an oil spill by letting loose an oil-eating bacteria that takes out all the oil before we're ready, or by taking some artificial means to try to balance the greenhouse effect.<br><br>In brief, we don't know what to prepare for, so, according to Murphy's Law (which, of course is as sure as any law discovered by Newton), the very disaster the preppers aren't expecting and preparing for is the very disaster that will happen.<br><br>Zen (and it's many cousins) is a great idea. We will need cool heads. Bringing back the community is also important. Our libraries, as much as possible, should be in our heads. I have been gathering a huge library of CDs with every topic imaginable but all we need is a big electromagnetic pulse to eliminate that and the computer I would need to play them on. And those of us who wish to survive then will need to maintain their health now. <br><br>And the survivalist philosophy that I often see, that survival is in isolating a group and fighting off anyone who trespasses is a sure way to finish off humanity - we need to rebuild with grace and the appreciation of all life.<br><br><a href=#c1553849472901768827 title="comment permalink">7/25/14, 9:26 AM</a><br><br>

There is so much that I want to write, but at 1:30 a.m., I'd better go to bed instead. Being so steeped in eastern philosophy, I love hearing about the western philosophy that you brought up. Why is it that such fine ways of thinking have been tossed into the garbage can? The younger Japanese, I can see, are doing it too--losing sight of their spiritual basis because of all of the material joys (which never satisfy) around them. It is mostly people in their sixties and seventies I interact with as a Shintoist--people who recall the deprivations of war and post-war Japan.<br>Having been brought up as a Buddhist in Salt Lake City, I was surrounded by people who believed fervently in an apocalypse happening any day in which they would be favored, and they were all for bringing it on. <br>Andrew Lobaczewski (Political Ponerology) brought up Plato as a counterpart to Confucius in the east, who addressed the dark side of human nature in a practical manner, but I've been waiting years for someone who could give me more information.

I know I've harped on this point a few times already, but I feel as though it fits well with what you've stated on a number of posts. This death of progress narrative can be wonderfully circumvented by blame-the-rich ideologies, and particularly the kind proposed by Picketty's "Capital in the 21st Century," an updated schema for the old socialist paradigm.<br><br>And before anyone misinterprets what I'm saying, I'm not mentioning this because I want to defend the level of wealth disparity in this country or the (frankly criminal) acts of certain wealthy oligarchs. Not at all. I just think it's worth noting that the religion of progress has one more ace up its sleeve: "it's THEIR fault." The failure can be construed not so much as the inevitable outcome of hard limits to reality but rather as the consequence of the wealthy robbing us of our wealth.<br><br>Even by official (and horribly manipulated) figures, household income has been flat in the US for forty years. The only "increases" have been the increase in dollar amounts for healthcare coverage, which has been a product of price inflation in healthcare, not rising standards of care. Meanwhile CEOs get paid some 400 times what the low level worker makes (when it used to be something like 35 times), and the wealth gap increases while millions find themselves out of a job.<br><br>There is an easy answer here for such people, which is to make the rich swing from lampposts. I simply do not see us avoiding that stage. My greatest fear is that such a movement could become organized and global, and attempt the sort of worldwide revolution long touted by Marxist political thinkers. Of course, for Communism to ever actually work (even theoretically, and regardless of how immoral the system is), it requires super-abundance, something Engels himself acknowledged.<br><br>I'm of the Thomistic persuasion, but old school Catholics like myself have a great admiration for Plato and neoplatonic thought (it was essentially the Catholic mode of thinking from Augustine to Aquinas, after all, albeit in a Christianized context). I think Aristotlean thought and Catholic mysticism would fall somewhere within both two and three, what with the via media and idealized indifference to outward conditions, so long as one is right with God. I think that provides a real answer to our present predicament, and one that might one day gain a following. <br><br>For now, though, I think we have one heck of a mess to go through with the death throes of progress. Like Kristallnacht levels of mess.<br><br><a href=#c1587513323334049268 title="comment permalink">7/25/14, 10:37 AM</a><br><br>

Seriously though, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/25/extreme-solar-storm-sun-earth?CMP=fb_gu" rel=nofollow>this article in the UK newspaper <i>The Guardian</i></a> described a coronal mass ejection (CME) event that might have brought down the electrical grid, everything that relies on it, and most modern communication systems too, had our planet been in its line of fire.

The fact that it would have happened in 2012 would certainly have added to the temptation to call it just that.

(And, by the way, I am a devout Christian.) Pagans also generally see the importance of seeing nature, not as an enemy to be conquered, but a partner in our attempts to co-survive.

The shortage is triggered not by actual lack of gasoline, but by the police crack down on a network of gas company employees who were stealing the product and selling it in the black market. 21 people has been arrested<br><br>2. Securing 17 tanker trucks as evidence has evidence has cut the local fleet by about 30%. There are no enough resources to move gas from the central facilities to the gas stations.<br><br>3. Union of petrol workers seems to be closing lines and backing up their members. There's push back to prevent emergency measures to contract non union tankers from out town. Drivers are being discouraged from working, claiming "fear to undue detention from part of the police" (imho. not totally unjustified).<br><br>4. Distribution is uneven. Instead of resorting to rationing, Pemex/State Government/whoever has decided to cut off the supply for East side in order to sustain normal supply in West side (here as more often than not in the rest of Northern Hemisphere, East=blue-collar West=white-collar).<br><br>5. Once citizenship figured out this is not something that will go away in "two days" as was promised in the media, a range of non constructive behaviors have kicked in: Hoarding and panic purchases, frantic driving around looking for a gas station with some inventory, organized groups (public transport drivers) coordinating to get access and increase their share.<br><br>6. There have been reports in the news that emergency services - ambulances, "proteccion civil" (Mexican FEMA, sort of), firefighters, police themselves - is having a hard time keeping their vehicles on the road... so it seems a second wave of collateral damage is about to hit during the next hours/days.<br><br>So, it's interesting times again. This time around I have tasked my kids (11 and 6 y.o.) to come up with plans to deal with the crisis.

Can it also be possible to accept loss and sadness and pain as sensations and experiences with value in their own right? It seems to be a common approach in Dark ages for some mystics to embrace philosophies of ascetism, seeking out wilderness, adversity, and hardship as a path towards some deeper relation to the universe. There are certainly extremes, and our culture often looks at ascetism with bewilderment and disapproval, but there can be a certain beauty in suffering and hardship all on its own as a part of the human experience.<br><br><a href=#c1627925738274681760 title="comment permalink">7/25/14, 5:32 PM</a><br><br>

I feel that this mostly acted to intensify my already overwhelming feelings of emptiness that have existed since the crumbling of my worldview in early 2012. It also certainly didn't help that I got to see the state of American medicine much more intimately, with all its thousands-of-dollars-per-dose chemo regimens and medical trials that implicitly promise amazing advances. It turned out they were not even to be able to do a biopsy well enough to extract usable DNA after six attempts, with the exception of one actionable mutation, which turned out to be worse than useless.<br><br>Of course I never really believed the genetically targeted chemo drugs would be likely to help, and I was right: the one she tried based on the mutation was by far the worst of the pharmacopeia she was on at various times. Fortunately she was well-insured and the numbers on the medical bills over the past 16 months were irrelevant pinball scores for all it mattered to us, but if my parents had been uninsured or poorly ensured the medical system would have eaten more than every penny they had.<br><br>Overall I've find the loss of a belief system and the loss of a parent fairly similar in how powerfully they have affected me, although I imagine many of my emotional reactions to the death of my mom are still to come.<br><br>You said that Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus helped you survive losing your only child, which (although not directed at me) may be the first useful piece of advice I've gotten so far.

The ascetics are pretty clearly aligned with the stoic way of seeing the world... Rather what I'm wondering is if there's room there to let yourself feel that sense of loss... To actually embrace the sadness that can come when contemplating the ephemeral nature of all things. I dusted off my copy of Marcus Aurelius's meditations today and reread them. He doesn't leave much room for feeling or emotion... And yet, his musings on the impermanence of all things can inspire a sort of cathartic sadness and that's not the sort of feeling I'd at all want to get rid of. Within a stoic or ascetic approach to life, can there be room for emotion? I think that's closer to the question I was trying to frame earlier.

I don't think you are abdicating responsibility or thinking of yourself as special and, when I was younger, I had some similar yearnings. <br><br>In my 20s and even into my 30s, I wanted to serve a higher purpose, a higher will, for the better good. I couldn't figure out what it was. I believed in a transcendent being/wisdom/intelligence/whatever that could be accessible to those who sought it and from whom specific guidance could be received. <br><br>I still believe that, but largely just on a theological level, and I now see seeking and finding a specific path as being much more nuanced, "fuzzy", unclear, complex, etc. In other words, it ain't as simple as finding the right channel so you can receive your marching orders. <br><br>Part of what changed for me was an experience I had while in deep meditation 15 or so years ago. I was seeking (again), and the message I received back was something along the lines of: "You are given your life so that you may make choices and learn from them. Guidance will be given when necessary, otherwise, carry on." It was followed by a very weird, almost altered state where I felt that the 'usual' choices that we make aren't really important in the universal scheme of things. You know, how hung up we usually each are in finding the right job, right spouse, right place to live, etc. and I had the strongest sense that none of that was what life was really about. It was much more about being conscious that we are just visiting here, and how do you want to spend your time? <br><br>Hard to explain, definitely shifted my view of things. Unfortunately, that altered state only lasted about 24 hours, then I was back to my normal state of mind, but I've never forgotten it.<br><br>Another thing that has helped me on a daily basis is something a very wise minister always emphasized: "Doing your best to be conscious and kind in any given moment IS serving the divine." <br><br>HTH.

I have enough trouble getting through to those who plan on living as long as possible. <br><br>Janet, yes, that's an inevitable part of the rejection of nature. Since we are all, every man, woman and child of us, inseparably part of nature, those who claim to be different from and superior to nature always, without exception, project their own connectedness to nature on someone else and then abuse the target of that projection. It's not just indigenous people, either -- much of the rhetoric of Western misogyny is based on a logic that says "woman = nature, man = reason." As long as people insist that they're separate from nature, such idiocies will follow. <br><br>Wolf, fair enough.

Examples may include terminally ill patients, people who have suffered through chronic severe mental conditions (e.g. schizophrenia) for over a decade with no sign of any remission, people in chronic pain with no hope for a cure, people imprisoned for life or de-facto life terms, etc.<br><br>But from within the perspective of people who are still reasonably able-bodied and able-minded, there are probably a large number of potentially useful paths even in a rather bleak future. I haven't found them yet personally, largely because I've put in some mental work but haven't gotten off the couch to do anything. I'm hoping that I can motivate myself soon and that the despair will eventually end, and I'm looking for ways I might possibly get out of this mess. That's one of the reasons I keep coming back here - it might turn out to be worth it.<br><br>As for the the natural world, I have somewhat good news: an extinction event is happening, but there's no need to worry about the survival of life or nature from a long-run perspective. I've started a grad program in climatology, and the paleoclimate history of the world is really worth studying if you don't know much about it. Combine it with paleontology and you get a good idea of what an extinction event is like. <br><br>It's true that humans are causing an extinction event, but that does not mean that nature is in any danger even though the majority of species we currently have now may well go extinct somewhere in the next 100,000 years, quite possibly sooner. Extinction events are not exactly common but not at all unprecedented, with 5 known major extinctions and about 15 more minor ones in the last 540 million years. They cause temporary devastation but ultimately lead to rapid evolution as adaptive radiation by the descendents of the survivors leads to quick speciation to fill all the empty niches.<br><br><a href=#c3852530632030882446 title="comment permalink">7/25/14, 10:53 PM</a><br><br>

I started the discussion with the trailer for Christopher Nolan's new movie "Interstellar" because I found it striking how brazenly the myth of technological progress was on display. "Man was born on Earth. He was never meant to die here," or some nonsense. <br><br>I know a lot of people who consider themselves fairly open- and critically-minded, and they do their best to listen closely and then talk sensibly. However, when I started discussing how previous civilizations had lost the vast majority of their technology, and suggested that we might be in for a dose of the same, it was clear that we had reached a fundamental disagreement that we weren't going to get past. The response I got was that we may be in for a significant population correction soon, but after we contract by a few billion, those of us that are left will have enough rich energy sources for technological progress to rig up it's miracle cures for our problems. I said that sounded more like religious faith than science and logic, and we more or less had to leave things there. <br><br>Everything we hear about the supposed-viability of business as usual is laced with contradictions people seem unable to confront even when they are stated outright. What you called our fantasies and fears are mixed up in our view of reality to a degree where people literally cannot see what is happening around them. In addition to people who believe they're rational and objective when they're actually blindfolded, you have the deep skepticism of any "faith" that openly acknowledges that there might be more to the world than what we can hit with a stick. Doesn't make me very optimistic about how the majority will attempt to understand the world for a good long while.<br><br><a href=#c2775630813658774664 title="comment permalink">7/26/14, 8:22 AM</a><br><br>

Lately I see more people struggling to remain upright and wanted to offer a few of my day to day strategies against ennui and inertia. During a time of multiple disappointments I looked around for concrete, useful and kind things to do. It is difficult to wallow when you are offering care to someone else. I had the good luck to run across a posting for an aging legally blind typesetter who wanted someone to read to him and answer his correspondence. I also started running. Lately, I make bread and deliver/offer it around the neighborhood.<br><br>In terms of a reading boost, I have returned to the works of Maria Rainer Rilke, particularly his "letters to a young poet" dozens of times in the last twenty years. He was a particularly good antidote to the romance narratives imbedded in my middle class girlhood.<br><br>" I tell you that I have a long way to go before I am - where one begins....you are so young, so before all beginning, and I want to beg you, as much as I can, to be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer. Resolve to be always beginning - to be a beginner!"<br><br>I am not sure if this places Rilke firmly on the third path.

Their job was to better themselves by isolating themselves from sin in the world, and to pray for the good of the world. I'm not so sure if either helped. That's why Francis didn't isolate his order - he figured that they couldn't do much good if they weren't /there/.<br><br>What you're talking about sounds a lot like old age. At 60, I've collected all kinds of aches and pains. Falling off mountains, taking cataclysmic spills while working as a life model and construction worker, and dropping acetylene bottles on my foot continue with me to the present day. Nor does it hurt as badly when a loved one dies. I'm learning to live with pain, both physical and emotional. And that will certainly serve me if and when society collapses.

Aquinas upset the apple cart and changed the mode of thinking. Christianized neoplatonic thought was hugely influential from the post-Nicene Fathers all the way until the 13th century, after which it gradually waned. Any Church historian will tell you the same, as it's quite undisputed. Aquinas (and Albert Magnus before him) were the first in the West to get proper translations of Aristotle from the East and use it to create a new system of thought, the Aristotlean Scholastics.

Western industrial society has never been able to come to grips with this at all. If anything, it's steadily lost ground during those centuries. No one, least of all the people who do it for a living, thinks that we do elder care, end-of-life care, or long-term disability care well.<br><br>One of my sisters, who left medical practice (for reasons that no regular reader here would find surprising) and took up medical ethics, is working on a book (with colleagues and a publisher lined up) about this topic, examining where the abysmal results might be traceable to wrong (but cherished) underlying assumptions. It is based partly on her experiences with our developmentally disabled brother (my twin) and the various people involved in his care over the decades.<br><br>To wit: most care-giving now takes place on a "customer service" model, where the care-giver is expected to adhere to a set of rules for ethical conduct and patient rights, without emotional commitment or emotional claim. Nor is the care-giver expected to derive any benefit from this service, other than market-value compensation for doing the necessary labor.<br><br>Overall, this situation might seem to resemble applied stoicism, where following the ethics and patient-rights rules represents doing what's right at the cost of all else, except that those rules are imposed from outside, like other industrial workplace rules, not from any coherent philosophy or belief system actually held by the care-givers.<br><br>One interesting indicator of the fundamental problem there is to imagine a typical care-giver faced with the idea, however hypothetical, of exchanging places with one of the people they care for. Most would find it horrifying, to the point of being a suitable premise for a horror movie. It doesn't have to be that way, but between the institutional awfulness and the able-server versus needy-served polarity, it's awfully hard to get people to see that.<br><br>While there are plenty of care-givers who feel a higher calling toward that work, in most case they are still expected to toe that very hard line of detachment and polarity between server and served that dehumanizes both. Many of them seem to end up convinced that that really is an appropriate way to carry out that calling, but most still find it less fulfilling than they had hoped.<br><br>The exceptions manage to find better and more rewarding ways, usually by working at least partly outside the established systems, either through family or religious community connections. A balance of all three approaches to getting along with life are in evidence in those cases, but usually with some one of the three emphasized above the others. The divine order can lead or follow, but it always seems to work in somehow. Some people, like the Brothers of Charity (a relatively recent but traditionally poverty-chastity-obedience-pledged Christian order) who run the home my brother lives in most of the time, start out from that perspective. Others, like myself, find it eventually in the negative space of the search for purpose in such efforts, when all the easy answers (the things he'll contribute to society, the genetic legacy he'll carry on) don't apply.<br><br><a href=#c5584999841368238327 title="comment permalink">7/26/14, 5:18 PM</a><br><br>

The Stoic, for example, might resolve to fight to preserve BAU or die trying, the Epicurean might say something like, "You can't live life braced for impact...," and those whose experiences of the divine reality convinces them that the trials of the visible world are irrelevant (admittedly, a small minority) could have a case; who's to say?<br><br>(That's not a confession of my actually being primarily Epicurean in outlook, or complacent. But that is part of the balance I've been looking for. Does anyone else remember that old Lunar Lander computer game where, if you slow down too much too soon, you run out of fuel and free-fall the rest of the way, and if you don't slow down enough soon enough, you build up too much velocity to overcome?

However, in my experience (which I fully recognize is just mine), I found out that finding my destination WAS my destination. In other words, if you don't know what to do, and no 'higher orders' are arriving, perhaps your "assignment" is to figure out what you need to do and who you need to be. In my case, figuring those things out took more than a decade (hardly what you want to hear, I'm sure).

This is surprisingly difficult for me as I have fairly extensive background in New Age thought. In certain ways it seems to me that in many ways New Age spirituality is rather shallow and shoddy compared to older magical traditions.<br><br>The definition for magic you give is: "changing consciousness in accordance with will" <br><br>It appears to me that the philosophies that you shared all have a deeply magical foundation.

I think that they would pop up and every religious tradition.<br><br>One last question: if magic is "changing consciousness in accordance with will" what is the word/practice for "acting in the world in accordance with conscious will"?

The thing I'd point out is that natural disasters, even fairly large ones, happen tolerably often, and people usually dig themselves out and go on with life. It's when a civilization is in deep trouble that any crisis -- for example, a natural disaster -- can push it over the edge once and for all. <br><br>JMG, Lewis is always worth reading, but I was up on the flash traders quite a while ago. I should write something one of these days on the emergence of parasitism as an economic category in failing societies. <br><br>Onething, excellent -- you get today's gold star for a solid historical comparison. You're right, of course, and that happens quite regularly when the rulers of a failing empire try to extend their power further than it will go. The ability to disrupt other power centers does not equal the ability to replace those other power centers...<br><br>Also, I'm very sorry to hear about the loss of your son. That's got to have been shattering. <br><br>NR-Cole, excellent! It's a disorienting experience to step outside a popular mythology once and for all, and see just how bizarre thinking based on the myth actually is. Now of course all our thinking is based on one narrative or another, and so has a certain bizarrerie, but some narratives make more sense of the world we're experiencing than others do. <br><br>Stacey, Rilke was very much part of the third current, and had a first-rate working knowledge of the traditional Western sources of that current. A quote from him is always welcome here. <br><br>Wolf, hoping and wishing aren't going to preserve printing technology -- someone, or more likely a number of someones, are going to have to make it their job to keep it alive and pass it on to others. That may not be your job, but I hope you'll choose something to preserve. As for Pagan Christianity, you're not alone -- there are quite a few people in the Druid scene, for example, who are moving toward that sort of synthesis. <br><br>Chris, "leaving the den" is simply a matter of regular practice of certain common spiritual disciplines -- but that's a subject for my other blog, really. <br><br>Vicky, that depends entirely on what you mean by that much-debated and much-abused word "animism." (The theory that animism was the original religion of our species, by the way, is wholly speculative -- we simply don't know.) <br><br>Alan, a great deal depends on how you define that equally difficult word "fulfillment."<br><br><a href=#c6725776736139809769 title="comment permalink">7/27/14, 9:27 AM</a><br><br>

Your comment about asking caregivers if they could handle switching places, btw, is brilliant -- if not, as you've suggested, there's something profoundly wrong with the care they're giving!<br><br>As for the applicability of the same three philosophical sensibilities to living complacently, yes, you should certainly mention that. Having one or another philosophy doesn't give you privileged access to what's actually happening -- they're ways of responding to your experience of the world. The recognition that industrial society is on its way out history's exit door comes first -- or doesn't -- and philosophy is how you deal with that -- or don't. Philosophy can't give you the recognition. <br><br>Violet, it would take me at least one book's worth of writing to propose an answer to that set of questions! My experience, for what it's worth, is that the New Age equivalent of magic isn't so much shallow and shoddy as crippled by an insufficiently rich sense of the nature of consciousness and its interaction with the objects of its perception. The limitations of the underlying philosophy mean that, first, New Age methods aren't as effective at causing change as more traditional magical approaches, and second -- and much more damaging -- New Age practitioners are taught not to be aware of the limitations of their methods, so have a lot of trouble adjusting to those limits! As for the rest -- well, we'll be getting to most of that over on Well of Galabes. <br><br>Elm, give your descendants a fish and they eat for a day; teach them to fish and they'll eat for a lifetime. Which is to say, I'm far from convinced that passing on a trunk full of stuff is a useful project -- but of course your mileage may vary.<br><br><a href=#c5976344684398844478 title="comment permalink">7/27/14, 9:41 AM</a><br><br>

I was wondering if you could do a post or series of posts on your thoughts on what's adaptive/maladaptive regarding community engagement during times of collapse or extreme social dysfunction. I know you've discussed the importance of fraternal organizations like the Masons and Odd Fellows, disconnecting from pop culture, and the dysfunction on mainstream culture, but I didn't know if you had a coherent theory on what and how to engage with the culture at large that we are immersed in. I tend towards a cloister/detach approach, but maybe this is not the best approach. Do you have clear ideas about what makes you a sitting duck/target vs. a survivor during collapse? What are your thoughts about what should be avoided and what should be cultivated regarding the community at large?<br><br><a href=#c7592330262946712704 title="comment permalink">7/27/14, 9:53 AM</a><br><br>

The main thought that crosses my mind is that 80% of the US population identifies themself as Christian, so I question how deep the "religion of progress" is entrenched as a dominant theme guiding peoples' belief structures.<br><br>What I see predominantly in the alternative blogosphere, amongst those who understand that the economic future we face is catastrophic, is that the reason we are declining is because people are moving away from God and increasingly sinning (even though the statistics don't support this alleged movement away from God). Any mention of peak oil or other resource limits is usually relegated to a sidebar.<br><br>People don't and won't see this inevitable degradation of society as a <i>symptom</i> of resource limits and overpopulation (as all previous empires experienced), because that would force many to accept principles that they have always rejected -- that we are fully supported by and dependent on the natural world and its laws that don't revolve around humanity. <br><br>I don't see how a rational understanding of peak oil and resource limits is going to mean much to anyone as society declines, especially as the inevitable diversionary wars break out. Overpopulation will be the last thing on most people's radar screen, but they will of course be fully focused on its symptoms, laying blame everywhere except where it belongs, and even more fanatically latching on to promises of afterlife redemption as a way out of the miserable reality we have created ourselves as a result of not accepting and acting upon those natural laws.<br><br>Especially since "this time it will be different", as in, much worse than previous empire declines, simply due to the scale of the West's gluttonous excesses, and the fact that we have so totally filled up the planet's productive capacity, and much of that capacity depends on delicate just-in-time efficiencies and fancy technology requiring a highly complex and ordered society in order to be realized -- more so now that at any other time. Furthermore, we have no new energy technology offering up greater opportunities than what the former energy sources did, in contrast to what we enjoyed through most of history.<br><br>Therefore, the drop we can expect between the artificial production gains we enjoy today and the base production that will be supporting us in the future (and that supports all other animals, from which we are no different) will be greater than in any previous instance of civilization decline. Basically, we've climbed higher than ever before, it is almost entirely unsustainable, and therefore the fall will be greater than ever before. Those concerning themselves with the topics discussed here will be a very minor portion of the population, as they are now.<br><br><a href=#c2597540846264316309 title="comment permalink">7/27/14, 3:27 PM</a><br><br>

Nor does it say you have to have any god or religion at all.

Having a philosophical view and spiritual practice which incorporates elements of all 3 schools that you mention, from over 20 years study &amp; practice of various forms of Paganism &amp; magical work and Tibetan Buddhism, in particular Tantra and Dzogchen, has lead to a fundamental re-ordering of my personal world view and how I respond to and deal with what the apparent world presents to me, which is standing me in good stead as we start down the long descent. One of the practices I do includes a commitment to 'go beyond hope and fear' ie not to get sucked into either craving or aversion. Wanting what we can't have and not wanting what we do have are and always have been the cause of suffering. As a practitioner I have the intention to work towards freeing myself and all other sentient beings from suffering.

A more apt comparison would be the difference between teaching someone to fish, or teaching them to fish and also endeavoring to make sure they have the means to make a fishing pole with which to ply the skill in question.<br><br>@ Elm, there's more than one way to fish! You don't necessarily need a pole and bait! 1) There's a variety of fish traps, some portable and some just stakes pounded into the bed of the water course to funnel fish into a holding pen. 2) There are trot lines, a main line stretched across the creek with baited hooks dangling in the water. (Just look out for smart ravens or crows stealing your bait!) 3) Spear fishing and you don't have to dive into the ocean to do that! 4) You can also fish with a bow and arrows!

Traditionally, as people aged, they grew in wisdom, and the aged were revered in kind. So caring for the aged was not a problem, if someone had built up good karma and lived a good life and cultivated relationships with family and community. The wisdom and skill was well worth it to the family or community. Contrast that with today's boomers and silent generation, who have aged, but not matured, who have sold out and neglected their children and grandchildren (spoiling and cultivating dependence can also be considered neglect), and have not cultivated that karma among their family and community. They're depending on their wealth, that fictive paper that JMG has talked about, to maintain their quality of life in old age. They'd better hope that the financial collapse doesn't wipe out their wealth prematurely, or they'll be coming, cap in hand, to those children and grandchildren they sold out, and they'll be coming as aged children themselves, without the wisdom and knowledge previous generations had at their age.<br><br><a href=#c7561272875822636399 title="comment permalink">7/29/14, 4:35 PM</a><br><br>

If it can only give pleasure, however spiritual that pleasure may be, it is of no great consequence or at least of no more consequence than a dozen oysters and a pint of Montrachet. If it is a solace, that is well enough; the world is full of inevitable evils and it is good that man should have some hermitage to which from time to time he may withdraw himself; but not to escape them, rather to gather fresh strength to face them. For art, if it is to be reckoned as one of the great values of life, must teach men humility, tolerance, wisdom and magnanimity. The value of art is not beauty, but right action."<br><br>and I'll leave you with this from Jonathan Saffron Foer:<br><br>"Why didn't I learn to treat everything like it was the last time?

Well, to use just the Jewish tradition, the fourth commandment states in full "Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee" and the prophet Sirach says, "My son, take care of your father when he is old; grieve him not as long as he lives. Even if his mind fail, be considerate of him; revile him not all the days of his life; kindness to a father will not be forgotten, firmly planted against the debt of your sins —a house raised in justice to you." This implies that caring for one's elders is an act of gratitude and of duty, not reverence for their wisdom, which may fail.<br><br><a href=#c6453483573427196303 title="comment permalink">7/30/14, 12:23 PM</a><br><br>

Is there any way from within provisional living to distiguish it from correctly planning ahead? <br>I imagine that one has to laboriously think things out again, and make one's estimation of how hopeful a future we'd best expect, then check this against the provisions one is making for future life. In such long trains of calculation we humans do not excel as individuals, so we tend to check our models of reality and the future against those around us, then toss the unpopular ones. This is what usually passes for a sanity check after an internal logic review (as best we can do this). But this can trap us in bubbles of mutual overoptimism, or overpessimism. Indeed, Ben Goertzel, in his _Chaotic Logic_, argues that, not only do we check, as individuals, for concordance of perception with those around us, but that within our minds, we check for concordance with other parts of our thinking. This leaves us vulnerable to internally-re-inforced misunderstandings of external reality at times, yet such is inevitable, given our need to internally check where something was, to compare with where it is, so that we can detect motion, and to check what we once decided to see if we've changed our minds. (I fear I badly explain the work, and haven't revealed the eloquence of his interesting book on 'paralogic', but maybe you or other readers will be intrigued enough to check it out anyway).<br><br>Brian<br><br><a href=#c993787231716143412 title="comment permalink">8/22/14, 1:07 PM</a><br><br>
