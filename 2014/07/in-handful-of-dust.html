All things considered, it’s a good time to think about how much we can know about the future in advance. A hundred years ago last Saturday, as all my European readers know and a few of my American readers might have heard, a young Bosnian man named Gavrilo Prinzip lunged out of a crowd in Sarajevo and emptied a pistol into the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, who were touring that corner of the ramshackle Austro-Hungarian empire they were expected to inherit in due time. Over the summer months that followed, as a direct result of those gunshots, most of the nations of Europe went to war with one another, and the shockwaves set in motion by that war brought a global order centuries old crashing down. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In one sense, none of this was a surprise. Perceptive observers of the European scene had been aware for decades of the likelihood of a head-on crash between the rising power of Germany and the aging and increasingly fragile British Empire. The decade and a half before war actually broke out had seen an increasingly frantic scramble for military alliances that united longtime rivals Britain and France in a political marriage of convenience with the Russian Empire, in the hope of containing Germany’s growing economic and military might. Every major power poured much of its wealth into armaments, sparking an arms race so rapid that the most powerful warship on the planet in 1906, Britain’s mighty HMS <i>Dreadnought</i>, was hopelessly obsolete when war broke out eight years later. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Inquiring minds could read learned treatises by Halford Mackinder and many other scholars, explaining why conflict between Britain and Germany was inevitable; they could also take in serious fictional treatments of the subject such as George Chesney’s <i>The Battle of Dorking </i>and Saki’s <i>When William Came</i>, or comic versions such as P.G. Wodehouse’s <i>The Swoop!</i>. Though most military thinkers remained stuck in the Napoleonic mode of conflict chronicled in the pages of Karl von Clausewitz’ <i>On War</i>, those observers of the military scene who paid attention to the events of the American Civil War’s closing campaigns might even have been able to sense something of the trench warfare that would dominate the coming war on the western front.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s only fair to remember that a great many prophecies in circulation at that same time turned out to be utterly mistaken. Most of them, however, had a theme in common that regular readers of this blog will find quite familiar: the claim that because of some loudly ballyhooed factor or other, it really was different this time. Thus, for example, plenty of pundits insisted in the popular media that economic globalization had made the world’s economies so interdependent that war between the major powers was no longer possible. Equally, there was no shortage of claims that this or that or the other major technological advance had either rendered war impossible, or guaranteed that a war between the great powers would be over in weeks. Then as now, those who knew their history knew that any claim about the future that begins “It’s different this time” is almost certain to be wrong.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All things considered, it was not exactly difficult in the late spring of 1914, for those who were willing to do so, to peer into the future and see the shadow of a major war between Britain and Germany rising up to meet them. There were, in fact, many people who did just that. To go further and guess how it would happen, though, was quite another matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some people came remarkably close; Bismarck, who was one of the keenest political minds of his time, is said to have commented wearily that the next great European war would probably be set off by some idiotic event in the Balkans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Still, not even Bismarck could have anticipated the cascade of misjudgments and unintended consequences that sent this particular crisis spinning out of control in a way that half a dozen previous crises had not done. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s more, the events that followed the outbreak of war in the summer of 1914 quickly flung themselves off the tracks intended for them by the various political leaders and high commands, and carved out a trajectory of their own that nobody anywhere seems to have anticipated. That the Anglo-French alliance would squander its considerable military and economic superiority by refusing to abandon a bad strategy no matter how utterly it failed or how much it cost; that Russia’s immense armies would prove so feeble under pressure; that Germany would combine military genius and political stupidity in so stunningly self-defeating a fashion; that the United States would turn out to be the wild card in the game, coming down decisively on the Allied side just when the war had begun to turn in Germany’s favor—none of that was predicted, or could have been predicted, by anyone. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nor were the consequences of the war any easier to foresee. On that bright summer day in 1914 when Gavrilo Prinzip burst from the crowd with a pistol in his hand, who could have anticipated the Soviet Union, the Great Depression, the blitzkreig, or the Holocaust? Who would have guessed that the victor in the great struggle between Britain and Germany would turn out to be the United States?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The awareness that Britain and Germany were racing toward a head-on collision did not provide any certain knowledge about how the resulting crash would turn out, or what its consequences would be; all that could be known for sure was that an impact was imminent and the comfortable certainties of the prewar world would not survive the shock. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That dichotomy, between broad patterns that are knowable in advance and specific details that aren’t, is very common in history. It’s possible, for example, that an impartial observer who assessed the state of the Roman Empire in 400 or so could have predicted the collapse of Roman power outside the Eastern Mediterranean littoral. As far as I know, no one did so—the ideological basis of Roman society made the empire’s implosion just as unthinkable then as the end of progress is today—but the possibility was arguably there. Even if an observer had been able to anticipate the overall shape of the Roman and post-Roman future, though, that anticipation wouldn’t have reached as far as the specifics of the collapse, and let’s not even talk about whether our observer might have guessed that the last Emperor of Rome in the west would turn out to be the son of Attila the Hun’s secretary, as in fact he was.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Such reflections are on my mind rather more than usual just now, for reasons that will probably come as no surprise to regular readers of this blog. For a variety of reasons, a few of which I’ll summarize in the paragraphs ahead, I think it’s very possible that the United States and the industrial world in general are near the brink of a convusive era of crisis at least as severe as the one that began in the summer of 1914. It seems very likely to me that in the years immediately ahead, a great many of the comfortable certainties of the last half century or so are going to be thrown overboard once and for all, as waves of drastic political, economic, military, social, and ecological change slam into societies that, despite decades of cogent warnings, have done precisely nothing to prepare for them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I want to review here some of the reasons why I expect an era of crisis to arrive sooner rather than later. One of the most important of those reasons is the twilight of the late (and soon to be loudly lamented) fracking bubble. I’ve noted <a href=../../2013/08/well-and-truly-fracked.html>in previous posts here</a> that the main product of the current fracking industry is neither oil nor gas, but the same sort of dubiously priced financial paper we all got to know and love in the aftermath of last decade’s real estate bubble. These days, the rickety fabric of American finance depends for its survival on a steady flow of hallucinatory wealth, since the production of mere goods and services no longer produces enough profit to support the Brobdingnagian superstructure of the financial industry and its swarm of attendant businesses. These days, too, an increasingly brittle global political order depends for its survival on the pretense that the United States is still the superpower it was decades ago, and all those strident and silly claims that the US is about to morph into a "Saudi America" flush with oil wealth are simply useful evasions that allow the day of reckoning, with its inevitable reshuffling of political and economic status, to be put off a little longer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Unfortunately for all those involved, the geological realities on which the fracking bubble depends are not showing any particular willingness to cooperate. The downgrading of the Monterey Shale not long ago was just the latest piece of writing on the wall: one more sign that we’re scraping the bottom of the oil barrel under the delusion that this proves the barrel is still full. The fact that most of the companies in the fracking industry are paying their bills by running up debt, since their expenses are considerably greater than their earnings, is another sign of trouble that ought to be very familiar to those of us who witnessed the housing bubble’s go through its cycle of boom and bust. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Bubbles are like empires; if you watch one rise, you can be sure that it’s going to fall. What you don’t know, and can’t know, is when and how. That’s a trap that catches plenty of otherwise savvy investors. They see a bubble get under way, recognize it as a bubble, put money into it under the fond illusion that they can anticipate the bust and pull their money out right before the bottom drops out...and then, like everyone else, they get caught flatfooted by the end of the bubble and lose their shirts. That’s one of the great and usually unlearned lessons of finance: when a bubble gets going, it’s the pseudo-smart money that piles into it—the really smart money heads for the hills. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So it’s anyone’s guess when exactly the fracking bubble is going to pop, and even more uncertain how much damage it’s going to do to what remains of the US economy. A good midrange guess might be that it’ll have roughly the same impact that the popping of the housing bubble had in 2008 and 2009, but it could be well to either side of that estimate. Crucially, though, the damage that it does will be landing on an economy that has never really recovered from the 2008-2009 housing crash, in which actual joblessness (as distinct from heavily manipulated unemployment figures) is at historic levels and a very large number of people are scrambling for survival. At this point, another sharp downturn would make things much worse for a great many millions whose prospects aren’t that good to begin with, and that has implications that cross the border from economics into politics. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, the political scene in the United States is primed for an explosion. One of my regular readers—tip of the archdruid’s hat to Andy Brown—is a research anthropologist who recently spent ten weeks traveling around the United States asking people about their opinions and feelings concerning government. What he found was that, straight across geographical, political, and economic dividing lines, everyone he interviewed described the US government as the corrupt sock puppet of wealthy interests. He noted that he couldn’t recall ever encountering so broad a consensus on any political subject, much less one as explosive as this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Recent surveys bear him out. <a href=http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2014/06/19/congress-confidence-gallup-poll/ >Only 7% of Americans</a> feel any significant confidence in Congress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Corresponding figures for the presidency and the Supreme Court are 29% and 30% respectively; fewer than a third of Americans, that is, place much trust in the political institutions whose birth we’ll be celebrating in a few days. This marks a tectonic shift of immense importance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Not that many decades ago, substantial majorities of Americans believed in the essential goodness of the institutions that governed their country. Even those who condemned the individuals running those institutions—and of course that’s always been one of our national sports—routinely phrased those condemnations in terms reflecting a basic faith in the institutions themselves, and in the American experiment as a whole. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those days are evidently over. The collapse of legitimacy currently under way in the United States is a familiar sight to students of history, who can point to dozens of comparable examples; each of these was followed, after no very long delay, by the collapse of the system of government whose legitimacy in the eyes of its people had gone missing in action. Those of my readers who are curious about such things might find it educational to read a good history of the French or the Russian revolutions, the collapse of the Weimar Republic or the Soviet Union, or any of the other implosions of political authority that have littered the last few centuries with rubble: when a system loses legitimacy in the eyes of the people it claims to lead, the end of that system is on its way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The mechanics behind the collapse are worth a glance as well. Whether or not political power derives from the consent of the governed, as American political theory insists, it’s unarguably true that political power depends from moment to moment on the consent of the people who do the day-to-day work of governing:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the soldiers, police officers, bureaucrats and clerks whose job is is to see to it that orders from the leadership get carried out. Their obedience is the linchpin on which the survival of a regime rests, and it’s usually also the fault line along which regimes shatter, because these low-ranking and poorly paid functionaries aren’t members of the elite. They’re ordinary working joes and janes, subject to the same cultural pressures as their neighbors, and they generally stop believing in the system they serve about the same time as their neighbors do. That doesn’t stop them from serving it, but it does very reliably make them unwilling to lay down their lives in its defense, and if a viable alternative emerges, they’re rarely slow to jump ship. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here in America, as a result of the processes just surveyed, we’ve got a society facing a well-known pattern of terminal crisis, with a gridlocked political system that’s lost its legitimacy in the eyes of the people it governs, coupled with a baroque and dysfunctional economic system lurching toward another cyclical collapse under the weight of its own hopelessly inefficient management of wealth. This is not a recipe for a comfortable future. The situation has become dire enough that some of the wealthiest beneficiaries of the system—usually the last people to notice what’s happening, until the mob armed with torches and pitchforks shows up at their mansion’s front door—have belatedly noticed that <a href=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/the-pitchforks-are-coming-for-us-plutocrats-108014.html>robbing the rest of society blind is not a habit with a long shelf life</a>, and have begun to suggest that if the rich don’t fancy the thought of dangling from lampposts, they might want to consider a change in approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In its own way, this recognition is a promising sign. Similar realizations some seventy years ago put Franklin Roosevelt in the White House and spared the United States the hard choice between civil war and authoritarian rule that so many other countries were facing just then.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unless a great many more members of our kleptocratic upper class experience the same sort of wake-up call in a hurry, though, the result this time is likely to be far too little and much too late. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here again, though, a recognition that some kind of crash is coming doesn’t amount to foreknowledge of when it’s going to hit, how it’s going to play out, or what the results will be. If the implosion of the fracking bubble leads to one more round of bailouts for the rich and cutbacks for the poor, we could see the inner cities explode as they did in the long hot summers of the 1960s, setting off the insurgency that was so narrowly avoided in those years, and plunging the nation into a long nightmare of roadside bombs, guerrilla raids, government reprisals, and random drone strikes. If a talented demagogue shows up in the right place and time, we might instead see
<a href=../../2014/02/fascism-and-future-part-three-weimar.html>the rise of a neofascist movement</a> that would feed on the abandoned center of American politics and replace the rusted scraps of America’s democratic institutions with a shiny new dictatorship. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If the federal government’s gridlock stiffens any further toward rigor mortis, for that matter, we could see the states force a constitutional convention that could completely rewrite the terms of our national life, or simply dissolve the Union and allow new regional nations to take shape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Alternatively, if a great many factors break the right way, and enough people in and out of the corridors of power take the realities of our predicament seriously and unexpectedly grow some gonads—either kind, take your pick—we might just be able to stumble through the crisis years into an era of national retrenchment and reassessment, in which many of the bad habits picked up during America’s century of empire get chucked in history’s compost bin, and some of the ideals that helped inspire this country get a little more attention for a while. That may not be a likely outcome, but I think it’s still barely possible. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All we can do is wait and see what happens, or try to take action in the clear awareness that we can’t know what effects our actions will have. Thinking about that predicament, I find myself remembering lines from the bleak and brilliant poetic testament of the generation that came of age in the aftermath of those gunshots in Sarajevo, T.S. Eliot’s <i>The Waste Land</i>: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And the dry stone no sound of water. Only</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There is shadow under this red rock</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And I will show you something different from either</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Your shadow at morning striding behind you</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Or your shadow at evening rising up to meet you:</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I will show you fear in a handful of dust. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br>
It’s a crisp metaphor for the challenges of our time, as it was of those in the time about which Eliot wrote. For that matter, the quest to see something other than our own shadows projected forward on the future or backward onto the past has a broader significance for the project of this blog. With next week’s post, I plan on taking that quest a step further. The handful of dust I intend to offer my readers for their contemplation is the broader trajectory of which the impending crisis of the United States is one detail: the descent of industrial civilization over the next few centuries into a deindustrial dark age. </div>

The biggest wildcard here, IMHO, is the media. Because of the media, most Americans don't know our neighbors; we spend our evenings watching our own little screens when our grandparents would have been visiting. I don't know what effect to predict for that; will we all stay apolitical because all politics is local and we can't really act locally anymore? Will corporate dominance of the airwaves keep us quiescent while it falls apart around us? Will enough of us latch onto some media-savvy figurehead who gets into the system and dismantles it from the inside? The one guess I can make is that none of the candidates will burn well enough to replace our diminishing fossil fuel reserves.<br><br><a href=#c7048305540217836276 title="comment permalink">7/2/14, 5:51 PM</a><br><br>

And thank you even more for another thought-provoking essay. <br><br>I'd like to think that Americans will wake up and reclaim - or repurpose - government's potentially very useful toolkit for dealing with problems. But that hope was dimmed again this week by the Supreme Court's latest ruling that the religious qualms of corporations (!) trump our right as a democracy to make public health laws. It follows their other famous ruling that showering money onto elected officials is not corruption, but actually free speech, protected by the Constitution and so beyond our right to interfere with. They are barely trying to disguise the campaign to remove the levers of power from the general population and bring the pretense of populist government to a close.<br><br>I'm not sure whether regular Americans, if they could shape policies, would still have the genius to deal constructively with the problems coming down the pipeline, but I'm certain that a country dominated by a defensive and un-legitimized oligarchy - deeply entrenched in a failing status quo - is a recipe for failure.<br><br><a href=#c8472332678515507585 title="comment permalink">7/2/14, 6:13 PM</a><br><br>

These days though, government workers often make more than their private sector counterparts, are nearly impossible to fire if they don’t do their jobs and have generous retirement benefits and pensions at a time when more and more Americans have seen their pensions go up in smoke and many work in jobs which give them little opportunity to amass a nest egg for retirement. Many on the right complain that a lot of this is due to the unionization of government agencies and the fact that in many cases, the unions that donated huge sums of money to political campaigns are the same ones sitting across the table “negotiating” with the politicians whose campaigns they bankrolled. Conflict of interest, anyone? In many states and cities, public employees unions like the AFSCME and NEA are the single largest source of campaign funds, and like all big time donors, they expect a return on their investment. This helps further fuel the perception that the government is indeed the corrupt sock puppet of wealthy special interest groups.<br><br>Moreover, in many cases, these compensation and pension costs are eating local and state governments alive. They played a major role in municipal bankruptcies like Detroit, Michigan and Stockton, California while attempts by state governments to rein in labor costs have provoked major political food fights in places like Wisconsin and Illinois. Efforts by state and local governments to cover their pension liabilities via the stock and bond markets have been a major factor in fueling the financial bubbles over the last couples of decades. One of the reasons why the bond rating system became so corrupt is that by law, government pension systems can only invest in AAA rated bonds. With so much government pension fund money sloshing around and looking for large returns on investment (many government pension funds need annual returns in the 8 to 10 percent range just to meet their obligations and stay above water), this created a lot of pressure for ratings agencies and investment banking firms to relax their standards and look the other way, which was one of the reasons why we saw so many junk grade bonds falsely rated as Triple A.<br><br>And even the modest attempts by the Obama administration to curb the explosive growth of military pay and benefits over the last decade or so has run into a brick wall due to lobbying by veterans groups, even though compensation costs for the military have gone through the roof since 9/11 (on average, military pay and benefits per service member has nearly doubled since 2001) and military leaders complain this is cutting into other vital needs.<br><br>On the flip side, this trend and your observation about the need of the political elites to maintain the allegiance of their functionaries reminded me of something I read a while back. A retired CIA agent once said that he predicted the fall of the Shah of Iran years before it happened and long before the US political and intelligence establishment realized how vulnerable he really was. How was this lone CIA agent able to predict the Shah’s overthrow so much earlier then his peers? The answer was that he had noticed in the mid 1970's that salaries for military and police officers had doubled in only a few years. He concluded that the Shah knew he was in trouble and was attempting to buy the loyalty of those who kept him in power. One wonders if we are seeing a similar dynamic working out in the US. If that is in fact the case, hold onto your hats ladies and gentlemen…<br><br><a href=#c3988067033827367664 title="comment permalink">7/2/14, 7:45 PM</a><br><br>

On a more serious note, I read a history of World War I back in 2000 to get an idea of what really happened. What struck me as I paged my way through the book was that it was error after miscalculation after mistake, all the way up to the end, when the war ended, not because of military defeat so much as exhaustion and collapse, first on the part of Russia and then Germany. To this day, my impression of the war was "what a tragic screw-up by everyone involved." The story would be funny if it weren't so bloody and wasteful.<br><br>As for the denouement of the Great War, "Who would have guessed that the victor in the great struggle between Britain and Germany would turn out to be the United States?"--that might have been foreseen if people had been paying attention to the GDPs of the major powers. By 1914, the U.S. and Germany were the top two, with the U.K. in third. Also, there had been historical precedents for another power sneaking in when the top two got into a contest for world domination. Spain and Portugal were the top two countries in the first world system from 1500 to 1600. Nominally, Spain won by absorbing Portugal from 1580 to 1640, but the actual winner was the Netherlands, who ended up the dominant world power until the late 1600s, when they got into a fight with Hapsburg Spain. Again, both lost and England took over the top position among world powers, ironically when the English monarch was Dutch. So, the U.S. taking over as the hegemon should have come as no surprise. Unfortunately, the U.S. didn't accept world leadership until World War II broke out. That was one last tragic mistake on our part in the aftermath of all the rest.<br><br>Finally, the prediction that we are in the midst of a "convulsive period of crisis" is not a new one. I am a fan of Strauss and Howe's "Generations" and "The Fourth Turning." Those two authors predicted a "Crisis of 2020" that could start as early as the middle of the first decade of the 21st Century back in 1991. Everything will be swept up in the whirlwind of the 20-year-long crisis period and completely reshuffled, just as it had during the Great Depression and World War II and in the U.S., as it had during the Civil War and Reconstruction. However, they didn't include peak resources in their analysis, just the responses of people to events. From the perspective of their readers, the only way to tell the difference between their view of things and yours regarding this crisis is what things look like afterwards. If things consolidate and improve after 2020, at least for the next 40 years, then Strauss and Howe will be vindicated. If the crisis ends and things decline, then you'll be right. Of course, both of you could be right in your own ways. I wonder what that future would look like?<br><br><a href=#c4779165031777750809 title="comment permalink">7/2/14, 7:59 PM</a><br><br>

That may not be a likely outcome, but I think it’s still barely possible."<br><br>I'm one of a group of people out of power who are trying to "take the realities of our predicament seriously and unexpectedly grow some gonads." I'm a director of the Coffee Party, a transpartisan and inclusive response to the Tea Party Movement. Our main issue is counteracting the corrosive effect of (big) money in politics, which we see as the force that is compelling the two major parties to cater to the wealthy elite and not the masses, where the neglected center you mentioned before resides. However, the ill effects of money in politics, such as income inequality, are also our concern. I posted the link to the Politico article by Hanauer in which he told the weathiest Americans that he looked into the future and saw pitchforks to the Coffee Party's Facebook page. That hit a nerve, with more people viewing, liking, and sharing the link than any other posted to the page that week. Clearly, there is an audience for that kind of thinking.<br><br>Here's to hoping I get the rest of the Coffee Party leadership on board with facing the realities of our current situation and getting the organization in a position to influence others to get the results you and I both desire.<br><br>http://www.coffeepartyusa.com/<br><br><a href=#c7883476568900249575 title="comment permalink">7/2/14, 8:10 PM</a><br><br>

Scapegoating government employees is a very old tradition. And there is an ongoing, long-term mass replacement of government workers with private contractors, who have no loyalty and usually wind up costing more to produce less (at least that is what the private consulting firm hired in Tennessee found when asked to look for inefficiencies in the state government). Oh, and that same analysis also found that state salaries were generally below the private sector for comparable positions in many departments. The new fresh-from-the-private-sector governor was hoping to be told that there were lots of reductions that could be made; instead he was told that the state workforce was understaffed and underpaid. <br><br>JMG, MawKernewek -- I'm not sure that the increase in US interest in the World Cup reflects much more than the fact that the US team has become more competitive.

The best way to get in contact for an interview is to put through a comment marked "not for posting" with your email address -- I'll follow up promptly. <br><br>Kutamun, if you make economic decisions by throwing darts at a dartboard, I nominate you for Fed Chairman on the spot; you have at least random odds of making the right choice, which is better than any recent Fed chairman has been able to manage! <br><br>Bill, of course that could be it. I was delighted to hear that Ann Coulter apparently denounced US fans of the World Cup, though -- an endorsement like that can't hurt!<br><br>Compound F, it was more complex than that. The Austro-Hungarian empire used the assassination as an excuse to invade Serbia, which it had wanted to do for a while; Serbia was a Russian ally, and that dragged Russia in; Germany was Austria's ally; France was Russia's ally; the German armies heading toward France took the easy way, through Belgium, and Britain was Belgium's ally. Since all those alliances were there to keep anybody from getting an overwhelming position of strength in Europe, nobody dared let the other side get away with stomping its allies -- well, except for Italy, which was allied with Austria and Germany but decided it would rather steal some territory from Austria, so switched sides. <br><br>So very quickly you had every major power in Europe panicking and going to war to keep someone else from getting the upper hand. Did the Berlin to Baghdad Express have a role in it? Yes, among many other things. The whole continent was a powderkeg by 1914, and it just happened to be Gavrilo Prinzep who tossed a lit cigarette the wrong way. <br><br>Mark, yes, they're making exactly the same mistake the French aristocracy made before the French Revolution. It's never occurred to most of America's wealthy that without government shilling for them, they're toast.

Perhaps next year I can make it. Instead, I ended up on a cross country move to Harrisonburg, Virginia. It seems to the type of valley town posed to fare better than others (Drought stricken west and Midwest) in our current trajectory. While I have yet to use my somewhat useless college degree in environmental science and chemistry, I found a job doing construction work for a company claiming to do sustainable and “green” business. This just means is they sometimes do solar hot water, solar panels and weatherization with a few fancy accolades. Permaculture and organic foods are much more prevalent here in Oklahoma, which is nice. My main concern is that the economy here is hugely dependent upon the colleges here, once that revenue runs dry I think the town will go down with it. There is an interesting dichotomy going on where the downtown in reviving and people wanting to live in a walkable area, where at the same time most the new businesses are located in the big box store area where everything looks significantly newer but not more durable. There is a dual local and corporate economy going on. <br>My wife and I are getting very accustomed to enjoying the simple pleasures and we accept we are going to do with much less in the future and enjoy it. What would have been an affordable honeymoon trip to Greece in the 1960-70’s, for us is a regional trip to Elkmont in the Great Smokey Mountains National Park to see the synchronized fireflies in June. Having passed through all the stage of grief it is much easier to see the middle ground path between the skewed ends of progress porn and zombie apocalypses. My plan is to further try to edge my way into agriculture and forestry and tap my livelihood into those daily energy flows of sunlight, which seems to be the only income that will be stable in the long haul. I’ve also been thinking of how to tap into the salvage economy, but I am not sure the economics of it make sense, yet. My own actions and thinking are partly the result of reading everything in your books and going, “well yep, that makes perfect sense, he’s right, what of it now?”<br> In this area in Appalachia I think we are a few economic crisis away from being stripped of the superfluous economy, via financial/debt issues. Next will be a corporate feudalism where the few large businesses with local roots in agriculture food, mining, energy ect, will control the fate of most of the people. There will be plenty of jobs and plenty of people to work them, but these will not be jobs I think anyone wants. These will be menial backbreaking jobs replacing rusting hulks of machinery with more and more human labor. Once the labor exploitation by these big businesses reaches a breaking point, that’s when a group of men with a charismatic leader break out the guns and decide to make changes. Next thing you know it is regular ole feudalism in practice, but with a different explicit name probably Sheriff BigMan and his thugs.

They were both patriots. The elder signed up with his mates in the "Grimsby Chums" aged 18 within a month of war breaking out. Sixty per cent of his unit were killed. The younger one biked 40 miles to sign up when he was 15, as the local unit unit would not take him till he was 16.<br><br>They grew up in a period when there were no wars (both too young to remember the Boer War)and British Empire exceptionalism was at its height. <br><br>Hopefully the failing Iraq and Afghan adventures have immunised much of our youth against overseas military involvement today.

Britain is increasingly less martial, our army is at an all time low. Weapons are not available here and I suspect the government would hate to have to arm the population up.

His latest article is here: http://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2014/07/02/What-is-Missing-from-Fracking-Debate/<br>The comments are entertaining reading as well, from a "they'll think of something" perspective.<br><br>He also wrote a great book entitled "Energy of Slaves" which details our addiction to fossil fuels.<br><br>My actual purpose in writing is more selfish than sharing an interesting author. In fact I just need to type this all out for my own benefit. <br><br>I cannot be surprised that society as a whole, governments with wealthy donors and tax receipts etc are able to ignore the growing evidence in front of them that business as usual is not a good long term strategy. What I struggle with is my own capacity to ignore the evidence and get sucked back in when it's convenient. There is a gap between what I know intellectually that I should be doing and what I actually do day to day. The easy choice is remarkably hard to refuse at times, yet the easy choice (drive rather than bike, eat out rather than cook in, buy new instead of repair old, YouTube vs a good book) is usually far worse for me and for the planet. It is each of these daily little decisions, multiplied by a few billion (depending on what part of the planet one lives on of course, first world problems being what they are) that are really moving us even faster further down into "history's compost bin".<br><br>I think this was in part why you wrote Green Wizardry (which I own and have read but not implemented as you might have guessed). I know from experience that nothing changes overnight and that change goes in stages. My entry point into environmental issues was studying transportation engineering, which turned into advocating for better public transit for students, and one day later getting my bike out of storage and riding to work for the first time. Out of all of that I started looking into more issues surrounding fossil fuels, GHGs, environmental issues, and eventually found this site. And I have continued on from here as well to find more interesting ideas. Changing the behaviours like cycling to work instead of driving prove more difficult than reading or talking about the ideas. I guess I am frustrated that the change I made in my transportation choices proved so much easier than some of the other changes that should follow, like food, consumption, energy use etc. I think of it as being the difference between being a "fanboy" and being a serious devotee to something of great importance. But it would be wise for me to start since I am a specialized "knowledge economy" worker and that sort of career is not very resilient in the face of difficult times.<br><br><a href=#c7006504436922123146 title="comment permalink">7/3/14, 6:20 AM</a><br><br>

There's really nobody left there that's able to say "stop" or "knock it off". If you don't have any negative feedback loops in the system, it's only a matter of time before it blows up or goes insane.<br><br>I think it would be a good idea, if people want to rebuild these trading type markets, not to put a bunch of regs on them, but to try to build in natural ways for people to make money by participating in negative feedback loops. I mean, at its essence, it's just a game, and the rules can be changed. Perhaps a game designer should be put in charge of the economy, to make something more fun and balanced to play?<br><br>At least in the political world you have entities like "russia" or "china" that do have the ability to say "knock it off" or "stop". It does come with a lot of whiny drama when they do so, but at least there's a negative feedback loop.<br><br>As far as where we go from here, Germany -&gt; China, Britain -&gt; Murica. And if history repeats neither will do that well. I guess we need to look for some neutral-ish power that everyone gets along with, if they don't outright like and is a bit opportunistic. Korea seems to be one of those, for instance. Nobody really thinks Korea is evil. Maybe Russia?

That one was amplified many fold by all the weird derivatives. I know there is some of that going on now, but I haven't gotten the impression that the house of cards has been built up quite so high in this case. <br><br>There's also the direct impact upon the citizenry. The housing bubble put people out of their houses, or stranded them in underwater properties that can't be sold. And it ate a huge chunk of retirement savings of people who had been stupid enough to put all their retirement in the stock market. The fracking bust will push energy prices up. Given our ridiculously extravagant energy use in the U.S., we have a whole lot of room to adjust to this even in the short term -- thermostats, carpools, cancelled vacations, buying less crap and buying it closer to home. These are not at the same level as a home foreclosure and eviction. And people are not as heavily exposed to the stock market as they used to be either. <br><br>There is the overall lower state of the economy now to contend with. We've been in a contacting economy in the U.S. since the 1990s, and only a lot of creative accounting involved in the way goods and services are valued has hidden this from view. But people have been adjusting their lifestyles to contraction for over a decade.

I feel obligated to say, my experiences make me side with Mssrs Roboto and Pullman rather than Enrique. If Washington is trying to make a loyal cadre of viziers out of today's government bureaucracies, let me assure you they're going about it rather wrongly.<br><br>Most of the employees are still smarting from Obama's Executive Order, in spring 2010, where he unilaterally froze all Federal raises. This came out of the blue and was done without any consultation with these mythical "Federal Employee Unions" (don't even get me started about what puffball organizations those are). We took it as pretty much a slap in the face; clearly we were just a bargaining chip as Obama responded to an ersatz budget deadline crisis that the other party just ginned up out of nothing. It was clear to us that Obama bought into all the talk-radio narratives about lazy overpaid Federal workers rather than defending us. The freeze only ended this year, with a 1% raise, and just think about the "real" inflation rate over those four years, as opposed to the 2% that government propagandists claim. I suppose private-sector employees (of which I am one now) won't be terribly sympathetic, of course; most private employees haven't seen a raise more than 1-2% since maybe the '80s.<br><br>In the next two ersatz budget deadline crises, government shutdown was threatened, and then achieved -- (as I'm sure will occur again at least once or twice before the uprising JMG predicts) -- and a surprising amount of acrimony, sniping, and internecine competition occurred between agencies, between departments, and individual employees, as everyone with bills and a family struggled desperately to avoid being "furloughed" by getting onto the Critical Services list. Clearly government employees don't have any more saved wealth than average Americans, who spend their lives about 2 paychecks away from total destitution, or else they would have smiled and accepted the extra "vacation" instead. <br><br>I quit the Army Corps a couple of years ago. Believe it or not, it was among the most stressful jobs I've ever had. The USACE regulates all water resource projects in the U.S., but it was certainly not sitting on my butt dreaming up new ways to interfere with honest businessmen, as most people imagine. We were constantly being asked to complete huge public/private partnership projects in ridiculously short deadlines with slashed budgets and personnel. And yet there was pretty much infinite budget anytime we wanted to contract something out to a private company instead, so there was constant pressure to outsource. Whenever I dealt with some other government agency, such as the E.P.A., the story was exactly the same. The U.S. government is basically just a shell these days, of a handful of contract managers overseeing private mercenary companies, in all fields such as Engineering, biology, and so forth. <br><br>I don't have any personal experience at the State or Municipality level, but I have read a lot about those pensions being completely cut, reneging on agreements made decades ago. There are numerous individual examples of agency heads with golden parachutes, but these stories typically uncover graft and corrupt deals those individual heads appropriated for themselves in violation of policy; that is not the policy for rank-and-file employees. My own particular experience is that the narrative you hear on Fox News or talk radio, about how Federal employees recline on couches and get paid like kings just to screw with citizens and businessmen's livelihoods -- in my experience that's 100% false. When I hear that from somebody who is not making money off that narrative via the media, it is typically promulgated by people who don't actually know any government workers personally.<br><br><a href=#c5456024835984651579 title="comment permalink">7/3/14, 9:39 AM</a><br><br>

At the beginning, the war didn't look like the kind of event that was going to rewrite maps, bring an empire to the brink of collapse, and introduce the world to violence on a scale that wouldn't have even been physically possible a few years before.<br><br><br>It's amazing how the events that rewrite maps, unravel empires and snap the threads of cultural continuity look so similar to the sorts of crises that mark business as usual. I remember how a little over a decade ago everyone thought the collapse of the World Trade Center was going to set of a world war on par with the ones of the previous century. Instead it led to tighter airport regulations and another wave of the same sorts of skirmishes in the Middle East we've been seeing since the 1970s. I imagine that the event that throws us into the next wave of crisis won't even be on the front pages of the newspapers.<br><br><br>And the same is true of the events that bring down whole civilizations. I expect that to the ancient Romans, the first wave of Gothic refugees pouring into the empire in the 370s was fodder for conversations on the street about immigration and border policies and the Huns they were fleeing from were just another group of barbarians to be tamed. On the surface, the beginning of the gothic wars looked no different from any of the other crises of the last few centuries. The empire had survived in tact through border skirmishes, civil wars, a demographic shift in religions, and so many assassinated emperors they barely paid attention anymore.<br><br><br>And yet, just a few decades later, the Roman religion and much of its cultural legacy would be eradicated in a violent purge, and the entire Western empire dismantled and transformed into Feudal Europe. After 3 centuries of decline, Western classical civilization finally came crashing down over less than 20 years. It's only in hindsight that you can tell the events that wear down the threads of civilizations and empire from the ones that break them.<br><br><a href=#c1011803436520985386 title="comment permalink">7/3/14, 10:33 AM</a><br><br>

And it seems that's my realization for the week. You can't live life braced for impact. Personal resilience can't be entirely driven by trepidation. It can't be just another thing on the long list of responsible-minded chores you're supposed to do to protect yourself and your loved ones against adversity, like cleaning your chimney and getting regular doctor-recommended colonoscopies.<br><br>Not only is it unappealing if presented that way, inviting "maybe it won't happen" refusal, it's fundamentally the wrong way to think of it. That's the prepper delusion of being able to keep all possible adversity at bay. Personal resilience has to be, at its core, a strategy of mindful enjoyment of life-as-it-is. Accepting risks and losses has to be part of it. Not so much bracing for impact, as being prepared to dance through the debris. Or if it comes to that, and you end up in the trenches going over the top at dawn, to dance on your own grave.<br><br><a href=#c2141650854110519017 title="comment permalink">7/3/14, 12:20 PM</a><br><br>

I don't have any significant on-the-ground experience of the British political system, but my sense is that, feckless as your current leaders are, they're a good deal less so than ours. <br><br>Raven, heck of a good question.

I don't know of an easy answer for that, other than finding things that you like to do anyway, and focusing on those first. <br><br>Bear, it might be Russia; it might be Brazil; it might be any of a half dozen other second-string powers that haven't yet made a move toward global-power status. We'll see. <br><br>Unknown, for that matter, I've written <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/G/Green-Wizardry rel=nofollow>a book on the subject of what to do</a> -- might be worth a look!<br><br>Thrig, yeah, that sounds like the Fourth in Seattle. It's much less fractious in some other parts of the country, fortunately. <br><br>Bill, I don't think the end of the fracking bubble is going to impact as many people directly as the end of the housing bubble did. The impact I consider likely is indirect -- depending on how deeply Wall Street and the financial industry generally has come to depend on fracking as a source of hallucinatory wealth, there might be hefty knock-on effects via interest rates, debt defaults, etc. <br><br>Thomas, thanks for the news from the front lines. Do you happen to know if Army employees in the combat end of things are being treated the same way? <br><br>Cheesemoose, it's certainly possible that events in the Middle East could provide the trigger, but it's also possible that things could spin out of control in some other way, triggered by something else. That's the thing with decaying empires -- if one thing doesn't bring them down, something else will. <br><br>Nate, I don't see any way the US is going to remain a single country indefinitely; the question is purely how soon the breakup will happen, and by what means. <br><br>Eric, exactly! You get today's gold star for paying attention to the way that history looks when it's happening. <br><br>Neo, it's probably the least violent way things could go. That's why I used it as the endgame of my "How It Could Happen" series in 2012, and the forthcoming novel <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> -- that's gone to the publisher now, btw. <br><br>Myriad, thank you!

The elite troops -- (the Special Forces, the tech geeks like drone guys, the SIGINT people) -- and the civilian contractors, generally speaking, seem to be well-equipped and well-supported, with little real accountability to their success or failure. Everybody says, that's the future of warfare of course, so those are our BOYS!!! The regular infantry, as distinct from the civilian employees, it seems to vary a lot. A small minority of those units are scraping by, sewing their own torn uniforms, tours extended past the breaking point, problems with drug use and suicides. And every shade in-between. I have not detected any real pattern to that (based on theater of combat, nor race/regional origin of the troops), it seems more like, does your unit's leadership fight for your needs back in Washington.

One thing I kept running into was how similar conditions were before those insurgencies started to what is currently going on in the US. <br>Out of touch elite, check; militarization and abuse of police powers, check; fragmentation of social narrative, check; appearance of counter narratives, check; increase in strength of black market networks that move drugs and weapons, check; increasing loss of funding local constabulary, check; fragmentation of elite, check. The list goes on like that. Out of curiosity I did a more detailed analysis of conditions and modeled a few scenarios. The results were frightening, that's why I came back to the US and started work on my current events website. Call me an idealist, but I still believe in the democratic project.

The wealthiest among us are robbing society blind... and calling it freedom. It always amazes me(makes me laugh) how some of the most wealthiest among us seem to take any and all calls to help the rest of society in any meaningful way as if you were calling for all out communism. I can only imagine that they see themselves like Mell Gibson crying FREEDOM!!! when they refuse higher taxes on themselves but have no problem with the minimum wage being barely high enough for average families to scrape by. Apparently they love Free Market Capitalism as long as there the only ones who are actually bennifiting from it. I love free market capitalism too. But there is a difference between Capitalism and blind robbery, a distinction they can't seem to make. They also don't realize that its called a society for a reason: we all rely on eachother, there was no way they could have made the riches they have without the poorer among them. Just to be clear I'm talking about the top 0.1 percent of society, the bottom 0.9 percent of "The 1 Percent" is comprised mostly of really successful Doctors, Lawyers, Engineers etc. people who make a lot but not an insane amount of money. So "The 0.1 Percent" is a more accurate description for the people we're talking about right now.<br><br>Despite some of my comments last post and some misunderstandings of them I do realize the importance of community. I just wished that it could apply to the entirety of society instead of us all staying insular, trying to one up eachother and keeping other members down just because of where they were born and who to. Yes I do realize this is hopefully idealistic and has almost zero chances of coming true, but I don't have many idealistic hopes for the immediate future left so I'd like to keep this one for a little while longer before I give it up. Again to be clear I am NOT trying to restart the disscussion on that.<br><br>It is true about the lack of trust in government as a whole, mostly because the same downward spiral seems to be going on no matter which sits in office. This is depressing because of what you said a few weeks ago in your post on fascism. If a person who would actually do the things that I want to see occur like greater unity, concern over resource and energy consumption actuapy doing something effective abot the ecpnemy and other things I'm not sure I would recognize it before it was already too late. So there is no way the average American who barely knows anything about history or their own governmental process and politics is Google to see it.<br><br>Also a little off topic but the exeptionalism thing has become pretty apparent to me lately. I remembered talking to a friend while we were in the army about our country. He was sure that we would still be a nation(as strong as we are today) in another thousand years. Ha... Ha... Ha... no amount of telling him about history or that historically Republics don't last that long(at leasst not in the same way) could sway him. Its notable that a recent talk with him revealed he is no longer as idealistic about the county surviving(in its current form at least) to 3000ad. But he is still sure that we(humans) will somehow be sailing the stars, having sex with green skinned alien space babes by then. His words, not mine<br><br><br><a href=#c5501498350033187880 title="comment permalink">7/3/14, 3:16 PM</a><br><br>

What's more, for the last decade or so the US government has been behaving as though it thinks it's going to have to fight a domestic insurgency.

I know there is a lot of anger these days directed at the government by rural whites in the Midwest, the Rocky Mountains and the Deep South. It seems to me that the recent standoff between a Nevada rancher and the BLM could be a harbinger of things to come. A lot of people in the Western states really resent the fact that the federal government owns so much of the land west of the Mississippi. In Nevada, it’s nearly 85 percent and in Alaska, its 69 percent. While these are extreme cases, the Congressional Research Service recently estimated the federal government owns around 52 percent of the land in the Western states. Add to this issues like immigration, declining standards of living for most Americans and what many people see as excessive regulation by the feds and you’ve got a combustible mix. Of course, incidents like the one at the Bundy ranch are hardly new. Many people still remember the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. There is still quite a lot of anger in certain parts of the country about the way the feds handled those two cases. In all three cases, the feds ended up making things a lot worse and escalated the situation through the ham-fisted way they handled things. And don’t forget that the worst act of terrorism on American soil before 9/11 (aside from the genocidal wars against the Native Americans) was the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, which was essentially a revenge attack by a disgruntled veteran for the Waco and Ruby Ridge massacres.<br><br>Or perhaps the insurgency could come from the inner cities, which are filled with minority groups with lots of grievances of their own. One of my university professors once argued that welfare programs, affirmative action and so on weren’t so much motivated by social justice as they were an attempt to keep the peace by placating people who otherwise might revolt, like they did during the race riots in the 1960’s. Incidents like the Rodney King beating and subsequent race riots, the OJ Simpson case and the Trayvon Martin case show that these racial cleavages never went away, they were just swept under the rug by the political establishment and the mass media. <br><br>My suspicion is that the domestic insurgency is most likely to come from one of those two sources. Once the insurgency gets going, we could see both factors feed off of one another. For instance, if another Rodney King or Trayvon Martin type incident sparks mass rioting and urban guerrilla warfare, this could spark a huge and violent backlash from rural, working class and lower middle class whites, who also have lots of grievances as previously mentioned.<br><br><a href=#c3993442384489001114 title="comment permalink">7/3/14, 4:41 PM</a><br><br>

They must have awareness of the gridlocked political system, their own inability to represent the desires of their constituencies, and the fact that most Americans no longer take them seriously. <br><br>If 93% of Americans don't feel any signifcant confidence in Congress, I'd bet money that a significant fraction of congress people are included in that fraction.<br><br>I imagine that many of the more self-aware members of the political class must be viewing their careers as something of a joke. I wonder; did the political class on the eve of WWI have a similar ironic detachment from their positions of power, or were they much less postmodern than today's leaders?<br><br>Of course this doesn't bode very well for effective governance, especially during a time of crisis.

They also have both come to the free yoga classes I've been offering.

Will you please comment/respond to my following observation as I do not have the resources or perspective to do so. It seems to me (thanks to 911) that homeland security and other government sector groups have such as NYPD have gone a long way toward militarizing 'security'. For instance, I have read that off-duty NYPD officers can be hired to do private sector corporate security - these are large scale operations, not 'mall-cop'. I have also noted heavy hardware in seemingly odd places - I am from a rural area, the sheriff department here has a tank. Not an Abrahms A-1 but an armored vehicle with a turret and a cannon. I can't help but believe that the powers that be are anticipating the breakdown and are preparing to 'maintain order'.

But I wanted to say a few things. Because right now I feel as if the whole world is moving in slow motion. The last time that I felt that way was in June of 2011 as the first debt ceiling crisis crept up upon us and so many people just seemed to yawn. That crisis was defused, but can we have a similar hope for the next one? All around me people know that something is building. It's on the faces of everyone around me in the office, it wants to escape their lips but doesn't.<br><br>Here in Los Angeles the practice of business as usual has had enough residual momentum to keep going all throughout the years since the financial crisis. And yet if you are willing to get out of your car you can see that there's something very wrong here. I don't own an automobile any longer, and every morning I walk to work down La Brea Avenue, which has been engulfed by a commercial construction boom of staggering proportions. From Sunset all the way down to Olympic, buildings are being razed every few weeks, with massive new apartment complexes and commercial developments going up every which way. More than once I have had the experience of walking up to the grocery store and stopping confusedly in front of some empty lot, saying to myself "Wait, wasn't there a building here three or four days ago?" And yet, despite this boom, much of this finished construction seems to be sitting empty. No retailers or tenants seem to have moved into the new mixed use property at La Brea and Fountain. The giant mixed use building at La Brea and Wilshire has a few occupied apartments but none of the retail space has been claimed. The renovated factory at La Brea and Romaine is ready for shops and offices to come in, but nobody seems to have followed up on the opportunity.<br><br>There is also no sign of the drought here in this city, save for an epidemic of bleary, dried-out eyes caused by the abnormally low humidity (I wear contacts and have had lots of trouble with them this past year). But even more shockingly, there is little sign of it in places where the water situation should be even more serious. This past weekend I spent two days in the Mohave Desert and surrounding areas. Obviously this is the absolute worst time of the year to visit that particular place, but I had a friend from South Africa staying with me and she desperately wanted to visit the area and that weekend was her only opportunity to do so during her time here in the US. We rented a car and went to the Salton Sea, slab city, Joshua Tree National Park and a lot of places in between. We had the misfortune of being lost in Palm Springs and neighboring Indio thanks to a faulty guide book which sent us all over those two cities. I was horrified by what I saw: lush greenery everywhere. And it wasn't just limited to businesses that require lush greenery like Palm Springs' famous golf courses. The local Chase Bank branch had an emerald green front lawn. So did the local retirement homes. So did the yards of private residences all over town. I saw plenty of sprinklers running during the hottest part of the afternoon.<br><br>I actually wouldn't be surprised if there was the next major market crash happened this year. Obviously that's simply my prediction, and as JMG pointed out, the specifics of these things are almost impossible to decipher with any reliability. But if you look at the warning signs that are flashing, the lack of volatility, the collapse in margin debt and other factors, it becomes obvious that the bottom is waiting to fall out. What happens after the bottom falls out no man can tell yet, but I expect that the market crash will not itself be the crisis that unravels everything, but that it will directly lead to that crisis in some way, shape or form.<br><br><a href=#c1549766701548937736 title="comment permalink">7/3/14, 8:43 PM</a><br><br>

He let me know that before he started selling insurance, he worked for the NSA. He also let me know that everything that was wrong with America was all Obamas fault. Apparently our president is trying to implement a socialist dictatorship or something. He also told me that there was a "revolution" coming. The guy seemed sane and cogent, but very polarized. He spoke with regret over the presidents rejection of American Exceptionalism. While I doubt the president can have our empires failure laid at his feet, it is troubling to me to think that there may be people involved in the security sector of our government who might agree with my customer. The loss of security and entitlement that goes along with the end of an empire might be unsettling some important people.<br><br><a href=#c3154567727927137384 title="comment permalink">7/3/14, 8:56 PM</a><br><br>

I think a lot of folks here (no, I don't mean our host) are being seduced by the drama of the present, and forgetting how many times in past decades that things looked just as dramatic and unstable. <br><br>When Ronald reagan was elected in 1980, my generation were quite certain that this meant we were all going to die in a nuclear war within the next few years. It's been over a third of a century, and still no nuke has been dropped on anyone by anyone since 1945. <br><br>Fifty years ago, when the Freedom Riders were headed south, local governments in Mississippi were preparing for race wars. None happened.<br><br>During the Clinton years, militias were organizing throughout the country, terrorist bombings created mass killings, conflicts between armed enclaves and federal agents lead to many deaths. But no actual sustained armed insurgency ever arose from any of this.<br><br>I am not saying that there is no risk. It might start tomorrow. Or it might be triggered by events involving people who are not even born yet in a place you would never imagine over an issue that does not yet even exist. <br><br>I've been around for almost 53 years. Just about every one of them has been tumultuous, with leaking powderkegs piled in some corner or another.

If it is mentioned, it's usually to cheer on super-star CEOs, vilify poor performing CEOs, or quietly and apologetically suggest that perhaps, maybe we should look at their compensations in theory, but fall far short of suggesting anything be done about it in practice. On the rare occasions someone suggests actual changes be made, pundits and politicians will act as if you've said something vulgar or defiled their religion. People are allowed to have their own ideas, opinions, and theories about the topic, but I do not understand the anger that erupts when people are asked to consider the topic. <br>On the other hand, we are all very comfortable deciding how little people should make in the lower classes. For example, our governor in Minnesota, Mark Dayton, was willing came out in a recent interview saying that perhaps the minimum wage was in fact too high for waiters and waitresses considering they get tips. The Seattle minimum wage hike is getting lots of coverage and analysis as well. We don't need to add to these conversations here, I only bring these up as examples of what we are willing to consider as dinner conversation. <br><br>The Hobby Lobby case is another case that we have decided that corporations not only get to decide how much your time is worth, but they should also be able to dictate how you use your own compensation. If they don't like how you're using your health insurance, what is to prevent them from saying that you need their approval for spending the rest of your earnings in a way that meets the employer's moral standards?<br><br>These as I see it are part of why we are losing faith in our government. It's not only that much of the current system seems unfair, but the fact that government seems to be clinging to a set of ideals that has no foundation in truth.<br><br><a href=#c3995579957968199843 title="comment permalink">7/3/14, 9:42 PM</a><br><br>

If you do, read not <br>further.<br><br>You indicated your reason for posting a comment was selfish. You describe a difficulty in motivation. Go with selfish. Its very motivating. So is fear. Its a type of selfishness. I'm talking anxiety attacks fear ... walking up in the middle of the night covered in sweat fear. Nothing lights a fire under someone like that kind of fear. Stop short of paralyzing fear though. That's no help. <br><br>Collapse is poverty. Fear that poverty now. That's your motivation. Feel the cold sweat, the heart palpitations. Get out of and stay out of debt now because debt costs money. Ride a bike now because it saves money. Reduce, conserve, reuse, recycle now because it saves money now. Grow your own food if it saves money and makes your more resilient, not because there is some virtue in it. There is no “should” here and no moral rectitude. These seldom motivate people for the long term anyways. Greed and fear though; they work wonders to motivate people. Rest assured every BTU of fossil fuel you don't burn, someone else will anyways. So change your behaviour, not because its the right thing to do, but because you understand it to be in your best interest to make yourself more resilient against a difficult future. <br><br>My own view is that things are just to far gone, and have too much momentum, to change at this point. We have already hit the iceberg. It now time to find a lifeboat, not work on better iceberg detection systems. So beware of any altruistic desire to do the right thing to save the world. Frack the world! In the near future your concerns will be much more very local. The world will have to fend for itself. Your immediate concern is impending extreme personal poverty. As wealth is the antidote to poverty, the way to achieve personal resilience is to go for those things that build real wealth in your life now. <br><br><br><a href=#c5272775803121856252 title="comment permalink">7/3/14, 9:43 PM</a><br><br>

Being an American, who admittidly doesn't know all that much about British politics, I can't really comment on The House Of Lords. But I will say that if you meant litterally in terms of not knowing what it's for, The Electoral College would probably be a pretty good American equivalent. Most Americans have absolutely no idea what The Electoral Colege does. More depressingly, from my experience, many average Americans are not even aware that the Electoral College even exists. They most certainly don't know that in the Presidential Election the Electoral College Vote outweighs the Popular Vote. As in, if the P-vote among the citizens is for one candidate and the EC-vote for another, the EC-vote will always win out. They are however supposed to vote based on their states Popular Vote and admittedly this is what most often happens, but there have been a few exceptions. The last one that I can think of off-hand is George W Bush Jr's first term in 2000. The P-vote was actually for Al Gore but for whatever reason the EC-vote ended up being for Bush Jr, so, he was elected. Again this is not common but as things continue to get worse in the U.S, and trust in government(or at least in the tradional Democrate and Republican Parties) begins to wane, it may become much less rare than it is now.<br><br><a href=#c3114716371276032715 title="comment permalink">7/3/14, 10:30 PM</a><br><br>

He is certainly correct about the role of Zbigniew Brzezinski in fomenting the present crisis, but Zb. Brz., as a Pole, is simply approaching the problem of Ukraine from a common Polish point of view, that is to say, a point of view that for centuries has feared and demonized Russia above all other countries. On the other hand, Boyle (like most Russian Studies people in the US) does not so much demonize Poland (and Western Europe) as ignore it, and --quite unhistorically -- he seems to view Ukraine as a natural part of Russia, or at least its natural ally. It is no such thing.<br><br>There is a deep and ancient fault-line, nearly 2000 years old today, that cuts all of Europe into an Eastern and a Western half: Rome vs. Byzantium, Catholic Christianity vs. Orthodox Christianity, more recently German National Socialism vs. Russian Communism. This fault-line cuts right through Ukraine, just as to the south it runs right through Bosnia. It splits Ukraine down the middle. (Bosnia, on the other hand, in ther later Middle Ages seems to have said, "a pox on both your Christian houses," and become Muslim at the earliest possible opportunity.) <br><br>Because of this, each land has been a sort of geo-political live bomb with a hair-trigger fuse for centuries. And each will continue to be so for the foreseeable future.<br><br>The ancient cultural history of each of these two lands will forever keep Ukraine from being peacefully assimilated either to Western Europe or to Russia. There is too much historical baggage, and it is too heavy. And any attempt to force either land do so will only provoke a genocidal frenzy, not unlike what is currently happening in the Middle East, where the Ukrainian partisans for each orientation will happily destroy themselves if only they can destroy all the partisans of the other orientation along with themselves.<br><br>This is not to say that the US is not fomenting a crisis there for its own advantage. It is. And so is Russia, for its own advantage -- and doing it somewhat more skillfully. But neither attempt is more legitimate than the other. And each side is playing with very dangerous wildfire as it does so.<br><br><a href=#c2608008284550454043 title="comment permalink">7/3/14, 10:34 PM</a><br><br>

This geographic isolation allows the US to decline to previously unheard of depths. Any other country would promptly be taken over by an opportunistic aspiring empire on its borders (witness Russia in Europe, China in Asia) But, the US retains its geographic isolation, and is still too far from any competing empire, so is still left to its own vices to decline and collapse on its own on its own territory. Hence an unheard of wait as things creak and moan on to previously unheard of depths.<br>I still maintain that Canada will come out smelling like a rose, particularly if it maintains wide open immigration policies with up and coming powers like India, China, Brazil, and manages to improve relations and ties with those countries as the US declines. I'm so glad I live only 6 hours from the Canadian border, if it comes to that.<br>Violet, I'm very interested in your path, as I don't have land of my own, or any wealth to buy land.

I've found evangelical fundamentalists of a prepper bent in KY that are into permaculture and homesteading, and I'm not opposed to learning from/working with them as long as we could set aside differences and focus on similarities--permaculture and the like can make for strange bedfellows, as posters here have noted before. The biggest issue so far has been nonresponse of people I've contacted. I've always thought of KY &amp; Tenn as sister states, but maybe there's just much less going on here. I've known of the Faeries for years, and a local guy I've been in touch with is fond of them.

Say you are inclined to use all four these in the traditional manner. Who do you know of by name and face of the 1% who lives within 100 km of you. I'm thinking the answer for the vast majority us is no one. I'm also thinking that the vast majority of us would not really have the inclination to bestow the honour even if we did know someone worthy of it. Personally I have a hard enough time killing bandit raccoons (I'm up to 9 this season). <br><br>This thought came to me in response to the essay in Politico by Hanauer. No matter how desperate or angry you might be, killing the 1% in an industrial society won't change much for you personally even if the victims are transparently connected to the political apparatus. Your taxes will not immediately cease. Your cost of living will not change. You will not have more to eat. By contrast, the Terror in France following the revolution did serve such purposes. The Terror eliminated a transparent power/wealth structure to allow better distribution of wealth. However, the 1% are all but invisible in our societies. They don't live in the big house on the hill and levy taxes from the peasants who inhabit the lands surrounding it. There is no clear direct link between your poverty and their wealth via obvious systemic theft. (In my view there is systemic theft, its just not obvious.) Killing them, their family, and their retainers will not make you wealthier because you now no longer pay the rents to support them. Thus much of the motivation (save anger at not getting your share of the loot) is absent.<br><br>This brings up the issue of where their wealth comes from. Its not based so much on land as it used to be before industrialization. There is no need for pitchforks etc. Just stop buying their stuff and stop working for them. This is hard to do voluntarily but it probably won't be voluntary in time anyways. So if you seek social justice, just turn off the wealth pump by not participating, or participating a little as possible. The immediate effect of doing so will be to make you poorer though. You can see the problem. I do not advocate this idealism, I'm just pointing it out. <br><br>For those of the 1% that are ahead of the curve, setting up a feudal arrangement would be the next move during industrial collapse. Of course, in proportion to how feudal things become or already are in a particular society, the target would now be more obvious. Then the pitchforks etc. may come in handy. That's a long way down the road though. I think Hanauer's concerns are premature. What is more likely is that many of the 1% will cease being such once the basis for their income evaporates. What they do with their stored loot (assuming it too did not evaporate) will determine if they stay in the 1%.<br><br><a href=#c6851419162318498480 title="comment permalink">7/4/14, 8:40 AM</a><br><br>

The fiscal design of these plans worked just great for 50 years until those preconditions no longer obtained, so now it should come as no surprise that they're becoming problematic. This isn't really the fault of individual retirees.<br><br>* The original assertion was that the government was trying to create a loyal cadre of public overseers or viziers of some type, to insulate it against revolution by the impoverished masses. None of the fiscal discussions of pensions anyone has provided support this assertion, and I find it sensationalistic and baseless. Every discussion acknowledges that these benefits are being cut and government job security is rapidly vanishing, so it seems ludicrous and maybe even clinically paranoid to assert this.<br><br>In defense of our stance, as Bill Pullman notes, if I cited web pages from the SEIU that say that pensions aren't so bad, I suspect Enrique wouldn't grant them any legitimacy. Those who obsessed about Ayn Rand back in college tend to cherry-pick extreme examples of a few department heads (who have obtained special deals for themselves), and then say "many workers retire at 50" or "this one guy retired at 41" and then try to pass this off as the typical situation, as Charles Hugh Smith does in Enrique's links. They don't acknowledge that the vast majority of pensioners only worked for the government for a brief period of time, not their entire careers, and consequently receive only a few thousand per year. Also these analyses tend to lump in Social Security benefits along with the supposedly generous pension amount that a lowly worker receives, and give you a sum total dollars that doesn't actually reflect the pension system. We ought to revoke these despicable leeches' Social Security too, g*DD@##it!! And you kids get off my lawn. <br><br>The fact remains that the _average_ pensioner is receiving something in the $30k per year, ( http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/23/retirement/detroit-pensions/ , http://www.ilretirementsecurity.org/faq?id=0004 )not the $100k that most of Charles Hughes Smith would have you believe every single librarian receives.<br><br>Nevertheless, that doesn't change the fact that municipal and State budgets are floundering, and pension costs are <b><i>one</i></b> of <b><i>MANY</i></b> factors to that problem. Other factors include tax "reform" that eviscerated the States' revenue _after_ the pensions were set up. Whether you think Howard Jarvis was a good thing or not, you have to acknowledge that the pension plans were designed and drafted in a different era, when States had more revenue streams and the economy in general, as JMG would point out, was expanding. They worked great for 50 years until those preconditions no longer obtained, so now it should come as no surprise that they're becoming problematic. Hence the vitriol directed at pensioners seems undeserved, and merely plays into the hands of division and wedging the public apart. Those who argue from the Libertarian perspective, like Charles Hugh Smith, I must point out, are the ones who think an economy doesn't need a government to regulate it <b><i>because</i></b> Contracts are a sacrosanct moral obligation. Then they turn around and say that pension contracts to government workers which were legitimately negotiated decades ago are obviously null and void. Grandparents moving back into the homes of struggling young parents who have nothing saved for retirement themselves and can't afford to support three generations in home, will probably contribute to the economic stresses that JMG says will fuel a revolution, and ultimately that's everybody's problem.<br><br><a href=#c7551475371870011376 title="comment permalink">7/4/14, 10:10 AM</a><br><br>

I appreciate your courage in acknowledging the shortcomings of your efforts to date, as they reinforce for me that I need to "get on the stick" too, for the sake of those kids (all kids, really), whose soccer- and homework-filled current existences I too often allow to serve as an excuse for not spending more time and energy building an existence more appropriate to the REAL future. <br><br>Going to hang the clothes out on the line and then sift some compost now.

They've got a cable network called RT, which openly presented itself as Russia Today when it was getting started. The style is very similar to Fox News, albeit hewing towards more radical libertarian rhetoric... buy gold and silver, the Federal Reserve is evil, etc. My parents had to downgrade to the basic Dish Network satellite package, and I was shocked to find that while they no longer received the rural-living channel RFDTV, RT was still available. Now, I can't say I blame the Russians, because this sort of media back-and-forth has been going on for longer than I've been alive... but I can (and do) blame anyone who buys what comes off that network wholesale.<br><br>The same thing goes for the Bundy ranch incident a few months ago, which another commentor brought up.

Instead, the State, local &amp; Federal governments are trapped in the "Tinkerbell Theory," that if they just put out enough happytalk, the economy will recover, despite any physical or resource limitations. Admitting that pensions legally &amp; lawfully agreed-to, cannot be honored, would be a major admission that our way of life is drawing to a close.

Rural property in my opinion is a pretty good idea. I was taking steps to buy a small but fully developed campground here in Oregon before the owners yanked the opportunity away from me in favor of a later offer. I wanted it because it was open enough to put in pastures and a garden yet right on the border of a National Forest with a river for fishing within easy riding distance and plenty of deer and elk in the area to hunt as well. It would be an income until things really go south. Plus the area had another attraction for me, my skin is brown and my features show the American Indian in me and that area has a reservation. It helps to blend in with the locals and there's lots of trails leading away that I could fade into the woods if necessary. A remote rural location isn't a drawback if you have transportation and I'll have a few horses. Wagons and carts aren't hard to rig up if needed either. <br><br><br>Wadulisi<br><br><a href=#c2475490234890804877 title="comment permalink">7/4/14, 6:24 PM</a><br><br>

Very well said. I felt as if I were in philosophy class, except your speech was far more interesting and far less useless, and I thank you for it. Your right of course about not worrying your life away, even when as now there is a lot to worry about. I realized that a long tolime ago. Another way to say this to use a tired saying is: What's the point of Life if your not really living it?<br><br> Being cautious is necessary in life but to let that fear rule you is useless. Trying to fight the inevitability of death is as pointless as trying to fight the air you breath. You can try it, but its not really going to get you very far. Nothing is truly infinite. Not humanity. Not the Earth. Not the Sun. Possibly not even the Universe. Everything goes away eventually. In nature it is to give way to something else. Just as there can be no beginning without and end, there can be no life without death. Maybe this will go on indefinately, maybe it won't. But that's not what really matters. What matters is the filler in between. Just because something is short doesn't mean that it has no purpose. Just because you know your going to die doesn't mean that you can't still enjoy your life. <br><br>I intend to do just that tonight and for as long as I can(within reason of course!) and I hope that you and everyone else will as well!<br><br><a href=#c3314947660443996749 title="comment permalink">7/4/14, 7:01 PM</a><br><br>

I say that seriously. I am not qualified to make pronouncements about the state of our federal government. What I'd like to remind folks is that there are multiple levels of government. <br><br>In my line of work I am somewhat plugged into state and local government activities. At that level, there are efforts, at least where I live, to prepare for a climate changed, resource poor future. Say what you like about cities, and their flaws are many, but they also are driving much change: mayors have a direct responsibility to their citizens and must do practical things to help their cities. I believe the citizens of those cities have a responsibility to participate in local governance.

The recent evaluation of shale reserves in various places indicates strongly that there was probably some fraud involved in the initial estimates (nobody is that bad!)<br><br>I had a friend who was a local wheel in the federal employees union. They had no power whatsoever to negotiate anything, and could only send a representative to hold an employees had during a hearing, etc. (their success rate was nil--most of the hearing examiners had never in their entire career ever ruled for a federal employee on any issue whatsoever, including obvious disabilities). The unions were set up in the 1970's to give the CIA a front to use to attend international labor conferences, and that was the role of ALL the higher ups in the organizations through the 19080's.<br><br>The problem with state pension plans is that you had some mid-level manager in terms of training and market savvy making gigantic investment decisions, and they were played like a violin by Wall Street, and they wound up as the major holders of the worthless derivative paper,etc., spawned in the recent financial crisis. In consequence the states and many municipalities are in trouble--even Colorado where budgets must be balanced under the state constitution have trouble due to their mal-investments and the current zero interest rates on bonds, i.e., the Federal Reserve is really already stealing people's retirements, and the federal governments tolerance of well known criminality (Eric Holder turned down prosecution of 15,000 lay down criminal cases handed to him by the lawyers in a class action civil lawsuit against Counrtywide) is guaranteeing that there will only be pennies on the dollar recompense for the fraud. In other words, pension funds got left holding the bag for most of the $21 trillion in losses in the recent financial crisis. And, of course, you hear Republicans whining about unfunded liabilities (that their patrons caused--sorry to be political here, but then the Democrats are busy micromanaging everything--I guess you could say I revile them both!)<br><br>I'm 69 and spend too much time looking into things. It makes me very discouraged about our future, and the likleyhood of guns in the streets in this country. If you are optimistic about change, read Bruce Bueno de Mesquite's book The Dictator's Handbook, whose punchline is that those in power will never betray their base. The first case is a small town in California, not Saddamm Hussein or his ilk. You are not in the real base of any politician.....<br><br><a href=#c5163176435941745779 title="comment permalink">7/5/14, 9:07 AM</a><br><br>

The rich industrialist/fossilist/noveau riche - of whom you have a very large proportion in the US may be more prone to not comprehend why they are so rich (almost having to hope/believe it is their smarts and technology -just so they can sleep at night). Hanauer fell in that category before he woke up. Now he can choose to quit or try to become traditional 0.1%. Almost the entire rest of the 1% will get their place allotted in a feudal system (if one is to come). I think Whomever the security apparatus in the US is serving is most likely traditional now - although they are doing very amateurish blunders currently. Still, I guess if we get anyone to dangle it will be the slightly naive and accessible industrialist/fossil/nouveaus. If my surmises are correct some of the thoughtful ones started taking courses with these fellows recently: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallenberg_family - although they need to work on their "non videri" (obviously).<br><br>"This brings up the issue of where their wealth comes from. Its not based so much on land as it used to be before industrialization." <br>True in a way. But then again there are certain lands industrialization is in turn dependent on, because in those you can harvest a bit more energy than from last year only.<br><br>"Who do you know of by name and face of the 1% who lives within 100 km of you."<br>I assume you mean 1% and up by US standards? With the 100km limit I guess I could fairly say one or two only plus some family. And one uses bodyguards (a lot). The other I am not sure. Without the 100km limit it is surely more than a dozen + family. A few of them in the 0.1% for sure. Some of them with very lax security. Some with basic, say 1-5 minutes extra security. Many I wouldn't know in so much detail - but did you know you can get addresses from patent documents? Or really scared linkedin and facebook contacts? Or traffic cams, shareholder meetings, conferences... <br>However, in this group your statement may be true for the majority. But in general it is not so unlikely if you assume that you know perhaps 200 people "by face and name" and you're not exactly in a "working class place". Also, if you can smell a weak link with some addresses, for example a lawyer, you can easily extend your list.<br><br><a href=#c8367355418432136727 title="comment permalink">7/5/14, 12:04 PM</a><br><br>

As weapons go, an IED is potentially a very "good natured" tool, no? It is a bit like a "more responsible mine". Also, to use them really effectively you better have support from the local populace (as you'll be digging in their front yard for half a day, or leaving your "trash bags" around their neighborhood). IEDs are rather pointless on the offense (I'll just assume here that those people will be the bad guys more often than not). What I'd be more afraid of is rapid reaction force ("tax collector") type gear - or what ISIS and the likes use (depends a little on geography). Basically anything that allows organized groups to outrun the consequences of their previous actions. Trucks and big ships coming at night would probably make me hope there'd be MORE IEDs in my neighborhood...<br><br><a href=#c4137006175835304335 title="comment permalink">7/5/14, 12:07 PM</a><br><br>

Used human carrying capacity<br>2. We're on the downslope<br><br>The first one doesn't work in our favor but I am not sure how much impact it has on the issue at hand - apart from the obvious incentive for resource wars. And I guess for WMD as well to be blunt.<br><br>I have some hope that number two will be a strong stabilizing factor, at least as far as military endeavors are concerned. In a growth economy you can argue that you can get back up, and inaction will lose out eventually. Therefore risk taking is adaptive (I would say this is strongly reflected in US (business) culture).<br>In a shrinking economy sitting still until you (think you) know what you are doing is preferable. Military conflict is costly - and most of the immediate benefit goes to the people selling sandbags and guns from the sidelines. Now if there is no long term return on investment to be expected there's not much reason to go to war unless you really have to (or it comes to you). On the other hand there is more than enough incentive to do a "shake out" of your former alliance, who would in due time become competitors. <br>On that note it was interesting to hear that a spy was caught in a German government committee reluctantly established to investigate allegations of US espionage. The most shocking aspect was the tiny sum of money the operative was said to have received. Well, I guess it was only the US side income - if it was true at all. But I think the ratio of embarrassed "hush-hushers" to all kinds of people that start thinking is starting to shift - even without elections. The headline news of the day before was that the NSA targets specifically people who value their privacy, using a real example of a harmless looking "non-political" young dude working in academia.<br><br><a href=#c5405675051107806409 title="comment permalink">7/5/14, 12:48 PM</a><br><br>

Just to be clear I am not trying to start an argument here nor trying to attack you or whatever your personal viewpoint may or may not be. But I would like to comment a little on your posts about Security Forces, Reactionary Forces(as in people fighting the Security Forces) and IEDs.<br><br>When it comes to the Security Forces it is true that many a civilian has been a victim of them. Mostly through incedental or accidental harm, as in they were going after a the Reactionary Forces and the civilian somehow happened to get in the way. But also through intentional actions of individuals of those Security Forces. Usually because of orders given to them by the upper Governmental echelons bossing around those Security Forces, who IMHO tend to really care about the men and women who make up the SF about as much as they really care about the civilians, wich is not much. Rarely but occasionally because of a personal misguided grudge against them the member of the SF has against them. Mostly because the Reactionary Forces are made up of them and probably because they killed another member of the SF they cared about. Combined with the stress of war and conflict and this usually drives them to take things WAY too far. Its as if all thier senses have flown away, and they're in some kind of dream. Notably many of them(though certainly not all) tend to feel extreme remorse after sometime has passed, they have been removed from the situation and they start to remember who they were before. Their victims unfortunately don't get that chance. These occasions are often far worse and have far more terrible consequences. While the orders harm is usually not on the order of magnitude of the personal grudge harm it cannot be denied that being under constant surveillance and guard, having your home broken into and your relatives captured and interogatted can cause some serious trauma.<br><br>On the subject of the Reactionary Forces. It is a common misconception that if the Security Forces are so disliked by the civilian population than surely they most love the Reactionary Forces. Not quite. Often the RF are disliked or even hated just as much or even more than the SF are. Mostly because the RF can be just as much or even more cruel and destructive towards them as the SF can be. Its hard to love someone who forces your older brother to fight for them, makes sexual advances on your sisters and then subsequently kills your brother and poor acid over your sisters faces when they refuse. Also the fact that some of these RF are actually foreigners who are simply being paid to fight for them(aka mercennaries) makes it even harder. From my experience most of the civialian populace that supports the RF only do so because: a member of their family was harmed by the SF, a member of their family(for whatever reason) is part of the RF, they are being paid by the RF or(very often) they are deathly afraid that the RF will harm them and their families if they don't. Also as far as the IEDs go, they often have no qualms using them when civilians are present and will suffer and die as well, so this might diswade them from wanting alot of them around.<br><br>See usually, or at least in the situation I and it sounds like you too are thinking of, the RF are not fighting for the freedom of their country, their fighting for control of their country. As in they control the rest of the civilian populace and enforce their rules on them. Though to be honest this is exactly what the SF are doing as well. At least these are often the goals of the upper echelons of the SF and RF, the individual members of both groups often have their own reasons and motivations. This could be applied to a lot of other situations in history as well. For all our bluster about them, many Americans don't like to admit just how horrible the Patriots of the Revolutionary War era and many more of our heroes really were.<br><br><a href=#c4572422799132310048 title="comment permalink">7/5/14, 6:40 PM</a><br><br>

The truth is while for whatever psychological reason we like to widdle real life down to the simple narrative of good guys and bad guys, in most real life conflicts there are no truly good guys. Just bad guys fighting other bad guys, and the people caught in between them. The bad guys who are somewhat nicer than the others are, we label, the good guys. No matter who gets the good guy label, its the ordinary people in the middle who suffer most. But truly lets face it, human nature being what it is Manny of those civilians caught in the middle could find a reason to fight and do some horrible things too, given the piper incentive. After all both the SF and the RF have done some good things too and more importantly are made up of other human beings just like them. Many of whom never intended to do many of those horrible things. We were all inoccent at some point, life just had different plans. Even you, should something happen were you had to support or join an RF in your area might do some things and events might occur that you never intended. Or for whatever reason you might join the SF and those same things might occur. Either way you will probably still find some justifications for your actions and either way the end result will probably not be what you were expecting.<br><br>This is a terrible realization to have and most certainly is not comforting to anyone, especially those in the middle civilians, but as far as I can tell that's just reality. Obviously there are exceptionss and sometimes it is black an white, but yeah. That doesn't mean that all is negative doom and gloom however, there are certainly great, beautiful wonderful things about life and humanity and the future. But lets face it, not everything is so great.<br><br> @ To JMG thanks for making this site and for allowing us to comment, but if you feel I have overstepped my bounds or should refrain from bringing things like this or others in such (admittidly long winded) detail and think they might start uneneeded pointless conflict, feel free to tell me to shut my trap.

I said the problem is chiefly a social dysfunction, not the proliferation of a certain technology. The social dysfunction is primarily due to exclusion from social political institutions of minorities, which then form gangs (as the Italians did early in the century, so now the darker skinned minorities do so today)... essentially, the origin of most gun crime is poverty.

Before the coal-powered steam engines - that first Industrial Revolution - the Constitutional Founders could not anticipate that so much power would be had by the owners of capital. <br><br>In a way, the result of centralized management and ownership of Industrial energy and technology was that the Pyramid on the back of the dollar bill starts to look more and more like a space needle, with an increasingly heavy bulb of powerful control at the top, swaying around in the maddening and increasingly blustery winds. Furthermore, the demands of debt repayment necessitate an endless pursuit of profit - by law - such profit to be paid out of the earth's blood, even as parasites drawing the blood kills the host.<br><br>It is a particularly tricky problem - really more like a predicament (no solution) because nowadays, empowered by the industrial fuels and the technologies, and security, they drive, the American middle class lives like kings (even as they struggle to keep that tower from tipping over)...<br><br>there is no check and balance on such astronomical power -- it seems only to wait until it ends, either by dwindling away, or by hubristic self-destruction.<br><br>Let us say a brave political elite recognizes the problem and offers a solution: we must wrestle control of the government away from the corporations. then what? what policy follows on that? <br><br>Because it's not so much the greed of corporations, but the greed of all of their customers, that continues to drive corporations as they prod government to increase liquidity, stimulate demand with more currency in circulation, more unpayable debts....<br><br>It's hard to see any policy following on taking control of government away from corporations that doesn't involve a reversal of economic growth. Without economic growth, there are three subsequent policy options: curtail population growth with something like the one-child policy; yank support for the elderly who cannot produce for themselves; or yank support for the poor and disabled who can't produce for themselves.<br><br>JMG, I know I'm kinda just echoing the discourse, but I thought this other angle might be helpful: even dealing with the lack of confidence Americans have with government - getting the government to be democratic again - doesn't really solve our problem.

Swedish armament is often the product of choice for groups who care about their independence.<br>5.

Okay, I am not sure how much of this would be possible if they weren't a safe haven for some nasty crooks from nearly everywhere - but they sure are sensible enough to "share the loot", if I may put it in these terms.

Your pensions are paid out of current government revenue. There is no reserve or slush fund for this specific purpose. The basis of a defined benefit pension scheme is that it predicts future flows of income to those pensioners. It is just a poor basis with which to make that judgement of future income flows to pensioners as it fails completely to take into account declining government revenues.<br><br>The local government body here recently sent me a letter saying that this was the first year that property rates (land taxes) would increase by less than 5% (4.9% to be precise). They also stated that they were cutting back on some services to the community. Now I'm just pointing out that it is not a particularly good look.<br><br>As someone who works in small business, I have had a single increase in revenue from existing sources over the past 6 years and am unlikely to achieve this feat again in the future.<br><br><a href=#c7514210680035365142 title="comment permalink">7/6/14, 4:19 AM</a><br><br>

And please be clear that my comments are from an "interested armchair general perspective" (reading literature, technical background, listening to people, watching Armadillo, etc), without going into too much detail here. I value empiricism so I'd see me conceding point after point if we discuss concrete examples. And of course in military conflict the concrete circumstances matter a lot.<br>I agree with all the points you make, but I want to clarify in what vain I meant my original comment.<br><br>The situation I consider would be set in a world where the "good people" (if there ever was something like that) are dead in the gutter. The Geneva Convention or similar things are part of a difficult to grasp history. The world is very gray.<br>I'd just say that this thread's conception of worse is: a predatory behavior restricting another groups' abilities to live sustainably in a given location, maybe reduce ability to follow their individual and communal decisions, the whole shebang that can be subsumed under the romantic notion of the "old not-authoritarian Western tradition" or "power of love" I guess.<br>ON the other hand anyone who is in it more for "short term return on investment with whatever externalized cost" and "the love of power" is a shade darker. In practice they can look nearly identical as you explained well.<br>In my argument I just "max out the contrast" so that factions are either black or white. The ranks of the "Good Side" can still include "Bad Individuals" and tactics, just a little less (or for a little "Better Ends").<br><br>Now certain weapon systems are better suited for "love of power people" than for "power of love people". Of course both sides can use IEDs for example. The "power of love" side just has to use a little more resources to, say kidnap lots of people in the neighborhood (so word about the ambush doesn't come out), and make everyone see why it was just and necessary, than the "love of power side". So everything else being equal I'd say the side using more IED tactics (or less e.g. carpet bombing or scorched earth tactics) is more likely to be on the "power of love side". Even if it is only one iota more.<br><br><a href=#c1452144280512814249 title="comment permalink">7/6/14, 6:56 AM</a><br><br>

My impression is that our trains of thought follow mostly parallel tracks that go through slightly different landscape at times.<br><br>I there was one point that still bugged me about this statement:<br>"Taking these people out only really makes sense though when you are in a position to step into the void left by the recently deceased."<br><br>This is correct if you are looking for a substitute from the mainstream in an essentially similar prevailing system. The change is pretty insignificant as you correctly pointed out in earlier comments. You could say there are plenty of spare 0.1%ers in the 99% - just by virtue of their mental make-up. If they have money or not doesn't really matter as that variable is largely random anyway. The thing is if they attack out of the same basic motivations that drive the traditional 0.1% the only thing that changes is the name of the person really. <br>Because most of these attacks are from a similar motivation in a society with intact mimesis - you know the angle of attack and can (relatively) effectively guard against it.<br><br>When mimesis breaks down this is not true anymore. The efforts in protection become futile. There's a handful of people that demonstrate this as their hobby. And if the peoples goal is NOT replacing the previous 0.1%er in anything but name, they become really dangerous - even if there is no organization of theirs in place to pick up the ball again.<br><br><a href=#c4979940641057916445 title="comment permalink">7/6/14, 7:21 AM</a><br><br>

Australians, Europeans, and other places with higher gas prices have responded by developing less car dependent, more compact development with a rich alternative transportation network, so they're less dependent on petroleum and the cost of gas than freeway and suburbia crazed America. Even if they have mimicked our development, it's not to the same extent, nor could it be, considering how much gas costs.<br>I wanted to second the building craze thread. I live in an area that, at one time, was somewhat preservation oriented, and keen on preserving it's architectural history, which is why it's unsettling to see so many structurally sound, architecturally valuable buildings coming down for much cheaper, less durable replacements. The University of Kentucky has been a bad culprit for this locally. It's very dismaying to see durable structurally sound buildings getting torn down for cheap replacements that won't last<br><br><a href=#c5858406300197020810 title="comment permalink">7/6/14, 12:37 PM</a><br><br>

I get what you mean and I didn't take your comments in a bad light. Your absolutely right about the world(and people) being very grey. Its understandable to want to pollerize them to make them easier to discern from each other and to support a certain narrative. People on all sides from every walk of life do it all the time. I guess I've just gotten too cynical to be able to do it myself(unless the distinction is VERY extreme). A fact I don't like, and definitely don't say with any kind of pride or joy. <br><br>It's clear that many things about the current order are setup to benifit those in power and keep those not down. Unfortunately the new order and people looking to replace them don't seem all that better. Even if they were, once they have that power themselves, time might change that. But of course humans being what we are, no order at all wont be that much better, despite what some hopeless idealists might think. There seems to be no right answer. Doesn't mean that there aren't and wont be good things about the world now and in the future. Just that I always expect something equally as bad to balance it out. Although yes, sometimes the scales tip one way or the other, it never seems to fully fall over to one completely, especially the good side. Of course on the bright side that also means also means things can't go completely to hell either. Even if it may seem that way in the hard times ahead. An old History professor of mine summed it up perfectly: "Human History:horrible people doing horrible things to other horrible people, and then they died."<br><br>I think i understand what you mean about "power of love" weapons and " love of power" weapons, but im not sure I quite agree. As far as the IEDs go I'm not sure I'm convinced about them being different from any other tool of war subjectively. Yes they tend to be used by people fighting an occupation(for whatever reason) but this isn't necessarily because they don't want to use the "love of power" weapons, like say missiles that level entire blocks, and probably have a large number of collateral damage and civilian casualties. Usually its got more to do with just not having the resources or money to use those weapons. If they had those things, they would probably use them too. Most of the reason people on all sides of conflict might not use some of those weapons isn't necessarily because they don't want to but because they either can't or they're afraid of the consequences for them or their group if they do. Like say nuclear weapons for example. Though to be fair this might be a consequence of my cynical attitude! <br><br>As far as having to have the support of the people for IEDs. You could have the love of the people to plant them in their neighborhood, but their fear would work just as well. Nobody's going to tell the enemy that you put a bomb in the road if you tell them their next if they do. They'll just be smart enough to stay away from that part of the road. Of course in reality it would be both love and fear that would motivate them to keep their mouths shut. As fast the other weapons like missiles go. You need both the love and/or the fear of people to use those too. Support of the people to use them(on someone else besides them) or their fear that you'll use them on them if they oppose.<br><br>We seemed to be mostly in agreement and I'm greatly enjoying your other posts, thanks for the conversation!<br><br><a href=#c541815203692256659 title="comment permalink">7/6/14, 4:01 PM</a><br><br>

I hope you don’t mind but all that talk of 1914 makes me want to throw a couple of poems into the mix. Sometimes poetry can say things better than prose can. The first poem “On the idle Hill of Summer” was written by A E Houseman sometime before the outbreak of war in 1914. However it seems to describe well, the almost dream like state in which millions went off to war in 1914,even though many were aware that they might be going to their death. It also describes well the way that the drum beat of war speaks to something deep in the human psyche. Looking at what has gone on in Iraq, Syria and other places recently, it is clear that human nature has not changed and that the same forces that drew millions of men off to war in 1914 could do so today. The other poem “The parable of the old man and the young” quite accurately describes the attitudes of many of the politicians and statesmen of the day.<br><br>On the idle hill of summer,<br>Sleepy with the flow of streams,<br>Far I hear the steady drummer<br>Drumming like a noise in dreams.<br><br>Far and near and low and louder<br>On the roads of earth go by,<br>Dear to friends and food for powder,<br>Soldiers marching, all to die. <br><br>East and west on fields forgotten<br>Bleach the bones of comrades slain,<br>Lovely lads and dead and rotten;<br>None that go return again.<br><br>Far the calling bugles hollo,<br>High the screaming fife replies,<br>Gay the files of scarlet follow:<br>Woman bore me, I will rise. <br><br>A E Houseman<br> <br>So Abram rose, and clave the wood, and went,<br>And took the fire with him, and a knife.<br>And as they sojourned both of them together,<br>Isaac the first-born spake and said, My Father,<br>Behold the preparations, fire and iron,<br>But where the lamb for this burnt-offering?<br>Then Abram bound the youth with belts and straps,<br>and builded parapets and trenches there,<br>And stretchèd forth the knife to slay his son.<br>When lo! an angel called him out of heaven,<br>Saying, Lay not thy hand upon the lad,<br>Neither do anything to him. Behold,<br>A ram, caught in a thicket by its horns;<br>Offer the Ram of Pride instead of him.<br>But the old man would not so, but slew his son,<br>And half the seed of Europe, one by one.<br><br>Wilfred Owen<br><br><br><br><a href=#c423609767721836532 title="comment permalink">7/7/14, 5:40 AM</a><br><br>

There's soldiers who went through the Asian meat grinders. There's multitudes of people who watched employers shut down and relocate to China and, as a consequence, who watched their towns, their finances, their lives, their marriages, their families and futures disintegrate. <br><br>People may have missed the fact that whacking huge bonuses and unimaginable wealth accrued to execs doing the offshoring (and the oligarch masters) the first 10,000 times. But eventually they noticed. Millions of livelihoods wrecked and Wall Street rolls in money. <br><br>This has to be history's most idiotic business plan because if this isn't a sure-fire recipe for upheaval I don't know what is. Just think of the fortunes spent on Ivy League MBAs. Is this the plan they come up with? Is this what elite education buys? <br><br>Regardless, what's done is done. So maybe it's obvious that the demogogue will be the man with the plan and the helping hand but I'll bet it will be somebody that nobody would've guessed (and least of all the oligarchs). <br><br>We've seen it before. Like the little Corsican that ruled France. Or the Austrian with the goofy moustache that ruled Germany. How unlikely were these two men? How far outside the centers of power were they born and raised? Or the obscure KGB agent for that matter.<br><br><a href=#c7304921647210549161 title="comment permalink">7/7/14, 9:24 AM</a><br><br>

When a government has the resources, capability, and public support it can deal with rising anti-state violence pretty quickly. Of course when a state doesn't have the resources then those insurgencies will fester. This is called a low-intensity insurgency as opposed to high-intensity that we see in Ukraine or Iraq. In the United States don't expect us to go from nothing to high-intensity at the drop of a hat. Things will build slowly. So when I said that we will probably face a low-intensity insurgency in the next decade that's what I meant. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c1826640424808101190 title="comment permalink">7/7/14, 9:40 AM</a><br><br>

Science does not play well with chaos beyond a certain (and very short) time period. It is the realm of the Unexpected Consequence.<br><br>One thing that is important in dealing with chaos is intuition. Before I moved to Colorado, my left hand was more accurate than the meteorologists. We can forgive the weather folks for not being able to predict the weather accurately past three days, especially in the Southeast, but my left hand started hurting two days before severe storms, regardless of what the weather people said. Evidently, my left hand was sensitive to the same initial conditions that the weather danced to. So, the brain isn't a digital computer, it's an exquisite pattern processor and it's very well designed for dealing with chaos if it's well tuned.<br><br>But chaos is chaos, you don't deal with it on a scientific basis. Individuals can and do change world events, but it's often in ways they don't expect. My best guess is that we have to be responsible for our own lives and the way they affect the vast network of connectivity around us. We have to because we can't be responsible for others' lives and actions.<br><br><a href=#c7518095305777539511 title="comment permalink">7/8/14, 8:22 PM</a><br><br>
