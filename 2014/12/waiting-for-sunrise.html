<div class=MsoNormal>
By the time many of my readers get to this week’s essay here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, it will be Christmas Day. Here in America, that means that we’re finally most of the way through one of the year’s gaudiest orgies of pure vulgar greed, the holiday shopping season, which strikes me as rather an odd way to celebrate the birth of someone whose teachings so resolutely critiqued the mindless pursuit of material goodies. If, as that same person pointed out, it’s impossible to serve both God and Mammon, the demon of wealth, it’s pretty clear which of those two personages most Americans—including no small number who claim to be Christians—really consider the reason for the season.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A long time before that stable in Bethlehem received its most famous tenants, though, the same day was being celebrated across much of the northern temperate zone. The reason has to do with one of those details everyone knew before the invention of electric lighting and few people remember now, the movement of the apparent point of sunrise along the eastern horizon during the year. Before the printing press made calendars ubiquitous, that was a standard way of gauging the changing seasons: the point of sunrise swings from southeast to northeast as winter in the northern hemisphere gives way to summer and from northeast back to southeast as summer gives way again to winter, and if you have a way to track the apparent motion, you can follow the yearly cycle with a fair degree of precision. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This movement is like the swing of a pendulum: it’s very fast in the middle of the arc, and slows to a dead stop on either end. That makes the spring and fall equinoxes easy to identify—if you have a couple of megaliths lined up just right, for example, the shadow of one will fall right on the foot of the other on the days of the equinoxes, and a little to one side or the other one day before or after—but the summer and winter solstices are a different matter. At those times of year, the sun seems to grind to a halt around the 17th of June or December, you wait for about a week, and then finally the sun comes up a little further south on June 25th or a little further north on December 25th, and you know for a fact that the wheel of the seasons is still turning. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s why Christmas is when it is. I’ve read, though I don’t have the reference handy, that shepherds in the Levant back in the day kept watch over their flocks in the fields in late summer, not in December, and so—if the New Testament narrative is to be believed—Jesus was something like four months old when the first Christmas rolled around. As far as I know, nobody knows exactly how the present date got put in place, but I suspect the old solar symbolism had a lot to do with it; in those days, the Christian church was less prone to the rigid literalism that’s become common in recent centuries, and also quite aware of seasonal and astronomical cycles—consider the complicated rules for setting the date of Easter, in which movements of the sun and moon both play a part. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve been thinking quite a bit about such things as the holiday shopping season stumbles toward its end and a troubled, weary, and distracted nation prepares to bid a hearty good riddance to 2014. Of course Druids generally think about such things; the seasonal cycle has had an important role in our traditions since those were revived in the eighteenth century. Even so, it’s been more on my mind than usual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In particular, as I think about the shape of things in the world right now, what keeps coming to mind is the image of the old loremasters, waiting in the darkness at the end of a cold winter’s night to see the sunrise begin swinging back in the direction of spring.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who see such an image as hopelessly out of place just now have, I grant, quite a bit of evidence on their side. Most notably, the coming of 2015 marks a full decade since production of conventional petroleum worldwide hit its all-time peak and began to decline. Those who were around in the early days of the peak oil scene, as I was, will doubtless recall how often and eagerly the more optimistic members of that scene insisted that once the peak arrived, political and business interests everywhere would be forced to come to terms with the end of the age of cheap abundant energy. Once that harsh but necessary awakening took place, they argued, the transition to sustainable societies capable of living within the Earth’s annual budget of sunlight would finally get under way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of course that’s not what happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Instead, political and business interests responded to the peak by redefining what counts as crude oil, pouring just about any flammable liquid they could find into the world’s fuel tank—ethanol, vegetable oil, natural gas liquids, “dilbit” (diluted bitumen) from tar sands, you name it—while scraping the bottom of the barrel for petroleum via hydrofracturing, ultradeep offshore wells, and other extreme extraction methods. All of those require much higher inputs of fossil fuel energy per barrel produced than conventional crude does, so that a growing fraction of the world’s fossil fuel supply has had to be burned just to produce more fossil fuel. Did any whisper of this far from minor difficulty find its way into the cheery charts of “all liquids” and the extravagantly rose-colored projections of future production? Did, for example, any of the official agencies tasked with tracking fossil fuel production consider subtracting an estimate for barrels of oil equivalent used in extraction from the production figures, so that we would have at least a rough idea of the world’s <i>net</i> petroleum production?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Surely you jest. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The need to redirect an appreciable fraction of the world’s fossil fuel supply into fossil fuel production, in turn, had significant economic costs. Those were shown by the simultaneous presence of prolonged economic dysfunction and sky-high oil prices: a combination, please note, that last appeared during the energy crises of the 1970s, and should have served as a warning sign that something similar was afoot. Instead of paying attention, political and business interests around the world treated the abrupt fraying of the economy as a puzzling anomaly to be drowned in a vat of cheap credit—when, that is, they didn’t treat it as a public relations problem that could be solved by proclaiming a recovery that didn’t happen to exist. Economic imbalances accordingly spun out of control; paper wealth flowed away from those who actually produce goods and service into the hands of those who manipulate fiscal abstractions; the global economy was whipsawed by convulsive fiscal crisis in 2009 and 2009, and shows every sign of plunging into a comparable round of turmoil right now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I wish I could say that the alternative energy side of the equation had responded to any of this in a way that might point toward a better future, but no such luck. With embarrassingly few exceptions, the things that got funding, or even any significant amount of discussion, were the sorts of overpriced white-elephant systems that only make economic sense in the presence of lavish government subsidies, and are utterly dependent on a technostructure that’s only viable given exactly the sort of cheap abundant fossil fuels that those systems are theoretically going to replace. Grid-tied photovoltaic systems, gargantuan wind turbines, and vast centralized solar-thermal facilities soaked up the attention and the funding, while simple, affordable, thoroughly proven technologies such as solar water heating got another decade of malign neglect. As for using less—the necessary foundation for anything approaching a sustainable future—that remained utterly taboo in polite company.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Back in 2005, a then-famous study done for the Department of Energy by a team headed by Robert Hirsch showed that to get through declining oil supplies without massive crisis, preparations for the descent would have to begin twenty years before the peak arrived. Since the peak of conventional crude oil production had already arrived in 2005, this warning was perhaps a little tardy, but a crash program focusing on conservation and the conversion of energy-intensive infrastructure to less vulnerable technologies might still have done much. Instead, we collectively wasted another decade on daydreams—and all the while, week after dreary week, the mainstream media has kept up a steady drumbeat of articles claiming to prove that this or that or the other thing has disproved peak oil. Given all this, is there any reason to expect anything other than a continuation of the same dysfunctional behavior, with the blind leading the blind until they all tumble together down the long bitter slope ahead? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As it happens, I think there is. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Part of it, oddly enough, is the steady drumbeat of articles just referred to, each claiming to have disproved peak oil once and for all. The last time the subject was shouted down, in the early 1980s, there wasn’t that kind of ongoing barrage; after a few blandly confident denunciations, the subject just got dropped from the media so hard it would have left a dent on a battleship’s armored deck, and was consigned thereafter to a memory hole straight out of George Orwell. Presumably that was the intention this time, too, but something has shifted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the early 1980s, when the media started spouting the same sort of cornucopian drivel they’re engaged in this time, the vast majority of the people who claimed to be concerned about energy and the environment trotted along after them with scarcely a dissenting bleat. That hasn’t happened in the present case; if I may indulge in a bit of very edgy irony here, this is one of the very few ways in which it really is different this time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s worth glancing back over how that difference unfolded. To be sure, the brief heyday during which media reports took the end of the age of cheap abundant energy seriously stopped abruptly when puffing up the fracking bubble became the order of the day; the aforementioned drumbeat of alleged disproofs got going; those of us who kept on talking about peak oil started getting pressure from mainstream (that is, corporate-funded) environmentalists to drop the subject, get on board with the climate change bandwagon, and join them in the self-defeating rut that’s kept the environmental movement from accomplishing anything worthwhile for the last thirty years. In response, a certain number of bloggers and speakers who had been involved in peak oil discussions did in fact drop the subject, and those peak oil organizations that had committed themselves to a grant-funded organizational model fell on hard times. A fair number of us stayed the course, though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Far more significantly, so did a very substantial portion of our audience. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That latter point is the thing that I find most encouraging. Over the last decade, in the teeth of constant propaganda from the mass media and a giddy assortment of other sources, the number of people in the United States and elsewhere who are aware of the ongoing decline of industrial society, who recognize the impossibility of infinite growth on a finite planet, and who are willing to make changes in their own lives in response to these things, somehow failed to dwindle away to near-irrelevance, as it did the last time around. If anything—though I don’t have hard statistics to back this perception, just a scattering of suggestive proxy measurements—that number seems to have increased. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When I speak to audiences about catabolic collapse and the twilight of the industrial age these days, for example, I don’t get anything like as many blank looks or causal dismissals as those concepts routinely fielded even a few years ago. Books on peak oil and related topics, mine among them, remain steady sellers, and stats on this blog have zigzagged unevenly but relentlessly upwards over the years, regularly topping 300,000 page views a month this autumn. Less quantifiable but more telling, at least to me, are the shifts I’ve watched in people I know. Some who used to reject the whole idea of imminent and ongoing decline with scornful laughter have slowly come around to rueful admissions that, well, maybe we really are in trouble; others, starting from the same place, now denounce any such notion with the sort of brittle rage that you normally see in people who are losing the ability to make themselves keep believing the dogma they’ve committed themselves to defending. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even more telling are the young people I meet who have sized up the future with cold eyes, and walked away from the officially approved options spread before them like so many snares by a society whose easy promises a great many of them no longer believe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Each year that passes brings me more encounters with people in their late teens and twenties who have recognized that the rules that shaped their parents’ and grandparents’ lives don’t work any more, that most of the jobs they have been promised either don’t exist or won’t exist for much longer, that a college education these days is a one-way ticket to decades of debt peonage, and that most of the other<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>institutions that claim to be there to help them don’t have their best interests in mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They’re picking up crafts and skilled trades, living with their parents or with groups of other young people, and learning to get by on less, because the price of doing otherwise is more than they’re willing to pay. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
More broadly, more and more people seem to be turning their backs on the American dream, or more precisely on the bleak waking nightmare into which the American dream has metastasized over the last few decades. A growing number of people have walked away from the job market and found ways to support themselves outside a mainstream economy that’s increasingly stacked against them. Even among those who are still in the belly of the beast, the sort of unthinking trust in business as usual that used to be tolerably common straight through American society is increasingly rare these days. Outside the narrowing circle of those who benefit from the existing order of society, a crisis of legitimacy is in the making, and it’s not simply the current US political system that’s facing the brunt of that crisis—it’s the entire crumbling edifice of American collective life. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That crisis of legitimacy won’t necessarily lead to better things. It could all too easily head in directions no sane person would wish to go. I’ve written here more than once about the possibility that the abject and ongoing failure of constructive leadership in contemporary America could lay the groundwork for the rise of something closely akin to <a href=../../2014/02/fascism-and-future-part-three-weimar.html>the fascist regimes of Depression-era Europe</a>, as people desperate for an alternative to the Republicratic consensus frozen into place inside the Washington DC beltway turn to a charismatic demagogue who promises to break the gridlock and bring change. Things could also go in even more destructive directions; a nation that ships tens of thousands of its young people in uniform to an assortment of Middle Eastern countries, teaches them all the latest trends in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>counterinsurgency warfare, and then dumps them back home in a collapsing economy without the benefits they were promised, has only itself to blame if some of them end up applying their skills in the service of a domestic insurgency against the present US government. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those possibilities are real, and so are a galaxy of other potential outcomes that are considerably worse than what exists in America today. That said, constructive change is also a possibility. The absurd extravagances that most Americans still think of as an ordinary standard of living were always destined to be a short-term phenomenon, and we’re decades past the point at which a descent from those giddy heights could have been made without massive disruptions; no possible combination of political, social, economic, and environmental transformations at this point can change those unwelcome facts. Even so, there’s much worth doing that can still be done. We can at least stop making things worse than they have to be; we can begin shifting, individually and collectively, to technologies and social forms that will still make sense in a world of tightly constrained energy and resource supplies; we can preserve things of value to the near, middle, and far future that might otherwise be lost; we might, given luck and hard work, be able to revive enough of the moribund traditions of American democracy and voluntary association to provide an alternative down the road to the naked rule of force and fraud. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
None of that will be easy, but then all the easy options went whistling down the wind a long time ago. No doubt there will still be voices insisting that Americans can have the lifestyles to which they think they’re entitled if only this, or that, or the other thing were to happen; no doubt the collapse of the fracking bubble will be followed by some equally gaudy and dishonest set of cargo-cult rhetoric meant to convince the rubes that happy days will shortly be here again, just as soon as billions of dollars we don’t happen to have are poured down whatever the next rathole du jour happens to be. If enough of us ignore those claims and do what must be done—and “enough” in this context does not need to equal a majority, or even a large minority, of Americans—there’s still much of value that can be accomplished in the time before us.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To return to the metaphor that opened this post, that first slight shift of sunrise north along the horizon from the solstice point, faint as it is, is a reminder that winter doesn’t last forever, even though the coldest nights and the worst of the winter storms come after that point is past. In the same way, bleak as the immediate prospects may be, there can still be a future worth having on the far side of the crisis of our age, and our actions here and now can further the immense task of bringing such a future into being. In the new year, as I continue the current series of posts on the American future, I plan on talking at quite some length about some of the things that can be done and some of the possibilities that those actions might bring within reach. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And with that, I would like to wish my Christian readers a very merry Christmas, my readers of other faiths, a blessed holiday season, and to all my readers, a happy New Year. </div>

So we let the last two live, gave them names and their freedom. Now they provide us with endless entertainment as we watch their life and times unfold. Late summer, we ordered some real meat chickens because I have begun to learn that all chicken in this country, no matter how "organic" is an overbred, pathetic hybrid that cannot even reproduce and often die at 3 months from heart failure due to excessive growth. <br><br>These chickens have been a pleasure to raise, used to be terrorized by the two leghorns but now the leghorn rooster sees the possibilities for increasing his harem and is openly courting them. The other night he alllmost convinced two of them to come sleep over at his pad. We will let a few live, give us some eggs and see if they will raise chicks.<br><br>This spring I plan to open up a bit of meadow and try my hand at small grain raising. I may try the three sisters (corn, beans, squash) and/or some other things, like buckwheat or barley. If I can grow some corn and sunflower seeds, I might be able to provide a good bit of feed for the chickens which would actually be organic, as it is quite difficult to not have GMO feed for chickens.<br><br>So we are growing or raising a fair amount of our food, with an eye to providing even some staples, simplifying our lifestyle, selling a car and driving much less. We also bought some panels for a solar hot water system, but I don't know when he'll have time...meanwhile, to save on propane I have constructed out of a box about a cubed foot in size, padded the interior with various insulation, and tried bringing a long-cooking grain like rice or oatmeal to a boil, let it simmer about 5 minutes, and then put it in the box. You have to plan ahead because it does take longer, but you come back in an hour about, and it is done perfectly. In fact, the rice is fluffy. So, you've saved about 30-35 minutes of fuel. Another project this summer for which we have mirrors, is to construct a solar cooker.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c2566977781949534883 title="comment permalink">12/24/14, 7:09 PM</a><br><br>

Since I took advanced astronomy 3 times while I was an undergraduate, I learned to become aware of a variety of natural cycles.<br><br>Your analogy of the pendulum for the seasonal changes is very good. I knew that the rate of change in the length of the daylight portion of a day is at a maximum at the equinoxes and a minimum at the solstices.<br><br>Our society is changing so fast now that people don't have the time to adjust their perspective or modify their behavior to correspond to the changes taking place now and those that are likely to occur in the future. <br><br>For example, it is bordering on insanity for people to encourage one another to have more and more children, particularly in poor nations that are already overpopulated. The whole continent of Africa is undergoing a runaway population explosion, and many African nations can barely feed themselves as it is. Yet the ideas of birth control and family planning are all but ignored on that continent, as discovered a few years ago by Bill Ryerson of Post Carbon Institute. A major disaster awaits Africa. Other overpopulated nations can be expected to experience some sort of famine in the coming decades, such as India, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Lester R. Brown regards food as the weak link among critical resources today, even more than oil.<br><br>Dmitry Orlov surmises that a major disaster awaits the people in the USA as well. The people here are simply not prepared for the simplicity and austerity that awaits them, to say nothing of a growing police and surveillance state, as pointed out by Paul Craig Roberts among others. <br><br>As Paul Ehrlich pointed out, when consumption is factored in, the USA is one of the most overpopulated nations in the world.<br><br>To make matters worse, governments change even more slowly than individual people. Some are regressing. By and large, the former confederate states in the USA have no clue what's going on, have regressed back towards irrationality and religiosity, cannot think well enough to understand concepts such as Peak Oil, and still maintain a cornucopian perspective circa 1950.<br><br>Small countries (or sparsely populated ones such as Norway and Sweden) can make changes more quickly than larger ones. Hence I am inclined to agree with the recent remark of Nicole Foss that the nations that are most likely to weather the storm of the coming financial, economic and technological changes are the smaller ones whose economies are at least partially based around organic agriculture, and which are not too dependent on imports.<br><br>Costa Rica, New Zealand, Uruguay, Denmark, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and a few others come to mind. Maybe Switzerland should be included.<br><br>Anyway, I look forward to your weekly posts.

It is worth noting as well the simple possibility of disconnecting from the network and focusing in on ways to mentally change interpretations of scarcity and abundance. A lot of people are aware that lots of things do not abundance make. These folks, despite the predations of the madly possessed, will adjust well, and sustain. The Christmas you describe is a growing theme I hear from friends - and it is one of scarcity - of emotional and psychological scarcity. Many people are increasingly eager to bridge the gap that all this ... shtuff, puts between people, and between us and nature.<br><br>There is also an increasing sense of another kind of abundance than the industrial one. Not SUPERMANmarket abundance but chicken-in-the-yard, large leafy compost pile, fingers in the dirt, warm bodies moving in the sun and feeling the best virtual reality simulation ever, in the 4D world filled with real senses and a sense of deep time as well, in the garden. Just that simple step, seeing seeds spring into green with the sun and rain, seeing where it really, really all comes from - that it is given, not made, is such a promising awareness, even though much else that seems important, being that it seems to make us powerful, still has a hold on us. I would be remiss to fail to mention one of nature's most spectacular events - the daily sunrise and sunset, when the light feels so eternal, so momentous.<br><br> Folks in the yoga community generally have a lot to say about the art of letting go - that could well be a mantra of our generation, the people living through this next twenty years or so - we would all do well to entrain it - and keeping in mind that is no diminution of humanity to let go but rather a liberation from a possessive, unworthy lower power - such liberation permitting a reconnection to a higher power... we may well be watching the economy decline, and say good riddance, if only to all these "gifts" - how many times is that the toddler plays with the box rather than the toy in it? Heck you can give a kid a pile of dirt for free and he or she may well have more play time with that than all this plastic garbage. Life is a great thing in itself, not to be burdened with tons of baggage to carry around... in a magical bottomless bag hauled around by a guy who's fed too many cookies, and his eight pet reindeer....<br><br>Much thanks for your commitment to your work.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c2441959530275057033 title="comment permalink">12/25/14, 12:06 AM</a><br><br>

But the disaster is already occurring! Not only that, but it's fallen into the void of non-news, to the bemusement of news agencies. The Economist <a href=http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21612228-illegal-migration-causing-strains-across-continent-surge-sea rel=nofollow>writes</a>, "Another weekend, another two thousand-odd immigrants rescued by Italian sailors and coastguards in the Mediterranean. ... Stories of vessels entering Italian waters with four-figure human cargoes, which would have been front-page news a year ago, now barely warrant a mention." Even the New York Times had to <a href=http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/how-italy-became-the-refugees-gateway-to-europe/ rel=nofollow>admit</a> that the only major report on this issue since 2013 was done by Vice magazine.<br><br>It's not like the media are consciously covering this up, or that it's too much work to hand someone a camera -- Vice shows that it's entirely possible to produce <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPipuzDqPpM" rel=nofollow>a documentary</a> about it on the cheap. But what narrative does it fit into? There is a great and unstoppable movement of human mass across the Mediterranean right now. It is going on this very minute, boosted by Iraq 3.0 and the collapse of Libya, has been for several years, and probably will get worse in the second half of this decade. This doesn't fit into our narratives about <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2014/12/the_world_is_not_falling_apart_the_trend_lines_reveal_an_increasingly_peaceful.html?wpsrc=sh_all_dt_tw_top" rel=nofollow>everything getting better</a>, the quest for equality and freedom, the evil guys on the other political side trying to ruin it for us all.<br><br>Like JMG points out above, our only hope is that people will begin to recognize that what is happening in the real world isn't fitting into our narrative. So here is part of that hopeful message: while some Africans nations are still booming this year and will have a pleasant Christmas, in other nations oil-related collapse has already begun.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c4015553912631305155 title="comment permalink">12/25/14, 12:22 AM</a><br><br>

Quite simply the Faustian soul is finally exhausting itself completely and definitively. I reckon this would be the case about now even were peak oil/ climate change no problem. Quite simply people are getting bored with the empty Faustian ideal of transcendence into limitless space- its quite empty and lonely really. <br><br>Also I might have mentioned this before on this blog but I'll repeat anyway. One of the famous tech-copornican films often referred to is Back to the Future II where the hero's arrive in 2015 to find flying cars, self drying jackets and hover-boards etc etc. The failure of these predictions alone I reckon will add quit strongly to the sense of disenchantment felt by many westerners at the moment. (not accidentally too the film came out in 1988 or so- at the 'peak' of peak oil denialism).<br><br>As for your observations about the young, speaking as a young person I will add that even for persons who are not aware of the full ramification of the situation the fact remains, right in front of mine and the faces of my peers, that jobs are not easy to come by and study will land you in gratuitous amounts of student debt. Furthermore, there is no shortage of a general lack of enthusiasm for the dominant institutions of western society (big governments and corporations). Meanwhile the seeking of alternative ways is being increasingly popular. Wwoofing schemes are for example quite popular among western youths. I will repeat and stress here too, it isn't just a lack of jobs or resources that's getting us down, its a lack of meaning and purpose in what we do that is really biting. The Faustian soul really feels to be at its end. This does not of course mean whatever the youth do next will be good or constructive of course. still though, 'down to earth' type work (growing food, environmental work etc) does in my view anyway, hold a powerful sense of meaning for the youth of today. The problem for most of us is having an idea about where to start.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c7844884968052923563 title="comment permalink">12/25/14, 12:39 AM</a><br><br>

It didn't ask to make the sacrifice. Perhaps, in matters of sacrifice, it should only ever be something of ourselves, not the lives of other, not-really-consenting creatures? <br><br>In earlier times, living trees were hung with sacring decorations where they stood, until the end of the festive time; these offerings were then taken down and re-stored; or left to weather and evolve naturally back into the natural cycles. Additionally, my partner and I, at the Solstices and the Equinoxes, offer gifts directly to the trees themselves, of a kind which they would appreciate.<br><br>You can still see the decorated tree through the window, when you leave it where it is. You can even put presents under it for people to go out and find. Just now, the death of any tree is a small slip backwards. There can't be too many of them right now, alive and growing vigorously; possibly the best hope we have for a real, Gaian amelioration of the climate-shift careerings about of the weather; and without us having to do anything, beyond just leaving the trees, indeed the whole forests, safe to get on with doing what they do.

I don’t preach but hope to model a way of life that is not based on how much do you make? (wages and salary=worth), but how much do you make of living? (doing with less, growing our own, shedding what is no longer relevant, thinking of what needs to be preserved and how to make that happen).

The "birth story" we are told is an amalgamation of the two. Both stories are to some extent adding elements to the earlier Gospel of Mark and trying to explain to their contemporary audience how Jesus fits in with earlier prophetic scriptures.<br><br>For instance, Micah 5:2 it is foretold that the Messiah will be born in Bethlehem. This is the same question being asked by the crowd in John 7:41 when the crowd is confused about a Messiah from Galilei.<br><br>In Matthew, Mary has gone nowhere, she lives in Bethlehem and the wise men warn her that she needs to get away because of Hared. So after his birth they head to Egypt. On returning they are afraid of Harrods son, so they go to live in Galilei.<br><br>In Luke, there is a census, so they have to go to Bethlehem. There is no wise men or warning. So the parents have no reason not to go to the Temple in Jerusalem - where Jesus is swooned over by the prophetic Simeon and Anna. The Simeon and Anna story can't be made to fit well, so it is not included in the generic stories, and is usually brought up at the pulpit in isolation of the other pieces of the birth story.<br><br>Many of the other pieces in the two stories variously relate to earlier scriptural references to the messiah.<br><br>Outside the gospels, other than some disputed passages in Josephus, there is no contemporary recording of Jesus' life. The earliest written references to Jesus in the bible were written by St. Paul who did not meet the living Jesus. Paul does not have any great interest in the details of Jesus' life. Like John, he has a very involved spirituality that does not require exacting biographical detail.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c5131818141259872540 title="comment permalink">12/25/14, 7:00 AM</a><br><br>

This has made them a bit more receptive to discussions about the instability of the system in which they have been raised.

From the essay:<br><br><i>"...while simple, affordable, thoroughly proven technologies such as solar water heating got another decade of malign neglect.</i><br><br>Well, yes and no. While adoption of solar thermal; water heating, passive solar heating of structures, etc.) has been slow in the energy-saturated west, these technologies have made significant progress, especially in the water heating area. The evacuated tube water heating assembly I installed this summer, replacing our old home-built flat panels, works magnificently. JMG did a series some time back on technologies that may survive the technological bottleneck ahead, and vacuum tubes (for electronics) was one of those things. The evacuated tube water heater is simply a group of vacuum tubes (blown glass) with a sealed copper tube/fin assembly in the center which collects heat and transfers that heat to a simple copper manifold through which the water you wish to heat flows. There's a bit of 'phase-change' that occurs (liquid turning to gas inside the copper tube- AKA: boiling) which improves the efficiency.<br><br>These assemblies, courtesy of the Chinese, are now very affordable, and my assessment is that they could remain functional for decades. Not much to go wrong. Indeed, the most complex part of the system is the water pump and its controller. Glass tubes, copper, and a little liquid. I showed one of the tubes (every system I looked at came with spares in case of breakage) to my local glass blower friend and he said he could make them easily in his studio. He noted (later confirmed) that this is simply technology adopted from the production of florescent tube lighting.<br><br>I predict that this is one seemingly complex, though actually quite simple, technology that could be maintained in a technological collapse scenario.<br><br>Meanwhile, I highly recommend this solution for those who have interest in producing hot water (lots of it) with minimal inputs. We use the surplus for space heating (hydronic flooring), but mostly enjoy long hot showers, fairly guilt free; something of a medical necessity in our home.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c9101166891168566407 title="comment permalink">12/25/14, 7:49 AM</a><br><br>

The earliest known date reference for the nativity of Christ was the <i>'Chronography'</i> of 354AD, which listed Dec 25th as the birthdate of Christ and also the feast day of 'Sol Invictus', the composite deity the Romans cobbled together from their native Sol, the Persian Mithra(s) and the Syrian Elah-Gabal. Under the Julian calendar which was currently in force in the Roman world, the solstice fell on the 25th. Although we have reformed the calendar since, we kept the nominal date intact, failing to reform it in line with the rest of the year.<br><br>On a more theological basis, Sextus Julius Africanus calculated from scripture that the Incarnation (like Creation) occurred on March 25th (the erstwhile vernal equinox) and a standard nine-month gestation leads to Christ's birth nine months later on the winter solstice (25th Dec at the time). <br><br>Other churches adopted different dates for the Nativity (eg Jan 6th in the Antiochene church), and the Western church only formally accepted Christmas as a ritual festival on Dec 25th in 527AD following the lead of Denis the Small (Dionysius Exiguus).<br><br>Interestingly, Sir Isaac Newton, who was born on December 25 himself, argued from scripture that the solstice was chosen for the Nativity in order to fulfil a prophecy of Malachi referring to Christ as the 'Sun of righteousness'.<br><br>Whether one celebrates the solstice, the <i>'Dies Natalis Solis Invicti'</i>, Christmas, Jul, Shab-e Chelleh or any of the other 1001 pagan variants, the psychological purpose of the event is clear, namely to inject some hope and light into the darkest days of winter - and 2014 is proving to be one of the darkest we have encountered for quite some time. I absolutely agree that the crass materialistic excess that has infected the season only adds to the darkness. <br><br>I don't have any idea how it could be enforced, but I'd love to see the principle that people should only be allowed to 'celebrate' Christmas if they also observe Lent. Observance of Lent would be more appropriate preparation for our likely future, I believe, and the benefit of a ritual cycle surely can't be appreciated if it isn't observed 'in the round'.<br><br>All that said, the season's greetings to one and all!<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c3338714691583980245 title="comment permalink">12/25/14, 7:52 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you. It is refreshing to see glimmers of hope despite the grim picture. I found myself thinking of the Arab Spring when I read your article. There, despite decades of oppression and press censorship, and perhaps because of social media and cellphones, millions took to the streets and the weight of those masses caused nearly a dozen governments to fall. It took that - millions of people in the streets, silent, standing there, expressing disapproval, to bring change. Then of course it all has collapsed, over there, because those nations hadn't the history or institutions to take action and follow through. But here in America, if and when millions take to the streets, perhaps our two century legacy of law and institution and occasional leadership will enable us to follow through, and wrench this nation and culture from mindless growth and gimme gimme gimme to what the original founder intended - a nation of men and women making their lives in some form of peace and freedom and responsibility. We aren't there yet, by any means, but we may get there, in time....<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c2722570838945708547 title="comment permalink">12/25/14, 10:24 AM</a><br><br>

One is that whenever a crisis such as an extreme weather event (flash flood, tornado, 20 inch snowfall, etc.) closes down the city where I live (Minneapolis) it always seems to bring out the best in most people, contrary to conventional wisdom. People who were flipping each other out on the road the day before won't hesitate to pull over, jump out of their cars and help complete strangers stuck in the ditch with a level of enthusiasm that leaves you breathless. I've seen it happen many times. People will check up on their neighbors, share whatever they have with each other and show a kind of civic responsibility that seems lacking in ordinary times. I think that's why many of us look forward to disruptions in "business as usual"- for the sense of comradeship it seems to bring out in others... The other thing that gives me hope is the incredible social and political awareness I'm witnessing in young people these days. I've been involved in direct action campaigns for years and I've never seen such diversity (all ages and ethnicities) and political maturity among the younger crowd as I have in the current "Black Lives Matter" movement. The incredible solidarity, courage and organizational and leadership skills I've witnessed in recent actions have left elders like me staring in wide eyed wonderment. In short, I believe I'm experiencing the waning of the "Me Generation" and the rise of a new generation of humans who are watching each other's backs and seem to know instinctively that survival depends upon cooperation and sometimes personal sacrifice because "an injury to one is an injury to all", as the saying goes. I'm looking forward to your take on the cultural shift that is taking place right now.

Most societies in the northern hemisphere had some sort of quasi-religious celebration to mark the winter solstice.

But astrologically the 21st was the end of Sagittarius ruled by jolly Jupiter and the beginning of Cappricorn ruled by Saturn. <br><br>Since the Saturnalia was a rowdy holiday, early Christians might have decided to compete with their own holiday of a more sedate nature near the solstice. <br><br>It would have made sense in the dead of winter to celebrate with evergreens and yule logs in the far northern reaches to represent rebirth and the return of light and greenery and to bring in the sacred mistletoe and maybe do some erotic doings underneath. <br><br>Recall in "The"Golden Bough" the author's observation that customs are immortal though religions come and go.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c7017412994184943770 title="comment permalink">12/25/14, 11:48 AM</a><br><br>

Conspicuous consumption, bragging rights over the expense of toys, TVs, etc. played, again, by merchandisers, has lead to expectations of piles of dollars beneath that Yule tree.

They laid him in a "manger" - that word comes to western languages from the latin vulgate, which itself is a translation of the greek. The greek word used there in the NT is the same word used for the Hebrew word "sukkah" everywhere it appears in the LXX. The reason the inns were full is that women and children are not obligated in the oral tradition to live in the sukkah for the 7 days, only men were. The shepherds who supposedly visited are part of the sukkot liturgy developed in the Hasmonean era and still used to this day - each night one of the 7 founding fathers ( and modernly, their wives, too) visit in spirit (Abraham, Isaac Jacob, Moses, Aaron, David, &amp; Solomon). Even the theme of Joy to the World is part of it, as the sacrifices offered were supposed to represent all the known nations of the world, and the prophet Zechariah mentions all nations would come to observe sukkot in the end of days. And so on - the story related in the NT dovetails amazingly to the liturgy, but all references to Judaism were stripped out of the official Christian texts and obscured with the non-historically verified census during Herod's reign. They even got the year wrong, as Herod died in 4bce (if I recall correctly).<br><br>And of course, Christmas was substituted because there was no way they could outlaw observance of Dec 25th and expect anybody to comply...if you can't beat em, join em, I guess. Ditto for easter (feast of ishtar).<br><br>On the other point, some of us are moving slowly because we're just not sure what to do. A lot of people say get a wood burning stove, for example. Ok, so, after the first year the US becomes like the first energy crisis and becomes completely denuded of trees. Then what? Or, learn to hunt. Well, again, a year or so and even all the rats and feral pets have been eaten - then what? Grow and preserve food is a good idea, as long as the starving neighbors don't find out you have stores laid up. In a crisis, it won't be a good idea to look well fed, I am guessing. <br><br>How do you decide? Solar and wind home systems are too expensive for most people without going into debt - but debt is bad and to be avoided at all costs. Small measures are helpful, but won't solve big problems when push comes to shove. Big measures draw attention to your home and basically advertise you have resources other people don't...<br><br>The consequences of choosing a mistake can be as bad as doing nothing at all, it would seem. (I am not advocating doing nothing!) I think more people would act if they felt more confident. I am just not sure where to find that confidence.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c5223532416871207371 title="comment permalink">12/25/14, 2:22 PM</a><br><br>

That was the best present I have received. Still, while the days will slowly get longer, the coldest weather of winter is yet to come. That's what I'm focusing on from your post. Even though I think you are right that a shift toward taking limits seriously is in process, I also think you are right that things will get worse before they get better. How long before the metaphorical spring arrives I don't know. Maybe not while I'm still alive. But as a gardener I know that the most appropriate activity for the coldest part of winter is preparation for the spring to come: planning the garden, figuring out what seeds need to be obtained and getting them, repairing tools, analyzing the previous season's results and learning from them. All those seem to me to have their analogs in work to be done as decline continues.

Thank you for this week. A message of hope is much welcome and much needed as this year winds to a close. There's been so much pain and frustration this year, deaths, systemic injustices that are driving people rapidly from frustration to outrage, to warfare. You offered us this on the day after we all cringed while the fundamentals of the global economy tumbled a little further down while the DOW Industrial average soared past 18000. I'm visiting my father this weekend for what may be our last holiday together as he moves into the final stages of a long battle with cancer just a week after losing my grandfather to hospital transmitted pneumonia while being treated for a minor hip injury. My father and I have been talking about crafts and skills. Where to start a path on the trade skills that draw me. He's a guitar builder and woodworker, and tried to impart his practice onto me when I was a teenager but it never stuck and never interested me since I was so caught up in thinking the only way to make a difference for the future was through activism. I deeply regret not having spent the time in his shop when I was young, but we've been talking about ways to carry that artisan spirit on and where I can start. Shoemaking has a special tie to the gods and myths that feed me and dad dabbled in leatherwork once upon a time. He doesn't get peak oil or environmentalism of any of that, but talking about crafting and trade skills and reading through the Green Wizardry handbook together has made us closer than ever even though our time together is short now. The lesson of this year has been to cherish life, to cherish the years of stability, make use of them, and to hold friends and family close. We don't know how long they may be with us.<br><br>Every time I read this blog and think on these themes, especially over the course of this year the words of Paul Simon have rung in my head as the song that defines our age more than any (a song, fittingly enough written during the oil crises of the '70s)<br><br>"I don't know a soul that's not been battered<br>I don't have a friend who feels at ease<br>I don't know a dream that's not been shattered<br>Or driven to it's knees<br><br>Oh but it's alright, it's alright<br>We've lived so well so long<br>Still when I think of the road we're traveling on<br>I wonder what's gone wrong<br>I can't help it, I wonder what's gone wrong."<br><br>Thank you for giving a light in the dark of the year...

I've always thought of Jewish space as warm and open, and had a personal affinity for it. As a gen X'er, I must say your observations regarding fellow millennials are spot on. I'm encouraged by the small fraction aware of and preparing for our predicament, as well as concerned and downright depressed regarding the screen addicted. I've read too many negative studies regarding mental and brain damage/alteration from screen usage, and it is very distressing to witness the damage among so-called" digital natives" I fervently hope that in the not-too-distant future, when we see a screen in the hands of a minor, we will react with the same disgust and horror as if it were cigarettes. Perhaps I'm too hopeful. Thanks for reminding me of my intention to contact and get involved with the Radical Faeries. <br>Clay, <br>I wanted to 2nd your observations regarding youth and the" ghetto", certainly that's exactly what I see in Lexington's north side.<br>I'm just so glad that heads are coming out of posteriors, or maybe never entering posteriors in the first place for so many of today's youth.

If the world's gonna hate America, and you're going to emigrate, make sure you're vocal about renouncing your native country.

I am definitely not the smartest person in the room here, which always means I am in a good place to help me evolve.<br>I, too, have observed a profound skepticism in many young people that business as usual will continue. Perhaps it is more instinctive than knowledge based, for many of them. But the younger people I meet do sense that a new way of life is coming, ready or not.<br>I am concerned about what everyone else will do, the millions who refuse to even consider industrial decline. For quite a few years now in America a large portion of the population has been angry, and most of them do not know who or what to direct their anger towards. (Just listen to AM radio.) It's like living in a town where half the citizens are psychotic. The darkness of it all reminded me of a Lew Welch poem:<br> "The Basic Con Those who can't find anything to live for,<br>always invent something to die for.<br>Then they want the rest of us to<br>die for it, too."<br>Those of us who have plenty to live for will know people who are stocking up on ammunition to defend their stored wealth.

I am on the side of staying in a place you know, or "digging in," as Gary Snyder would say. To live like a human being, I think it is a great advantage to deeply know the local ecosystem and seasons and have a well established community.

Now I use the word "previously", because due to cuts in government expenditure, she is now unemployed and I only discovered this fact after a bit of a ribbing as I caught her surfing the Interweb whilst at lunch. The truth about the unemployment status then rolled out. Honestly I never considered that the person in question may have been worriedly perusing job advertisements during a lunch.

Contrary to the popular belief (which was repeated here by people in the comments), Christmas was not instituted on December 25th to counteract Saturnalia, Dies Natalis Solis Invictii, or the winter solstice. <br><br>Christmas was officially "locked in" in 354, and Solis Invictii was instituted in 274, but Christmas was held as December 25th at least since the mid-third century. Sextus Africanus mentions in 220 AD that the Annunciation was March 25th, for instance (and nine months later, Christ was born obviously). This and a few other pieces of evidence suggest that, if anything, Sol Invictus was instituted in an attempt to thwart Christianity, not the other way around (assuming that Aurelian implemented the Dec 25th celebration at all, which is based on debatable evidence).<br><br>There is additional evidence as well. From Scripture and Tradition, it's clear that Christ was born six months after St. John the Baptist (Luke 1:26). Zacharias in Luke received his vision concerning St. John while executing his priestly duties, which was associated with Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement). In fact, the Dead Sea Scrolls confirm this, that Zacharias was the functioning priest in September, being from Abijah's lineage. <br><br>So Zacharias received the vision of his wife conceiving a child in September, and Elizabeth gave birth in June. The Annunciation happened when Elizabeth was in her sixth month, which was March (25th). So Christ was born on December 25th.<br><br>This all ties into one thing that just strikes me as utterly baffling, namely that modern scholars working with fragmentary records of events nearly two thousand years ago on a subject they aren't personally attached to think they know history much better than the people who actually lived in those times and dedicated their lives to these things. It seems like common sense that the Apostles and their successors would've known the details and passed them on, doesn't it? They did record the story and die for their testimony. <br><br>And would all of Christianity just shrug their shoulders if, after centuries, some emperor changed the date of Christmas to override a pagan festival? I suspect most Americans today care less about the Fourth of July than Christians did about the birth of Christ, but everyone would flip out if Obama tried to change it to, say, February 23rd. And if some historian from the year 2861 published a paper claiming that Independence Day was actually in February based upon fragments of a Cosmo article he found, we'd probably think he was an idiot.<br><br>Let's give the ancients a little credit, eh? Do the dates of St. John the Baptist's and Christ's births line up extremely well with the solstices? Absolutely. But I'd expect no less from the Creator of the Earth and its seasons. (And I might note that we Catholics can't go three days without some sort of feast day, so something was bound to stick somewhere.)<br><br>Not trying to create a big brouhaha over this whole bit. It's just a subject I know a little about and it's a story I've heard repeated so many times that my eye twitches a little when I see it.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c1774673737501909196 title="comment permalink">12/26/14, 1:11 AM</a><br><br>

This is a classic astrological signature for limits on oil (which is ruled by Neptune and Jupiter), and the price upheavals we are seeing now reflect the forming square. The aspect will not become exact until November, but it will be close most of 2015, and there will be two more exact aspects of those two planets in June and September of 2016. Jupiter will get the party off the ground in September of 2015. <br><br>I expect prices and markets for Crude Oil to be on a major roller-coaster over the next two years, and the reality of Peak Oil to really begin to sink in to the mass consciousness, which may presage a widespread willingness to bow to the necessity of conservation (no, I’m not holding my breath). Of course Saturn and Neptune can also herald the materialization of visionary technology, so I am hopeful — given this and other cosmic patterns — that there may be some breakthroughs in small-scale, efficient, renewable energy technologies, as well. <br><br>Thanks for another great post, and blessings of the season to you.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c5172831366213510000 title="comment permalink">12/26/14, 2:35 AM</a><br><br>

For me, the obvious things are to minimize expenses, and the most obvious of these is to cook your own food, planning for adequate nutrition at minimum cost. Minimize transportation costs by careful route planning and by getting no more vehicle than you actually need (if any). Minimize heating costs by insulating yourself first, then your home. Even if you're renting, you can add insulating window coverings and seal drafts. <br> <br>We just installed grid-tied solar panels (not a permanent solution, but a step in the right direction).

As a historian and someone who commonly translates obscure texts from foreign languages, I'm sure you can appreciate that problem:<br><br><i>[evangelical scholar Rev Ian] Paul argues that the Greek word, "kataluma," usually translated as “Inn” was in fact used for a reception room in a private house – the same term is used to describe the “upper room” where Jesus and his disciples ate the last supper. An entirely different word, "pandocheion," is used to describe an “Inn” or any other place where strangers are welcomed.<br><br>Even if there were an inn in Bethlehem, Paul argues, Joseph and Mary would not have been staying there. The only reason for them to travel to Bethlehem for the census was because he had family there and if he did, the customs of first-century Palestine required him to stay with relatives and not with strangers.<br><br>In that context, the kataluma where he stayed would not have been an Inn, but a guest room in the house of the family where Joseph and Mary were staying. That could very well have been full with other relatives who had arrived before them.<br><br>“The actual design of Palestinian homes (even to the present day) makes sense of the whole story,” Paul writes. “Most families would live in a single-room house, with a lower compartment for animals to be brought in at night, and either a room at the back for visitors, or space on the roof. The family living area would usually have hollows in the ground, filled with straw, in the living area, where the animals would feed.”<br><br>So Jesus would not have been born in a detached stable, but in the lower floor of a peasant house, where the animals were kept.</i><br><br>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/23/jesus-christ-not-born-in-stable-theologian-new-testament<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c678066864023583785 title="comment permalink">12/26/14, 11:15 AM</a><br><br>

It does need more insulation, we have figured out. We will be starting to garden in earnest this spring, but we do have a raised bed of garlic out right now. I do cook at home, learned canning at a young age, and have a few useful skills not common among the younger generation. We have five rain barrels ready to install in the spring as well. We have two paid for cars that will not be replaced when they finally die - we are strategically located within walk/bike distance of both our jobs, a grocery store, a ymca, and are only a block and a half from the bus stop. The kitchen in this house was a joke-the previous owners must have eaten out all the time, because it was a glorified closet with no counters, but we have space now for canning, drying and preserving as well as serious cooking. I have installed lines for drying laundry in the basement, so we only use the dryer to fluff things occasionally...that will knock a good 20%+ off your electric bill we found. We are well on our way to getting the small stuff worked out.

I can't help but daydream about some kind of solar thermal underground, in which sinister figures meet in the dark corners of vegetarian restaurants to pass old Zomeworks plans from hand to hand...<br><br>Chris, exactly. For all the turmoil and suffering that the endgame of the current order of things is going to involve, there are also gains.<br><br>Tom B., and that's also an issue. I should probably do a post one of these days on the manufacture of boredom by industrial societies -- a case could be made that that's far and away their biggest product -- and how that relates to the failure of the Faustian dream of transcendence through infinite expansion into the void. <br><br>Bogatyr, and a slightly belated <i>Nadolig llawen</i> to you too. I do celebrate Christmas as well as the solstice, yes -- one of the advantages of being a Druid is that it includes that sort of flexibility as a standard feature. <br><br>Phil, I've never lived outside the US, and the last thing the rest of the world needs is one more cluelessly parochial American telling it what to do. I'd encourage those who want blogs like this one, discussing the rest of the world, to get busy writing them!<br><br>Ed, exactly. It's a routine pleasure of mine to pull out one of Toynbee's volumes, sit down, and find myself considering some aspect of history from a wholly unfamiliar angle; he's good at that. <br><br>Phil, glad to hear that CAT is still chugging away -- as, of course, is the stone circle.

It's going to take a lot of hard work to get anyone to start treating science again as something other than an ideological weapon. <br><br>Edde, thank you! One more good reason to disconnect as much of your life as possible from the failing infrastructure of the old order...<br><br>Gail, many thanks. I'm heartened by the number of people who've commented that they also see the first whispers of change -- and when it's in the children, that's the most encouraging thing of all. <br><br>Russell, so? "Myths are things that never happened and always are," said Sallust. I'm by no means sure I'd agree with him about "never happened," but he's got one thing right -- the meaning and validity of a spiritual narrative does not depend on the historicity of the descriptive details. <br><br>Andrew, you're welcome and thank you!<br><br>GHung, I didn't mean to imply that solar thermal technologies aren't around, and haven't been improved -- it impresses me that gains so significant have been achieved in what is, by most measures, a mature technology. In a saner society, there would be solar water heater panels on every roof in the US sunbelt, and a lot of roofs outside it; it's the complete indifference to such a logical and obvious step that I had in mind. <br><br>Violet, it's quite possible that the Magian model is being revived here. One of the places where Spengler and Toynbee both fall down is in failing to grasp that there's nothing necessarily wrong, and may be many good things, about retaining the worldview and practices of a culture that is long past its creative age. Magian civilization is still alive, in Judaism, the Muslim world, and a number of other manifestations; it doesn't surprise me to hear that young people with a foot in both worlds are discarding a failing Faustian system and turning to something that has a tolerably good track record of surviving under harsh conditions. <br><br>Tony, I think that's an excellent idea! Our cultures' habit of cherrypicking the happy celebrations and ignoring the difficult ones -- or turning them into sticky-sweet parodies of themselves, as happened with All Hallow's Eve -- has little to recommend it. <br><br>Unhinged, I didn't even try to avoid laughing. That's quite the impressive bit of unintentional comedy. Thank you. <br><br>Clay, where is your shop, and in what city? It sounds like the kind of place I should visit one of these days. <br><br>David, yes, I've been tracking that. If anyone needed the best possible evidence that our current elite classes are acting like drooling morons, the way the current system treats its discarded vets is it. <br><br>Patrick, the first couple of times somebody mentioned that, I misread the typo! I may just leave it for the sake of entertainment; it was supposed to be 2008 and 2009, of course.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c4692601453365266633 title="comment permalink">12/26/14, 4:31 PM</a><br><br>

Change is a tricky thing, and it's by no means safe to assume that any change must be an improvement. <br><br>Goldmund, thanks for the report from the trenches! I hope those same young people are also realizing that they have to change their own lives, to become the change they seek in the world, as Gandi said -- to my mind, the thing that doomed the activism of the Me Generation to futility was exactly their unwillingness to put their own lifestyles on the line. <br><br>Lewis, funny. There are people putting up megaliths all over the world at this point -- many but not all of them are part of the Druid community -- but they're not designer megaliths, except to the extent that somebody usually designs the placement and the astrological alignments. No, the old-fashioned bare rock look is still very much in style. ;-)<br><br>Mundanomaniac, you probably won't be surprised to know that I cast the Capricorn ingress chart for the US in the runup to the solstice!<br><br>Therese, of course there was more -- there always is. Cultural phenomena are normally overdetermined, with many different needs, drives, and causes feeding into each detail. <br><br>Brad, very likely. I tend to think of it as the normal concomitant of end-stage decadence: when you have nothing else to live for, no source of meaning or value, and nothing to look forward to except more of the same until you die, you go shopping. <br><br>Carl, excellent! You get this evening's gold star, for saying to heck with popularity and doing the right thing instead. <br><br>Ahavah, thanks for the data. As for confidence, the best way to find it is to just go ahead and find something to do, and when that's done, find something else. <br><br>Raven, maybe a Solon, maybe a Catiline...<br><br>SLClaire, exactly. Making sure the house is as stormproofed as possible is another important detail! <br><br>Donalfagan, I saw that!

How that rage will end up playing out is one of the wild cards just now. <br><br>Rita, thanks for the recommendation. <br><br>Cherokee, the one thing that's kept that sort of thinking in the minority here in the US is that we've been in prolonged and worsening economic dysfunction for decades. Everybody knows people who, despite education, training, excellent skills, and a good employment record, have been out of work for years and can't even get a job flipping burgers. It's only in the more privileged end of the upper middle class that any degree of confidence that the jobs will always be there can be found here. <br><br>Avalterra, best wishes on the job and relocation! <br><br>Derv, the concept of history is a social construct, and people in the 3rd century CE understood it in ways that don't have a lot in common with ours. For that matter, consider the concept of book authorship -- in the classical world, publishing a book under the name of some distinguished figure of the past was considered an honorable and respectful thing to do, rather than an act of forgery! The literalism I noted in my post is very much a modern habit, and its application to dates presupposes the modern concept of uniform quantitative time -- which, again, the ancients didn't have. Nor is it any kind of insult to the ancients to note that they had a different sense of time -- one that in many ways is more functional than ours.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c3960286782324310222 title="comment permalink">12/26/14, 5:02 PM</a><br><br>

An area that was once it's own town called Albina. After World War II the shipyard workers who had been brought in from the South to build Liberty Ships were forced in to this wedge shaped section of Stumptown through redlining and discriminatory housing policies in the rest of Portland. For the next 50 years it was an economically downtrodden and segregated part of the city. This all changed in the early 2000's when young people discoverd the, close proximity, cheap rents and excellent building stock that survived the destructive redevelopment l found in the fancier parts of town. The discovery of this part of town has come at a price as rents have been rising lately, and vacant lots with urban gardens have been sacrificed to large apartments to capatalize on the newfound coolness of the area. The original inhabitants are being priced out and have had to move to the outer fringes of the city where things are cheaper. But at least the new apartments are being built without any automobile parking. I can only hope that the short term building boom we are currently experiencing will end while we still have enough empty space in the neighborhood to grow food. <br><br>If you are ever back in this part of the country ,let me know, and I will be happy to show you around and buy you a beer in a local brewpub.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c2629422357604069083 title="comment permalink">12/26/14, 5:35 PM</a><br><br>

With any air sealing measures, be sure that there is adequate moisture control, and combustion air to anything that needs it. Don't fail to tighten a house up because of moisture issues. Instead, fix the moisture issues first. If necessary, put a membrane across the basement floor. If a cardboard box falls apart if left on the concrete, it's too wet. If there's exposed damp soil or gravel over damp soil, it's too wet.<br><br>Vent damp air at the source. Use your shower fan. Use your stove fan. If you need new ones, look into a heat recovery ventilator instead, which will get rid of the moisture but keep most of the heat.<br><br>Get a humidity gauge, a thermometer, and a hygrometric chart, and learn how to use all three together to understand dew point. If there's a surface that's below dew point, water will condense there. Work at air sealing your walls so that warm moist air from inside doesn't get part way through the wall and condense.<br><br>If your house is too dry in the winter it's because it's too leaky. If your house is too damp it's because you don't have enough moisture control. <br><br>Remember: Warm air rises, but heat moves in any direction by convection, conduction, and radiation. A well air sealed (and moisture controlled) house will feel a fairly constant temperature throughout, and will have a warm basement. Don't forget to insulate, air seal, and moisture proof the basement. It's often the single most cost effective thing you can do.<br><br>[/rant] <br><br><br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c1241113927265019994 title="comment permalink">12/26/14, 7:37 PM</a><br><br>

There are obviously a number of differing cultural conceptions that go into various approaches to history, but I do stand by my claim that Christ was really born on December 25th. There's a decent bit of evidence to back it. You may well say they didn't care about the literal date, and may be right in many cases (though the Easter date controversy of the 4th-5th centuries shows that particular dates really were important to many ancients). <br><br>I was just commenting as an aside how baffling I find it that so many people, including historians, start from the assumption that ancient claims carry no value and should be dismissed as the mad ramblings of backwards people.

For some reason I thought you would take a break this week and it was a delightful surprise to see this article.<br><br>When I hit the spot where you observed that 'this time around the reaction is different' I really sat up because I haven't yet noticed this. This time around I am simply ducking my head and silently carrying on. I have found my town friends simply seize upon issues or inventions to say, "all will be fine". They then send me links to something like gel-battery research, or Tesla, and remark how this will be the game changer, meanwhile plan and purchase a one month all-inclusive to Costa Rica. Another friend finally obtained his sky-diving license/certification as if flying helicopters in the high arctic isn't risky enough. Now he can legally jump out of perfectly good airplanes for fun. Other friends are planning retirement in 5,000 sq/ft homes (two grandparents need a lot of room you know). As for passing on to them little gems about 'infinite growth on a finite planet is most likely impossible', well, they don't even want to think about it much less listen to me. What I have noticed is the subtle change in our relationships as we drift apart and lessen our contact frequency. <br><br>Let me share our with you and other readers our Christmas and plans from northern Vancouver Island. We have some very good local friends who live a similar lifestyle. I went out and bought lots of good alcohol to supplement my wine offerings. We instructed them to not bring a thing, and if they felt like visiting instead of being at home on Christmas Eve, then please stop in. The house was warm and cosy from the woodstove, the radio played bluegrass, and the table was laden with food and every kind drink but you had to help yourselves! It was a blast. Instead of buying a bunch of useless crap for Christmas I made furniture for family and a dollhouse for my grand daughter. Those presents will last as long as they live.<br><br>Tomorrow, we start a week of supposed sun. I plan to take my 36 year old restored trail 110 and a small chainsaw and will cut out the many windfalls on a 6km washed out road that ends up at a deserted logging camp on Johnstone Strait. There are two fallen down old buildings on a beautiful bay surrounded by rocky bluffs. The next day I will bottom fish off the rocks for cod...maybe a halibut. Usually, I use a boat but it is winterized and the season is closed, anyway. I suppose this would be called poaching. I will then fillet the fish leaving the scraps for the eagles and we will enjoy fresh fish and chips that night.<br><br>The only noise will be an occasional tugboat or gulls. There will be sea lions and seals to curse (if they get too close and inspect my lines). I will have a thermos of tea and a fire to sit by.<br><br>That is Christmas on the west coast.<br><br>regards<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c3126788360875776067 title="comment permalink">12/27/14, 7:38 AM</a><br><br>

In our area, most people heat their water with electricity, and when people ask how my new solar water heater is working out, I tell them; <i>"it just works great. Think about that the next time you pay your electric bill since a big chunk of that is hot water."</i><br><br>Payback for solar hot water is quite short; two to three years in many areas. The other hook is that our state and federal tax credits pay back 65% of the costs; tax credits that can be used over five tax seasons. Our $2500 investment drops to less than $900. For many folks, that will mean a payback of a year or less, all things considered. Even without the credits it's a bargain, financially. Appealing to people's financial insanity is quite affective. See examples of complete systems <a href="http://www.dudadiesel.com/search.php?query=%2Bfull+%2Bsolar&amp;i=info_Solar" rel=nofollow>here</a>.<br><br>Regarding your mention, above, of the pump, etc. (constitutes an "active" system); this same evacuated tube technology also comes in a much less expensive passive version. The hot water tank is part of the roof unit into which the evacuated tubes are plugged. The water is heated passively and flows (via gravity) to the point of use. One only needs enough water pressure to keep the roof tank full (controlled by a float valve). These are very popular in the more challenged parts of the world. Not recommended for areas that freeze hard, even though most units come with an electric backup in the tank to prevent freezing and boost hot water during cloudy periods.<br><br>The tanks for these units are stainless and copper; should last for decades.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c588021645935628025 title="comment permalink">12/27/14, 7:51 AM</a><br><br>

I hope your holiday was peaceful. This was the slowest Christmas I have ever seen since I started working at this flower shop in 1982. Orders were way down. We are part of a delivery cooperative with 12 other florists. Co-op deliveries were frighteningly scarce. For holidays, we run 2 co-op meetings at 12:30 and 6:30 pm. In years past, we would normally send a truckload, 20+ packages to co-op, and get 25 to 50 packages per meeting as we approached the holiday. We would have at least 6 extra drivers to help deliver. This year we only sent 2 or 3 packages in per meeting. The most we got from a single meeting was 11. We only had 3 extra drivers, and probably didn't need that. I discussed this briefly with my family at Christmas. My cousin's husband is a homebuilder. The crash hit them hard, but he has actual construction knowledge, carpentry, stone, etc. and has taken jobs in repair, renovation, etc. to make up for some of the loss. Despite the relentless claims of "recovery," everyone I meet has similar experiences. That longest night might get very long and dark before the return of the light.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c6260338230218787053 title="comment permalink">12/27/14, 8:17 AM</a><br><br>

And you're not the only one who's certain that the liquid hydrocarbons' plateau in extraction is coming to an end, instigated by the collapse in oil prices as MENA crude floods the market. And the US is not the only country that will suffer the consequences as the fracking bubble bursts. Russia, too, is and is going to suffer as Arctic oil extraction becomes more expensive than what Russia can get for its petroleum on the open market. And her Siberian reserves that she hoped to frack could stay "shut-in," permanently. Still, it's not going to be as bad as I think it could get here in this mess called the US...

Wood is not our main fuel, but we use it as a fuel-saver. Eventually we hope we should have reduced our house demand and can coppice enough of the faster growing kinds for most needs.

It took me a while to figure out what that meant. <br><br>So, yes, you learn to "think". You learn a body of knowledge and they test you on it. You mouth certain phrases, you perform mental gymnastics with pre-approved choreography. And they give you marks. <br><br>Which was a good preparation for the non-academic world. People like people that go along. Nobody likes people that do otherwise. Those are seen as spreaders of fear and doubt. I suspect that many professions are like that. Maybe archdruids excepted. <br><br>For example, in my line of work and in my circle you were expected to be middle class, to marry and raise a family with two cars and a suburban dwelling. And, especially, to own stocks or mutual funds. In addition, you were expected to drink alcohol and to smoke. It marked you as a substantial man. <br><br>I married and I drank alcohol. None of the rest though. <br><br>What happened if you didn't? Well, you were morally suspect. Maybe you're really one of those crazy, pot smoking, wife swapping environmentalists. So, say as little as possible but, if you have to speak, you explain your choice using conformist terminology. You see, both of us have demanding careers, we have no time, we don't want to commute etc. Keep it simple. <br><br>And bring the wife to corporate functions. There, you see, she's a respectable, university educated professional. And OH! she thought to bring her business cards. That's why I married her, she thinks of everything. Does that set everyone's mind at rest? And, FYI, I did the same for her at her company get-togethers. With matching socks even. <br><br>What happens when the world doesn't conform to conformist expectations? There's a problem. Do you draw attention to the discrepancies? No, you don't. You stay the course. <br><br>The real estate market blows up? Ditto the stock market? The banking system sinks into a swamp of fraud? No worries, it's fixable, they'll come back, they always do. You are quietly optimistic. You see, the Emperor DOES have clothes. He always did, he always will. <br><br>I learned a long time ago that people believe what they want to believe and no amount of facts or logic will help. I'm not persuasive enough to break people's mind-sets. Maybe it's a charisma deficit on my part. To speak up meant harming myself. <br><br>Anyway I figure that everyone has a brain and they have eyes. The question is do they choose to use them?<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c7170741607910851300 title="comment permalink">12/27/14, 12:08 PM</a><br><br>

Maybe it's where I'm standing at this point more than anything, but what I had seen as faces from last year seem more like masks that are beginning to slip around a bit, exposing faces underneath that aren't quite the same but not radically different – just dingier or darker, so to speak, than the mask being worn; otherwise there's no real difference between mask and face.<br><br>And as things begin to slow down, I sense - of all things - a weirding going on. Never mind gas prices going down; here's a personal example: Instead of the usual slow-down during Xmas season, seems instead to be adding on hours onto my workload. Whether it's because of personal actions by the dispatchers or a decision by the boss to not hire new evening workers before the new year (don't worry, I'm being paid, but still...) it's affecting my life in ways I had no way of predicting. I wouldn't be surprised to find people working (eating, sleeping) as 24-7 employees inside their cars alongside driverless Uber-mobiles – many Ambulance EMTs already have this lifestyle going on, and too many others are aspiring to that.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c2464730980460679844 title="comment permalink">12/27/14, 3:50 PM</a><br><br>

More on this in an upcoming post. <br><br>Ecologist, I tend to see myself as a symptom rather than a cause.

Yes, as I see it, western civilization peaked between 1815 and 1914; the fact that we have more shiny toys than they did doesn't outweigh the vast number of ways in which the cultures of that time were stronger and more viable than ours. The implosion of Europe in the 1914-1954 crisis left Russia and the United States more or less in charge of the smoking ruins; now that the era of US dominance is ending, we should see another steep jog downwards. <br><br>Thomas, there's no cliff, just a period of relatively rapid change.

Augustus apparently ordered three censuses during his reign, but they were all censuses of <i>Roman citizens</i>, not of the vast majority of people who were not Roman citizens. In addition, the notion that someone who was living in Galilee having to go somewhere else where they did not live and work for a tax census is, frankly, idiotic. That’s the only word I can use - Galilee was north of Samaria and taxes were based on what a particular region could produce, not on where someone’s ancestors lived several generation’s previously. If Augustus ordered a tax census, and I have no reason to doubt that he could have, it would have been a survey of what various regions produced so he knew how much tribute to assess.<br><br>I’ve been quite comfortable with the idea that the Lucan narrative is a fiction to support the idea that Jesus was the Son of God. Luke is writing to the pagans, not the Jews. In that time and place, to be accepted by the population as a Son of God, if your father hadn’t been declared to be a god by the Senate, there had to be a virgin birth. No virgin birth, no divinity.<br><br>The birth story in Matthew might actually be real, if you interpret several pieces symbolically.<br><br>@ escapefromwisconsin<br><br>Interesting point.

Yes, the late 70s and 90s squares correlate with an uninterrupted steep rise in price, but the latest opposition in 2006-7 was very volatile, with major swings in both directions, which ended in a steep rise. I think we will see more of the same upcoming — we already are. <br><br>I note that a Jupiter-Uranus square was also active during the volatile time of ’06-’07, and Jupiter will form a T-square with Saturn-Neptune in 2015, while the Uranus-Pluto square is still in force.

I have seen this transformation in the collapse support group that I’m a member of as well as in many of the online collapse blogs. I am too much a student of yours to think that this conviction is a very useful stance with which to approach the difficulties looming before us and have been struggling with how not to get caught up in the hysteria.

I don't claim to be a specialist in mundane astrology, but in your place I'd check the relationship of the Saturn-Neptune square to the relevant national and ingress charts -- or for that matter, to a chart drawn up for the first oil well (that would be 28 August 1859, Titusville, PA, time not specified but it would be during daylight hours and a chart could doubtless be rectified easily enough). Any of those might give you some idea of whether this aspect will be a stagnant, rising, or volatile one. <br><br>Yanocoches, that's a difficult question, since the answer depends partly on your own psyche and partly on the people around you. I'm not at all sure what to suggest -- but it's a question worth discussing and exploring, since there will probably be a lot of people flinging themselves into one or the other set of easy answers as things tighten up. <br><br>Ed-M, I don't speak for Dmitry, and I'm sure he wouldn't claim to speak for me! My working guess is that every economy in the world is going to be hit to a greater or lesser degree by the approaching mess, and a galaxy of factors including pure dumb chance will determine who gets hit how hard. <br><br>Shane, now consider how hard Europe would have to be slammed by crisis for popular majorities and decision-makers alike to be willing to walk into Russia's outstretched arms. That may well happen, but it's going to be a very rough road one way or the other. <br><br>Elizabeth, yes, I'm familiar with it!

I have been following it since 2006 and 2007 and now own three of Mr. Greer's books. His writings (as well as those of Sharon Astyk and others) were influential in my decision to purchase a modest home five years ago in an affordable, racially diverse "transitional" neighborhood in the southeast. There is a strong DIY ethic here and veggie gardening is common. We also have two community gardens and several households that raise chickens for eggs. Potlucks and backyard bonfires happen on a regular basis, and even though the neighborhood has its challenges, I consider it a blessings (a calling, really) to live here. 2015 will be the year I focus on deepening my spiritual path.

Is it about gifts for everyone, or for your kids? <br><br>The first step is to get over buying anything for adults. They get a jar of jam, a basket of fruit, maybe a scarf. But they're adults. It's fine to offer a loving token, but they can buy their own goodies. <br><br>I do admit that I fight my own urge to overindulge my kids. Though we didn't have a lot of money, my parents did Christmas up big when I was a kid, and it feels stingy to hold back with my own kids. But reminding myself that it isn't doing them any good to be flooded with material goodies, especially since it may be setting them up for unrealistic expectations in harder times of their lives (will they be able to afford big Christmases for their own kids? Is it smart to plant the guilt trap now?), helps me rein in my worst impulses. <br><br>But I do take pleasure in picking out things just for them, and seeing their surprise at opening things they didn't even realize they would like, but do. So I tried to walk a middle line, and choose wisely. 1. Nothing advertised anywhere that they've seen. (tv, grocery store, school...) No cartoon characters, no plastic junk. 2. Nothing passively entertaining. 3. Items that will plant the seed for things I actually want them to be doing. So my kids got rain gear, for adventuring outside even when the weather is bad. Whittling knives, and a book of project ideas. Small musical instruments (a well-made lap harp and a slide whistle.) oh, and books, lots of 'em. Grandparents who wanted gift ideas were pointed toward a chemistry set for my 10 year old and a scooter for her little brother. I tried to consider (à la Michael Pollan on food) whether my great grandparents would have know what to make of the gifts. And you know what? My kids didn't miss the usual flood of $&amp;!@, still had plenty to open, and now have projects to keep them busy through the winter, and maybe a few beginning skills of their own. I know that it was still more than may be possible in future years, but I felt ok about it for this year. It's moving in the right direction, at least. <br><br>So maybe instead of completely ignoring the urge to give gifts, you and your wife can work together to find a mutually acceptable, pared down list that acknowledges both your values. <br><br>Hope this was helpful, and not just long. <br>--Heather in CA<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c4510930110152005942 title="comment permalink">12/29/14, 6:13 PM</a><br><br>

There is nothing inherently wrong with giving gifts or exchanging gifts. The exchange of gifts is a true cultural universal, a practice found in some form all over the world from industrial economies to bands of hunter-gatherers. To refuse to give or receive in any way is to cut yourself off from society.<br><br>The main point of giving or receiving is that it acknowledges a relationship with the person or group on the other side of the exchange. For adults the symbolic part of the exchange is usually more important than the material part. Gifts are a form of communication. Like other forms of communication, it can be more or less honest and more or less understood the same way by the giver and the recipient. <br><br>In America it's typically the wife who is in charge of managing social relationships between the married couple and everyone else. If you are relying on her to do that work for both of you, she may be more in tune with the nuances of the relationships than you are. If you stop your wife from giving gifts, you are taking away one of her tools. <br><br>It might be worthwhile for you and your wife to discuss the names on your gift list. Are the two of you in agreement about what relationship you have (individually or as a couple) with each of them? Would you like that relationship to be better or different in some way? Does the kind of gift you have been giving express the relationship that you have or would like to have? What is your gift saying? Would a different gift (either a thing or an activity) say it better? <br><br>You probably won't be instantly in agreement on any of these questions, but if you have time to talk it out, you might both get a better understanding of how the other spouse thinks.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c5532039994241324676 title="comment permalink">12/29/14, 11:38 PM</a><br><br>

Why not use gift-giving opportunities to provide each other with high-quality, useful tools for your lifestyle, instead? You can support small companies, local if possible, but there are businesses well worth keeping in business even through mail order. Good quality tools are well worth having, but also something of a luxury. Really soft, comfortable wool long underwear, a stainless-steel food mill, a metal cherry pitter that will pit six cherries at a time, a really good hand mill and a broadfork are examples from my house from the past several years. They are all things that get regularly used, and all but the clothing will last a lifetime, and probably someone else's lifetime, too. Husband, a wood-worker, often receives good wood-working tools. Flannel-lined jeans; new house shoes, when the old ones wear out, a tool roll for chisels, sewed out of duck cloth, homemade flannel shirts. We also make gifts to give friends and family sometimes: jam, baked goods, beeswax candles, shaker boxes, etc. He's given me things he built; a new free-standing cupboard, one year, to hold all the jars I'd canned, that were stacked all over the floor; a shaker chair, sized to fit me. This year we gave some family toddlers tiny shaker chairs just their size, for Christmas. A friend gave us several bags of wool a couple years ago, and we use it to stuff the chair cushions, instead of buying foam, and sew the cushion covers out of muslin. The wool makes good dog toy stuffing, too, and you can sew the toys out of worn-out jeans. I stuffed a couple homemade bed pillows with it, too, but have had mixed success with those; the wool mats down and gets lumpy. He has given me, and we have given a friend, all metal sewing machines made several decades ago when quality was still important. They were bought used but in good condition, off Craig's List locally, and then carefully cleaned and adjusted. He also found a really nice treadle machine, in good condition, on Craig's list. We got my dad interested in ham radio, by giving him one for Christmas one year. <br>A friend inherited boxes of beautiful beads from her mother, and decided to honor the heritage by learning to make jewelry, which she now gives as gifts. It's gorgeous, and so touching to receive; it's always perfectly matched to the recipient. Another friend knits many gifts; a third sews, another gave garlic braids from her garden this year, with dried flowers woven in. I've given people pretty cloth shopping bags, napkins, and sturdy kitchen towels that I sewed for them.<br> There will always be people who'd prefer an Amazon gift card, but it's easily possible to at least eliminate a good percentage of meaningless stuff-buying, and retain the element of generosity and thoughtfulness.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c6442584263028740977 title="comment permalink">12/30/14, 7:23 AM</a><br><br>

I'll definitely check out that chart. I generally take a quick look at the ingress charts on my blog over on the Witches and Pagans magazine site, but it's an audience that is not all that interested in things like oil prices -- though, as I mentioned in my Capricorn ingress post, with Neptune in and co-ruling the 9th and co-ruling the MC, oil is likely to be a very major factor in foreign policy this quarter (not, of course, that the two are every really separable).

You may be wondering why I'm talking about 'Ribbonfarm'. I'm talking about it because it offers some interesting perspectives on <a href=http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/12/08/acting-dead-trading-up-and-leaving-the-middle-class/ rel=nofollow>how to leave the middle class</a> and another<a href=http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2012/03/22/can-hydras-eat-unknown-unknowns-for-lunch/ rel=nofollow> interesting perspective on possible responses to unknown-unknowns</a>. This holiday season, I received nothing but a few books for Christmas that had arrived a week or so earlier, a sign of the Decline. Of course, the more important personal decline was my mother's leg surgery, which resulted from bone damage from her eating too much cortisone medications to try to alleviate her lupus.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c6805697816131144681 title="comment permalink">12/30/14, 3:14 PM</a><br><br>

Since Neptune is the signifier of oil, I suspect that the entire Neptune cycle from first crossing to next crossing (in 2025) has something to do with the entire cycle of discovery to final depletion.<br><br>@Diotima<br><br>I hate to say it, but while the time might give some results, the “Sibley” chart for the U.S. has been thoroughly debunked. Ebenezer Sibley never made a chart for the U.S. What he did was place the planets for noon at Philadelphia into the chart for the Summer Solstice at London, and proceeded to delineate that for the effect of U.S. independence on Britian. I’m not a fan of any of the July 4 charts; I use the chart for the opening of the Continental Congress. It’s got the advantage of having a close conjunction between the Moon (the people) and Neptune, and I’m sure that the members of the 1st Continental Congress would never have elected it if they’d have known about Neptune at the time. That conjunction is, I think, a really good descriptor of the population of the U.S.<br><br>@Nastarana<br><br>I seriously doubt that anyone very far away from Jerusalem traveled there to present new children. If Jesus was presented at “the temple” for his bar Mitzfah, it would have been at the synagog in Sephoris, which was only a few kilometers from Nazareth, and had been called “the Jewel of the Galilee.” As far as Jesus’ early education is concerned, this is the elephant in the room. He would have had easy access to not only Jewish teachers but a selection of Greek philosophical schools. In any case, “Luke” was not a native of Palistine, and wrote in the late first century.<br><br>As far as the annual Passover celebration, most people didn’t go to Jerusalem each and every year. I suspect it was more like current Muslim custom for the pilgrimage to Mecca: one tried to get there once in the lifetime. It was the locals who crowded Jerusalem.<br><br>Theophilus means “lover of God.” I doubt that this was a person at all.<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c5280266259907026263 title="comment permalink">12/30/14, 5:27 PM</a><br><br>

I live in a high mountain valley in Southeastern Brazil. It's been impossible so far to buy a decent photovoltaic system (I envy Cherokee Chris every time I see his setup). But solar hot water is common, and I had one put in. <br>As it happened, I sized it based on my experience in California, and ended up with a system that's a bit larger than I need. On most sunny days, I end the day with a 400l (about 100 gallon) tank full of water at around 80ºC. The water is chlorine free gravity-fed local spring water (Petrópolis is famous for its great mineral water), so long showers are a pleasure. But that's not enough to justify the abundance.<br>... so ...<br>My 55-gallon crafts beer production kit arrives later this month. It turns out that with a little dilution for cooling I can use 80ºC water direct from the tap for brewing, with only limited use of fuel for reheating. From now on, sunny days = brewing days :)<br><br><a href=waiting-for-sunrise.html#c1556777876105867365 title="comment permalink">1/3/15, 11:47 AM</a><br><br>
