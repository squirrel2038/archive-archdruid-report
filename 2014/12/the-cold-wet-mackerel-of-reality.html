<div class=MsoNormal>
To misuse a bit of prose from Charles Dickens, it was neither the best of times nor the worst of times, but I know very few people who will object when, a few hours from now, 2014 gets dragged off to the glue factory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This has not been a good year for most people in the United States. By all accounts, this year’s holiday season was an economic flop of considerable scale—the US media, which normally treats cheery corporate press releases with the same enforced credulity that <i>Pravda</i>
used to give to pronouncements from the Politburo in the Soviet era, has had to admit that Black Friday sales were down hard this year, even counting the internet—and plenty of Americans outside the echo chambers of the media have very good reasons to worry about what 2015 will bring.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, <a href=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2014/12/the_world_is_not_falling_apart_the_trend_lines_reveal_an_increasingly_peaceful.html>cheerleading of a distinctly <i>Pravda</i>-esque variety</a> can still be heard from those pundits and politicians who are still convinced that <a href=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/11310456/Goodbye-to-one-of-the-best-years-in-history.html>people can be talked into ignoring their own experience</a> if they can only be force-fed enough spin-doctored malarkey. That sort of enthusiasm for the glorious capitalist banker’s paradise has plenty of company just now; I’m thinking in particular of the steady drumbeat of articles and essays in the US mass media wondering aloud why so many Americans haven’t noticed the economic recovery of the last four years, and are still behaving as though there’s a recession on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of course there’s an explanation for that awkward fact, which is that the recovery in question never happened—outside, that is, of the abstract otherworld of numerical jugglery and spin doctoring that passes for official economic statistics these days. For most Americans, the last four years have been a bleak era of soaring expenses, shrinking incomes and benefits, rising economic insecurity, and increasingly frequent and bitter struggles with dysfunctional institutions that no longer bother even to pretend to serve the public good. That’s the reality people in the United States face when they get out of bed each morning, but it’s not a reality that’s welcome in the American mass media, so endless ingenuity has been expended in explaining why so many people in the US these days haven’t noticed the alleged economic recovery that’s allegedly burgeoning all around them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I expect to see a good deal more of this sort of twaddle in the weeks immediately ahead, as those mass media pundits who haven’t yet trotted out their predictions for the new year get around to that annual task. For that matter, it’s doubtless safe to assume that out here on the fringes where archdruids lurk, there will be plenty of predictions of a different kind or, rather, several different kinds. There will be another round of claims that this is the year when the global economy will seize up suddenly and leave us all to starve in the dark; there will be another round of claims that this is the year when this or that or the other hot new technology will come swooping in to save the day and let the middle classes maintain their privileged lifestyles; there will be—well, those of my readers who have been following the blogosphere for any length of time can fill in the blanks themselves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve noted in previous years just how many of these latter predictions get rehashed every single January in the serene conviction that nobody will notice how often they’ve flopped before. Popular though that habit may be, it seems counterproductive to me, since—at least in theory—predictions of the sort we’re discussing is intended to be something more than light entertainment. With this in mind, I’d like to engage in the annual ritual of glancing back over the predictions I posted here <a href=../../2014/01/the-song-of-snallygaster.html>at the beginning of the year now ending, and see how well I did. Here’s what I said: </a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“My prediction for 2014, in turn, is that we’ll see more of the same:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>another year, that is, of uneven but continued downward movement along the same arc of decline and fall, while official statistics here in the United States will be doctored even more extravagantly than before to manufacture a paper image of prosperity. The number of Americans trying to survive without a job will continue to increase, the effective standard of living for most of the population will continue to decline, and what used to count as the framework of ordinary life in this country will go on unraveling a thread at a time. Even so, the dollar, the Euro, the stock market, and the Super Bowl will still be functioning as 2015 begins; there will still be gas in the gas pumps and food on grocery store shelves, though fewer people will be able to afford to buy either one. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The fracking bubble has more than lived up to last year’s expectations, filling the mass media with vast amounts of meretricious handwaving about the coming era of abundance:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>the same talk, for all practical purposes, that surrounded the equally delusional claims made for the housing bubble, the tech bubble, and so on all the way back to the Dutch tulip bubble of 1637. That rhetoric will prove just as dishonest as its predecessors, and the supposed new era of prosperity will come tumbling back down to earth once the bubble pops, taking a good chunk of the American economy with it. Will that happen in 2014? That’s almost impossible to know in advance. Timing the collapse of a bubble is one of the trickiest jobs in economic life; no less a mind than Isaac Newton’s was caught flatfooted by the collapse of the South Sea Bubble in 1720, and the current bubble is far more opaque. My guess is that the collapse will come toward the end of 2014, but it could have another year or so to run first.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“It’s probably a safe bet that weather-related disasters will continue to increase in number and severity. If we get a whopper on the scale of Katrina or Sandy, watch the Federal response; it’s certain to fall short of meeting the needs of the survivors and their communities, but the degree to which it falls short will be a useful measure of just how brittle and weak the national government has become. One of these years—just possibly this year, far more likely later on—that weakness is going to become one of the crucial political facts of our time, and responses to major domestic disasters are among the few good measures we’ll have of how close we are to the inevitable crisis. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Meanwhile, what won’t happen is at least as important as what will. Despite plenty of enthusiastic pronouncements and no shortage of infomercials disguised as meaningful journalism, there will be no grand breakthroughs on the energy front. Liquid fuels—that is to say, petroleum plus anything else that can be thrown into a gas tank—will keep on being produced at something close to 2013’s rates, though the fraction of the total supply that comes from expensive alternative fuels with lower net energy and higher production costs will continue to rise, tightening a noose around the neck of every other kind of economic activity. Renewables will remain as dependent on government subsidies as they’ve been all along, nuclear power will remain dead in the water, fusion will remain a pipe dream, and more exotic items such as algal biodiesel will continue to soak up their quotas of investment dollars before going belly up in the usual way. Once the fracking bubble starts losing air, expect something else to be scooped up hurriedly by the media and waved around to buttress the claim that peak oil won’t happen, doesn’t matter, and so on; any of my readers who happen to guess correctly what that will be, and manage their investments accordingly, may just make a great deal of money. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sudden world-ending catastrophes will also be in short supply in 2014, though talk about them will be anything but...Both the grandiose breakthroughs that never happen and the equally gaudy catastrophes that never happen will thus continue to fill their current role as excuses not to think about, much less do anything about, what’s actually happening around us right now—the long ragged decline and fall of industrial civilization that I’ve called the Long Descent. Given the popularity of both these evasive moves, we can safely assume that one more thing won’t happen in 2014:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>any meaningful collective response to the rising spiral of crises that’s shredding our societies and our future. As before, anything useful that’s going to happen will be the work of individuals, families, and community groups, using the resources on hand to cope with local conditions.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As I write these words, the US media is still parroting the fantasy of a fracking-driven “Saudi America” with a mindless repetitiveness that puts broken records to shame, and so the next shiny distraction disguised as a marvelous new energy breakthrough hasn’t yet been trotted out for the usual round of carefully choreographed oohs and aahs. Other than that, once again, I think it’s fair to say I called it. Continuing economic decline, check; a fracking bubble heading toward a world-class bust, check; climate-related disasters on the rise, with government interventions doing less and less to help those affected, check; and a continuing shortage of game-changing breakthroughs, world-ending catastrophes, and meaningful collective responses to the crisis of our age, check-check-check. If this were a bingo game, I’d be walking up to the front of the room with a big smile on my face. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course a case could be made that I’m cheating. After all, it doesn’t take any particular insight to point out that continuing trends tend to continue, or to choose trends that are pretty clearly ongoing and predict that they’ll keep on going for another year. While this is true, it’s also part of the point I’ve been trying to make here for getting on for nine years now:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in the real world, by and large, history is what happened when you weren’t looking. Under some circumstances, sudden jarring discontinuities can hit societies like a cold wet mackerel across the face, but close attention to the decade or so before things changed routinely shows that the discontinuity itself was the product of long-established trends, and could have been anticipated if anyone was willing to do so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s a particularly relevant issue just now, because the sort of long-established trends that can lead to sudden jarring discontinuities have been more and more evident in the United States in recent years, and one of the things that made 2014 so wretched for everyone outside the narrowing circle of the privileged well-to-do is precisely that several of those trends seem to be moving toward a flashpoint. I’d like to sketch out a couple of examples, because my predictions for 2015 will center on them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first and most obvious is the headlong collapse of the fracking bubble, which I discussed at some length <a href=../../2014/12/deja-vu-all-over-again.html>in a post earlier this month</a>. For most of the last decade, Wall Street has been using the fracking industry in all the same ways it used the real estate industry in the runup to the 2008 crash, churning out what we still laughably call “securities” on the back of a rapidly inflating speculative bubble. As the slumping price of oil kicks the props out from under the fracking boom, the vast majority of that paper—the junk bonds issued by fracking-industry firms, the securitized loans those same firms used to make up for the fact that they lost money every single quarter, the chopped and packaged shale leases, the volumetric production agreements, and all the rest of it—will revert to its actual value, which in most cases approximates pretty closely to zero. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s important in this context to remember that those highly insecure securities haven’t been cooped up in the financial equivalent of the dog pound where they belong; quite the contrary, they’ve gone roaming all over the neighborhood, leaving an assortment of messes behind. Banks, investment firms, pension funds, university endowments, and many other institutions in the US and abroad snapped this stuff up in gargantuan amounts, because it offered something like what used to count as a normal rate of return on investment. As a result, as the fracking boom goes belly up, it’s not just firms in the fracking industry that will be joining it in that undignified position. In the real estate bust, a great many businesses and institutions that seemingly had nothing to do with real estate found themselves in deep financial trouble; in the fracking bust, we can count on the same thing happening—and a great deal of the resulting bankruptcies, defaults, and assorted financial chaos will likely hit in 2015. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus one of the entertainments 2015 has in store for us is a thumping economic crisis here in the US, and in every other country that depends on our economy for its bread and butter. The scale of the crash depends on how many people bet how much of their financial future on the fantasy of an endless frack-propelled boom, but my guess is it’ll be somewhere around the scale of the 2008 real estate bust. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It probably has to be said that this doesn’t work out to the kind of fast-crash fantasy that sees the global economy grind to a sudden stop in a matter of weeks, leaving supermarket shelves bare and so on. The events of the 2008 crash proved, if there was ever any doubt on that score, that the governments of the world are willing to do whatever it takes to keep economic activity going, and if bailing out their pals in the big banks is what’s needed, hey, that’s all in a day’s work. Now of course bailing out the big banks won’t stop the bankruptcies, the layoffs, the steep cuts to pensions, the slashing of local and state government services, and the rest of it, any more than the same thing did in the wake of the 2008 crisis, but it does guarantee that the perfect storms and worst case scenarios beloved of a certain category of collapsitarian thinkers will remain imaginative fictions. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Something else that’s baked into the baby new year’s birthday cake at this point is a rising spiral of political unrest here in the United States. The mass protests over the extrajudicial executions of nonwhite Americans by police were pretty much inevitable, as pressures on the American underclass have been building toward an explosion for decades now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There’s a certain bleak amusement to be had from watching financially comfortable white Americans come up with reasons to insist that this can’t possibly be the case, or for that matter, from hearing them contrive ways to evade the awkward fact that American police seem to have much less difficulty subduing belligerent suspects in nonlethal ways when the skins of the suspects in question are white. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Behind the killings and the protests, though, lies an explosive tangle that nobody on either side of the picket lines seems willing to address. Morale in many police departments across the United States resembles nothing so much as morale among American enlisted men in Vietnam in the last years of US involvement; after decades of budget cuts, grandstanding politicians, bungled reforms, an imploding criminal justice system, and ongoing blowback from misguided economic and social policies, a great many police officers feel that they’re caught between an enemy they can’t defeat and a political leadership that’s more than willing to throw them to the wolves for personal advantage. That the “enemy” they think they’re fighting is indistinguishable from the people they’re supposed to be protecting just adds to the list of troubling parallels. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In Vietnam, collapsing morale led to war crimes, “fragging” of officers by their own men, and worried reports to the Pentagon warning of the possibility of armed mutinies among US troops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We haven’t yet gotten to the fragging stage this time, though the response of New York police to Mayor De Blasio suggests that we’re closer to that than most people think.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The routine extrajudicial execution of nonwhite suspects—<a href=http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/police-shootings-michael-brown-ferguson-black-men>there are scores if not hundreds of such executions a year</a>—is the My Lai of our era, one of the few warnings that gets through the Five O’Clock Follies of the media to let the rest of us know that the guys on the front lines are cracking under the strain. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The final bitter irony here is that the federal government has been busily worsening the situation by encouraging the militarization of police departments across the United States, to the extent of equipping them with armored personnel carriers and other pieces of hardware that don’t have any possible use in ordinary policing. This is one of a good many data points that has me convinced that the US government is frantically gearing up to fight a major domestic insurgency. What’s more, they’re almost certainly going to get one. For decades now, since the post-Soviet “color revolutions,” the US has been funding and directing mass movements and rebellions against governments we don’t like, with Syria and Ukraine the two most recent beneficiaries of that strategy. We’ve made a lot of enemies in the process; it’s a safe bet that some of those enemies are eager to give us a heaping dose of our own medicine, and there are certainly nations with the means, motive, and opportunity to do just that. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Will an American insurgency funded by one or more hostile foreign powers get under way in 2015? I don’t think so, though I’m prepared to be wrong. More likely, I think, is another year of rising tensions, political gridlock, scattered gunfire, and rhetoric heated to the point of incandescence, while the various players in the game get into position for actual conflict:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the sort of thing the United States last saw in the second half of the 1850s, as sectional tensions built toward the bloody opening rounds of the Civil War.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One sign to watch for is the first outbreaks of organized violence—not just the shooting of one individual by another, but paramilitary assaults by armed groups—equivalent, more or less, to the fighting in “bleeding Kansas” that did so much to help make the Civil War inevitable. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Another thing to watch for, along the same lines, are glorifications of revolutionary violence on the part of people who haven’t previously taken that plunge. To some extent, that’s already happening. I’m thinking here especially of <a href=http://www.resilience.org/stories/2014-12-23/everything-s-coming-together-while-everything-falls-apart>a recent essay by Rebecca Solnit</a>, which starts off with lavish praise of the French Revolution: “It’s popular to say that the experiment failed,” she says, “but that’s too narrow an interpretation. France never again regressed to an absolutist monarchy”—a statement that will surprise anyone who’s heard of Napoleon, Louis XVII, or Napoleon III. In holding up the French Revolution as a model for today’s radicals, Ms. Solnit also doesn’t happen to mention the Terror, the tyranny of the Directorate, the Napoleonic wars, or any of the other problematic outcomes of the uprising in question. That sort of selective historical memory is common in times like these, and has played a very large role in setting the stage for some of history’s most brutal tragedies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, back behind these foreground events, the broader trends this blog has been tracking since its outset are moving relentlessly on their own trajectories. The world’s finite supplies of petroleum, along with most other resources on which industrial civilization depends for survival, are depleting further with each day that passes; the ecological consequences of treating the atmosphere as an aerial sewer for the output of our tailpipes and smokestacks, along with all the other frankly brainless ways our civilization maltreats the biosphere that sustains us all, builds apace; caught between these two jaws of a tightening vise, industrial civilization has entered the rising spiral of crisis about which so many environmental scientists tried to warn the world back in the 1970s, and only a very small minority of people out on the fringes of our collective discourse has shown the least willingness to recognize the mess we’re in and start changing their own lives in response: the foundation, it bears repeating, of any constructive response to the crisis of our era.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
I’ve heard quite a few people insist hopefully that since 2014 was so bad, 2015 has to be better. I’m sorry to say, though, that I don’t see much likelihood of that, at least here in the US. Quite the contrary, I think that when people recall 2015, they may just think of it as the year in which America got slapped across its collective face with the cold wet mackerel of reality. Come New Year’s Day of 2016, I expect to find the dollar, the Euro, the stock market, and the Super Bowl still functioning, gas in the pumps and products for sale on the grocery store shelves—but the nation in which these things exist will have passed through a traumatic and crisis-ridden year, and the chances of avoiding an even more difficult 2016 don’t seem good just now. Still, we’ll see. </div>

USA Today went so far as to call 2014 a year in science best forgotten. Even the boosterish Wired admitted it was a roller-coaster year for science. A magazine called The Scientist listed ten very public retractions and ten outright scandals in science. They even documented how less faith in science was resulting in reduced levels of support for research from government. Mother Jones added to the litany of decreased belief in scientific expertise, using a term to describe anti-science sentiment that would prevent my comment from being approved.

And local attempts to make changes will be most effective. So I resolve to keep learning and sharing my knowledge this year.<br><br>Here's another good example of the "something will save us" hype - well-intentioned optimism that just doesn't do the numbers:<br><br>http://www.resilience.org/stories/2014-12-24/review-the-great-transition-the-new-paradigm<br><br>The thing that strikes me the most is that this cheeriness seems to completely ignore the number of people on the planet, so I have to assume the underlying message is, "we, the already privileged, will make sure we get enough resources to keep going; there's enough for us,and that's what counts". I can't see any really good solution to overpopulation; obvious being able to keep births below replacement numbers for a while would be great, but not going to happen. So I read articles like the one linked above and I sigh, knowing other will read it and use it as an excuse not to scale down. :-|<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c5807224407416605787 title="comment permalink">12/31/14, 8:07 PM</a><br><br>

Not sure it's going to be worth redeeming your win, though; the bingo prize is likely to be some piece of useless plastic tat produced in a sweatshop somewhere in the world where meaningful employment is as unlikely as meaningful civic participation.<br><br>Some random observations from Airstrip One: 2014 looks set to be the hottest year on record in Britain, with every month except August being the hottest ever recorded, too. Some muted and surprised comment is being made that the FTSE index begins 2015 lower than it began 2014. The ramifications of Scotalnd's independence vote keep on, well, ramifying. And in five months' time, we'll be enjoying or enduring one of the most uncallable general elections for decades. (I'll have a ringside seat working as a poll clerk - partly out of a spirit of civic responsibility, partly because it is ridiculously well-paid work. And as an election worker it will be illegal for me to discuss party politics for the duration, thereby getting me out of many spit-flecked conversations with wild-eyed loons of all stripes. A win-win-win for me, at least ;-) )<br><br>Unusually for me, I'm managing to read the ADR with a mere six comments posted. It's 4am on New Year's Day, and I managed to miss the fesitivities by falling asleep at the wrong time, trying to repair my shattered sleep patterns caused by shift work on my usual winter gig as a temporary postal worker. With my mostly collapsed-early lifestyle, each week worked now covers a whole month of bills, and it helps me get through the season without succumbing to the winter blues.<br><br>I must confess I had to look up the term 'fragging' before I could fully appreciate your discussion of police morale. Some ominous signs there, and it is looking increasingly fraught in the arena of police-community relations. It strikes me as odd that a law-enforcement establishment which can take alive the likes of Al Capone, Charles Manson, Ted Bundy or Timothy McVeigh cannot apprehend allegedly-unarmed, alleged-shoplifters with darker skins without resorting to lethal force.<br><br>There's little wonder at the increasing use of revolutionary rhetoric amongst the commentariat on both sides of the pond. I think it's partly a measure of the sesne of futility in challenging the established order through sanctioned avenues (bought elections, suppressed protest, etc etc), and people are beginning to see some form of revolution as the only effective means of sweeping away the old order. Alas, as you pointed out, they forget the Robespierres, Terrors, Holodomors, Sisis, Cultural Revolutions and increasingly virulent factionalism and sectarianism which tend to follow before things eventually settle down to a new order that ultimately resembles the old. It's interesting to note that many of the Russian volunteer militias operating in Eastern Ukraine paint themselves as 'nationalist, orthodox and monarchist'. I'm not sure how Vladimir Vladimirovitch views that final claim, but he's happy enough to turn a condoningly blind eye to the first two, just as Nuland et al seemed not too concerned about the motivations of the Right Sector and other Ukrainian extremists so long as they waved the correct colour for their 'uprising'.<br><br>All in all, an interesting year ahead.<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c1952229550199186719 title="comment permalink">12/31/14, 9:29 PM</a><br><br>

Delusional, yes, but no less popular for that...<br><br>Nastarana, if for whatever reason the foreign government in question can't get the US to stop trying to overthrow it or make trouble in its backyard using canned insurgencies, feeding the US some of its own medicine has got to have a potent appeal. <br><br>Gardener, a fine habit. May the next month bring you peace. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, interesting -- I hadn't been following those stories, due to the press of other things happening in a hurry. Thanks for the heads up! As for your comments re the Progress Fairy, I'm reminded of the use of "clapping" in obsolete slang with the meaning of "giving the clap to"...<br><br>YCS, glad to hear of the new blog! Congrats and best wishes for the project; it's needed. <br><br>Cathy, yes, that's a fine example of the species. (Gah.) I'm probably going to have to devote a few posts in the new year to why all these expressions of the bargaining stage need to be recognized as such, and not taken any more seriously. <br><br>Tony, oh, granted. That's one of the reasons that rigged elections are so counterproductive for the elite: if you don't give the people a peaceful way of making their wishes known, sooner or later it's going to be time to decorate lampposts with the elite. That revolutions normally put in governments worse than the ones they overthrow is just one more irony in the fire.<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c7236385565905924170 title="comment permalink">12/31/14, 9:45 PM</a><br><br>

I had trouble finding live footage of my city, even though I had access to all four local networks and I live here; three of them were offering national coverage featuring Pitbull and clip reels of toilet humor, but I don't want to whine about the state of pop culture. My question is this: I was somewhat troubled to see that there was only one local channel (WBZ) with the resources to show local footage, even though Boston is a fairly large city. And I was further troubled that the quality of this channel had dropped noticeably from the celebrations I remember enjoying last year; there was certainly no lack of thoughtful planning or skill on the part of the program's directors, but in terms of the program's budget, I felt like I was time traveling back to roughly 1980.<br><br>So, how was your New Year's programming?

There are some odd things beginning to surface there.<br><br>The Scottish referendum has left very large numbers of people utterly disillusioned with the British political establishment, and with the media. <br><br>Events in Ukraine led to some very strange discussions, with people (including myself) taking positions which surprised the audience, being in contrast with what we were anticipated to support.<br><br>I don't know about the British armed forces, but I know that many police officers, firemen, etc are increasingly mutinous as they see the terms of their pension schemes being unilaterally changed for the worse, for example.<br><br>Even in the media, there are odd discontinuities. Traditionally left-wing papers provide consumerist boosterism; traditionally right-wing 'pro-business' papers produce serious analyses of Peak Oil.<br><br>As for academia... I interviewed recently for a lecturing post at a British business school. I had to give a presentation for this, and used it to discuss the Sino-Russian relationship, the realignment of the Eurasian economic space, and the effects it will have on global trade. It was met - predictably enough - with (shall we say) polite bemusement. Clearly, they hadn't got beyond "China makes cheap stuff for us, and Russia is evil". Needless to say, I didn't get the job (and I'm not sad).<br><br>What's interesting is that all of this makes sense when viewed through the narrative here on TAR. There is a firming up of sides, between those who believe in post-Cold War business as usual, and those who believe that it cannot continue as usual. This is splitting old groups apart.

France never again regressed to an absolutist monarchy”—a statement that will surprise anyone who’s heard of Napoleon, Louis XVII, or Napoleon III."<br><br>That's actually debatable. Bonapartism was a different beast from the Ancien régime while the Restoration monarchy was a constitutional one: when Charles X and the Polignac thought they could get away with turning the clock back they swiftly got the boot. Incidentally that that the guy who wrote in 1830 'The legal regime is now interrupted; that of force has begun. In this situation obedience ceases to be a duty' would be the same to end the season of French revolutions in 1870 by executing revolutionaries by the thousands is one of my favorite ironies of history.<br><br>That said the current situation is pretty different. The bourgeois élite which ran the revolution had at least semi-feasible ideas about what it wanted in terms of government, economy etc. and eventually got around to implement them even if it took a century to make everything fit together. <br>In the US that is largely lacking and so is a suitably debauched tyrant people can rally against. For example the political class could easily offer the resignation (to a cushy retirement) of one or more of its disposable members to placate the masses if it came to that. Much more importantly while there is no shortage of angry people the chances of a coherent action are pretty low: the guy stocking up guns waiting for UN troops to invade is unlikely to find much common ground with the ghetto criminal seeking revenge against the police or the clueless leftie intellectual. A jacquerie or a mindless insurgency are certainly possible, perhaps likely just very few years of decline away but a revolution along French lines lacks the raw intellectual material, while the harsh economic realities would make charting a sensible course afterwards near impossible. <br><br>Also while foreign countries might like the idea of a coloured revolution in the US that's actually pretty much impossible in the existing climate. Right wing Le Pen in France can pretty much publicy admit to receive russian money without excessive negative consequences. Currently anybody doing the same in the US would be found out (any political threat to the status quo would be spied upon to insane levels) smashed by the state security apparatus and then swept away by a media tsunami with hysterical op-eds beating the war drums against Russia or whatever to eardrum piercing levels. <br>Some fascist willing to allow the cushy retirement of the political class and offering generous deals to business interests might be accepted in an impasse but he would have to be wrapped in an American flag.<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c8034715890986743255 title="comment permalink">1/1/15, 3:11 AM</a><br><br>

In this month's National Geographic, editors asked "experts and futurists" to predict aspects of the future. One (listed as a tech entrepreneur -- not sure what sort of expert that would be)weighs in on how we will age in the next 20 years. He begins, "Since technology grows exponentially, not in a linear way, we will see dramatic improvements in our way of life in just a few years." He lost me from his premise, but wait, there's more: "Soon we will be able to solve all problems that are fundamentally technical. These problems include disease, poverty, hunger, energy, and scarcity. If you can live a few years more, there's a real chance you will never die, since mortality may be just a technical problem we can solve. All these advances will usher in a new golden age, freed from the scourges that have plagues humanity throughout our history." <br><br>The executive director of the Sierra Club seemed almost as delusional in his predictions about energy in the next 50 years. I'm reminded of the character Larry the gambler, in the movie Parenthood: always convinced his day is about to dawn, even when he's being beaten up by gangsters.

Alhough I find the NYPD PBA a bit bullying and immature, having worked for a public institution I understand the low morale caused by directives coming down from the top. I'm sure many officers (especially those of color) resent enforcing "broken windows" policies that have them at war with the communities they serve. It seems the NYPD is trying to show the city what turning away from that approach will look like. I'm curious how it will play out.

While I've only had a very minor role in this effort, you're quite right that at least on my side of the picket line (activists working to stop police brutality) that this hasn't been discussed at all. While most of us seem to have learned the lesson from Vietnam about demonizing individuals, the practical impact of the drop in morale and why it is happening isn't really discussed.<br><br>There was an article recently on the NYPD's <a href=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-nypds-work-stoppage-is-surreal-20141231 rel=nofollow>work stoppage</a> that was my personal introduction to this topic. The paralysis of local and state governments with regards to trying to extract enough revenue from wary voters through taxation explains a lot in the development of quotas and other revenue-enhancing policing functions. And it is pretty typical that those burdens come down heaviest on those who can't defend themselves -- people of color and the poor. I doubt anyone who is a police officer signed up to shake people down for money every day. The fact that this is treated as a "fight against crime" when it clearly isn't probably leaves officers feeling used, and the increasing resentment by the public against these policing tactics is probably making the situation worse -- by undermining support for taxes that would provide a more stable revenue stream to support their departments.<br><br>Any ideas on ways to change this feedback loop?<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c3314681964051243577 title="comment permalink">1/1/15, 6:54 AM</a><br><br>

When I went to new years party last night with high school friends from wealthy suburbs, I was able to engage people on the same level I was able to communicate with anarchists 4 years ago.<br><br>When asked about the prospects for 2015, I was honest in my assessment: it will probably be worse than 2014, at least on a collective level. People would ask why, and I would go some into the intractable political/economic situation in the states and people got it. No one said "violet quite being a downer," people listened like drinking water.<br><br>Also, many of my old friends are really interested in Spengler - I quote from him a lot and people like that. It's hard for me to imagine that a few years back as well.<br><br>Looking at the political situation has me a bit anxious. As the United States continues to undergo a crisis of legitimacy mixed with economic contraction it is easy for me to imagine things getting real ugly in the next few years. I say to my friends "imagine you were in Europe before WWI, the say before it started. Would you have guessed what was about to happen?" <br><br>I'm trying to practice war-time thinking, imagining how I would survive and support myself if the political situation became the same in New England as, say, Yugoslavia while it was dissolving. I've read accounts of that conflict and took note that the old ladies who knew herb lore became important people that weren't messed with. Since I already have a familiarity with herbal medicine I'm expanding my knowledge, spending hours taking notes, even gathering some roots to tincture before the freeze became too hard a few days ago. I think with some practice and experimentation I could, conceivably, become mostly independent of western medicine within the next few years, on my terms, with herbs I know how to use and with established doses. I'll still go the dentist though as long as there's a competent one I can access at a price less than an arm or a leg.<br><br>The narrowing range of options can be viewed impetus towards action. Spengler says that in a declining civilization there eventually comes the choice between doing what needs to be done and doing nothing at all. There is so much that needs to be done, but it beats the alternative of alternative. The first choice looks like taking charge of life and finding purpose and meaning in the actual circumstances we're living with the second looks like a deer in headlights of destiny or drinking oneself to death. Thank you JMG for being such a vocal proponent for the first choice. Many blessings on your new year!!<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c4594517528581513368 title="comment permalink">1/1/15, 8:01 AM</a><br><br>

I was remembering a point made in Ousepensky's work: "eventually, all ideas become their opposite". It would explain why people never see it coming. There are subtle deviations that occur to bring things "full circle", and unless one applies pressure at those right moments, "democracy" eventually stops meaning "local self-government of the responsible" and starts meaning "oligarchy" or "mob rule". Gramsci callis this "revolution within the form". It's a familiar cycle, which Polybius taught on in the ancient world, as a very natural revolutionary process.

What kind of monster would look askance things like that! This allows them to conveniently ignore the wholesale disintegration of living standards in much of the developed industrial world.<br><br>But of course these are mainly the result of extremely cheap things that could have been done fifty years ago. Because Africa is starting from a low level of development, even inexpensive measures like mosquito netting make a huge statistical difference. And vaccinations have been around for decades before managing to get around to a slightly larger number of sick children. The ones who still don't get it are not counted.<br><br>The middle classes in China and India are increasing, but that's because of their low starting point. Eventually this will play out, and probably soon - look at Japan for example. And the optimists always point to inequality *between* countries as decreasing, probably as a deliberate distraction from what is happening domestically.

It's always our little experience with how the other 90% live. <br><br>Over the past year at home in rural Tennessee, I had become increasingly concerned about the prospects and outlooks of the young adults in this area. Due to the still-prevailing gender segregation of rural America, my interactions have mostly been with young men. I have been deeply concerned that they are worried about exactly the wrong things, and had unrealistic visions of what their future paths might hold.<br><br>Well, now, after a week around young men and women in suburban Atlanta, as well as their parents, I am thinking that by comparison our local hillbilly boys are doing pretty well. The suburbs, in contrast, seem to be awash in people who don't even think about *anything,* much less the "wrong" things. Unrealistic visions? Hah! NO visions! No goals, no strategies, no interest in anything but immediate gratification. Those kids seem to be absolutely lost into a world of nothing, with no awareness of or concern for today, tomorrow, or yesterday.<br><br>Yes, I know, we old fogies always think the kids these days are lazy and worthless. But I am comparing two groups of "kids these days," not "the kids these days" versus my rose-colored memories of "when we were your age." At least here in the hinterlands, the young guys actually have an idea that their lives do have a trajectory, and they believe that they have some control over that. When presented with hopeless prospects, they move away. Or join the military. Sure, some of them become meth-heads, drunks, and video game addicts. But even many of the pot-smoking drunks are still hustling around for odd jobs, scrap they can salvage and sell, etc. to help pay for their cigarettes and beer. And I am sure some of the suburban kids doubtless have plans, visions, goals, and strategies to achieve them. But it seems the wasteland is significantly more wasted in "the mainstream" than here in the "backwards backwoods." <br><br>On a side topic, the niece who hosted us (she's early 40s) works for the CDC.

I think mostly it is a difference in perception of what the first main sign of collapse is. To some the loss of their 401K and the closeing down of neighborhood Applebees is Collapse personified. While to one with your long view of history such events are but a baby step down the long staircase. I would propose my own yardstick of the first significant stage of collapse. <br><br> My Yardstick is an upside down version of the Pareto principle applied to the automobile. I beleive that when it happens most people would agree that when 80% of Americans can no longer afford to own and operate a personal car collapse will be upon us. I think this is an easy yardstick to measure, and given the all pervasive nature of the automobile in every aspect of American life such a milestone will be lifechanging for most. If we use this as a yardstick I think there will be much more agreement among those who study collapse.<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c407079767092251480 title="comment permalink">1/1/15, 11:51 AM</a><br><br>

He is a high school history teacher and has some historical knowledge, and I think is open-minded and intelligent enough of a person to read and consider a different point of view. She wanted to give him a few readings that might allow him to question his current worldview. Which ones might you choose? For those of you who once had a different worldview, what were the books most influential in your change of worldview?<br><br>Books that come to mind include: Richard Heinberg's books (though which one would be best?), JMG's The Long Descent. I haven't thought of any articles.<br><br>In the last 8 1/2 years I have read so many books and articles related to peak oil, the limits to growth, and industrial decline.

I'm looking forward to the release of After Oil 2 because I see it as a chance for people I know to read a peak oil-related book for the first time. For example, my parents (who while are not necessarily peak oil deniers, haven't grasped the full implications for the future). I've long wished they could read some of the peak oil books I've read, but they lead busy lives and that hasn't happened. But now that my After Oil short story will be published, they are very eager to read the anthology when it comes out.

This year, prevalence and gaudiness were both noticeably reduced, at least in the area I know best. Another is the amount of noise as the New Year arrives. It was colder than usual yesterday evening, but that doesn't usually put much of a damper on it. However, this year the intensity of noise and the length of time it lasted were both noticeably reduced. In fact I can't think of a year's start with less noise since we moved to this house almost 13 years ago.<br><br>Personally I had a good year, and I think making concrete preparations for decline had a lot to do with that. It isn't just that we now have a wood stove, for instance (though it was lovely to sit in front of the fire and warmth on New Year's Eve). It's also the deep-down satisfaction of seeing things clearly and taking appropriate action. I'm thinking over what to do along that line in 2015.

Someone who fought against all odds to recover from a disease or something, or the "pay it forward" types who do charity, leave a $400 tip. I'm thinking it's a sign how bad things have gotten that such pieces that were not worth reporting now seem to be front and center so much. Status quo cheerleading, I guess.<br>Hapibeli,<br>I'm bullish on Canada, and here's why:<br>JMG has mentioned that the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes will be the new centers of power in North America, as global warming destroys the coastal cities. The US base of power is on the coasts, while Canada's base of power is on the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence. I can easily see Canada outliving the US, and an Ottawa based "New Canada" composing Ontario, possibly Quebec, and Great Lakes states stretching from New York to Minn. as a future powerful North American country. I could easily see that government/constitution continous with the same Canada founded on Confederation in 1867, meeting on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, same as today.<br>Canada's founding myths of "Peace, Order, and Good Government", Loyalism (little "c" conservatism/monarchism/resistance to revolutionary change), and unresolved conflicts (Anglophone/Francophone, English/French Canada) are much more conducive to our current situation that the US founding myths.<br>If fascism does break out in the US, and some equivalent of the American People's Party takes hold and starts to enact a reign of terror a la Hitler, then Canada has many options available to it. it could appeal to China for support on the basis of its not insignificant Chinese Canadian population. I'm sure China would consider Canada a major coup/score the same way the USSR did Cuba during the Cold War. Considering Chinese helpful diplomacy, I'm sure they'd offer support to help Canada resist American fascism. If the American People's Party does, for whatever reason, outdo Hitler and the Nazis, you can bet that the US will be a dirty word among refugees, never to be mentioned in a positive context in polite company, much the same way WWII refugees responded, and Germans responded after the war.<br>All in all, Canada is well positioned. My guess is that Harper and his cronies would get the boot real quickly in the event of an American collapse, and that Canada would revert more to its traditional form in keeping with its history dating back to the United Empire Loyalists.<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c1499038456505991252 title="comment permalink">1/1/15, 3:31 PM</a><br><br>

I've seen the equivalent -- the progress-worshipping equivalent of speaking in tongues, in which bits of technobabble get flung together incoherently as though the Holy Spirit of Progress was speaking through them. Bah. <br><br>Tubaplayer, thank you. Yes, it may get very, er, interesting. <br><br>Greg, yes, I saw those articles -- you're right that they paint a picture most Americans desperately don't want to see. As for the NYPD, they'd better be careful or they'll emulate the last doctor's strike in the US, which happened in California in the 1970s. The death rate dropped by some 15%, as I recall, and once word started leaking out that that was happening, the strike was over <i>very</i> fast. <br><br>Crow, there's one straightforward and utterly necessary way to break the feedback loop: <i><b>talk to the police</b></i>. Sit down with officers over beers and get them talking about how they see the world; if what they say isn't politically correct, leave the self-righteousness at home and let it pass for the time being. Open up a dialogue with them, not on the overfamiliar basis of who did what to whom, but trying to understand what's going on behind the scenes, and what's driving the violence. Then direct some of your efforts toward responding to their concerns as well as those of the rest of the community. The police are only part of the problem, and they're potentially also part of the solution; treat them as stakeholders who can be included in the process, not as the villains of the piece, and you may get somewhere. <br><br>Diana, no argument there. We are already in the process of collapsing, and the steep downward trend in product quality is one sign of that. <br><br>Violet, you're welcome and thank you! You've mentioned something that's going to be a central theme in upcoming posts: the one meaningful alternative to despair is getting up off the couch and doing something. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Stu, thanks for the heads up. My assumption all along -- based on previous examples -- is that things in the shale patch will be spinning out of control far more quickly, and far more extremely, than the media is letting on; by the time the first news stories about bankruptcies hit, it'll already all be over but the shouting.

Thus I don't think it's actually that useful to have a single metric for what counts as collapse, because collapse is a process, not an event; the collapse of industrial civilization has been under way for quite some time now, and will still be a going concern for longer than any of us will be alive.

This develops an idea JMG has been suggesting for a while.<br><br>In the spirit of dissensus, I disagree. The various revolutions (Orange, Rose, etc) were based in a specifically US vision of "democracy". Perhaps I shouldn't even say "US"; I probably mean "Beltway". <br><br>In this vision, there is a natural group of the population who support US-friendly principles. This groups are therefore designated "the People", and are funded to promote US-friendly ideals (and, if possible, to install a new government that will follow US-friendly policies).<br><br>This works, because the American Dream still has global resonance - even if what the protestors actually get is corporate control of their supply chains, asset-stripping on a national scale, and other unintended consequences.<br><br>None of the Foreign Powers who have been suggested have anything like such a universalist vision to justify and empower any interference. In fact, currently, all of them are basing their policy very specifically on the preservation of national sovereignty against the idea of corporate internationalism.<br><br>What they DO share is a philosophy based on letting opponents over-extend themselves. China, for example, produced Sun Zi, and still values his thinking. Russia has repeatedly allowed opponents to stretch their own supply lines to breaking point before closing for the kill (as well as being led by a champion judoka, who thoroughly understands the practice of using the enemy's own force against him).<br><br>All this being the case, I can't see a Foreign Power funding a US colour revolution; the raw material isn't there in any kind of organised way, and there isn't the fertile ideological ground that's necessary.<br><br>Far more effective would be to use the US's weaknesses against it. A few fake ISIS operatives sabotage irreplaceable substations in the electrical grid, perhaps; what would happen in Ferguson, I wonder, after a few weeks without power? No need to organize anyone - just provide the right conditions for opposition to emerge spontaneously... Or perhaps just wait for the real ISIS to do it on their own - they've certainly threatened it...<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c148243064747268728 title="comment permalink">1/1/15, 11:51 PM</a><br><br>

As a consequence of strife between nations of classes there might be local and temporary anarchy ,a passing phase . Anarchy is essentially weak and in an anarchic world any firmly organised group with rational organisation and scientific knowledge could spread its dominion over the rest . And as an alternative to anarchy , the World would welcome the despotic state .Then the world might enter upon a period of spiritual "petrifaction" , a terrible order which for the higher activities of the human spirit would be death . The petrifaction of the Roman Empire and the petrifaction of China would appear less rigid because ( in our case ) the ruling group would have much greater scientific means of power .( Do you know Lord MacAulays essay on "History"? . He argues that the barbarian invasions were a blessing in the long run because they broke up the petrifaction ."it cost Europe a thousand years of barbarism to escape the fate of China " . There would be no barbarian races to break up the future totalitarian state .)<br>" it seems to me possible that in such a totalitarian state , while philosophy and poetry would languish , scientific research might go on with continuous fresh discoveries . Greek science did not find the Ptolemaic realm an uncongenial environment , and i think , generally speaking , natural science may flourish under a despotism . It is to the interest of the ruling group to encourage what may increase their means of power . That , not anarchy , is for me the night,are ahead , if we do not dind a way of ending our present fratricidal strife . But there is the Christian Church there , a factor to be reckoned with .

Recently, I overheard a retired Baltimore City policeman talk to a few of my co-workers. I tried not to eavesdrop, but I couldn't help but hear as he poured out his tale of woe. He and his wife had several run-ins with the law themselves, courtesy of their troubled son and daughter-in-law. He seemed to feel the law was both too strict when aimed at himself and people he liked, and too lenient with people he didn't like. He finished his lament with two statements I found chilling. <br><br>First, in reference to the Ferguson protests, et al, he said, "They got the police they wanted. They protested about 'police brutality' (you could hear the air quotes) and now they have people running wild in the streets. Police have targets on their backs." Apparently, he believes that police have been too lenient, and need to crack down more. Bustin' heads, and all that.<br><br>Second, in a low, intense voice he said, "There's a revolution coming."<br><br>I live in a relatively conservative area of Maryland. I hear tis sort of "rhetoric heated to the point of incandescence," all the time. I know a few firearm enthusiasts who have stockpiled weapons and ammunition, anticipating (hoping for?) trouble. As someone who has diffculty keeping my mouth shut, I sometimes wonder if I might end up like Hypatia. I feel a need to learn more discretion.<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c8958869853753898856 title="comment permalink">1/2/15, 6:20 AM</a><br><br>

Usually the 31st of January at least pretends to be festive. This year, there were solemn midnight toasts to the people who died, and in the morning the sound of quiet chewing as people ate their black-eyed peas, nursed their wounds, and braced themselves for another year. I do have hopes for myself this year. Doors are opening, goals are nearing completion, and I’m learning how to look for opportunities in the midst of hardship. There may be some berries hidden among the bramble as this year’s crops spring up. <br><br>I’m disappointed with the Rebecca Solnit news. Her “Field Guide to Getting Lost” is one of my most cherished books and rarely strays too far from my pocket. It’s helped me through some dark times and helped me to learn how to see beauty and meaning in decline and decay. I saw another article from her floating around the message boards of one of the transition communities I used to be involved in about how personal lifestyle changes weren’t going to make a difference and only top down systemic transformation could make a difference. It doesn’t devalue her other writing for me, but it is sad to see someone I once admired and respected saying things that are so completely out of line with the very ideas that drew me to her writing in the first place. Of course, most of the transition towners I know have been taking a similar path. It’s been years since any of them mentioned reskilling or community building, and when they haven’t dropped out altogether they spend time passing petitions.<br><br>One thing I’ve been watching with interest this month has been a shanty town growing up under a bridge on my route to work. It started with a single homeless person getting a citation from an officer. A few days later the same guy was there with a tent, getting another citation. A few days later there were two tents. Now, 3 weeks later there are 8 tents, a few boxes, and some loose blankets on the ground. The cops don’t even bother to come there anymore. People are setting in for the long haul it seems.<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c8717558165488838339 title="comment permalink">1/2/15, 7:52 AM</a><br><br>

I'd say the drop in oil prices surprised nearly everyone, but isn't at all a good sign. 2. Eating some kale is good, but beware of hyperkalemia. 3. A relative was contesting a speeding ticket. Instead of a judge she had a police sergeant as arbitrator. She said she thought the local police were crooked. He said I'm not going to disagree with you, but don't quote me or I'll deny it. He was retiring soon. 4. My feeling is that there are three groups of Americans. The recession had very little impact on the top group, and some refuse to even take notice of the effects. The recession has had a great impact on the bottom group, and many of them are in tough straits. Aside from the Occupy protesters, the middle group has been keeping their heads down and trying hard to stay out of the bottom group. 5. Auto sales were one of the few categories that went up over the holidays. I suspect people in the middle group finally exhaled and replaced their ten-year-old clunkers, but many bought pickup trucks.<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c3393210817927501117 title="comment permalink">1/2/15, 10:01 AM</a><br><br>

It's the ones at the top of the food chain just now that have the furthest to fall. <br><br>Iuval, try some of the links <a href=http://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/2qu54d/shale_oil_the_next_subprime_crisis/ rel=nofollow>here</a>. <br><br>Compound F, the Long Descent thesis includes the likelihood of sudden discontinuities -- local, regional, national, or global -- on the way down. Remember, it's like falling down a stair, not like sliding down a ramp!<br><br>Andrew, history doesn't bear that out. I should probably do a post one of these days on the ways that Greek mythology came to embody ecological warnings derived from the Mycenean collapse. <br><br>Bogatyr, I take it you haven't seen the remarkable amount of fawning around Putin's feet among a range of American pundits in the alternative scene. Putin's Russia is doing a fairly good job of positioning itself to stand for something just as global as the late lamented American dream: a vision of order and traditional values immensely appealing to many people in a time of social disintegration and decadence. Don't underestimate the power of that vision in the US and elsewhere; a glance at European history will show just how much raw political force it can wield. <br><br>Gwaiharad, I didn't criticize the post in its entirety; I simply pointed out that it finesses the brutal violence and unpleasant consequences of the French Revolution, and noted that this is a sign to watch for. <br><br>Spanish Fly, I'm sorry to hear that. I wonder when anybody will wake up to the fact that promising good times and then not delivering on the promise is a recipe for disaster and an invitation to demagogues. <br><br>Marc, that's certainly one possibility. <br><br>Donald, the abandoned house next to ours has been torn down, and there are plenty of other empty houses in town waiting for the same fate.

I was born in the States but grew up in Canada as a Canadian. 1/2 my relatives are American, the other 1/2 is Canadian. My sister is American, another brother is French, and my closest brother has just renounced his US citizenship and turned in his passport. It cost him $2300 to do so as well as the same for his wife who was a US army vet (major).<br><br>Religion: We have absolutely no idea what religion our leaders have followed and couldn't care less. In the US, someone who is not religious and did not go to the 'right church' would not be elected. Here, it is meaningless. No one cares.<br><br>Education: Canada has more leveled implementation and better outcomes.<br><br>Health Care: Universal single payer, no deductibles. Some Provinces charge premiums and some do not. outcomes much better at far less cost.<br><br>Energy: We are in fact, energy independent and export at least the same amount we use. Our energy is taxed at a higher rate to fund infrastructure, etc.<br><br>Exceptionalism: True, we do take pride in not being American and also tend to resent obese US tourists travelling in their hulking motorhomes. US obesity rates are at least 10% higher than Canadian rates, despite our eating poutine!!<br><br>Firearms (handguns): A very restricted weapon and impossible to obtain a handgun carry license anywhere in Canada. Automatic weapons restricted/banned. Long rifle registry attempted and failed. It has since been rescinded. We have gun control. Gun crimes are 3X higher in US than Canada.<br><br>As for independent bloody mindedness, it depends on where you live...rural vrs urban. Where I live we tend to make our own rules and resent outside interference. For example, we have no local building code, resent health dept intrusions, etc. If I want to shoot a rifle in my yard then so be it.<br><br>Until Harper came along we did not send soldiers to maintain empire after WW2. We used to be considered UN peacekeepers. Now, not so much.<br><br>Hockey is a religion, other sports not followed too much. We all sing 'Oh Canada', but leave the patriotic heart covering pledges to others.<br><br>Hey, we had Rob Ford...our crack smoking drunk mayor of Toronto. I guess you had those Chicago and Wash DC Crooked mayors. Aren't they both in jail? <br><br>Speaking of which, our prison system is public and not 'for profit private' as in the USA. We don't incarcerate as many people per capita 140/100,000 vrs 716/100,000. We also have no capital punishment, nor do Provinces have the right to implement such as compared to states.<br><br><br><br>These are just a few differences.

As far as the science goes , with things like genetically modifying our food supply in an attempt to control it , this is not a progressive improvement by any stretch , but rather " a great leap forward" perhaps . I also disagree that christianity could be our saving grace , though the dude that runs it now seems to have his eyes open , how long he will last is anyones guess ..<br><br>Speaking of barbarians , there is a rather excellent history channel show at the moment called "Vikings " depicting the adventures of Ragnar Lothbrook and the Incursions into England starting with the raid on the monastery at Lindisfarne around 800 AD . It shows that these " barbarians" were anything but primitive , and the scenes of the pagan celebrations at Uppsala where every nine years ,nine warriors are sacrificed and hung upside down from trees to bleed out are unlike anything i have wver witnessed .

A trend of increasing decadence, consumption, waste. What you're seeing is just the grotesque culmination of a trend going back 50 years that's well past it's pull date. I see the same thing in the conventional suburban youth I interact with, and it's frightening--to me, they seem downright soulless, already dead, if you will.<br>Ed-M<br>Please reread JMG'S posts regarding fascism, where he discusses fascism as "totalitarianism of the center". I don't think that the North, or the "progressive" parts of the country are any more immune to fascism than the rest, if anything, they're probably more prone to it. Like JMG, I think that the flinty South and Mountain West will probably be hotbeds of resistance to any centralized fascism. When I envisioned an Ottawa based eastern Canada that includes part of the Great Lakes U.S., that would be well after any fascism had fizzled and burned, and the area could be easily conquered or consolidated. In the near term, I figure any unrest/fascism in the U.S. would shock the Canadians into appealing to China or India on behalf of the danger posed to Canada's significant Chinese and Indian Canadian community.<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c9072822363927838474 title="comment permalink">1/2/15, 5:30 PM</a><br><br>

XY avoided the fate of many in Reich-occupied Estonia by taking, and passing, the Fooey's radio exam. He thereby had the happy fate of serving in a radio monitoring station rather than shooting at people. The exam required a speed of 24 w.p.m. or thereabouts. In the field, XY's task proved simple enough: Fooey's adversary at the Eastern Front, namely a bunch of (dim?) guys in Uncle Joe's "Red Army", was communicating in a code consisting entirely of numerals. XY had to write down what he was hearing and then pass the transcript to a bunch of specialists in the decrypt room (a room which was, admittedly, off limits to the Estonians: Estonians and Germans have traditionally not been pals). I suspect from XY's narrative that Uncle Joe's codes were weak. The decryption, I am thinking, was a matter of mere pencil-and-paper work, unlike Bletchley Park's decrypts of the Fooey's Enigma and Colossus traffic. <br><br>Noteworthy among the various contemporary Web offerings for students of Morse are <a href=http://www.morseresource.com/morse/makemorse.php rel=nofollow>http://www.morseresource.com/morse/makemorse.php</a> and <a href=http://www.morseresource.com/quotes.php rel=nofollow>http://www.morseresource.com/quotes.php</a>. The former I have used only a tiny bit. The latter I used to use a lot. <br><br>The aid I use most is the MFJ-418 "Pocket Morse Code Tutor" (just used it tonite). My current drill involves random pseudo-words on this machine, assembled from the 44 FCC-examinable characters, at 22 w.p.m. If you are seeking an MFJ-418, you might be able to pick one up for around 100 USD. <br><br>I also see from case notes that there are some good YouTube vids, from Uncle Sam, either at the time of WW2 or from a couple of decades later, showing among other things how a good wrist at the key is so steady that a coin lodged on the wrist upper surface does not drop off. <br><br>One might want to consider whether to use the Koch or, alternatively, the Farnsworth strategy for learning Morse (cf <a href=http://www.eham.net/articles/8813 rel=nofollow>http://www.eham.net/articles/8813</a>. One or other of these two strategies is probably advisable, since otherwise one risks getting into the dreaded "speed trap", wherein one is forever stuck at 5 w.p.m., with the speed refusing to go up because a 5 w.p.m. aural habit has become ingrained. <br><br>We may well find Morse prominent in the upcoming Dark Age, I imagine at 15 w.p.m. or so. <br><br>Thanks very much also, August Johnson, for chiming in on the discussion of Morse, and referring to your dad. I glanced a moment ago at the nice, short, Wikipedia writeup of your dad's most celebrated work, at <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBV_photometric_system rel=nofollow>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBV_photometric_system</a>. <br><br><br><br>Sincerely,<br><br><br>Tom = Toomas Karmo<br><br>on northern outskirts of Toronto<br><br>www dot metascientia dot com<br><br>Toomas dot Karmo at gmail dot com<br><br>VA3KMZ<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c6718103667908649357 title="comment permalink">1/2/15, 6:25 PM</a><br><br>

We are approximately 30+ million immigrants with 1.1 million indigenous people. Our national future will be entirely in the hands of the neighbour to the south with 10X our population and/or whatever further flung nations might wish to usurp the U.S. claim to our resources.

You wrote:<br><br>"Bogatyr, I take it you haven't seen the remarkable amount of fawning around Putin's feet among a range of American pundits in the alternative scene. Putin's Russia is doing a fairly good job of positioning itself to stand for something just as global as the late lamented American dream: a vision of order and traditional values immensely appealing to many people in a time of social disintegration and decadence. Don't underestimate the power of that vision in the US and elsewhere; a glance at European history will show just how much raw political force it can wield."<br><br>I see this as -shall we say -verging on alarmist, and I'm uncomfortable with the emotive position you're taking. You don't use the words, but what you wrote seems rather too close to the "Putin is Hitler" meme being spread by the MSM.<br><br>If you're on the 'alternative' scene there are some genuinely good reasons to cheer Putin on. <br><br>One particular example might be that Russia is actively resisting the corporate domination that has long since been accomplished in the US, and to which the EU is currently yielding. In Russia there are, and will be, no GMO foods, for example. Frankly, this pleases me, and I'd like to see my own political leaders show some of the same backbone. <br><br>But: this is being done purely within Russia, for Russia. Is is an example to be emulated? I could wish so. Is it a conscious positioning for international leadership? No, in no way.<br><br>As for social attitudes in Russia... well, you often say that you don't write about the world outside the US because you don't know it and, if I may say so, this is one of the times when it shows.<br><br>Most of the Russians I know and work with are open-minded and tolerant people. <br><br>In Russia generally, I would say that it's certainly no worse than - say - 1980s Britain, which I remember well and was a misogynistic, not very liberal, and certainly not gay-friendly time.<br><br>The liberalism of the contemporary West is a VERY recent thing, made possible by the very flow of oil wealth that we spend so much time discussing here - 20 years of it. The Russians, in contrast, spent the same period trying not to starve, not to freeze, and not to get shot in a social and economic collapse <a href=http://www.softpanorama.org/Skeptics/Pseudoscience/harvard_mafia.shtml#Economic_rape_of_post_USSR_economic_space_was_by_design_not_by_accident rel=nofollow>engineered by Harvard economists</a>. Of course, as a result, it's a more socially conservative society than the West. Putin's entire career has been about building the country back up from that. In fact, he's been incredibly successful. BUT, again, this has been in Russia, for Russia, using purely Russian material. There's no ideology ready for export, no expansionism. Given a decade or two of prosperity, Russia would certainly catch up with the West in social attitudes. The fact that it's going the other way now is a response to NATO's aggressive stance, unfortunately.<br><br>So, I really don't think it's necessary to call up the ghosts of the 1930s; that's not what's happening here.<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c3662349780791440230 title="comment permalink">1/3/15, 12:33 AM</a><br><br>

I respect the fact that you are happy to review your predictions against reality. Only the strong as they say.<br><br>I haven't been able to comment here for a few days as the weather has been a bit nerve wracking in that it has been just so hot. There isn't much unusual about that at this time of year here, but it is the human factor of arson that is the wild card. <br><br>Fortunately, the cool change has just arrived with a little bit of rain and the birds are happily singing to each other: "Let's get it on..." Whatever that means... Anyway, they sound pretty happy.<br><br>Speaking of which, this year with the shrub layer being better established many smaller birds are hanging around all day bouncing in and out of the foliage eating who knows what. Last year they departed for cooler parts of the forest, so I'm treating this as the incremental win that it certainly is.<br><br>I thought that it might also be worth mentioning that last year - now that it has been completed - was the second hottest year on record here: <a href=http://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/australias-2014-weather-in-review/215034 rel=nofollow>2014 Australian weather in review</a>. Well done everyone, keep up the good work.<br><br>It would be easy to sink into despair about such things or hide in a shopping mall, or cinema - but I chose instead to adapt to the conditions – there is no air conditioner here although the power system could easily run one - and have instead been out making some more concrete steps on the farm. I had a vision the other day for a proper potato patch and how it would all integrate into the rest of the farms systems, it unfortunately just required a whole lot of hard work under a brutal sun... Those stoics set the bar high for standards of behaviour. Unfortunately I had to move some plants at this time of year to achieve that vision and there has been a survival rate of about 10% because of the extreme heat.

All those US dollars that they have, have to end up somewhere, so it might as well be here. I believe we just signed a free trade agreement with them too - those agreements have worked out so well for us in the past with other countries. Honestly there was even talk very recently of signing alternative banking arrangements so that we can trade in the yuan in a local SE Asian block. A lot of other neighbouring SE Asian countries have I believe signed up to this. My understanding is that our treasurer was very excited about signing up for this arrangement but we were advised against signing this by other interested parties. Unfortunately I don't know enough about international financing arrangements to understand it better or even know how it turned out. No disrespect to the Chinese, as I'd do exactly the same if I were in their position and maybe, they may be cheaper?<br><br>Hi Sarah,<br><br>Respect for the classic 80's film reference. Top work what a great film!<br><br>Hi Diana,<br><br>Quality tools can still be purchased, it's just that they're really, really, expensive as they reflect the true cost of those items. Incidentally I pick up antique tools where ever I find them as the steel is much higher quality and longer lasting. I had a mass produced rake here which lasted 6 months before it's untimely demise and that is just wrong. It was the final straw for me.<br><br>Hi Violet,<br><br>All good options. Did you know that the ancient Aboriginals used to use charcoal to clean their teeth? Very clever as it works on so many different layers. Without all of the sugar and acidity of modern diets too think of what impact that would have on dental hygiene? Remember too that more plant matter = a less acidic diet. Just sayin...<br><br>Hi Phil,<br><br>I hear you man. It is evil. I've been rubbishing on for a while now about how the government here is failing to crack down on transfer pricing - which is the tricky process of sending local profits off shore to low tax havens through all sorts of techniques such as inter-company loan interest, management fees etc. Yeah, much of the big end of town is apparently not paying much in the way of company tax: <a href=http://www.smh.com.au/business/a-taxing-tale-of-two-peak-bodies-20150101-12gcty.html rel=nofollow>A taxing tale of two peak bodies</a>.

Our children are much bigger, stronger, and healthier than they were this time last year, as are we (the end of 2013 was really rough for us). Sales of our little herbal company's products have been stronger, and run later in the season than ever before.

Our fruit trees, berries, herbs, garlic, small stock and mushroom crops have all had a stellar year.<br><br>And not because the general trends are moving in those directions either! Im not trying to be Sister Mary Sunshine here.

So, since I have no resolutions to make, my wish for 2015 is for a gentle but unmistakable nudge to move a lot more people in the direction of constructive action this year.

So picture all those advantages of Canada, and remember that after autos, people in suburbs surrounded by suburbs (that used to be on middling-good farmland) will be walking around with buckets of water and bags of grain like in Africa. In such a situation they might have wished that we hadn't wasted so much productive land and burdened ourselves with such long trips on foot, just to feed our lazy narcissism for a mere fifty years or less.<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c5415244389409218051 title="comment permalink">1/3/15, 8:03 AM</a><br><br>

You may be correct for 2015 too. However, in talking about all the bursting bubbles, don't overlook the possibility of the largest bubble in history popping, that of the US dollar, which would entail overnight catastrophic global turmoil.<br><br>It seems that private demand for physical gold, especially from Asia, outstrips global supply 2 fold. That gold has to be coming from central bank vaults and when it runs out gold price will spike. This will mark the end of the US dollar, which will have some implications...<br><br>- the US trade deficit will end, which means all its imported oil will end. Expect oil price to spike. Also, all the imported electronic crap from Asia will end.<br><br>- the entire financial system will end. The dollar will be inflated many fold, and if we're lucky the freefall will be stopped with a peg to a new hard currency, and we'll only have a 10 fold devaluation. If not, expect hyperinflation. Interest rates will shoot up, destroying all this housing and consumption and fracking bubble. Expect unemployment to rise from today's 25% to around 90% as all the financial workers, and those working in service industries selling imported gadgets from China, and those working in the fracking oil patch, all lose their jobs, as well as all the associated lawyers and construction workers and engineers etc etc down the line. And I can't imagine what any of these people are going to do for jobs in the future either unless cheap manufacturing can be lured back over like China did to the US. That will take decades however and I wonder if there will still be a country left by then.<br><br>- what will be the implications of overnight 90% unemployment and soaring inflation? Total chaos. I only hope the military has plans to distribute food to cities out the backs of trucks, or else... And I can't see how this outcome can possibly be avoided. And it all rests on the gold suppression scheme continuing, which as I said, is inflating the greatest bubble in history which is enabling gross economic distortions of a global scale to continue. This is a bubble and like all bubbles, when it ends, it will not unravel slowly.<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c1300189407766606497 title="comment permalink">1/3/15, 8:23 AM</a><br><br>

I've tried to fend off 2015 in the night before New Year's Eve, and at first, things went fine. But then, the New Year seemed to have used the bubbles of the sparkling wine to send through some infiltration troops. They built up a bridgehead and provided covering fire, and before I was able to take effective counter measures, the whole January had marched in. Well, I could stop things at that point and succeeded in repelling at least the February. (:<br><br><br>@ Bogatyr: And what if a considerable number of US citizens (mainly from the middle class) should realise that it is their own government that keeps the very "American Dream" from them? The US government (as well as any other Western one) gives any support it can to let the super-rich just become super-duper-rich, at the expense of the overwhelming majority.<br><br>Voting isn't a mean to do anything about that because no matter what you vote, you may get different faces, but no different politics. Democracy, however, isn't about "elections"; the whole point is that the government shall make its decisions for the good of the vast majority, which isn't the case in any Western "democracy" anymore, and elections have failed to force the "democratic" governments to do so.<br><br>As soon as enough citizens understand that they have already been robbed of democracy by their own elites, getting rid of said class without (useless) elections might seem a more attractive idea.<br><br>Remember that the Ukrainian government that the canned US insurgency brought to fall HAD been elected. So why not bringing the US administration to fall? Because it had been elected? HAHAHA. As if the US government had been caring about such questions.<br><br>The only question is whether there is enough malcontent in the population on which to draw. For the US? Sure. The one big question that a vast majority of the voters (democrats and republicans and others alike!) can agree on is that they deeply mistrust the US federal government. The powder is there, the US government has taken great care to put it there; it's just a question of who will put a spark to it, and when.<br><br>Of course Russia would NOT foster some US insurgency along the lines of "Russian Dream in the US", that would be stupid (what "Russian Dream", anyway?!). It would be far more convincing to launch the whole thing the other way round - selling the "American Dream" to the USA!<br><br>Like "Priviet dear average US Americans, Russia doesn't have anything against you, you are fine. It's just your government that makes trouble to Russia AND to you. That's why Russia, and also China, will help the US citizens to restore their democracy. We are in the same boat!" They would not try to invade the US. Why would they - the chaos alone that would result in the US would suit their goals perfectly well.

My primary reason for being upset is that I have it on the strength of a quasi-insider (not a real-life diplomat or real-life security analyst, sorry) that the current acquittal rate in Russian courts is negligible, and that more generally the legal system over there, with police bribery and other abuses, bears scant resemblance to the systems of Canada or Britain. <br><br>My curiosity piqued, I quickly checked a couple of international-rankings sites. <br><br>(a) <a rel=nofollow>https://freedomhouse.org/&gt;</a> puts Russia into the category of "non-free" states, along with Algeria, Zimbabwe, and various others. This is two steps down from the contemporary UK, which is in the "free" bin. One step down from the UK are "semi-free" jurisdictions, such as Turkey.<br><br>(b) <a href=http://democracyranking.org rel=nofollow>http://democracyranking.org</a> puts Russian governance into the same unhappy bin, called "Low", as the less happy parts of Africa (though Egypt, for one, is still worse, at "Very Low"). A step up from this is "Medium" (Turkey, e.g.) Next comes "High", which includes Spain and Italy and (I note to my chagrin, having hoped for better) Estonia. The contemporary UK is in the "Very High" bin, and this is one notch below the "Top Ten" bin (Finland, and other Scandinavia; and Germany - and New Zealand). <br><br>(c) The International Human Rights Rank Indicator at <a href=http://www.ihrri.com/ rel=nofollow>http://www.ihrri.com/</a> puts contemporary Britain into the Top 15 (giving it a rank of 12; first place goes to Sweden). Canada is 10th (this is nice, since here I live), Estonia 39th (this is not good), and Russia 46th. <br><br>That is all I have the patience for at the moment. But perhaps someone else has the patience to uncover more stats. Comparative incarceration rates, and actual concrete comparative figures on acquittal rates, might help this discussion. <br><br>I feel particularly moved because I lived in the UK for four years, in the 1970s, and found the British attachment to law and due process to be one of the more remarkable strengths of that remarkably positive society. <br><br><br><br>(signed) <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br>on northern fringe of Toronto <br><br>www dot metascientia dot com<br><br>Toomas dot Karmo at gmail dot com<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c5339940024679869697 title="comment permalink">1/3/15, 12:13 PM</a><br><br>

All it takes is a bit more travel down the arc of decline and fall. <br><br>Philip, thanks for the link -- I'll put it on the to-read list. <br><br>Susan, thanks for the heads up! Yes, that's about what I expect. <br><br>Gwyneth, thank you for using the word "presumed." If it were true that merely postponing elective surgeries dropped the total death rate by 15%, then elective surgeries would be among the most lethally dangerous procedures in our society -- how many other causes account for so large a fraction of total deaths? I'd love to see hard numbers on death rates before, during, and after doctor's strikes, broken down by cause of death -- but I suspect those numbers will not be forthcoming. <br><br>Bogatyr, er, as I'm sure you're aware, the phrase "European history" covers a span of years rather larger than the period from 1933 to 1945. No, I wasn't thinking of Herr Schicklgruber in this context -- quite the contrary; the attitudes for whom Putin has become an international symbol have more in common with the people who tried to vaporize the Fuehrer with an assortment of bombs. That's a rising current these days, in Europe and North America alike; a lot of people are sick of the way things have gone in recent decades, and see a lot of promise in returning to the values of an earlier era. The American pundits who have a schoolgirl crush on Putin are paralleled by figures such as Marine Le Pen in France, who pretty clearly sees Putin as a role model. <br><br>I should probably stress here that none of this is a criticism of Putin. It's Russia's very good fortune that in this crisis of her history, she's got a talented despot at the helm, just as it's America's misfortune -- a predictable misfortune, given the normal trajectory of empire, but a misfortune nonetheless -- to have a crew of feckless drones in charge of its destiny. Meanwhile, the ghost of Oswald Spengler is watching all this unfold with a thin Teutonic smile; not quite a century ago, he talked about the coming conflict between plutocracy disguised as democracy and charismatic Caesarism, which the former would eventually lose. <br><br>Cherokee, no question the Stoics set the bar high, but any lower doesn't do the job. As for cooler weather, here in the Appalachians, at least, we haven't actually had that much of that; it's raining here today, not snowing. If we get some, I'll see if I can package it for shipping. ;-)<br><br>Irishwildeye, I learned small group politics in an assortment of fraternal lodges, and the same rules apply everywhere: if you want to accomplish anything, you need to figure out how to get everyone else on board, and that means finding out what their wants, needs, hopes, and fears are, and offering them something they want in exchange for their support. It's the loss of that simple insight that has turned politics here in the US into a permanent car wreck.

There is a Canadian culture, but it's harder to find.<br>* There's less gun violence, and the police are definitely less corrupt here in Canada than where I was in Florida. On the other hand, there's some remarkably lenient attitudes towards crimes here. The place is awash with drugs, as well. The frequency with which I smell marijuana from passing cars is far higher in Canada.<br>* The elementary and secondary educational system was as good or better in my Florida college town than here. <br>* There's a lot more smokers here than in Florida, from what I can tell.<br>* The single-payer healthcare is easier to deal with, but the low fees result in the doctors trying to see you in about 2 minutes per visit, and trying to split your various issues into separate office visits so they can charge the Province for each one. In Florida, I got more personalized care and longer visits, but I had to then chase &amp; corner the insurance company to pay my doctor. <br>* Authority figures still command a deference in Canada not found in the U.S., an attitude that seems to be a remnant of the class system.<br>* I don't see how Canada can survive in it's current built form without massive use of fossil fuels. You can live without air conditioning in Florida, but if you can't heat your house in Canada, you can't even have indoor plumbing, and you'll freeze to death. Plus, all the food (in Calgary, at least) is imported except grains and beef. So, while they HAVE a lot of fossil fuels, they seem totally unprepared to do without.<br>* Alberta seems is run by a one-party dictatorship of marginal and fading competency. Florida is run by a bunch of whackjobs and real-estate developer hacks who only get elected through extreme gerrymandering and the patheticness of their Democratic opponents. <br>* Southern girls are prettier :-).<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c7983710997219489413 title="comment permalink">1/3/15, 9:01 PM</a><br><br>

Raj Persaud &amp; Peter Bruggen on the topic):<br><br><i>"It looks like a surprising amount of mortality occurs following this kind of procedure [elective surgeries] which disappears when elective surgery ceases due to doctors withdrawing their labour. Mortality declined steadily from week one (21 deaths/100,000 population) to weeks six (13 deaths) and seven (14 deaths), when mortality rates were lower than the averages of the previous five years.<br><br>However, as soon as elective surgery resumed, there was a rise in deaths.<br><br>There were 90 more deaths associated with surgery for the two weeks following the strike in 1976 (i.e. when doctors went back to work) than there had been during the same period in 1975...<br><br>50% of the doctors participated in the LA 1976 strike."</i><br><br>In the longer running Israeli strike in Jerusalem from 2 March to 26 June 1983, mortality remained flat and did not increase when elective surgery resumed immediately after the strike.<br><br>There are about 225,000 iatrogenic deaths per year in the U.S. But even that number may be off by as much as 40% due to under-reporting.<br><br><a href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039606099001622 rel=nofollow>Review of surgical adverse events Colorado &amp; Utah 1992</a> suggests that while adverse events were no more or less likely with surgical vs. non-surgical treatment (hospital setting), nonetheless 66% of all adverse events were surgical in origin.<br><br>Two alternate theories (beyond elective surgery cessation) for the flattened or dropping mortality rates during doctor strikes were also suggested by Drs. Raj Persaud and Peter Bruggen in their review: <br><br><i>1) the public, and perhaps doctors themselves, overestimate the ability of medicine to stave off or have an impact on mortality.<br><br>or<br><br>2) patients live longer when doctors go on strike, [because] the profession finally shakes off the shackles of its employer's restrictive practices, and returns, albeit temporarily, to practicing medicine freely, as it would really like to.</i><br><br>In no doctor strike are all medical services removed and in the LA strike, doctors opened up aid stations to prevent mobbing of the hospitals.<br><br>My own bias would be that hospitalization involves high risk of lethal adverse events (nosocomial infection, surgical complication, adverse drug interactions). The intensity of intervention (whether warranted or not) is higher in hospital than what is offered out in the community and therefore would carry more risk.<br><br>While the national data suggest 106,000 of the 225,000 deaths are due to non-error drug effect, there is no breakdown of those drug effect deaths that occurred in hospital vs. those in the community. The remaining 120,000 deaths all occur in hospital settings (infection, other error, unnecessary surgery, and medication error).<br><br>However in-community adverse drug events (non-lethal) are another story. A study in Canada suggests about 95% of these events goes unreported to various tracking agencies [BC Carleton, MA Smith, Drug safety: Side effects and mistakes or adverse reactions and deadly errors? BCMJ, Vol. 48, No. 7, September 2006, page(s) 329-333].<br><br>In other words, iatrogenic mortality likely rests within the hospital, but iatrogenic harm is probably higher outside the hospital.<br><br>That's all I got.<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c1287042197216108145 title="comment permalink">1/3/15, 11:14 PM</a><br><br>

Certainly, I don't think Russia is as delusional as the US projecting itself of the world stage, but I don't think it's plausible at all to say that Russia has no world ambitions. Russia views itself as a global player, and acts on the world stage.

The specter of internal conflict fueled from the outside is just as great (if not greater) in Russia as you claim it is in the US.

I reckon that "strive" is the correct word in that context. It is interesting that that particular word also refers to the process of simple maintenance - It is my gut feeling that our culture has forgotten that point. <br><br>I read a charming tale once about a young English lady and her sister whom moved into a northern Italian village a few years prior to Italy's incorporation into the EU. What became abundantly clear was that any advantage that she personally gained on her property in that context came at the expense or loss of someone else in the village and whilst she gained many friends, in the process she really annoyed some of her close neighbours without much effort on her part. Engagement is crucial in such a context.<br><br>Oooo! That's my excitement noise! You're going to really like this one. Seriously, it is really funny.

As someone with an avid interest in graphics and web stuff {taught myself XHTML, graphic user interface (GUI), user experience (UX), and such}, in 2010 I created a folder containing details of my top fifty &lt;50&gt; websites, along with archived pages, screenshots, and pdfs. My criteria for the top 50 was prettiness, usefulness, and ease of use. The websites represented all sorts of organizations from volunteer cat rescue groups to Disney UK.<br><br>Yesterday I revisited those websites. The result: one-quarter (25%) are just plain gone, poofky, pssst, nada, defunct, disappeared — meaning the company or organization went belly-up since 2010. Nobody gets rid of a website unless they have to. Another quarter (25%) either downsized their website or had truly horrible websites (likely meaning they fired their professional website people, and those in charge are incompetent). Disney UK's website, for example, as it stands today, is nowhere near as flamboyant as it was in 2010; its current website is restrained and boring.<br><br>Roughly half the websites are the same as five years ago. One of the websites that is the same is San Francisco Zen Center (sfzc.org) (SFZC). No surprise there. The people at SFZC have been economical and sensible yet professional throughout.

Two well established small businesses in my neighborhood are selling up and closing at the end of the month. I have been a customer of both, so I asked the staff why the stores were closing. The gift store had a very good holiday sales season, but the owner had already decided to retire and close the store; apparently not related to economic trends. OTOH, several gift and high end housewares stores that used to be within a few blocks of this one have relocated or gone out of business in recent years. A couple remain. <br><br>The plant nursery is going out of business because it could not last out a recession followed by three years of drought. I put off buying new plants last year because I was afraid we would have mandatory water rationing this summer (and we might).<br><br>Just before the Great Recession, a spec builder began constructing a large retail building on undeveloped land near downtown. During the recession financing ran out and all work ceased. A while ago, they resumed building and For Lease signs have been in the windows for a couple of months. No occupants. <br><br>Other retail space of all sizes remains vacant in existing buildings within blocks of this one. I've also seen examples of one business moving out and the space being promptly leased again. Many restaurants and stores have Help Wanted signs. Unemployment rates in this county are low. <br><br>Toward the official ending of the recession, a local magnate who owned an entire block of commercial buildings next to City Hall evicted his remaining tenants (the anchor store and a restaurant had gone out of business), demolished the building and donated the land to a nonprofit created for the purpose of turning it into a little public park, which now exists. (Imagination Park).<br><br>2. Silicon Valley weathered the recession fairly well. Many people in computer-related services prefer living in San Francisco to living in the Peninsula/San Jose area. Companies and many young workers are relocating northward. The San Francisco real estate bubble has reinflated. Builders are frantically throwing up condominium blocks in favored southern neighborhoods; other neighborhoods are gentrifying.<br><br>Marin County housing prices dropped by about one third during the recession and there were many foreclosures. Most of the foreclosures were bought up for cash by investors. We don't have a large problem with derelict vacant houses here. Prices have partially recovered. The median price for a single family dwelling rose above one million dollars in December. Inventory for sale is low; common wisdom is that owners are holding out for higher prices.<br><br>Very mixed economic indications in my corner of California.<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c2889393269216519350 title="comment permalink">1/5/15, 4:16 PM</a><br><br>

While I am not a catastrophist expecting an economic seizure suddenly leaving us starving in the dark, I DO see so many unraveling threads and clumps of threads from my worm’s eye view of things and in every direction, with increasing velocities. Thus it seems clear that “the center may well not be able to hold” and that “push might come to shove” and that “all that is solid will melt into air” and “catastrophe is just around the corner” and “sooner rather than later” to coin a phrase EVEN in our rather puny human frame of reference of time.<br>While not wishing to engage Dr. Donald Rumsfeld in his theoretical non-linearities of “known unknowns” and so forth, it is clear that the nostrum of linearity that “everything is a matter of degree” is flat wrong. Such a notion places everything from, say, a black cat firecracker to a hydrogen bomb on a linear scale like a thermometer with “everything” being only a “mere matter of degree.” The reality is that “everything” on the black cat/hydrogen bomb continuum is exponential like the red shift, that is geometric non-linearity: the difference between 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or even worse, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 256, 65,536 …<br>The nonlinear dynamics of the atmosphere with respect to gravity waves in the troposphere is another example from science that comes to mind. Without going into a whole lot of meteorological detail, there comes a point where the vibrations in an air mass as it moves to higher altitudes cause nonlinear effects in the gravity waves. These nonlinear effects forces the previously linear and stable speed of the air mass to change and to do so rather spectacularly when ordinarily, the speed would remain unaffected.

And the Panamanian golden frogs have gone extinct -- in JUST the past ten years and amphibians everywhere on the planet aren’t feeling so good either.

An economic point of diminishing returns in the papier Mache world of industrial finance? Final collapse of oceanic fisheries due to industrial fishing? A state visit by Fidel Castro to Washington (lol). A sudden drop in the Dow due to oil going below $50 bbl? Some point at which killing young black and Latino men or stop-and-frisk actually foments revolt, rebellion and revolution? All of the above? Something’s else? But I do accept that there is some point in human systems – as in Antarctic melting -- where linearity can suddenly become nonlinear and with rapid but unpredictable effects.<br>I agree: No sudden seizure and collapse to be sure like dropping dead from a massive heart attack or stroke but cascading nonlinear effects seem to be virtually certain at some point. <br><br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c1576457838054987100 title="comment permalink">1/5/15, 7:20 PM</a><br><br>

In terms of the present conversation, I'd direct anyone interested to his essay <a href=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/12/was-democracy-just-a-moment/306022/ rel=nofollow>Was Democracy Just A Moment?</a>, first published in December 1997. <br><br>In the book of collected essays which i have in front of me, the subtitle is <i>"As we attempt to plant our version of democracy abroad, in places where it can't succeed, it is slipping away from us at home , too. Why democracy will destabilize the world much as early Christianity did"</i>.<br><br>Even reading that may give you the shivers. The essay is, naturally, rather dated in its examples. The first half tends to deal with American and Western overseas adventures in the 1990s; the second half is more concerned with the decline of democracy in the US - as evidenced in the 1990s.

The fact that it has gone on this long only means the collapse will be even more catastrophic when it happens due to the tremendous economic imbalances it has created and reinforced over the decades -- which then makes it even more essential that the authorities, year after year, keep inflating it further.<br><br>The fundamentals point to this as the greatest bubble in the history of the world, yet strangely many who discuss economic bubbles do not see it.<br><br>Pop it will. Should we revisit at the end of the year? Sure, but I'm not saying it will collapse this year, since it is very difficult to predict the timing of a ponzi collapse, although every year that passes the chances increase since the desperate acts the US military and Fed have to go to to maintain US hegemony around the world, which is all that's propping this thing up, becomes more and more desperate and out of control. It could pop the day after we revisit. History clearly shows that when currency devaluations happen, they happen quickly, and in the case of pegging to gold, usually overnight.

Services for the homeless are concentrated in downtown San Rafael, the largest city. Medical services for the indigent are fairly good by American standards, but there is no year round homeless shelter, only a coalition of agencies, churches and synagogues which provide cots in the worst weather. There is finally beginning to be some political support for building one or more permanent shelters. As usual, the biggest obstacle isn't finding the money to operate them, but agreeing on where to put them. No one wants a lot of homeless people hanging around near their homes or businesses.<br><br>Many people are poorly and insecurely housed in crowded conditions, couch surfing, living in their cars, etc. because they can't earn enough money for a studio apartment or one of the dwindling number of fleabag hotels with the bathroom down the hall.

Thank you for the dialogue about the homeless in Santa Clara County. I knew nothing of it.<br><br>I live in Santa Clara County. My husband and I pay a lot in taxes. If our taxes aren't getting applied to help the homeless, where is the money going? The main place our taxes are going is paying cushy pensions to retired rank-and-file Santa Clara County workers who, because they are unionized, (1) get a pension; (2) get a "high" pension; (3) get a high pension "guaranteed." These pensions are real.<br><br>A friend, who worked a mere twenty (20) years for Santa Clara County as a social worker, retired fully in the mid-2000s. She gets a whopping $120,000/year pension from the County, along with inflation increases when appropriate. Hers was such a windfall that she bought a second home in a cheaper coastal state, moved there, sold her house here, and at age fifty-two, sits by the pool with her piña coladas and goes on daily walks on the beach. Do I envy her her $10K/month check, for which she does no work? Am I upset? Do I begrudge her her good fortune? Yes, you betcha. And I am no longer friends with her. I view it that I am paying part of her pension, yet my husband and I will never, or more correctly, never be ABLE to, retire. Working in the high-tech industry since the 1980s, neither my husband nor I will ever see a pension. A home-based "cottage industry" small business will likely keep us in food-money during our gray years.<br><br>My family's "carrying capacity" is shot. Nothing more exists to give. No more can be squeezed out of the toothpaste tube, having been cut open and the insides scraped. The municipalities, counties, states, and federal governments have to decrease our tax burdens. Public pension reform must happen big-time. I return to the subject of the homeless located in Santa Clara County. We pay our fair share. Investigate the whole system; in particular, look at the tier of middlemen who get first-, second-, and third-crack at available tax monies of various governments. The homeless get the dregs.<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c4348195931877573142 title="comment permalink">1/7/15, 3:14 AM</a><br><br>

I found this website: http://www.1940.co.uk/index.html which is probably more re-enactment than everyday stuff, but here are a couple of interesting articles/videos: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28106466 &amp; http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/191018/We-live-in-the-1940s. Next event of the type that we are doing isn't until the end of May, but I will ask some of the authentic aficionados whether they do have some kind of society or at least method of recognising each other &amp; passing information around. I'd say 95% of the event-goers are weekenders or just bystanders, but maybe 5% are the Real Deal. <br><br>Interesting to note that the oldsters can generally dance the legs off the younger attendees! It's not as simple as just knowing the steps; it's that their muscles really know the moves, and that long-established partners move together, almost as a unit, in an effortless &amp; almost telepathic sort of way.<br><br><a href=the-cold-wet-mackerel-of-reality.html#c130755766892036142 title="comment permalink">2/1/15, 4:30 AM</a><br><br>
