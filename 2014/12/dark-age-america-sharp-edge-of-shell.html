One of the interesting features of blogging about the twilight of science and technology these days is that there’s rarely any need to wait long for a cogent example. One that came my way not long ago via a reader of this blog—tip of the archdruidical hat to Eric S.—shows that not even a science icon can get away with asking questions about the rising tide of financial corruption and dogmatic ideology that’s drowning the scientific enterprise in our time. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Many of my readers will recall Bill Nye the Science Guy, the star of a television program on science in the 1990s and still a vocal and entertaining proponent of science education. In a recent interview, Nye was asked why he doesn’t support the happy-go-lucky attitude toward dumping genetically modified organisms into the environment that’s standard in the United States and a few other countries these days. His answer<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>is that their impact on ecosystems is a significant issue that hasn’t been adequately addressed. Those who know their way around today’s pseudoskeptic scene won’t be surprised by the reaction from
<a href=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/collideascape/2014/11/06/bill-nye-explains-gmo-skeptic/ >one of Discover Magazine’s bloggers</a>: a tar and feathers party, more or less, full of the standard GMO industry talking points and little else.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nye’s point, as it happens, is as sensible as it is scientific: ecosystems are complex wholes that can be thrown out of balance by relatively subtle shifts, and since human beings depend for their survival and prosperity on the products of natural ecosystems, avoiding unnecessary disruption to those systems is arguably a good idea. This eminently rational sort of thinking, though, is not welcomed in corporate boardrooms just now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the case under discussion, it’s particularly unwelcome in the boardrooms of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>corporations heavily invested in genetic modification, which have a straightforward if shortsighted financial interest in flooding the biosphere with as many GMOs as they can sell. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus it’s reasonable that Monsanto et al. would scream bloody murder in response to Nye’s comment. What interests me is that so many believers in science should do the same, and not only in this one case. Last I checked, “what makes the biggest profit for industry must be true” isn’t considered a rule of scientific reasoning, but that sort of thinking is remarkably common in what passes for skepticism these days. To cite an additional example, it’s surely not accidental that there’s a 1.00 correlation between the health care modalities that make money for the medical and pharmaceutical industries and the health care modalities that the current crop of soi-disant skeptics consider rational and science-based, and an equal 1.00 correlation between those modalities that don’t make money for the medical and pharmaceutical industries and those that today’s skeptics dismiss as superstitious quackery. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To some extent, this is likely a product of what’s called “astroturfing,” the manufacture of artificial grassroots movements to support the agendas of an industrial sector or a political faction. The internet, with its cult of anonymity and its less than endearing habit of letting every discussion plunge to the lowest common denominator of bullying and abuse, was tailor-made for that sort of activity; it’s pretty much an open secret at this point, or so I’m told by the net-savvy, that most significant industries these days maintain staffs of paid flacks who spend their working hours searching the internet for venues to push messages favorable to their employers and challenge opposing views. Given the widespread lack of enthusiasm for GMOs, Monsanto and its competitors would have to be idiots to neglect such an obvious and commonly used marketing tactic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, there’s more going on here than ordinary media manipulation in the hot pursuit of profits. There are plenty of people who have no financial stake in the GMO industry who defend it fiercely from even the least whisper of criticism, just as there are plenty of people who denounce alternative medicine in ferocious terms even though they don’t happen to make money from the medical-pharmaceutical industrial complex. I’ve discussed in previous posts here, and in <a href="http://www.newsociety.com/affil.mvc?Affil=ARCH&amp;Page=../Books/A/After-Progress" target=_blank>a forthcoming book</a>, the way that faith in progress was pressed into service as a substitute for religious belief during the nineteenth century, and continues to fill that role for many people today. It’s not a transformation that did science any good, but its implications as industrial civilization tips over into decline and fall are considerably worse than the ones I’ve explored in previous essays. I want to talk about those implications here, because they have a great deal to say about the future of science and technology in the deindustrializing world of the near future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s important, in order to make sense of those implications, to grasp that science and technology function as social phenomena, and fill social roles, in ways that have more than a little in common with the intellectual activities of civilizations of the past. That doesn’t mean, as some postmodern theorists have argued, that science and technology are <i>purely</i> social phenomena; both of them have to take the natural world into account, and so have an important dimension that transcends the social. That said, the social dimension also exists, and since human beings are social mammals, that dimension has an immense impact on the way that science and technology function in this or any other human society. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
From a social standpoint, it’s thus not actually all that relevant that that the scientists and engineers of contemporary industrial society can accomplish things with matter and energy that weren’t within the capacities of Babylonian astrologer-priests, Hindu gurus, Chinese literati, or village elders in precontact New Guinea. Each of these groups have been assigned a particular social role, the role of interpreter of Nature, by their respective societies, and each of them are accorded substantial privileges for fulfilling the requirements of their role. It’s therefore possible to draw precise and pointed comparisons between the different bodies of people filling that very common social role in different societies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The exercise is worth doing, not least because it helps sort out the far from meaningless distinction between the aspects of modern science and technology that unfold from their considerable capacities for doing things with matter and energy, and the aspects of modern science and technology that unfold from the normal dynamics of social privilege.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What’s more, since modern science and technology wasn’t around in previous eras of decline and fall but privileged intellectual castes certainly were, recognizing the common features that unite today’s scientists, engineers, and promoters of scientific and technological progress with equivalent groups in past civilizations makes it a good deal easier to anticipate the fate of science and technology in the decades and centuries to come. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A specific example will be more useful here than any number of generalizations, so let’s consider the fate of philosophy in the waning years of the Roman world. The extraordinary intellectual adventure we call classical philosophy began in the Greek colonial cities of Ionia around 585 BCE, when Thales of Miletus first proposed a logical rather than a mythical explanation for the universe, and proceeded through three broad stages from there. The first stage, that of the so-called Presocratics, focused on the natural world, and the questions it asked and tried to answer can more or less be summed up as “What exists?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its failures and equivocal successes led the second stage, which extended from Socrates through Plato and Aristotle to the Old Academy and its rivals, to focus their attention on different questions, which can be summed up just as neatly as “How can we know what exists?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was an immensely fruitful shift in focus. It led to the creation of classical logic—one of the great achievements of the human mind—and it also drove the transformations that turned mathematics from an assortment of rules of thumb to an architecture of logical proofs, and thus laid the foundations on which Newtonian physics and other quantitative sciences eventually built.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like every other great intellectual adventure of our species, though, it never managed to fulfill all the hopes that had been loaded onto it; the philosopher’s dream of human society made wholly subject to reason turned out to be just as unreachable as the scientist’s of the universe made wholly subject to the human will. As that failure became impossible to ignore, classical philosophy shifted focus again, to a series of questions and attempted answers that amounted to “given what we know about what exists, how should we live?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the question that drove the last great age of classical philosophy, the age of the Epicureans, the Stoics, and the Neoplatonists, the three philosophical schools I discussed a few months back as
<a href=../../2014/07/the-gray-light-of-morning.html>constructive personal responses to the fall of our civilization</a>. At first, these and other schools carried on lively and far-reaching debates, but as the Roman world stumbled toward its end under the burden of its own unsolved problems, the philosophers closed ranks; debates continued, but they focused more and more tightly on narrow technical issues within individual schools. What’s more, the schools themselves closed ranks; pure Stoic, Aristotelian, and Epicurean philosophy gradually dropped out of fashion, and by the fourth century CE, a Neoplatonism enriched with bits and pieces of all the other schools stood effectively alone, the last school standing in the long struggle Thales kicked off ten centuries before. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now I have to confess to a strong personal partiality for the Neoplatonists. It was from Plotinus and Proclus, respectively the first and last great figures in the classical tradition, that I first grasped why philosophy matters and what it can accomplish, and for all its problems—like every philosophical account of the world, it has some—Neoplatonism still makes intuitive sense to me in a way that few other philosophies do. What’s more, the men and women who defended classical Neoplatonism in its final years were people of great intellectual and personal dignity, committed to proclaming the truth as they knew it in the face of intolerance and persecution that ended up costing no few of them their lives. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The awkward fact remains that classical philosophy, like modern science, functioned as a social phenomenon and filled certain social roles. The intellectual power of the final Neoplatonist synthesis and the personal virtues of its last proponents have to be balanced against its blind support of a deeply troubled social order; in all the long history of classical philosophy, it never seems to have occurred to anyone that debates about the nature of justice might reasonably address, say, the ethics of slavery. While a stonecutter like Socrates could take an active role in philosophical debate in Athens in the fourth century BCE, furthermore, the institutionalization of philosophy meant that by the last years of classical Neoplatonism, its practice was restricted to those with ample income and leisure, and its values inevitably became more and more closely tied to the social class of its practitioners. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the thing that drove the ferocious rejection of philosophy by the underclass of the age, the slaves and urban poor who made up the vast majority of the population throughout the Roman empire, and who received little if any benefit from the intellectual achievements of their society. To them, the subtleties of Neoplatonist thought were irrelevant to the increasingly difficult realities of life on the lower end of the social pyramid in a brutally hierarchical and increasingly dysfunctional world. That’s an important reason why so many of them turned for solace to a new religious movement from the eastern fringes of the empire, a despised sect that claimed that God had been born on earth as a mere carpenter’s son and communicated through his life and death a way of salvation that privileged the poor and downtrodden above the rich and well-educated. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was as a social phenomenon, filling certain social roles, that Christianity attracted persecution from the imperial government, and it was in response to Christianity’s significance as a social phenomenon that the imperial government executed an about-face under Constantine and took the new religion under its protection. Like plenty of autocrats before and since, Constantine clearly grasped that the real threat to his position and power came from other members of his own class—in his case, the patrician elite of the Roman world—and saw that he could undercut those threats and counter potential rivals through an alliance of convenience with the leaders of the underclass. That’s the political subtext of the Edict of Milan, which legalized Christianity throughout the empire and brought it imperial patronage. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The patrician class of late Roman times, like its equivalent today, exercised power through a system of interlocking institutions from which outsiders were carefully excluded, and it maintained a prickly independence from the central government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the fourth century, tensions between the bureaucratic imperial state and the patrician class, with its local power bases and local loyalties, were rising toward a flashpoint.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The rise of Christianity thus gave Constantine and his successors an extraordinary opportunity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most of the institutions that undergirded patrician power linked to Pagan religion; local senates, temple priesthoods, philosophical schools, and other elements of elite culture normally involved duties drawn from the traditional faith. A religious pretext to strike at those institutions must have seemed as good as any other, and the Christian underclass offered one other useful feature: mobs capable of horrific acts of violence against prominent defenders of the patrician order. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was why, for example, a Christian mob in 415 CE dragged the Neoplatonist philosopher Hypatia from her chariot as she rode home from her teaching gig at the Academy in Alexandria, cudgeled her to death, cut the flesh from her bones with sharpened oyster shells—the cheap pocket knives of the day—and burned the bloody gobbets to ashes. What doomed Hypatia was not only her defense of the old philosophical traditions, but also her connection to Alexandria’s patrician class; her ghastly fate was as much the vengeance of the underclass against the elite as it was an act of religious persecution. She was far from the only victim of violence driven by those paired motives, either. It was as a result of such pressures that, by the time the emperor Justinian ordered the last academies closed in 529 CE, the classical philosophical tradition was essentially dead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the sort of thing that happens when an intellectual tradition becomes too closely affiliated with the institutions, ideologies, and interests of a social elite. If the elite falls, so does the tradition—and if it becomes advantageous for anyone else to target the elite, the tradition can be a convenient target, especially if it’s succeeded in alienating most of the population outside the elite in question. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Modern science is extremely vulnerable to such a turn of events. There was a time when the benefits of scientific research and technological development routinely reached the poor as well as the privileged, but that time has long since passed; these days, the benefits of research and development move up the social ladder, while the costs and negative consequences move down. Nearly all the jobs eliminated by automation, globalization, and the computer revolution, for example, used to hire from the bottom end of the job market. In the same way, changes in US health care in recent decades have benefited the privileged while subjecting most others to substandard care at prices so high that medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy in the US today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s all very well for the promoters of progress to gabble on about science as the key to humanity’s destiny; the poor know that the destiny thus marketed isn’t for them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To the poor, progress means fewer jobs with lower pay and worse conditions, more surveillance and impersonal violence carried out by governments that show less and less interest in paying even lip service to the concept of civil rights, a rising tide of illnesses caused by environmental degradation and industrial effluents, and glimpses from afar of an endless stream of lavishly advertised tech-derived trinkets, perks and privileges that they will never have. Between the poor and any appreciation for modern science stands a wall made of failed schools, defunded libraries, denied opportunities, and the systematic use of science and technology to benefit other people at their expense. Such a wall, it probably bears noting, makes a good surface against which to sharpen oyster shells. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It seems improbable that anything significant will be done to change this picture until it’s far too late for such changes to have any meaningful effect. Barring dramatic transformations in the distribution of wealth, the conduct of public education, the funding for such basic social amenities as public libraries, and a great deal more, the underclass of the modern industrial world can be expected to grow more and more disenchanted with science as a social phenomenon in our culture, and to turn instead—as their equivalents in the Roman world and so many other civilizations did—to some tradition from the fringes that places itself in stark opposition to everything modern scientific culture stands for. Once that process gets under way, it’s simply a matter of waiting until the corporate elite that funds science, defines its values, and manipulates it for PR purposes, becomes sufficiently vulnerable that some other power center decides to take it out, using institutional science as a convenient point of attack. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Saving anything from the resulting wreck will be a tall order. Still, the same historical parallel discussed above offers some degree of hope. The narrowing focus of classical philosophy in its last years meant, among other things, that a substantial body of knowledge that had once been part of the philosophical movement was no longer identified with it by the time the cudgels and shells came out, and much of it was promptly adopted by Christian clerics and monastics as useful for the Church. That’s how classical astronomy, music theory, and agronomy, among other things, found their way into the educational repertoire of Christian monasteries and nunneries in the dark ages. What’s more, once the power of the patrician class was broken, a carefully sanitized version of Neoplatonist philosophy found its way into Christianity; in some denominations, it’s still a living presence today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That may well happen again. Certainly today’s defenders of science are doing their best to shove a range of scientific viewpoints out the door; the denunciation meted out to Bill Nye for bringing basic concepts from ecology into a discussion where they were highly relevant is par for the course these days. There’s an interesting distinction between the sciences that get this treatment and those that don’t: on the one hand, those that are being flung aside are those that focus on observation of natural systems rather than control of artificial ones; on the other, any science that raises doubts about the possibility or desirability of infinite technological expansion can expect to find itself shivering in the dark outside in very short order. (This latter point applies to other fields of intellectual endeavor as well; half the angry denunciations of philosophy you’ll hear these days from figures such as Neil DeGrasse Tyson, I’m convinced, come out of the simple fact that the claims of modern science to know objective truths about nature won’t stand up to fifteen minutes of competent philosophical analysis.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Thus it’s entirely possible that observational sciences, if they can squeeze through the bottleneck imposed by the loss of funding and prestige, will be able to find a new home in whatever intellectual tradition replaces modern scientific rationalism in the deindustrial future. It’s at least as likely that such dissident sciences as ecology, which has always raised challenging questions about the fantasies of the manipulative sciences, may find themselves eagerly embraced by a future intellectual culture that has no trouble at all recognizing the futility of those fantasies. That said, it’s still going to take some hard work to preserve what’s been learnt in those fields—and it’s also going to take more than the usual amount of prudence and plain dumb luck not to get caught up in the conflict when the sharp edge of the shell gets turned on modern science.</div>

He is a keen observer and is Peak Oil aware, yet has a few quite glaring blind spots. One of them is his love of (vaporware) technology that threatens to throw a lot of people out of work. One recently promoted example is the idea of self driving trucks. As this post and others of yours have stated, the concept of replacing more people with machines in these times is a bad idea from so many fronts - environmental, social and political. I find it so amazing that this concept is one that simply doesn't register with a person who is otherwise quite astute. But then, that issue is one of the major points of your post. He may be a very intelligent and astute person, but the blinders of his upper middle class viewpoint are too difficult to remove, even if he is aware of them.<br><br><a href=#c8843419864651022146 title="comment permalink">12/10/14, 6:59 PM</a><br><br>

It can only appear to be a process by which an industry captures a process that is done by nature for a far lower cost. With less middle men, clearly nature must have a lower cost base for an equivalent product. I'm unsure whether the yields (agricultural output, profits are another matter altogether) for GM organisms is that much higher than conventional agriculture anyway. Good luck finding unbiased reports.<br><br>Oh well. The whole lot will sort itself out in time as the fertilisers sprayed on industrial agricultural fields generally don't and can't cover the full spectrum of minerals required by plants due to the sheer cost and complexity of doing so. Sooner or later the soils in industrial agricultural systems will run out of one mineral or another (or a combination of). And there is the unanswered water question to about where that lot will come from in future?<br><br>My understanding - and I could be wrong - is that the herbicides favoured by GM organisms prohibit the uptake of minerals which possibly starves both the plants and the soil life that work in symbiosis (they generally swap plant sugars for minerals). Good luck in trying to rehabilitate that soil life quickly.<br><br>I always try to win people over with the quality of produce that I gift to them from here and they are rarely disappointed. <br><br>The funny thing about GM food is that it is eaten by both the lower and middle classes alike, because, like organic stuff is real expensive, like. Maybe the health impacts haven't shown up yet, who knows? I've read a few accounts now of the mineral deficiencies of food and that should be ringing alarm bells. It certainly does with me. As a prediction, the people and their soils will pay the price, it is just that they don't know it yet.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: There is a new blog entry up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>A hive of activity</a> where Scritchy the boss dog has had a further misadventure with bees.

I was not disappointed. It looks as if the blog author and the Redditor had a choice between two popular science heroes, Nye and Tyson, and picked Tyson, the one most friendly to technology. That choice exemplifies the confusion between science and technology that I fight against constantly and one that I point out to my classes in the very first lecture, in which I point out that technology, medicine, and engineering are not actually science, but the application of scientifically derived information to human needs and wants. The old Dewey Decimal System recognized this and separated science in the 500s and the rest in the 600s. Pity that distinction is being lost these days.<br><br>As for Monsanto, the corporation has earned such an odious reputation that there is now a <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2013/05/march-against-monsanto.html rel=nofollow>March Against Monsanto</a>, an annual event protesting GMOs in general and Monsanto's behavior in particular. The coverage of last year's protests earned contrasting views from <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2013/05/cnn-and-russia-today-cover-march-on.html rel=nofollow>CNN and Russia Today</a>. CNN tried to be as even-handed as possible and included the claim that there are, as yet, no studies showing ill health effects on humans from GMOs. That's true as far as it goes, but I'm not sure it goes as far as the supporters think it does. Russia Today, on the other hand, was much more supportive of the protesters and critical of Monsanto. Then again, RT is as much a propaganda organ as it is a news organization, and it likes to urge on dissidents in the U.S. With friends like them, the protesters don't really need enemies.<br><br><a href=#c1208846449888459207 title="comment permalink">12/10/14, 7:53 PM</a><br><br>

The "monster" of the title is actually a robot powered by meteorite metal, giving it fantastic strength and stamina. All throughout the first couple of chapters commentators keep talking about how these robots are going to "ease the burden of human toil" by doing work that is too dangerous or exhausting or boring for ordinary humans. When the inevitable mad scientist shows up trying to hijack the robot for his own evil ends (the "ape" of the title is used by him to assassinate rivals) the characters then lament about how they need to get it back so they can stop the madman and liberate mankind from being slaves to work and labor. Classic religion of progress stuff from the very beginning of the optimistic postwar era, all presented in a very exciting way.<br><br>You can tell how much attitudes to science and technology changed in seventy or so years from what a friend who watched it with me said: "Yeah, right. All that those robots are going to do is put a lot of blue collar factory and construction workers out of jobs.

Consequently, this risk should be treated differently from those that only have the potential for local harm. “The precautionary principle should be used to prescribe severe of limits on genetically modified organisms,” they conclude.<br><br>Taleb and co begin by making a clear distinction between risks with consequences that are local and those with consequences that have the potential to cause global ruin.

To some degree this is already happening, or at least the seeds are well-planted and green shoots are visible. Climatic scientists and alternative-energy researchers, in real life, have been effectively tarred (in the minds of a certain, minority but vociferous, segment of the population) as charlatans interested in nothing but gobs of free grant money. Ecologists and related disciplines can often be tarred by association. This problem has failed to go away despite liberals' lament of its stupidity. JMG has often pointed out real problems with the science these groups are promulgating, but a persistent minority has already been persuaded to reject their science wholesale regardless of its flaws or merits, simply on the basis of jealousy (of access to government money). It seems to fit JMG's model where one group of elites (short-term profiteers off fossil fuels) use the rejection of science as a weapon to take out another group (elite researchers and government regulators). As jobs become scarcer and the benefits of the science studies become more nebulous, I could imagine more and more of the population passing an unfavorable judgment on those fields and their ivory-tower practitioners. <br><br>Scratching my head I can think of only a few examples in science-fiction where a backlash arose against science <b><i>as a cultural expression of elitism</i></b>, instead of for other reasons. For example, in recent movies like "Elysium" and "In Time," science is presented as a tool of repression by the elite, but the impoverished masses want nothing more than to seize that perq for themselves, not reject it. In many post-apocalyptic stories (including your two, JMG, IMHO), certain aspects of science have been selectively rejected because of their consequences, not for social reasons -- the rejection is usually presented as some sort of awakening, tragic or hopeful. ADR readers, am I missing other prominent examples?<br><br>Sci-fi writers probably tend to see science as pure Truth and thus seem blind to the meme of science as a cultural wedge. The one clean example I can think of is from the cheesy old TV series "V", about neo-Nazi reptilian aliens invading the earth. The aliens didn't want humans to master any captured alien tech and use it against them, so they established a narrative where the "Visitors" wanted to offer miracle cures and technological solutions to world hunger etc., but they held back because they had allegedly caught human scientists weaponizing the technology and/or using it for their personal gain over others. The non-scientist humans promptly judged all human scientists as deceitful, and engaged in <i>pogroms</i> against them. That always struck me as one of the better and more predictive subplots of the otherwise mediocre '80s show (I never saw the 2009 remake). Minus the reptillians and tone down the violence, and you get basically the scenario with climate scientists today.<br><br><a href=#c8125476976862209493 title="comment permalink">12/10/14, 8:54 PM</a><br><br>

In fact, it works most often the other way around. <br>So from Taleb's point of view, we will all be better off when we stop wasting public money funding higher education and think tanks, and leave the improvement of civilization and culture to the tinkerers and amateurs. I don't wish anyone to be sliced to gibbets with shells, but there are some academic areas, like theories of economics, that have caused a great deal of harm when they drive the fiscal policies of the Empire.

The first was a gut response, one which I had hoped had left my thinking. I immediately started thinking about large-scale projects that could mitigate the damage, from a reform scientist community to an overhaul of our method of funding to a giant monument which would enshrine important formulas for future generations. I thought big instead of small. But I suppose I should be happy that I recognized it as an error, at least.<br><br>Secondly, I thought about (from a historical/sociological perspective) what it was that made Christianity thrive in the late empire. Of course, being a Christian I believe it was a matter of Divine providence that it took place, but that doesn't invalidate attempting to understand the means by which providence accomplished this. Immediately, I thought of Viktor Frankl's logotherapy approach, where he discusses the deep human need for meaning in one's life and most especially in suffering.<br><br>In a world of decline - as your previous posts have recently addressed - a good number of people who have found meaning in the religion of progress will find their lives shaken to the core. To that one commentor, a life without Progress was meaningless. He'd rather be dead. So any philosophy that once again comes into vogue needs to assign meaning to suffering, and with a continual decline in material wealth, it can't be a materialistic system either.<br><br>In my assessment, that's practically a death sentence (in the long-term) for a number of worldviews currently in vogue. The modern version of Protestantism, with its doctrinal declaration that God will take them all to Heaven in the Rapture rather than let His people suffer (because that's how it worked for Christ, after all, right?) and middle-class ethics is doomed. Communism/Socialism, which both declares progress dogma and sees materialism as the sole lens by which we understand history, is also out. That whole shallow New-Age "The Secret" mentality of universal wish-fulfillment doesn't have a shot. And so on.<br><br>At least in the West, I don't see the stoic approaches having much chance of widespread acceptance either. I mean stoic in the broadest sense, which includes things like Buddhism, Daoism, Stoicism and a few others. But I could be wrong there; they have a much better shot than the "prosperity Gospel" approaches at any rate.<br><br>But this is where I see the critical failure of nearly every modern ideological approach, and one of the reasons I've harped so long on the concept of returning to our roots (or someone else's, like Islam). I think things like - if you'll pardon me - druidry can provide meaning to a certain type of people, but identification of yourself as a part of some greater whole simply isn't enough for most. And I feel that most environmentalist worldviews, which have for some approached near-religious levels, will struggle to hold an audience when its message is both materialistic and must, in the future, amount to "we effed up pretty badly." It's hard to find meaning in a belief system that must essentially admit defeat, given what the state of the world is/will soon be.<br><br>But perhaps there will be some degree of synthesis that mitigates these issues, an adaptation of more overtly religious concepts to the worldviews. Who can say, really?<br><br>That's my two cents, anyway.<br><br><a href=#c1243223973104252846 title="comment permalink">12/10/14, 10:00 PM</a><br><br>

I heard his early speeches and I'm willing to agree that much he said was true. But he had no -- well, 'charity' is the best word for it. He wanted to force his pattern for living on everyone else, for their own good, of course. Because he was great and sincere in his own way, he gained a following of honest people. They were sick of war and they were terribly shocked by the Big Burn and they could readily believe that science had led to evil. The Free Scientists were too independent -- they made closed guilds of their teams. There was a separation between thinking and feeling. And feeling is easier to us than thinking.

Concerning the colonization of other planets and the split between science, as a method, and the cargo cult of science, as a social phenomenon... It has always bugged me that what we can do now, with existing technology, always plays second fiddle to what we might be able to do tomorrow, with future technology.<br><br> We can't colonize any of the planets in our solar system with existing technology, but we could move a suitable planet to a suitable location with existing technology and let it terraform itself. Specifically, we could move Venus to Mars's orbit with existing technology. The relevant science <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist rel=nofollow>Gravity assist</a> and Korycansky, D.G. et al. “Astronomical Engineering: A Strategy for Modifying Planetary Orbits” Astrophysics and Space Science 275 (2001): 349–366 would take an enormous amount of work, something like 1%, 5%, 10% of global GDP for thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years, and that is why this is interesting.<br><br> Because it is totally doable, except that human civilizations don't last that long. And because our civilization won't commit any resources to a doable project that is expensive when it expects that progress will make the project cheap and easy in the future.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br>PS a habitable planet needs lots of things, Venus lacks water, a magnetic field, and suitable radiation from the Sun. Magnetic fields require a conducting, convecting, spinning core. Venus has a convection and conducting core, we just need to spin it up, read “Astronomical Engineering: A Strategy for Modifying Planetary Orbits” for the details. The water can come from Ceres, the Trojans, the Oort cloud, or any other icy bodies in our solar system, again at great cost in time and effort.<br><br>PPS JMG, I disagree with your <a href=../../2007/09/solving-fermis-paradox.html rel=nofollow>Solving Fermi's Paradox</a> Specifically: "Given the fantastic energies required, the chance that any intelligent species will have access to enough highly concentrated energy resources to keep an industrial society progressing long enough to evolve starflight technology, and then actually accomplish the feat, is so close to zero that the silence of the heavens makes perfect sense." because I think that even an ecotechinic society could manage the feat, but I doubt that they would have the social stability to attempt such a lengthy endeavour or the willingness to spend such a large percentage of their resources on such a project.<br><br><a href=#c3627548576889603729 title="comment permalink">12/10/14, 10:22 PM</a><br><br>

There are plenty of rational people -- they just don't tend to be the ones who trumpet their claim to rationality -- just as there are plenty of sincerely religious people who avoid hypocrisy with all their strength. There again, it's the pompous bozos that give the others a bad name. <br><br>As for rejecting science, good. Myself, I've encountered some people who actually do reject science, the whole kit and caboodle, but they're decidedly in the minority. <br><br>Tim, 5% of current global GDP isn't something that could be sustained for a century, much less for the amount of time you're discussing. It's not even a matter of social stability -- though that's a major issue -- it's the sheer inability of any species to maintain extravagant levels of energy consumption long enough. As for my solution of Fermi's paradox, as far as I know my proposal is the only one that doesn't require the introduction of ad hoc hypotheses, and thus -- by Occam's razor -- it should be considered the default option until someone comes up with evidence that supports another hypothesis instead. <br><br>Candace, no argument there.

Later in the Hellenistic world a lot of people, rich and poor, wanted accurate horoscopes, hence the need for accurate predictive astronomy. That sort of religious motivation for a science to develop is interesting. <br><br>As you've predicted in the past, the trend towards a 'return' to earth religions could motivate a widespread enough desire to preserve sciences like ecology and perhaps biology.

And good for Bill Nye!<br><br>Your choice of GM to illustrate technology needing questions is OK by me. As a lowish level 'scientist' official in British government I was a cog in the creation of GM regulation Brit / EU style for 10 years prior to 97. I saw also a lot of US biotech and its regulation during that time. And I wrote a chapter on regulation in an obscure biotech book as I came up to retirement. FWIW; all your points figure OK.<br><br>I might add that 'scientists' are often estimable but even the least venal and most conscientious are naive. They find it intellectually hard or impossible to do commonsense risk assessment in the face of normal uncertainties. The lower order American scrum employed by American biotech industry, and one or two Brits ditto, was something else entirely. (BTW I met a few old 50s style American officials / career grade science / technology guys who were much more appealing. They were trying to "keep the faith", while facing the excrescencies that challenged their view of a world policed by knowledge.

Not all the science was right, of course, but it had impressed the population. By 1980 when Thatcher started to dismantle said Ministry and any ethos of ‘public science’, I made a joke in the pub that: “If it made money, then government can hand it over to ‘Business’.

I agree as to the Science Guy; did one quick search just to make sure I was not out to lunch and found http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Roundup_Ready_Corn. No doubt the author of the Discover item was a Monsanto scientist.<br><br>As to Neil deGrasse Tyson, skepticism in general, and as to skepticism about homeopathy in particular, you and I do not agree. For any claim of curative (or palliative) efficacy, my standard is similar to my position on GMOs. There should be careful, double blind studies done to determine what really works, what side effects occur, and whether or not stated claims are verifiable, and on publication I will take note of the results. <br><br>Homeopathy, acupuncture, chiropractic and the like are suspect, just as big foot, the Loch Ness Monster, ghosts, communications with spirits, esp and psi are suspect. All of these make grand claims and have no evidence in support for such. Folk remedies need to be subject to the same tests; if those tests show statistical positives, I will view them far differently than tests that are negative. Just saying that old Druids used magik herbs says more about the Druids than about the herbs. If tests show the herbs are remedial as to some affliction, then it says much about each. <br><br>Having said that, I agree that we may see science used as a scape goat, much as neo-Platonic schools were used by the Empire. Though I am not fond of that school of philosophical thought in general (I tend to favor Hume's brand of philosophy), it does serve as a good lesson. Perhaps we should be looking for some good Irish monks to preserve much of what is extant by way of scientific knowledge today?<br><br>Craig<br><br><a href=#c5033318438815757211 title="comment permalink">12/11/14, 7:43 AM</a><br><br>

Moreover, that science is always subject to bias -- most of it of the white, male, patrician elite sort -- and that ferreting out bias is as important as replicating experiments and making new discoveries.<br><br>The Higgs boson is a case in point. Last year, Higgs was reported to have been "discovered". This year it seems Higgs was, ahem, "created".<br><br>Which brings up the Carl Sagan test: "extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof."

I could actually argue that one either way lol<br><br>The Sagan test also applies, it seems to me, to the whole notion of God and gods as does Occam's Razor.

I think it can be done, but would advice to give yourself a finite date and run the experiment yourself to get an idea of the effort involved.</i> <br><br>I did kinda-sorta run the experiment, in 1995, using that pile of approx 20 floppies which was then the Slackware Linux distribution. But I write "kinda-sorta" because my CPU was not the i386 but the i486, in its cheapest incarnation - the "Intel 486 SX", as opposed to the more expensive "Intel 486 DX". I think I had 4 MB of RAM.<br><br>The install was indeed rather tedious, in keeping with Raymond Duckling's suggestion of trouble. I kept getting hung up with kernel panics, I think because for a while I was not correctly specifying the geometry of the hard drive. <br><br>When things finally worked, the result was a machine without GUI, but with Internet (via dial-up modem). One typed stuff at the command-line prompt, treating the screen as a no-graphics "glass teletype". I am quite sure that by doing the usual Linux CTRL-plus-F1, CTRL-plus-F2, ... trick, one had access to a simulated row of six or so teletypes. <br><br>This, then, was a Unix system at the level of the early-1980s "departmental mini". The results with an i386 would have been similar, albeit with a degradation in processing speed. <br><br>PPS: Also, I should correct some remarks I made last week on 1949-vintage Cambridge University Edsac 1: the number of words of storage depended on how the machine was configured (in a typical run, double the number I actually gave); and it is rather likely NOT the case, contrary to what I wrote, that the EDSAC 1 "mercury delay lines" were in the strict sense a RAM (since each "delay line" held a sequence of words, rather than a single word: I now conjecture, without having studied this, that you could not quite address a single word by memory address). EDSAC memory was in machine-architecture terms perhaps a little like today's technique of simulating RAM with "swap" on a (necessarily sequential-access) hard drive).<br><br><a href=#c850530266798042743 title="comment permalink">12/11/14, 8:31 AM</a><br><br>

While to me engineering is a skill and profession rather than an identity, there are times when I do present myself as an engineer. To many groups these days that is clearly a negative, and it has been obvious enough that I have at times done it just to gauge the reaction. <br><br>There was once a time that in general social situations I would often hide my engineering affliction just to avoid the absurd tape-on-glasses stereotypes, but now it is quantitatively different. This is more clear in on-line encounters where people feel more comfortable expressing their opinions due to anonymity, but even in real world situations I can feel it. At this point it isn't too hard to get past if given a chance to get to know each other, but I fully expect this reaction to deepen and spread, eventually getting to the point where one will not be given that opportunity.<br><br>It is an interesting reaction in a society where progress manifested by technological gadgets has been elevated to a religion, and where most accept the narrative of how our society has been sold out by outsourcing the manufacturing and engineering jobs overseas. And yet this is being overwhelmed by the rising resentment created from the obvious failure of progress/science/technology to improve the lives of most. <br><br>However, I man not worried much, as the applied realms of engineering have never been seen as worthy by the scientists and academics (hence the outsourcing), and so the types of things I do will be part of what is jettisoned as you describe. The skills and approaches used in designing and developing useful things can return to the realm of craftsmen, and will be too useful to be intentionally discarded.

I appreciate your taking these things with care and look forward to learning from what your studies and insight have to share.<br><br>It is astonishing to me how simple 1.0 correlation can be used as a mental BS detector (to use Hemmingway’s wonderful phrase). In the real world where there are limits to knowledge, sensory accuracy, and all the rest. Anytime inferential logic finds “always” or “never”, 0 or 1 in the probability density involved, the careful thinker should take note. There be dragons here. Those who made a cult out of science and insist reductive materialism is the <i>only</i> level of analysis that produces results valuable to the human animal are shrill yet sounding ever more hollow as their god progress continues to fail to deliver. <br><br>The very nature of reasoning it seems to me has been caught up in this pseudoscience science. The logical proofs that you mentioned became the foundation of mathematics are in danger of getting lost in the tempest of technological gadgetry since few in our population claim this corner of their intellectual inheritance. Delineating the capabilities of reasoning clearly is a needed first step in the process of assessing its proper role in systems of thought like ecology or Neoplatonism for that matter. I fear most those currents of intellectual history that warn us it is possible to have societies that in the process of dethroning reason enthrone much darker denizens; blood and soil come to mind.

Synesius, as well as for his epistles and clerical writings is remembered for his practice of astrology, hydromancy, dream interpretation, and physical experimentation. His training in neoplatonist philosophy under Hypatia led him to become remembered not for his role as a bishop or philosopher, but for his role as one of the founding fathers of medieval alchemy. All through the middle ages, the science and philosophy of the pagan world continued to be practiced by people willing to put their lives on the line to pursue their studies. Sometimes they managed to become influential politicians or doctors of the church, but just as many of them were executed for heresy. That continued all the way up until the last dredges of the Byzantine Empire got overtaken by the Ottomans in the 15th century after which most of Pletho’s circle moved to Italy where the neoplatonists and hermeticists gave rise to the golden age of renaissance magic. That’s a theme you’ve hinted at many times before, and it suggests that clothing the best of modern science in Druid Robes and starspangled hats may well be the best hope for it. And so, science may leave the industrial age wearing the same vestments it entered it in.

The reason she can do this is the complete and utter lack of trust that ordinary people have in the food industry, which you can understand when you ponder all the artificial ingredients commonly added to food today to make us eat more, or to make it taste better or last longer on the shelf.<br><br>Scientists are denouncing her work as "fear-mongering." But what's great about the article is exactly what this blog post points out - a growing divide between the common people subjected to having their food manipulated with chemicals they can't pronounce or understand by big business that they cannot control, and an arrogant scientific field in the pocket of big industry claiming that all of these chemicals are "perfectly safe" and denouncing anyone who disagrees, such as the Food Babe as "ignorant" and "fear mongering." Meanwhile, whatever the accuracy of her claims, she is taking her arguments straight to the average person, and people are all to happy to believe her over the scientists whom they no longer trust:<br><br><i>Hari's approach capitalizes on growing consumer distrust of both Big Food companies and their unfamiliar, industrial-sounding ingredients, and of regulators' ability to oversee them effectively. Some of these chemicals and additives may indeed be questionable, but food scientists would argue that nearly all are safe. So why do food companies respond to her demands, if they have nothing to hide?<br><br>Because, Gorski writes, "companies live and die by public perception. It's far easier to give a blackmailer like Hari what she wants than to try to resist or to counter her propaganda by educating the public."<br><br>Critics note that Hari lacks credentials in nutrition or food science; she's a former consultant who studied computer science. Hari declined to be interviewed for this story; through her publicist, she told NPR she isn't speaking to media until her new book is released in February.

(That is an insight worthy of exploration by a student of ideas; I wondered immediately what Mumford would have made of it!) I understand your point to be that some science will escape being painted with the same black brush the sciences hijacked by politics and marketing are destined for. This is all the more reason to try and share the observational sciences with as many as possible. With their hands-on, real-world characteristics and the practical benefits properly presented appropriate tech is not a hard sell. <br><br>It is by clearly demonstrating the value of experiment, observation, evaluation of data and careful use of reasoning to weigh the evidence that we can honorably defend and spread the word about limits to growth. The poor, as you have pointed out, have already collapsed. It seems to me wise to consider placing into their rough-hewn hands the precious treasure of our ecological understanding if we want to see it carried into the far future.

It was mentioned in a previous set of comments that this area of technology is both relatively low-tech in addition to having enormous possibilities for various outcomes.<br><br> For example, iGEM (internation Genetically Engineered Machine) just held its high school competition where students may use synthetic biology building “blocks” from the registry of standard biological parts and then typically modify E. coli to perform various new functions. There is a fairly extensive and diverse group of “garage biohackers” who have adapted equipment such as smart phones to take the place of much more expensive equipment; although with the internet one may obtain high-quality and inexpensive used equipment quite readily.<br><br>Gen9 has advanced production of bio components to an unprecedented level of output. In other words, the tools are readily available to many people and now it is just a matter of waiting to see what is made…Not a comfortable position and, in my opinion, something far more worthy of focus compared to the table top toy 3D printers…<br><br>If you want a good book then try “The Wind Up Girl” by Bacigalupi – many elements are quite plausible, in my opinion. <br><br>Here in Canada David Suzuki ended up a pariah for voicing his concerns on GMOs. Personally I think his concerns are extremely worthy of attention. AquaBounty, for example, is trying to get approval for the modified salmon which grow twice as fast as natural fish. Considering the impact introducing natural salmon to the great lakes had on the original fish population (read: population crash) it doesn’t take much to imagine what will happen when the GMO salmon get loose in the oceans.<br><br>I think that many such tech attempts will be used on the downslope whether it is engineered E coli making something we can no longer achieve with other more energy-intensive means or very engineered food (plants, animals, algea and fungi) that end up ravaging the biosphere.<br><br>Then there are the advances being made on hacking our own genetics. I saw Ron Evans talk a number of years ago regarding his “marathon mice” – mice that were modified with a drug where the end result was twice the physical output for no training. Evans stated his drug was in final clinical trials and that “the military was camping out in my lab” waiting for it. Since nothing ever came to market for mass sales I assume his drug is now being used to give soldiers twice the physical output for no training…A first step for super solider along the lines of “Nexus”… <br>Again, the technology is moving rapidly in this area and, I am sure, will be used on the downslope. And the relatively low-tech nature of the gear required to move this tech along I think that there is very high likelihood of dealing with the consequences for quite a long time. <br><br>So I worry very little about the survival of some tech, such as my 1984 hp calculator (electrolytic caps are not much concern for battery powered gear) but more about the stuff that is just being worked on. Time grows short for considering the impact of the synthetic biology revolution.<br><br>I think your stories along the past few weeks have been very good but I also would say that some tech just being developed and released is even worse than living next door to a nuclear reactor during the downward descent…<br><br><a href=#c6891542103462020964 title="comment permalink">12/11/14, 11:56 AM</a><br><br>

Thence arose a false eloquence, ready to uphold either of the opposed sides of a case indifferently. Thus it came about that, by abuse of eloquence like that of the tribunes of the plebs at Rome, when the citizens were no longer content with making wealth the basis of rank, they strove to make it an instrument of power."<br><br>That passage captures so much of what we've been discussing here.

We're already on it. <br><br>Seb, astrology has paid astronomy's rent far more often than not in the past, and I won't be at all surprised if it does so again. The calculations needed to erect a horoscope, btw, are actually surprisingly easy so long as you take advantage of the tables of logarithms and other math aids to be found in any old-fashioned book of astrological tables. A slide rule helps, too!<br><br>Nick, it's a standard strategy for members of a privileged class to insist that the only way for the poor to better themselves is to do the same thing the privileged class is doing, and then erect as many barriers as possible in the way of their doing that. Sooner or later, the poor figure that out. <br><br>Raven, no argument there; in my two stints at university, in different departments at different institutions, I encountered flagrant scientific fraud; in both cases it was treated as a matter of course, and the normal way of doing academic business. That's another reason why the scientific method has to be pried out of the hands of the academy and put someplace where it's less vulnerable to corruption. <br><br>Ed, good. You're paying attention. <br><br>Ben, notice how you're confusing science and technology. Here's a question for reflection: how many devout Biblical creationists use cell phones? <br><br>Jon, the problem is that it's not a rock. It's just a model, an elegant assemblage of human verbal symbols that more or less seems to imitate and predict the world as we perceive it. (Please note that I say this as a serious fan of Darwin, and a believer in evolution as the best model we've got for understanding biological processes.) Treat it as a model, understand the difference between map and territory, and much can be done with it; insist that it's a rock and try to use it as the foundation for a church, and problems mount up. <br><br>Phil, the issue of risk assessment is a huge one. I should probably do a post one of these days explaining why game theory proves that the standard approach to risk assessment used by proponents of progress is utterly misguided. <br><br>Donal, thanks for the link. As for Hypatia, well, yes; a lot of Christians finesse that point.

Both of us had been independently influenced by your writing to join (our other common interest is permaculture)<br>We both agreed that the Masons were one of the better bets on preserving some of the civil in civilization during the long descent, and the basic incompatibility of the Mason’s stated beliefs and a day job as a barbarian overlord.<br>As for backlash against scientists, when I was growing up the truth about the hazards of smoking was coming out, despite may supposed scientists (now acknowledged to being in the pay of Big Tobacco) claiming it was safe (Both my parents were heavy smokers, and both died of cancer). Now, I have determined by personal experimentation that I am sensitive to something in modern wheat (when I eat a wheat containing product, I develop arthritis like symptoms, when I stop, the symptoms go away). I recently saw a study that linked the practice of spraying round up on wheat a week before harvest to the incidence of gluten sensitivity reported. Correlation is not causation, but I may just have a sensitivity to the round up (which many credentialed scientists claim is perfectly safe). More experiments will follow with some organic wheat to see if this is true, but if not, it’s back to modifications made to wheat during the green revolution as being the likely culprit which also has most credentialed scientists claiming are safe.<br> Another problem is the turf wars between various groups claiming the “scientific gospel”, such as the AMA’s history against any other treatment options. I use Chiropractic and acupuncture, due to proven personal results, for the things that they do best. Every time a medical doctor denounces them, the doctors drop lower in the credibility ratings.

It then fell off whatever was holding it in place and the corner of the Perspex clopped me on the forehead and bridge of the nose.<br><br>Wow, that stuff is really surprisingly hard.<br><br>Anyway, I was annoyed but mostly OK so I went and picked up the rest of the stuff only to dab my forehead and go: "ooo, that's a lot of blood, mate can I have a tissue?". Anyway, the staff were really apologetic and took me off to the bathroom to wash off the blood and it stopped bleeding pretty quickly.<br><br>So later I'm walking though the city and people were getting out of my way because I looked like I'd just stepped out of a bar fight.<br><br>It is amazing how quickly accidents can happen without notice in the strangest of places. It is remote here, so I'm always as careful as possible, but it never occurred to me that the electronics shop could be so hazardous.<br><br>Hope everyone up in the PNW is staying safe.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c409193673440845295 title="comment permalink">12/11/14, 3:27 PM</a><br><br>

In any event the only chance of all this research being profitable is if it can be applied on a massive scale through an industrialized farming system, which kind of renders the whole discussion moot. Still, all things considered I don't have any strict opposition to people messing around with vegetable DNA. <br><br>A lot of the people who do oppose the proliferation of GMOs rub me completely the wrong way. Some comments here have correctly pointed out that there is a scientific basis for caution and skepticism here, but a lot of the opposition comes across as profoundly anti-scientific. Shrilly predicting catastrophic consequences, misrepresenting poor research (like the infamous Seralini study), and loudly promoting your own products (like commercially sold organic food or your services as a speaker) does not make for a compelling argument. I wonder if this is what we can expect the further out of the public trust institutional science falls? <br><br>In related news, I've been concerned lately by what I perceive as a loss of empathy in a lot of public debates on supposedly "progressive" causes. Simply, people who believe they're in the right on this or that issue seem quicker than ever to jump to the least favourable interpretations of the things they're opponents say and do. Binary divisions between what/who is right and wrong seem more and more common in a lot of internet debates these days. People are nailed up all the time as they struggle to express and work through things they were brought up believing and feel honestly. This lack of empathy seems to me like a very good way to start a culture war...<br><br><a href=#c2376059200791991133 title="comment permalink">12/11/14, 6:06 PM</a><br><br>

The current model of purified biochemicals and computerised databases of information is ironically a very counterproductive way to deal with the matter. For all our vast arrays of genome sequences we still have barely the foggiest about what it all means. We are applying reductionist linear mathematical mindsets to a system that is inherently networked and chaotic. For all our amazing tools at our disposal, a quick reflection will reveal they are all borrowed from pre-existing biological machinery. We have invented almost nothing, simply repurposed life as we found it. <br><br>One report that got little attention but sparked my interest was a group that showed animal sperm will very readily absorb naked DNA from solution and incorporate it into its genome. No gold bullets or complex mechanisms required, just a basic salt wash in buffers well within a low tech scenario.<br><br>The only thing that would have to be abandoned is the notion that we can control the outcome in any meaningful way. To my mind that spells magic, in fact I have often heard my research lab mates referring to fiddly and often unreproducible techniques as black magic. To use crude genetics this way would require a cultural shift, particularly if humans are to be tinkered with. I could see a despotic nation going down this path someday, and if they get meaningful benefit from it starting an arms race with deep biological roots.<br><br>Beneath all of this is the immense power that comes from traditional breeding techniques, that have ironically been lost to mainstream science with the push to genetic engineering. Deep down this is the original technique of civilisation, harnessing and transforming species for our short term benefit but generally for long term ecological detriment. Those low technology techniques could be reclaimed and applied to breeding perennial and tree crops, projects that are currently well underway at places like Badgersett nursery that has already gotten hints of hybrid hazel and chestnut production per acre well above that of corn. Inga alley cropping in the tropics is also looking promising even without selective breeding.<br><br><a href=#c5565552562105584562 title="comment permalink">12/11/14, 9:34 PM</a><br><br>

Everything else is an object; be it human bodies treated with allopathic medicine, the genetics of plants and animals open to tinkering, factory farm animals, or the proletariat masses. This dividing of the world into an almost entirely objective field is fundamental for any of the dogmatics of Science to have internal consistency.<br><br>As far as I can tell this extreme restriction of subjecthood is fairly unique historically, although there may have been something similar in the rationalist periods of other cultures.<br><br>I believe that it is this restriction of subjecthood and the subjective world that makes Science so repugnant to so many. As someone who lives in a world filled with subjective forces I personally find the loud insistence that all are objects to be used by intellects absolutely disgusting. Furthermore, the actual use of the earth, plants, animals and human beings as mere objects is nauseatingly abhorrent to me. Having had many subject-subject experiences with Nature, I personally believe that Western Culture partitions the world incorrectly into objects. This in turn informs my values; it isn't right to treat Nature like an object. Many non-Westerner cultures have shared this value, and I imagine that this valuation will find many converts in the years ahead.<br><br>For this reason I imagine that the second religiosity will be predicated on a much more subjective worldview, a world containing many subjects and perhaps few objects. I also imagine this sort of worldview will be more popular than the dead matter in soulless universe outlook of Science.<br><br>While I don't imagine a more subject-making cultural matrix to be inherently <i>better</i> than a more object-making one. There will be massive downsides that I probably can't predict. I believe it will, however, at the very least treat the non-human world with much greater respect than we typically allow.<br><br><a href=#c1296136888309545610 title="comment permalink">12/12/14, 5:48 AM</a><br><br>

The clock is regulated /adjusted by timing transits of stars - preserve copies of navigation tables/star_charts, etc!

Up to circa 1920 (I think?) this was done in London by a lady with a pocket watch and a daily trip to the Royal Greenwich Observatory.

For my thyroid issues however, I want to see my naturopath. He's not bound by the American Thyroid Association treatment guidelines which actually discourage (with threats of reporting them as conducting ethics violations to their boards) primary care providers from taking care of hypothyroidism in the majority of patients as being too complex. <br><br>Nor is he bound, as the guidelines state, to only prescribe levothyroxine (brand name!) to his patients as the guidelines specifically state. Guess who two major financial backers of the new guidelines were? AbbVie (Synthroid) and Pfizer (Levoxyl). Funny how that works. <br><br>Even funnier is how they insist that only BRAND NAME thyroid medications are effective while generics (which just recently became available) are not. Pseudoscience in action. And protecting paychecks over protecting patients. <br><br>The skills I am focusing very hard on as I complete my final rotation are in the 'old time' skill repertoire such as percussion, physical maneuvers that tell you a lot about function, plain old physical exam and the all important history taking skills, suturing, and basic microscopy. I am working under an old time GP so I am able to get a lot of good training; the one thing I wish I could get is setting bones but that is NOT going to happen in the near future as NO ONE will touch that with a ten foot pole outside of an orthopedist's office. I suspect these are skills which will be much in demand at some point in the not too far off future. Many of my fellow students laugh at me or think I'm crazy for wanting to learn these - after all you can send someone to the ER for sutures, send them for an xray if you think they have pneumonia, etc. I just smile and tell them I'm preparing for the zombie apocalypse.

The high light of the evening was a young man in a carhart coat and a truckers hat with a whiskey in hand stood up and made a scene about how the entire discussion was pointless chatter by people who aren't willing to do anything. I am glad he was holding the whiskey and not I or it would have been the same scene with my stetson standing in for his truckers hat. I felt very sad for the esteemed panel, they are trying in their own ways to help, but everything they said was too abstract for me to follow, and I taught second order predicate logic for a year! I believe that the conversation needs to become uncomfortably personal to break through the smoke screens. These sad souls are completely addicted to their position within the school, and it takes the force from their every attempt to act. <br><br>Fort Collins is a very interesting place to live, culturally it admires with lavish praise the idea of changing our way of life to respond to the challenges of our era with a fluency greater than any other region I have traveled to, at the same time it is more perfectly protected with in a bubble of affluence than any other American city I have heard of. I have become close to the subculture that is actively doing most of the actual work of making the area less dramatically unsustainable, which Fort Collinders prides it self on like a peacocks tail, but judging from how often the people in the sub culture all know each other I estimate that only about 1% of the population here is actively engaged in any of the movements I have come to know.<br><br>The underclass here is likely to swell massively in times to come, we have so much further to fall than most. Right now I am trying to encourage the friends I have to focus our energy on helping the lowest active strata of society, because I think it is the best place to try to smuggle through learning. Accepting a personal life of austerity is my main step so far. practicing and teaching a few sciences, specifically forest ecology and mycology are the other side. In my own heart I wonder what sciences I would even wish upon the future, it deserves much consideration; currently I believe that the observational and non experimental sciences are much less odious, but much fine tuning is needed there. Nature should not be forced to reveal her secrets, but if she chooses to give us clues, we may listen as mindfully as we are able with out offence I believe. <br><br>Even permaculture and its use of systems theory is suspect to me. The machine, a microcosm under human control, still dwells in many visions of permaculture I think. Just as many activists seeking to "Manage the Globe" bring to mind "the white man's burden" now in a green dress with dreadlocks; the same tragic idea that the world needs some rational center of control. We need to consider, as this blog I believe encourages, what to do when we are explicitly not in control of our situation and in no position to manage the crisis?<br><br>Hmmmm.... I need to think quite a bit more about what sciences I actually care about, it just occurred to me that much of the product of science inspires me not.... an image comes to mind, of peasants living in a farm land that is not flattened, but is deeply enriched in texture, texture of soil and texture of rock, and texture of hedge and canopy.

I might have mentioned that I picked up a copy of Sun Tzu's "The Art of War".<br><br>Oooo, it's good! In this binary presented this week, I believe he would recommend for scientists not to waste energy on divisive behaviour. In fact, I'd have to guess he would make a point of ensuring that we all moved as if of one mind in a brutal, if pragmatic and perfunctory sort of a way.<br><br>He's a clever chap.<br><br>Anyway, after the IPCC concluded that human actions are the most likely cause of global warming, he would have then acted swiftly, not because it was his preference - but because in between his words I sense a deep stoicism - but because it would be the right thing to do. And that, my friends is the conundrum that scientists now face. I strongly suspect that Sun Tzu would say that they are not leaders because they lack "Character".<br><br>Thus in sticking to what they know and the familiar feed trough from which they sup, they risk their very future. The Art of War warns never to: act according to beliefs or dogma but in light of the information flowing in a particular moment. Moreover, we must always challenge the conventional wisdom in order to arrive at the truth of a situation.<br><br>If I had to be brutally honest, I would suggest that there are very few leaders on the world stage now that display "Character". Too often in accepting donations - which no one seriously believes are made out of pure charity - they find themselves in a snare from which they can't extricate themselves. I often think of our own unloved Prime Minister accepting the bribes (sorry, I meant donations) and trying to get to sleep at night whilst telling himself that he did it so that he could pursue his pet ideology. All the while, that pet ideology when presented to the public he acts surprised when they find it to be wholly repugnant.

I have to say that many of the neat boundaries drawn between science, religion and other human endeavours are smudging and disappearing after reading the last few weeks all in one go. I keep coming back to Carl Jung's work, which I realize is not considered science or religion necessarily, but many of his writings straddle the line between what many would consider 'poetry' and a systematic meaning-making. Where are the borders between science and alchemy and Myth? The scientist, the intellectual and the Mage? I am still jostling along looking for some more useful distinctions. The new distinctions cannot radically fight with hanging up the laundry. <br><br> It also brings to mind George Eliot's contention that both science and story-telling have to start in the middle :<br><br> "Men can do nothing without the make-believe of a beginning. Even science, the strict measurer, is obliged to start with a make-believe unit, and must fix on a point in the stars'<br>unceasing journey when his sidereal clock shall pretend that time is at Nought. His less accurate grandmother Poetry has always been understood to start in the middle; but on reflection it appears that her proceeding is not very different from his; since Science, too, reckons backward as well as forward, divides his unit into billions, and with his clock-finger at Nought really sets off<br>in medias res. No retrospect will take us to the true beginning; and whether our prologue be in heaven or on earth, it is but a fraction of that all-presupposing fact with which our story<br>sets out.” (From Daniel Deronda)<br>What could some new units of measurement be moving forward? And where will we choose to begin our story? I must admit that technology has never been one of my altars, but I am grieving the university system. I am pondering ways in which to localise what I glean from your electronic living room each week. I am wondering how living by scratch and peck can also include the possibility of an intellectual life for a wide swath of people. <br><br>I try not to use the comments section as a search engine or magic eight ball!

I don't know what the numbers are but here in New England <br>in my circles many of us have created a parallel economy through barter, odd jobs, gardening, hunting, foraging, and repurposing the stuff that's thrown away. It surprises me that this trend is off the radar of so many elites because, given enough time and momentum, it is a direct threat to their positions. I discussed this with an economics professor at the local watering hole. He thinks of this as another cycle rather than a tectonic change. I do not carry any clamshells but once people have lived ten years or more without a "real job" it is unlikely they are going back. The economic system loses legitimacy just as the philosophical schools did. <br>As for those who would rather be dead than live without the religion of progress I would point to The Plague, by Camus, where those who retained their humanity put one foot in front of the other, one moment at a time.

Established opinion is where science is not done. Also, if you want out, disciplines are not set in stone - in principle you can shift focus or methodology to put quite some social distance between your approach and some corporate sock puppet club. In practice that may be difficult to pull off - possibly an indication that you've already strayed into some of the more murky areas of academia. The cultural differences between disciplines (or nations) and sub-disciplines is pretty large in my opinion. This is also true for their contacts outside the ivory tower. That may give you a few ways to break out. What is strange to me is this wide range of feelings people have towards some fields of technology, science, or organizations supposedly representing them. If they are large organizations you should expect them to be corrupt, no? Does that make them the enemy of all that is good and true? Off the bat - only to a small degree I would say. They are made by normal people that end up in their positions by relatively normal selection processes (peer review is far from being a cure all) and incentives (by now at least). If science (or technology) has any special authority it overwhelmingly rests with their results and experiments (if you can do any), and to a far, far smaller extent can be attritbuted to individuals who managed to bring the results about. In more than a few fields of science (or technology) the verdict on the results is a long ways from being clear. I do agree that can change quickly once people quit measuring their environment by the metrics of "progress". I wish (but highly doubt) that there are a bunch of rules of thumb out there that can say which specific field is going up or down. I doubt the corporate sock puppet debating clubs will all get shelled. They are relatively powerful and can push into other areas when they need to (see the interesting Raytheon example KF gave). As for the wall - there's a million and one ways to wreck that, and from my perspective it is being done at such a pace that you'll have trouble sliding your shell along it for more than a few times without pushing through a whole or knocking off a brick. This may not be true for each and every field though, and I don't know who started sharpening when, nor if Hypatia is still in the building or not...<br><br><br><a href=#c6222785267133535245 title="comment permalink">12/13/14, 12:10 PM</a><br><br>

Now, why an elementary school needs to offer STEM education, especially to a 40+%-ESL student body who struggle mightily already anyway with basic reading and writing, is anybody's guess.

Everything else is an object; be it human bodies treated with allopathic medicine, the genetics of plants and animals open to tinkering, factory farm animals, or the proletariat masses. This dividing of the world into an almost entirely objective field is fundamental for any of the dogmatics of Science to have internal consistency. ... <br><br> I personally find the loud insistence that all are objects to be used by intellects absolutely disgusting. Furthermore, the actual use of the earth, plants, animals and human beings as mere objects is nauseatingly abhorrent to me."<br> Maybe I just need to think more about this, but I both agree and disagree. It does remind me powerfully of some of the more nauseating dogma I recall hearing and reading about as a child -- "animals have no feelings and no ability to think," etc., that even then struck me as a large load of manure perpetuated by people who had never, apparently, used their eyes. <br>But I'm of the impression some of that comes to science straight out of Christianity. Certainly, as with most belief systems, you can find Christians who believe all of the above -- and those who believe nature is of God, and to be treated as holy.<br>And you can find science-worshipping agnostic atheists like me, who think nature and living things are intrinsically sacred, for lack of a better word. Personally, while having no objections to other people's beliefs, I'm horrified and terrified by the concept of Deity; 'it's all just evolution' strikes me as a much more calming idea. But I'm right with you on being horrified by the notion that the world is our toy. I think people choose their beliefs in that respect -- religious or secular -- based on personal inclination.

Still, your values, your judgment...<br><br>Anthony, good for you -- I hope you find the money and take the course! One of the reasons I'm so strongly in favor of printing presses and private subscription libraries is that, to my mind, they hold the most hope for getting as much as possible of current ecological knowledge through the bottleneck.

What do you propose to do to make that knowledge available to our descendants? <br><br>Crow Hill, sure. What science gives us is a set of mental models that have not yet been conclusively proved false. That's what the scientific method is capable of generating. Mind you, that's not a criticism; such models have enormous power as a tool for thought and action, especially when it's remembered that they're simply mental models that have not yet been disproved. It's when they get turned into dogmas that thinking stops and various stupidities set in. <br><br>Cherokee, funny.

That's why so many of them were slaughtered in the revolutions in Magna Graecia in the sixth century CE. <br><br>KL Cooke, makes sense to me.

Not all that long ago, most American farm houses had a spot of paint on a south-facing window and a line scratched into the floor. The shadow from the spot of paint hit the scratch at exact noon local time, and that "noon mark" was used to keep the big wind-up clock in the parlor running accurately. That's one of a good many old-fashioned tricks that were used for timekeeping before long-distance communication made the process easier. <br><br>Tinfoilhat, I wish you were setting up your practice somewhere within walking distance of me -- I'd probably make use of your services. The lack of access to competent mainstream medical services that aren't simply pimping for the pharmaceutical industry is rather on my mind as I get older; it would make a useful addition to the alternative modalities I have on hand already. <br><br>Ray, the guy in the Carhartt coat with the whiskey in his hand is the wave of the future.

All most Americans see are people in lab coats making dogmatic claims that may or may not reflect anything in their own experience, but will certainly be contradicted by the next guy in a lab coat to get up and say something.

The system as it stands is certainly broken and donations are certainly a large part of the problem.<br><br>Actually, I was approached by a person from Greenpeace about two weeks ago asking me whether I'd heard about the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef and I was like, yeah of course of I have. Then I could sense the money question, so I cut them off and said, you realise that it is inevitable that the reef may be destroyed. We're trying to campaign against its destruction they replied. I then pulled the big gun and said did not Gandhi say that we must become the change that we wish to see in the world? Before they had a chance to reply I said, "I live on an organic farm, which is not connected to the grid, I drive as little as possible". But we're really trying to make a change was the reply. Just to skewer them I said your NGO is part of the system and thus ineffective and I walked off and said as a parting shot over my shoulder, "the only effective change begins with the individual".

I remain in disagreement. The studies that I did read noted seemed to have been done by proponents of the method, using other proponents as their subjects. In other words, they were not random. The individuals responding had a dog in the hunt.<br><br>As to the "three" (actually two) logical fallacies, I did major in logic as an undergrad, and can inform you that I did not beg the question. It seems to me that the author did a bit of dancing about the subject, and tried to say that, because "extraordinary" was not strictly defined, it is impossible to judge anything as such, and equally impossible to judge proofs. I agree that it can be difficult to strictly define; and like some members of SCOTUS I think I can recognize one when I see it. Claims of one cure fits all, claims with no basis or real proof that water can remember one molecule was there (with no chemical signature showing it), as part of a &lt; 1ppm solution (and where not even that one part is present in the 'solution') is, frankly, not only extraordinary but seemingly preposterous. I am not saying it is impossible; I am saying it IS extraordinary. <br><br>It seems to me that the argument being made in favor is that, 'absence of proof is not proof of absence." And, perhaps the proponents have defined the subject to be impossible to prove, like the existence of a god. <br><br>A very good friend of mine, some years ago, was an advocate of and used, for instance, chiropractic. He was being treated for back pain, and I visited with him a number of times over a period of months, during which time he reported the pain would subside for a while after "adjustments" and it would later come back. At such times he called his faithful chiropractor, who did some new manipulations and sent him home. <br><br>Bottom line, he was treated by a quack, using quackery. Had he been treated by a traditional MD, he would have had an early X-Ray examination, read by a professional. He would have learned that what he was experiencing was pain from a tumor. Had he begun treatment for that cancer earlier, he might be alive today. <br><br>I view most homeopathic claims to be quite extraordinary. I wish they were all true. If they were, my wife would not be in severe daily pain, my friend would be alive, and all would be perfect in this, the best of all possible worlds. <br><br>That is not to say that there would not be a double blind, random study showing that 1 ppm or less in solution is a miracle cure for anything, or that acupuncture/acupressure provide any more than a temporary palliative consequence (yes, JHM, back rubs feel good, as do some acupressure techniques - I have tried them. Others can hurt, and do harm - been there and done that as well). I read claims with an open mind, and yet do apply a high standard when judging extraordinary claims, including medical claims that are often far beyond the pale and actually fraudulent. <br><br>Simply saying that old sages and mages have been doing that for years does not impress - they also did bloodletting, ingestion of what are now known to be poisons, and so forth. <br><br>And, I realize that some traditional remedies actually do work (and are banned - e.g., cocaine, marijuana, etc.), and that there are any number of traditional remedies that have been synthesized (in order to enable patenting). Greed is a great enabler for cognitive dissonance. <br><br>I am comfortable in disagreeing about homeopathy... I remain open to the possibility that some remedies might be curative and useful. I am also watchful when those I care about seek such treatments. Meanwhile, just call me, "ahomeopathic."<br><br><br><br><a href=#c2817521018458872151 title="comment permalink">12/14/14, 7:27 AM</a><br><br>

In a society bounded by the speed of an oxcart or shanks pony (feet!) you only need 4 times or tides a day - morn tide, noon tide, afternoon tide and even tide. Maybe monks with a set schedule of offices/prayers need something better, to within 15 mins per day or so. Incidentally JMG's mark on a window will give Local Solar Time which varies from a Mean Solar Time by up to 15 mins throughout the year. A good sundial with rough correction tables will do better than this - time would be broadcast by church bells... This sufficed from medieval times to the coming of the railways.<br><br>If you want to run a national railway system you need to keep time to better than than a minute per day, preferably to a second per day. The careful synchronisation of good quality pendulum clocks by stellar observations combined with time distribution by electric telegraph or radio time signals enables this level of precision. Radio time signals could well be an amateur radio contribution in a future time. In effect this would be a reversion to the early Victorian system, which might slip back to the more local systems as deindustrialisation proceeds. This is something I'll ponder in the near future.<br><br><a href=#c3379545143147787045 title="comment permalink">12/14/14, 8:12 AM</a><br><br>

Shumacher this weekend. They even briefly explained his ideas. Interesting times indeed, too see old Schumacher coming back in from the fringe.<br><br>You may have seen the Dublin Water Protest last Wednesday. Perhaps 50,000 people on a very cold winter day, and a major act of civil disobedience blocking a bridge in the heart of Dublin, at rush hour. Magnificent stuff.<br><br>My brother’s in law has been arrested eight times for obstructing the installation of water meters, but he continues to do so weekly. So many people are resisting that jailing them is out of the question, there is no space.<br><br>In recent weeks I have met some newly radicalised, middle class, middle aged women. Women I have known most of my life and never heard express a political thought, are suddenly burning with righteous anger about the state of our society and are ready to act and go to jail.<br><br>A significant and apparently growing section of the Irish people is full of fight and ready to challenge the established political order. There is a move to build local, grass roots political organisations and setup people’s conventions. It is suddenly a radical’s paradise.<br><br>As a life long, frustrated inhabitant of the radical fringe, this sudden turn of events took me by surprise but it gives me great hope. Who knows the risen people may yet reclaim political power and finally create the kind of Republic the leaders of the 1916 Rising died for. <br><br>There must be a General Election within 16 months and the three parties that dominated the state since its foundation are now collectively at only 48% in the polls.<br><br>Very interesting times indeed in the Emerald Isle.

More specifically, the seed of rationalism is found in the <i>puritan</i> movement of a culture's religion. with this conceptual framework it is telling that Isaac Newton was born 30 years after Oliver Cromwell. Newton's was the generation proceeding puritanism. Equally of interest is that in Greek times a similar chain of events unfolded - Euclid was about 30 years younger than Pythagoras.<br><br>I would say that the scientific revolution in the West wasn't a break from earlier Christian dogmatics any more than the Reformation.

I am a huge fan of science and discovery. I am fascinated by the Tracy-Widom distribution of highly correlated systems, which seems have to have a universality from sub atomic particles, to species extinction patterns to the stock market and beyond. <br><br>Biologist, Robert May, did a study on the effects of tortoise populations in a model of an archipelago and how the amount of flotsam between islands played a large role in creating strong interactions between the populations of tortoises as different species of tortoises rode flotsam to neighboring islands creating population instability. Robert May noticed that the populations rise and fall followed a skewed distribution pattern, later dubbed the Tracy-Widom distribution. <br><br>If society's planners could reduce the amount of figurative flotsam, each island's individual populations would be less likely to suffer catastrophic population destabilization. The flotsam in this case might be the highly complex and integrated banking systems,JIT inventory systems, and/or etc. <br><br> I do think that science has the answers for humankind to make slow and steady growth of knowledge and discovery and sustainability for everything else, but our lack of social intelligence and the greed of even a very few well placed people will likely derail anything resembling long term stability planning by a central authority. It seems as though we as a species are drifting instinctually into repeating our mistakes. Maybe humans have no more collective ability to forge our future than do subatomic particles and we will forever be trapped inside a Tracy-Widom distribution. <br><br>I find it interesting that the things JMG is proposing on how to deal with the realities of peak oil are in some respects to change the shape of the curve in which we now reside, reduce the strength of interaction between the strongly correlated aspects of our civilization to reduce the steepness of the right side of the curve. If we had more foresight, and discipline, and along with reducing the amount of strongly interacting correlations we also reduced the amplitude of the curve before we hit the peak, the other side of the curve would be flattened and extended providing a softer landing further in the future. We would also have more time at the apex of the curve.<br><br><a href=#c1773799046476593356 title="comment permalink">1/6/15, 10:35 AM</a><br><br>
