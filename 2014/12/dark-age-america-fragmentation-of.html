<div class=MsoNormal>
It was probably inevitable that last week’s discussion of the way that contemporary science is offering itself up as a sacrifice on the altar of corporate greed and institutional arrogance would field me a flurry of responses that insisted that I must hate science.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is all the more ironic in that the shoddy logic involved in that claim also undergirded George W. Bush’s famous and fatuous insistence that the Muslim world is riled at the United States because “they hate our freedom.”</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In point of fact, the animosity felt by many Muslims toward the United States is based on specific grievances concerning specific acts of US foreign policy. Whether or not those grievances are justified is a matter I don’t propose to get into here; the point that’s relevant to the current discussion is that the grievances exist, they relate to identifiable actions on the part of the US government, and insisting that the animosity in question is aimed at an abstraction instead is simply one of the ways that Bush, or for that matter his equally feckless successor, have tried to sidestep any discussion of the means, ends, and cascading failures of US policy toward the Middle East and the rest of the Muslim world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the same way, it’s very convenient to insist that people who ask hard questions about the way that contemporary science has whored itself out to economic and political interests, or who have noticed gaps between the claims about reality made by the voices of the scientific mainstream and their own lived experience of the world, just hate science. That evasive strategy makes it easy to brush aside questions about the more problematic dimensions of science as currently practiced. This isn’t a strategy with a long shelf life; responding to a rising spiral of problems by insisting that the problems don’t exist and denouncing those who demur is one of history’s all-time bad choices, but intellectuals in falling civilizations all too often try to shore up the crumbling foundations of their social prestige and privilege via that foredoomed approach. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Central to the entire strategy is a bit of obfuscation that treats “science” as a monolithic unity, rather than the complex and rather ramshackle grab-bag of fields of study, methods of inquiry, and theories about how different departments of nature appear to work. There’s no particular correlation between, let’s say, the claims made for the latest heavily marketed and dubiously researched pharmaceutical, on the one hand, and the facts of astronomy, evolutionary biology, or agronomy on the other; and someone can quite readily find it impossible to place blind faith in the pharmaceutical and the doctor who’s pushing it on her, while enjoying long nights observing the heavens through a telescope, delighting in the elegant prose and even more elegant logic of Darwin’s <i>The Origin of Species</i>, or running controlled experiments in her backyard on the effectiveness of compost as a soil amendment. To say that such a person “hates science” is to descend from meaningful discourse to thoughtstopping noise. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The habit of insisting that science is a single package, take it or leave it, is paralleled by the equivalent and equally specious insistence that there is this single thing called “technology,” that objecting to any single component of that alleged unity amounts to rejecting all of it, and that you’re not allowed to pick and choose among technologies—you have to take all of it or reject it all. I field this sort of nonsense all the time. It so happens, for example, that I have no interest in owning a cell phone, never got around to playing video games, and have a sufficiently intense fondness for books printed on actual paper that I’ve never given more than a passing thought to the current fad for e-books. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I rarely mention these facts to those who don’t already know them, because it’s a foregone conclusion that if I do so, someone will ask me whether I hate technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Au contraire</i>, I’m fond of slide rules, love rail travel, cherish an as yet unfulfilled ambition to get deep into letterpress printing, and have an Extra class amateur radio license; all these things entail enthusiastic involvement with specific technologies, and indeed affection for them; but if I mention these points in response to the claim that I must hate technology, the responses I get range from baffled incomprehension to angry dismissal.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Technology,” in the mind of those who make such claims, clearly doesn’t mean what the dictionary says it means.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To some extent, of course, it amounts to whatever an assortment of corporate and political marketing firms want you to buy this week, but there’s more to it than that. Like the word “science,” “technology” has become a buzzword freighted with a vast cargo of emotional, cultural, and (whisper this) political meanings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s so densely entangled with passionately felt emotions, vast and vague abstractions, and frankly mythic imagery that many of those who use the word can’t explain what they mean by it, and get angry if you ask them to try. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The flattening out of the vast diversity of technologies, in the plural, into a single monolithic shape guarded by unreasoning emotions would be problematic under any conditions. When a civilization that depends on the breakneck exploitation of nonrenewable resources is running up against the unyielding limits of a finite planet, with resource depletion and pollution in a neck-and-neck race to see which one gets to bring the industrial project to an end first, it’s a recipe for disaster. A sane response to the predicament of our time would have to start by identifying the technological suites that will still be viable in a resource-constrained and pollution-damaged environment, and then shift as much vital infrastructure to those as possible with the sharply limited resources we have left. Our collective thinking about technology is so muddled by unexamined emotions, though, that it doesn’t matter now obviously necessary such a project might be: it remains unthinkable. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Willy-nilly, though, the imaginary monolith of “technology” is going to crumble, because different technologies have wildly varying resource requirements, and they vary just as drastically in terms of their importance to the existing order of society. As resource depletion and economic contraction tighten their grip on the industrial world, the stock of existing and proposed technologies face triage in a continuum defined by two axes—the utility of the technology, on the one hand, and its cost in real (i.e., nonfinancial) terms on the other. A chart may help show how this works. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/adr-graph-1-9b3807-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=200 src=../../img/adr-graph-1-9b3807-200x200-g95.jpg srcset="../../img/adr-graph-1-9b3807-400x400-g92.jpg 2x" width=200></a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is a very simplified representation of the frame in which decisions about technology are made. Every kind of utility from the demands of bare survival to the whims of fashion is lumped in together and measured on the vertical axis, and every kind of nonfinancial cost from energy and materials straight through to such intangibles as opportunity cost is lumped in together and measured on the horizontal axis. In an actual analysis, of course, these variables would be broken out and considered separately; the point of a more schematic view of the frame, like this one, is that it allows the basic concepts to be grasped more easily. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The vertical and horizontal lines that intersect in the middle of the graph are similarly abstractions from a complex reality. The horizontal line represents the boundary between those technologies which have enough utility to be worth building and maintaining, which are above the line, and those which have too little utility to be worth the trouble, which are below it. The vertical line represents the boundary between those technologies which are affordable and those that are not. In the real world, those aren’t sharp boundaries but zones of transition, with complex feedback loops weaving back and forth among them, but again, this is a broad conceptual model. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The intersection of the lines divides the whole range of technology into four categories, which I’ve somewhat unoriginally marked with the first four letters of the alphabet. Category A consists of things that are both affordable and useful, such as indoor plumbing. Category B consists of things that are affordable but useless, such as electrically heated underwear for chickens. Category C consists of things that are useful but unaffordable, such as worldwide 30-minute pizza delivery from low earth orbit. Category D, rounding out the set, consists of things that are neither useful nor affordable, such as—well, I’ll let my readers come up with their own nominees here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course the horizontal and vertical lines aren’t fixed; they change position from one society to another, from one historical period to another, and indeed from one community, family, or individual to another. (To me, for example, cell phones belong in category B, right next to the electrically heated chicken underwear; other people would doubtless put them in somewhere else on the chart.) Every society, though, has a broad general consensus about what goes in which category, which is heavily influenced by but by no means entirely controlled by the society’s political class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That consensus is what guides its collective decisions about funding or defunding technologies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/adr-graph-2-b24c1d-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=200 src=../../img/adr-graph-2-b24c1d-200x200-g95.jpg srcset="../../img/adr-graph-2-b24c1d-400x400-g92.jpg 2x" width=200></a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With the coming of the industrial revolution, both of the lines shifted substantially from their previous position, as shown in the second chart. Obviously, the torrent of cheap abundant energy gave the world’s industrial nations access to an unparalleled wealth of resources, and this pushed the dividing line between what was affordable and what was unaffordable quite a ways over toward the right hand side of the chart. A great many things that had been desirable but unaffordable to previous civilizations swung over from category C into category A as fossil fuels came on line. This has been discussed at great length here and elsewhere in the peak oil blogosphere. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Less obviously, the dividing line between what was useful and what was useless also shifted quite a bit toward the bottom of the chart, moving a great many things from category B into category A. To follow this, it’s necessary to grasp the concept of <i>technological suites</i>. A technological suite is a set of interdependent technologies that work together to achieve a common purpose. Think of the relationship between cars and petroleum drilling, computer chips and the clean-room filtration systems required for their manufacture, or commercial airliners and ground control radar. What connects each pair of technologies is that they belong to the same technological suite. If you want to have the suite, you must either have all the elements of the suite in place, or be ready to replace any absent element with something else that can serve the same purpose. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For the purpose of our present analysis, we can sort out the component technologies of a technological suite into three very rough categories. There are <i>interface technologies</i>, which are the things with which the end user interacts—in the three examples just listed, those would be private cars, personal computers, and commercial flights to wherever you happen to be going. There are <i>support technologies</i>, which are needed to produce, maintain, and operate the output technologies; they make up far and away the majority of technologies in a technological suite—consider the extraordinary range of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>technologies it takes to manufacture a car from raw materials, maintain it, fuel it, provide it with roads on which to drive, and so on. Some interface technologies and most support technologies can be replaced with other technologies as needed, but some of both categories can’t; we can put those that can’t be replaced <i>bottleneck technologies</i>, for reasons that will become clear shortly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What makes this relevant to the charts we’ve been examining is that most support technologies have no value aside from the technological suites to which they belong and the interface technologies they serve. Without commercial air travel, for example, most of the specialized technologies found at airports are unnecessary. Thus a great many things that once belonged in category B—say, automated baggage carousels—shifted into category A with the emergence of the technological suite that gave them utility. Thus category A balloons with the coming of industrialization, and it kept getting bigger as long as energy and resource use per capita in the industrial nations kept on increasing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Once energy and resource use per capita peak and begin their decline, though, a different reality comes into play, leading over time to the situation shown in the third chart. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/adr-graph-3-d78091-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=200 src=../../img/adr-graph-3-d78091-200x200-g95.jpg srcset="../../img/adr-graph-3-d78091-400x400-g92.jpg 2x" width=200></a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As cheap abundant energy runs short, and it and all its products become expensive, scarce, or both, the vertical line slides inexorably toward the left. That’s obvious enough. Less obviously, the horizontal line also slides upwards. The reason, here again, is the interrelationship of individual technologies into technological suites. If commercial air travel stops being economically viable, the support technologies that belong to that suite are no longer needed. Even if they’re affordable enough to stay on the left hand side of the vertical line, the technologies needed to run automated baggage carousels thus no longer have enough utility to keep them above the horizontal line, and down they drop into category B. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s one way that a technology can drop out of use. It’s just as possible, of course, for something that would still have ample utility to cost too much in terms of real wealth to be an option in a contracting society, and slide across the border into category C. Finally, it’s possible for something to do both at once—to become useless and unaffordable at something like the same time, as economic contraction takes away the ability to pay for the technology and the ability to make use of it at the same time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s also possible for a technology that remains affordable, and participates in a technological suite that’s still capable of meeting genuine needs, to tumble out of category A into one of the others. This can happen because the cost of different technologies differ qualitatively, and not just quantitatively. If you need small amounts of niobium for the manufacture of blivets, and the handful of niobium mines around the world stop production—whether this happens because the ore has run out, or for some other reason, environmental, political, economic, cultural, or what have you—you aren’t going to be able to make blivets any more. That’s one kind of difficulty if it’s possible to replace blivets with something else, or substitute some other rare element for the niobium; it’s quite another, and much more challenging, if blivets made with niobium are the only thing that will work for certain purposes, or the only thing that makes those purposes economically viable. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s habitual in modern economics to insist that such bottlenecks don’t exist, because there’s always a viable alternative. That sort of thinking made a certain degree of sense back when energy per capita was still rising, because the standard way to get around material shortages for a century now has been to throw more energy, more technology, and more complexity into the mix. That’s how low-grade taconite ores with scarcely a trace of iron in them have become the mainstay of today’s iron and steel industry; all you have to do is add fantastic amounts of cheap energy, soaring technological complexity, and an assortment of supply and resource chains reaching around the world and then some, and diminishing ore quality is no problem at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s when you don’t have access to as much cheap energy, technological complexity, and baroque supply chains as you want that this sort of logic becomes impossible to sustain. Once this point is reached, bottlenecks become an inescapable feature of life. The bottlenecks, as already suggested, don’t have to be technological in nature—a bottleneck technology essential to a given technological suite can be perfectly feasible, and still out of reach for other reasons—but whatever generates them, they throw a wild card into the process of technological decline that shapes the last years of a civilization on its way out, and the first few centuries of the dark age that follows. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The crucial point to keep in mind here is that one bottleneck technology, if it becomes inaccessible for any reason, can render an entire technological suite useless, and compromise other technological suites that depend on the one directly affected. Consider the twilight of ceramics in the late Roman empire. Rome’s ceramic industry operated on as close to an industrial scale as you can get without torrents of cheap abundant energy; regional factories in various places, where high-quality clay existed, produced ceramic goods in vast amounts and distributed them over Roman roads and sea lanes to the far corners of the empire and beyond it. The technological suite that supported Roman dishes and roof tiles thus included transport technologies, and those turned out to be the bottleneck: as long-distance transport went away, the huge ceramic factories could no longer market their products and shut down, taking with them every element of their technological suite that couldn’t be repurposed in a hurry. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same process affected many other technologies that played a significant role in the Roman world, and for that matter in the decline and fall of every other civilization in history. The end result can best be described as technological fragmentation: what had been a more or less integrated whole system of technology, composed of many technological suites working together more or less smoothly, becomes a jumble of disconnected technological suites, nearly all of them drastically simplified compared to their pre-decline state, and many of them jerry-rigged to make use of still-viable fragments of technological suites whose other parts didn’t survive their encounter with one bottleneck or another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In places where circumstances permit, relatively advanced technological suites can remain in working order long after the civilization that created them has perished—consider the medieval cities that got their water from carefully maintained Roman aqueducts a millennium after Rome’s fall—while other systems operate at far simpler levels, and other regions and communities get by with much simpler technological suites. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All this has immediate practical importance for those who happen to live in a civilization that’s skidding down the curve of its decline and fall—ours, for example. In such a time, as noted above, one critical task is to identify the technological suites that will still be viable in the aftermath of the decline, and shift as much vital infrastructure as possible over to depend on those suites rather than on those that won’t survive the decline. In terms of the charts above, that involves identifying those technological suites that will still be in category A when the lines stop shifting up and to the left, figuring out how to work around any bottleneck technologies that might otherwise cripple them, and get the necessary knowledge into circulation among those who might be able to use it, so that access to information doesn’t become a bottleneck of its own</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That sort of analysis, triage, and salvage is among the most necessary tasks of our time, especially for those who want to see viable technologies survive the end of our civilization, and it’s being actively hindered by the insistence that the only possible positive attitude toward technology is sheer blind faith. For connoisseurs of irony, it’s hard to think of a more intriguing spectacle. The impacts of that irony on the future, though, are complex, and will be the subject of several upcoming posts here. </div>

Arbitrarily grouping some popular technologies of the moment, we have: 1.Internet marketing and social media related to the use of laptops and smartphones, including Amazon, FaceBook and their many competitors and thousands of related apps and sites. Most of the IPO money has gone to this group. Not innovative in most senses and completely dependent upon cheap transportation costs. If transportation costs triple, most of this group is DOA.<br>2.Medical technology, almost all of it highly expensive, and generally falling into the drug or the device category, with some procedural stuff like organ transplants, IVF, and vanity surgery. Most of it isn't cost effective and much of it, especially surgery and drugs with major side effects, isn't effective at all in a net sense. In a Malthusian society, 99% of it would disappear overnight.<br>3. Really practical technology, like thermal windows and various superior materials applications. Will stick around as long as no materials bottlenecks.<br>4. Computers and various internet related technology--important for control at all levels, and will be supported by the Governments until they can't--but would lose much of its utility if the internet is shut down or heavily censored.<br>5.

There is still much money available, but usually in the hands of adherents of the Religion of Progress. It is in the realm of changing their consciousness, i.e. magic. Your expertise. It is not enough for all these individuals who are barely scraping by to do their thing. We need a concerted effort. I've been doing all I can, but it isn't enough, and any isolated effort by homesteaders isn't enough. <br><br>We are trying to start an institute to do technology research (but of the type you propose) and also free people from the worst middlemen of our society, i.e. landlords. To buy land from them and manage it by groups who use Elinor Ostrom's principles for commons management.

Currently they are squarely in quadrant D with the bottleneck technologies being the densely-patterned silicon chips that must be produced in multi-billion-dollar factories. <br><br>I'm not aware of any obvious alternatives that could be mass-produced as the vertical line slides left. Vacuum tubes and relays won't cut it for useful 'low-tech' computing.

Its slope would be represented by utility/cost. You only have 2 categories that way, but they're useful and don't require a rather arbitrary cut-off. I'd have a hard time justifying keeping something at the lower right area of A and tossing something at the upper left area of B under your system, regardless of where you drew the lines. Board games might be less useful than the Internet, but they're so cheap I'd have a hard time seeing them ever really go away regardless of how tight things got, for instance. In this scheme, basically anything above the line represents a worthwhile use of resources, anything below would not be worthwhile.<br><br>The amount of spare resources the society has to spend basically defines the acceptable slope of the divider. Our current society accepts a fairly flat slope, maybe 0.25 or something. Expensive stuff is fine as long as it provides some acceptable amount of utility, and fairly useless stuff is still acceptable as long as it's not too ridiculously expensive, so something at (3, 10) would pass muster, as would something at (1, 3), but (1, 10) would not. As soon as resources get tight, the slope of acceptable cost increases. At a slope of 0.5, anything at less than a 2:1 ratio of cost:utility gets scrapped. Bring the slope to 2 or 3 and only extremely cheap and somewhat useful or modestly priced and extremely useful things survive.<br><br><a href=#c6261608282632538184 title="comment permalink">12/3/14, 5:34 PM</a><br><br>

It appears that China is simply trying to move the ore mountains wholus bolus from the Pilbara to port facilities in China itself . Old timers tell me that thirty years ago you could strike an arc on the ore as it came out of the ground , such was its iron content , though these days the grade is much lower and this would be impossible , so vast quantities of energy are used to process the metal from it as you say . <br>Years ago the wise patriarchs of w.a. decreed that mines should be accompanied by fully functioning townships complete with church , footy club school and sporting oval in order to preserve moral and spiritual well being of miner who was able to live with his family ,though this has since given way to the rise of the FIFO " fly in fly out " workforce to work the increasingly robotised and automated site . So we have the full gamut of precision GPS aviation technology which accompanies mining , GPS Satellite tech also presumably guides the driverless trucks , ore trains and ore ships . <br>One of the side effects of drug the remote often absent FIFO workforce has been depression , divorce , obesity , drug and alcohol addiction among its disenfranchised , increasingly atomised workforce , so i suppose you could include the technologies of crystal meth production and law enforcement in the "mining suite " these days . Mining companies have taken to launching full blown tactical police raids complete with sniffer dogs onto their own worksites to try and contain this problem , which is largely of their own making . ( mining townships tend to form strong communities and hence labor unions ) .<br>Without going all Ben Von Daneken on you I sometimes think that we are already living among the ruins of unrecognisable ancient technologies ; none of us really know what the pyramids actually are or how they were even constructed ( Pete Lemusurier gives it a shot ) . I wonder if NASA have found any old satellites in orbit that after rubbing away the dust found some ancient sumerian writing, translated " do not remove hatch cover during flight " ?? . <br><br>Seems the GPS constellations with their propensity to fix ones temporal position to a set of terrestial map coordinates will be the subject of much myth and legend making in future ; perhaps they will become a new set of Gods ? . I like how in the recent movie "Interstellar" some scientist turned corn farmers bring down an old solar powered military drone which is still circling the globe many years after the industrial project has ground to a halt ..<br>Cheers Mates<br><br><a href=#c7964235312274999199 title="comment permalink">12/3/14, 5:44 PM</a><br><br>

As someone mentioned in an earlier post, The Church itself is at fault.

The bees are a good example of that sort of thinking. Nobody denies that there is a decline in the number of European honey bees around the globe. There are clearly many causes of this decline including: the methods of bee-keeping; use of pesticides; and use of herbicides.<br><br>The weird thing about the situation is that everyone is pointing fingers at everyone else, whilst few consider the entire system and decline marches steadily onwards oblivious to opinions.<br><br>A good example of this is that beekeepers are fixated on orthodoxy to a point that drives me to distraction. However, there are a few dissenting voices in the beekeeping world that have some interesting observations to make and alternatives to orthodoxy. They should be considered.<br><br>Orthodox opinions concerned about the die off of European honey bees blame all sorts of things like: bee predators, parasites, pesticides, herbicides and mono-culture agricultural practices.<br><br>Yet the dirty little secret is that most of those beekeepers and/or their families may also be purchasing their fruit and vegetables at a market or supermarket where the produce supports the use of herbicides and fungicides - not to mention the mono culture!<br><br>People tell me time and time again, they'd really like to eat organic produce, but it's like really expensive man...<br><br>So the poor bees have to exist in a world of herbicides, fungicides and mono cultures and they're doing their very best. It’s just that they get weakened in that environment and then opportunistic predators and parasites move in and start taking advantage of that weakness.<br><br>Then weaknesses in the orthodox bee-keeping methods that have previously been able to be brushed under the carpet start showing up.<br><br>Few want to consider what is best for the bees themselves.<br><br>Honestly, our entire society is guilty of neglect and in it up to our eyeballs!<br><br>I'm ranting now... I heard a report from the UN climate body today saying that this year looks like it will be the hottest in recorded history (you don't need to tell me that). But then, I'm sure they want further funds to study it.<br><br>It's like if the IPCC comes out and says the most probable reason for all this heat is because our civilisation is using the atmosphere like a sewer and it isn’t going to get better any time soon, then why do we need to continue studying and researching it? Seriously, shouldn't they now be saying, perhaps adaption is not a bad idea at this point in time...<br><br>Honestly, blind Freddy would have a thing or two to say about the lot of them.<br><br>PS: I've got a new blog entry up showing continuing shed building activities (I’m sure such activities count towards my official ruinman status?), hot dogs (not the sort that you eat), kangaroos and cool insects: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Steel yourself</a> <br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c7187481550895091709 title="comment permalink">12/3/14, 7:45 PM</a><br><br>

You, personally, may not like cell phones, but most of the world disagrees. For example, in India, air conditioning is a luxury (a reasonably affordable luxury, but a luxury nonetheless) and washing machines rare (it's cheaper to hire somebody to wash your clothes by hand!), but cell phones are pretty common; I've heard this is true in Africa as well. I'd expect cell phones, and the communications network that supports them, to be one of the technologies that people will try to keep operational as long as possible, although the details of how it works may change. Far-sighted researchers are already trying to find ways around using rare-earth metals, many of which are bad news for a large variety of reasons ranging from geopolitical to ecological to humanitarian. And given the growth of semiconductor technology over the last few decades, it's not unreasonable to think they'll come up with some good solutions.<br><br><a href=#c6905264325344546423 title="comment permalink">12/3/14, 10:09 PM</a><br><br>

The reason I think this is so is that the last technologies to be developed are typically the most complex. Complexity implies greater vulnerability to interruptions in supply chains. Last on also implies we don't really need it since we've managed to do without up until recently. On the other hand, the simplest (and so generally cheapest) and most useful technologies have been with us for some time, well before the advent of cheap energy. These need not disappear although we can expect them to become more expensive. I'm thinking such things as shoes, pencils, ceramics, paper, glass, wood construction etc. <br><br>If we are talking machine technologies, the first that can be called “industrial” are still with us and have not fundamentally changed since their invention. Here I'm thinking steam engines, diesels, gasoline engines, electric generators and motors, refrigerators, pumps etc. Certainly the control systems and other stuff hanging of these machines have become more sophisticated, but the technologies themselves are still fairly simple. I think we can expect this sophisticated (generally computerized) overlay to disappear first. In theory there is no reason why such will not be replaced by what it replaced. <br><br>When all cell phones, ipads, digital cameras, GPS receivers, flat screen TVs, and computers ceased to function (as indeed they will), there are cheaper, less complex technologies to fulfill the same functions. I'm not saying the simpler replacement will do the job as well (e.g. typewriters vs word processors), but if the job really does need to be done, there is a simpler/cheaper technology already in existence that can do it. Once it is clear to the managers of these technologies that things must be simplified, graceful degradation is possible. Of course possible does not necessarily mean likely. By “managers” I'm not thinking politicians, I mean those people whose job it is to keep the machines running i.e. engineers.<br><br>The real issue is graceful degradation versus catastrophic collapse. Which it will be, in the case of each technology suite, is still likely a function of its complexity. As an example: I can see commercial air travel disappearing in a heartbeat. Gas turbines (jet engines) and avionics are extremely complex. Gas turbines are so complex, each generally can only be repaired where it was manufactured. On the other hand, a diesel engine powering a boat or train is far less complex. Diesels can be repaired just about anywhere. <br><br>This line of thought leads to the suggestion that the most recent and most complex technologies will collapse soon and catastrophically while the other older and simpler technologies will hang in there and degrade more gracefully.<br><br>A good analogy would be from biology. I'm thinking Stephen Gould's "Full House" and his graphs of number species vs complexity. Each major extinction only seriously affected the right side of the graph i.e. the newest and most complex species of the time.<br><br><a href=#c823775340666373636 title="comment permalink">12/3/14, 10:10 PM</a><br><br>

I have my own guess, but we'll see. <br><br>Kutamun, GPS satellites don't have a very long lifespan in orbit, so their usefulness as a theological resource for the future will probably be limited. As for ancient technologies, curiously enough, I'm working on a book on one of those; the thing that makes it intriguing is that, because it doesn't look like anything we'd consider a technology, only a few eccentric researchers have noticed that it used to function as one, and still does where people remember the trick. <br><br>Ivar, you're welcome and thank you!<br><br>Junto, that doesn't surprise me in the least.

To my mind, their dependence on complex computer technology makes their entire project unlikely to accomplish much. Why not instead go to tools that can be built using noncybernetic means, and rely on the one form of computing technology we've all got readily available -- the kind between the roof of your mouth and your scalp? <br><br>William, thank you.

It.</b> It's fascinating how frantically people try to come up with something that will do us in, other than the things that we're doing that are well on their way to accomplishing that!<br><br>Gwaiharad, this is why I've been saying all along that radio communications are probably going to make it. Cell phones per se probably won't be viable, due as much to the economic burden of trying to maintain that complex a technology, but radio? Easily done. For decades before the introduction of cell phones, a much simpler and more robust network of 2 meter FM transceivers and repeaters offered much the same service to amateur radio operators over most of the US and many other countries as well; the infrastructure's still largely in place, waiting for the next generation of radio geeks to get working with it. <br><br>Agent, that's plausible, except where (a) all available options require a bottleneck resource that isn't available, (b) the collapse of a complex technology removes any value from other technological suites, or (c) the knowledge base needed to downshift to a simpler technology isn't there any more. It's these three factors, and others like them, that make me think that even a relatively slow contraction will see a lot of sudden technological discontinuities -- and yes, air travel is a good example of one of those looking for a spot marked X.<br><br><a href=#c5206411295891091478 title="comment permalink">12/3/14, 10:45 PM</a><br><br>

In addition of the many and relatively well know complexities in the manufacturing process itself, the industry has to deal with the economic realities of being a relatively obscure step in long supply changes.<br><br>Back during the 2008-2009 crisis, I was working for a big semiconductor company. It shredded more than 20% of its work force in a little more than one year, and those of us who remained had to take one week of unpaid vacation per quarter to avoid further layoffs.<br><br>The reason: Our customers were handling the reduction of consumer demand by decreasing their inventories even more aggressively. This caused that even a mild slow down in the sales of products using our components resulted in several rounds of drastic reduction of orders for said products, followed by urgent orders to correct each overreaction. <br><br>What's more. The impression I got from talking to our suppliers was that we were pulling the same trick on them, so they were even worse off than us. By example, it was virtually impossible to have prompt support from the vendors who made the machinery used in semiconductor manufacturing, because people with key knowledge had either been laid off or sent on unpaid vacations themselves (one week per month, I was told once).<br><br>By the time I left in 2011, we were a team of 14 people doing the (most urgent subset of the) work which had kept busy a group of 30 at the first half of 2008. From those of us who left voluntarily, only about half of the positions were filled again, so even if the economy was now "recovering" the company did not seem interested in regain it's former capabilities.<br><br><a href=#c4236797362464510809 title="comment permalink">12/3/14, 11:51 PM</a><br><br>

Like us, the Romans stored all their books on paper. But during the fall of Rome, 95% of all Latin and Greek literature was destroyed. The reason Latin has such a reputation for preserving "classics" is because medieval Christian and Muslim scholars only preserved the most valuable works: the wizard-like engineering of Archimedes, the history of Livy, the philosophy of Plato and Augustine, the rhetoric of Cicero, and the poetry of Homer. But how about the other 95%? We only know snippets of it due to some freak accidents of history. <br><br>For example, Euripides is known to us from ten plays, called the "select plays", which show a master at his best. Scholars might have assumed he wrote only ten plays, if this were all they had to go on. But in fact we also have some other plays which are not so good and all start with the letters E through K, obvious evidence that they at one time were a single volume of the Complete Works of Euripides. From the size of the volume, we can guess that he may have written as many as ninety plays which were mostly uninteresting to people of later generations. There must have been hundreds of playwrights like this whose work received a Complete Works edition but was later found useless and turned into scrap. Christian works did not fare much better; there is a letter of Clement, the Church father, that only happened to survive because it was used to wrap a fish and handed to an Italian university student at a medieval market.<br><br>At some point during the long descent I am guessing that a lot of books will make the transition from "cheap and useful" to "useful but too expensive," or even eventually "expensive and useless." If a cold Viking in December happens to spot an academic study of the pamphlets of Revolutionary France, it may be more useful to him as a way to keep warm than as unique historic information. Now imagine millions of such people, defining a new cultural norm. Now imagine millions of priceless books in the tropics rotting away quickly without air conditioning (this already happens in India all the time). By the time some people want to save books again, they may have a job similar to the German archivists of the 17th and 18th centuries, reassembling minor works 1500 years after anyone cared-- a very long time for paper, and even longer for CDs and DVDs, which tend to rot after a couple of decades. It is not too hard to imagine a future where James Joyce is known principally from a summary of "Dubliners" found in a Second Religiousness writer's retrospective on Western culture (itself extant only in quotations by later writers), and secondarily in a dozen hand-copied, fragmentary pages of nonsense called "Finnegans Wake Part 7," buried in a cave around 2200 AD, attribution dubious.<br><br>If you want to write books that will last, it might be appealing to write book that people will need in the near future, like green wizardry. But history shows that the best thing to write is a classic. :)<br><br><a href=#c1341896652511252179 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 12:32 AM</a><br><br>

Criminal immigrants? Racism! Decreasing wages for workers in favour of increasing income for managers? Social envy! Rising unemployment? Laziness! And last but not least: Peak oil? Just a lie!<br><br><br>As for technology - funny that you mention video games. I used to play them a lot on my PC in younger days, but I've lost interest in that. It is always the same, just with better graphics. The only games I regularly still play on my PC are classics like chess and backgammon. Funny that you mention cellphones; I stopped one step later than you, not owning a smartphone but a classic cellphone. However, I usually leave it at home and take it only with me if I anticipate concrete use, e.g. when travelling long distances by train for announcing whether I'll be late - trains are not reliable here.<br><br>I've finished a little technology project, half-serious and half-parody in nature. It is a low-tech tablet. Basically, a wooden picture frame with glass cover containing a printout of my training exercises. On training days, I use little wooden pieces to mark what exercises I'm done with. Plus an hourglass (with sand) for the pauses between the sets. That's a training app and a timer app. Someone called it a "Flintstone tablet" - nice expression. (: However, it does have a serious purpose, and that's showing the use of low-tech to people used to indulgence in high-tech. I've noticed that people tend to resist less if you introduce new thoughts in a funny way.<br><br>And it lines up nicely with my calligraphy nib in steel plus inkpod, my slide rules and my DIY abacus plus the DIY logarithm table. All of them will clearly belong to category A one day. That is, after the more powerful tools like computers will have broken down and gone out of mass use because their support chain is not sustainable.<br><br><br>As for the medical system.. it's many, many years since that an old man in my family got seriously ill. The emergency doctor who had been called came up with the right diagnosis and concluded correctly that the man had to be operated on immediately, or else he would die within one or two days. The man refused to go to the hospital. The doctor insisted that this was the only option, thinking that his patient hadn't understood the matter.<br><br>But no, he was well clear about what was going on and told the doctor that he had had a good and long life (he was in his mid-80s then), that he had been smoking all his life, that he had smoker's legs and heart problems anyway, that his overall condition wasn't good. He said that if he went to the hospital, he would never get out alife. Therefore, his days were over anyway, beyond his choice. But he still had one choice left, and that was where to die. His decision then was to stay at home and die at peace. So he thanked the doctor for his effort, but asked him to leave.<br><br>Back then, I was too young to understand his choice. Now I do, especially since I've seen others in such a sitation making the error of choosing the other option; and I know he was a wise man. Even more since he wasn't into religion, so no support from this side for facing his death. No philosophy or so either. Just a simple and still great man. Should such a day come to me, I hope I will be able to match his example.<br><br>That is a skill which isn't too widespread now but clearly should be in category A - the art of dying well - not to be confused with "despair"! It is useful, and since dying in itself will always be affordable, this conclusion seems logical. But I guess that's already touching the sphere of your other blog, isn't it?<br><br><a href=#c3670095455003434990 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 6:17 AM</a><br><br>

The ability of the population to comprehend what is behind the interface technologies has rapidly faded, to the point that few understand much about how something like a smart phone works. Indeed the complexity is so high, in turn requiring such a high degree of specialization, that few who work on these things understand the big picture. <br><br>Further, some of our most complex technology suites and implemented infrastructure are now quite old, enough so that they have been inherited by new generations of people with different skills and training from those who designed and built them. The centralized electric power grid is an example of this, and I don't think of it much differently from those old Roman aqueducts still in use long after those who designed and built them were gone. These days the skill sets of those running it are more likely to be things like IT and network security as opposed to electrical engineering with a focus on 3-phase power systems. It is not a binary condition of course, but there are fewer who understand the fundamentals of the functioning of the power system. Then too there is the general hollowing out of the organizations that run it layered on top. <br><br>So you get things like the Smart Grid, which at its core means that since we cannot afford to increase the capacity of the system, we will instead layer on a high speed control system to allow us to push the old system to a greater percentage of its capacity for a greater percentage of time. The results will be predictable, if in fact we can even afford to implement it. I guess you could say we have a general bottleneck that affects all technology suites – human skills and training.<br><br><a href=#c5036995837008861920 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 6:29 AM</a><br><br>

Heidegger was one of the first and most cogent critics of industrial-technological society and his "Question Concerning Technology" is well worth a gander. (It is also among the most readable of his works, small comfort though that might be... ).<br><br>Heidegger correctly noted that "technology" is just one way you can engage with the world. Many of his followers, and even more of his detractors, have used this to create a false dichotomy between "science" (good/bad) and "religion" (bad/good). In actuality each of these ways are useful in their own sphere but less so in others. (Heidegger particularly cautioned against technology's tendency to reduce humanity to its use-value ala Marxism and Capitalism, its contemporary Dual Contending Heads).<br><br><a href=#c880293077236423863 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 6:36 AM</a><br><br>

Only in urban areas are we possibly going to see pavements that make bicycle technologies practical. In those same urban areas, manure is a problem: lots of horses in a city will generate more than the city can consume, even positing intensive urban gardening. Manure is a health problem and a practical obstacle for getting around in the street. There's plenty of incentive to use bicycles, if you can. <br><br>In urban settings, bicycles can move individuals and light cargo very efficiently. They are much safer than horses and wagons, and crowd the streets far less for a given amount of traffic. And, on the other side, bicycling is far quicker and easier than walking for distances exceeding a few blocks. This is especially true for cargo-capable bikes.<br><br>Deindustrial rural areas, by contrast, will never sustain paved roads such as we see today. To those who proudly argue that they have ridden their mountain bikes on gravel/dirt roads for miles and miles, I reply, well yes. Kudos. But I'm gonna ride a horse. Deindustrial bikes, even the best, will be heavier and less mechanically efficient than today's $2500 mountain bikes. And I'd rather arrive with some energy left.<br><br>And, of course, in rural areas, manure is a treasure not a burden, as long as you don't pack your animals too closely.<br><br><a href=#c2387247778732428105 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 6:37 AM</a><br><br>

I have been trying to predict the future for approximately 100,000 man-hours, and I ain't succeeded yet. When I was a kid, I thought the future would be like my Astroboy and Jetsons cartoons. When I went to CWRU in the Seventies I thought it would be like whatever the future predicted in my most recently read Futurology book was. I now think of us at the head of a river delta, with countless distributeries ahead of us, some sizable streams, some fine threads. I will try to focus on the distributery depicted here, and not contradict you too much (there is one website I follow which projects a World War between the West and a Sunni-Sino alliance in the very near future, killing half the human race, followed by a hyper intelligent AI driven Singularity transforming the world beyond recognition in the 2030's. He makes a good case, just as you do. I have learned that disputing his scenario is a quick way to basically get called stupid).<br>I think what will be preserved in a coming Dark Age depends on whether it is what I would call a Technology or a Trick (let me know if you have your own terms). <br>A Technology is something that requires such a level of infrastructure and resources that it could not exist without them, and could not have been invented any earlier...for example, a Hydrogen Bomb. If we had gone back to WWI and given the US blueprints for the H-Bomb to win the war, I humbly submit that they wouldn't have a prayer.<br>A Trick is something that could have been invented centuries earlier. An example is mentioned in a recent Analog magazine...any ancient civilization that could make jewelry could have made a radio, if they just knew how.<br>Musical CDs are almost certainly Technology, musical notation, pace Saint Isidore of Seville, is a Trick.<br>As for my own interests, the Furry subculture should survive...Beast Tales were so popular in the Middle Ages that the French word for "fox" is "renard", which is like us calling hedgehogs "sonics" (which, with the Robin Hood archetype of the cartoons and comics, is something we just might do in a few centuries). Science fiction may survive as post-modern Fairy Tales, or perhaps we will go to Fantasy in a ex-Industrial World (LOTR is likely going to be the most famous 20th century story in 2500). The moveable type printing press is 15th Century technology (or 13th if you count the Goryeo Dynasty) so an individual volume should not represent a man's Lifework. I hope we can keep at least 1% of all the books of the Industrial Age available in a few libraries at least...we will have to see.<br>I also like to collect tchotchkes (baubles or trinkets), such as paper money, water globes or lenticular prints. These are cheap, and they might be in what the Renaissance called "Cabinets of Curiosities" (I think snow globes are a Trick, lenticular printing is a Trick but I don't know if plastic lenses need industrial infrastructure, and paper money would likely be replaces by postcard type cards for local fairs and towns...although Medieval China had paper money).<br><br><a href=#c5310965453756941333 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 6:41 AM</a><br><br>

That is slow, frustrating work with its share of slumps, regressions, and the occasional tumble off the wagon, but I’m trudging along. I’ve tended to think about the tinkering and inventing as the next step. To draw on the “wizardry” parallels in Green Wizardry, giving things up would be the daily meditation, learning basic life skills would be the core ritual practice, and tinkering with technologies that seem worth preserving would be the more advanced workings that aren’t much use without a firm foundation.

How should I organize my work for the time when electricity is intermittent? What tools and skills do I need to acquire for the day when electrical power is no longer available?

I remember when my parents bought one, thinking how much less effort it would take to open cans. I always found them cumbersome to use (and as often as not, they didn't work--that is, they didn't fully open the can) and opted to buy a hand-held and hand-operated can opener as soon as I was on my own. I suppose these devices might be helpful to people with severely arthritic hands or similar disability, but otherwise I never saw much point in them.<br><br>(We could, I suppose, talk about the technology suite behind the need for can openers of any kind--the stream of technology that makes commercial food canning possible.)<br><br>The Amish, of course, are commonly labeled "anti-technology" by outsiders, but this actually isn't true. On the contrary, they simply have decided as a community not to accept a new technology just because it exists and is affordable. Rather, they evaluate each technology according, especially, to how its adoption and use might affect the community. They rejected private automobiles, as a well-known example, because they perceived their use to be harmful to community. (I find it hard to argue with that assessment--our wholesale adoption of automotive transport seems indeed to have caused harm to our communities.) On the other hand, Barbara Kingsolver, in her book <i>Animal, Vegetable, Miracle</i>, reports that Amish farmers adopted automated milking technology because they determined that the amount of time and labor saved over hand-milking each cow would produce a benefit to the community.<br><br><a href=#c6677068779755006951 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 7:22 AM</a><br><br>

( As many others did not. Specific solutions are in my opinion, a lot harder than speculation and commentary on the ideas of others). As your post now points out, I quickly started realizing that in order to use solar heat to maintain the ability to smelt metals and do other high temp material processing, there were many other technologies that got dragged in to the description. That is part of the reason I did not finish the exercise. John Muir's quote- “When one tugs at a single thing in nature, he finds it attached to the rest of the world" applies equally well to the technology ecosystem. I think another parameter to consider in deciding where to place our bets on technology is time scale. Some technology might prove quite useful, and worth the investment of energy for the next couple centuries of cannibalizing our artifacts for better use, but long term, the basics of working within the limitations of the carrying capacity of the soil,sunlight, and local biome will become more preeminent. We will need to do both, but with the understanding that some will be transitional and temporary.<br><br><a href=#c1622169913269361045 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 7:58 AM</a><br><br>

Flint arrowheads are technology. <br><br>Cameras existed through the middle ages, as a "Camera Obscura", even without a lens. What they lacked was film. But never fear, "film" is nothing more than a plate of silver that oxidizes more rapidly when exposed to light. That we got. <br><br>Back to Steampunk and Victoria, the Telegraph was digital. We went backwards (in our terms) by "advancing" to the analog telephone. Now we're back to digital, with the very same telegraph, only with phenomenally faster switching. Point is that radio, which can be created at home with copper wire, can be used to transmit digital (or analog). Text messages, no problem. Therefore IRC, even BB groups printed on ticker tape, no problem. <br><br>As there is a steam engine for work, there is also an old air conditioner called an "Icyball" which uses a fire under a sealed metal ball of ammonia--all perfectly attainable, even to Greece or Rome. <br><br>Similarly, the mathematics possible with slide rules, abacus, and clockwork is extraordinary and attainable even with wooden gears. Don't sell humans short. These are more than adequate for almost all math. The only reason to have better adding machines is for computers, which only use the underlying math to accomplish communication and modelling tasks that have nothing to do with math itself. With Babbage's Difference Engine, we could calculate well enough to travel to the moon. Except niche areas, we instead use it to send pictures of cats playing piano--not a core cultural need.<br><br>The main thing that recurs in all these arguments, like the Icyball, is whether you WANT this function. For instance: having poisoned most of the earth, we farm mussels (or fish) using aquaponics to propagate the larva which have to parasite the gills of fish before settling down and being seeded on mussel ropes by fishermen on diesel boats. Primitives CAN row out and do this, just as they COULD have ground a shoulder roast into hamburger in a few hours with a mortar and pestle, but wouldn't it be far EASIER to just stop polluting and let nature grow your mussels and dig them out of the sand by the hundredweight for free? <br><br>And "Easier" is a way of suggesting the Energy, EIEIO equation all life instinctively has. Wouldn't it be easier just to build a house on the river, or like a Hacienda, than cut firewood for an icyball? Or steam engine? Because Nature runs itself, on her own energy, with $multi-trillion$ in net benefit compared to humans performing all functions themselves. Cleaning the air, water, moving weights, refreshing soils, everything. <br><br>This is why Native cultures were prosperous. They didn't have to DO things, but let nature do it for them with careful culture, then just go out and collect the year-round bounty; a technology which is recorded in books, never implimented. <br><br>There's more to technology and culture than circuits and gears.<br><br><a href=#c1691808685989630493 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 8:02 AM</a><br><br>

Expecting a machine operator to spend an hour making e.g. a tractor wheel mount using a non-computer-controlled metal cutting machine (such as by controlling the machine by guiding a stylus on a template, or by skilled eye and hand) is unrealistic when that hour instead could be used at some other task to earn enough money to buy four wheel mounts from an overseas foundry. That would undermine OSE's goal of distributing productive power. The digital control allows the operator to spend a few minutes setting up the cut and then turn to other tasks while the machine takes the hour to finish on its own.<br><br>By the time the digital components become unavailable, so (in all likelihood) will the cheap alternate sources of the end product. At that point the machine can be modified to operate by hand or stylus-and-template instead.

In my home county we have this... er, let's call it "community workshop", I have no better translation for it. It is medium-sized workshop renting space from government-owned building. Appropriate trade unions (steel and construction worker's unions mainly) are funding it, and altruistic companies from said trades have donated old machine tools like lathes, oxygen cutting tools etc. to it.<br><br>These machines are really old, some of them are from 50's and having stamps " made in DDR/Czechoslovakia/USSR". You get the picture. OLD STUFF. Still they are solid pieces, big and strong, parts are mainly shaped from solid steel in lathe, no thin injury-prone sheet metal there. They are made to last, with proper maintenance they have long work-lives ahead. No fancy NC-technology there, but old hand-based tuning systems.<br><br>Idea of the workshop is that people pay small membership fee, after which they are allowed to do their own projects with machines after proper introduction to them. There is reservation calendar, and everybody have to leave machine spotless and clean after their reservation or face penalties or expulsion. <br><br>Surprise has been how hard it was to find old-timers who actually has practical knowledge concerning said machine tools; who actually know how to use them in practice, not in the paper only. Problem has been solved and knowledge passed on, but it was real-life example how easy it is to lost deeper knowledge about how something actually functions in industrial society.

I am hearing—often from other “greens”-- that if you can’t do EVERYTHING and thus ELIMINATE your carbon footprint then your efforts to reduce it are rendered meaningless by your hypocrisy, and are therefore not worth doing. A handy excuse for doing nothing. (For what it’s worth, I keep doing it anyway.) <br><br>Likewise, it’s so much easier for us to dismiss you as a neo-Luddite than to consider that your lack of a cell phone might be the result of a conscious decision based on clear reasoning and practical considerations, rather than strictly philosophical ones, and that maybe we should start thinking like that too. It’s too uncomfortable for those of us enthralled by the latest and greatest little gadgets, or the prospect of a colony on Mars, or the idea that geoengineering will save us all, to consider the actions of those who reject such values as being anything other than “quaint.” After all, if we had to admit that you might be onto something, then we might have to turn off the TV and do something different. And that would be hard work.<br><br><br>My family and I are smack in the middle of that “do something different.” My husband, who runs an “alternative energy” company, is finally tired of being handed weekly ADRs, Daily Impacts, books like Klein’s “This Changes Everything.” He’s tired of being buffeted by so many factors outside his control—the price of gas, the prospect of a shale bubble, the lack of sustained public investment in renewables, the deep pockets of the fossil fuel industry. He’s tired of letting me have all the fun of trying to raise a family on nothing (since so much of his “pay” gets “reinvested”), and managing the farm all by myself. So today he decided it’s time to get out, and do something different. This is likely to result in something that looks like catastrophe (in a 1st world sense) to our peers and families: bankruptcy, or foreclosure—a short sale at best. It will mean renting instead of owning, living with one car or none, and giving up what little is left of conventional “comforts”, like cable-based internet. Sounds bad, right? Well I couldn’t be happier. The kids? Well, they’ll come around. Collapse now and avoid the rush, eh?<br><br><br>Ultimately I think we’ve been practicing your skills of analysis and triage on a very personal basis for some time. Now I guess we’re onto the salvage part, and I for one am looking forward to what we might create out of what is left. <br><br><br>Incidentally, your mention of Bush’s famous “they hate us for our freedoms” quote reminds me of a recent radio show I heard on Alternative Radio. Surgeon and author Chris Giannou, born in Canada to Greek parents, trained in medicine in Egypt and for years a surgeon with the International Red Cross in war zones around the planet, paraphrased that same line “they hate us for our values,” and then added that in fact people in the Middle East “love you for your values. They hate you for your hypocrisy, because you do not live up to your values. The vast majority of the American public has absolutely no idea of what their government does in their names around the world.” He goes on to enumerate all of the specific grievances the people of the Middle East have against the West, and says, about like you do, that their animosity is based on specific actions, not abstractions, whatever our leaders may tell us. Anyway, you or other commenters might find it worth a listen. http://www.alternativeradio.org/collections/spk_chris-giannou <br><br>Kathleen<br><br><a href=#c2614089400783775241 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 11:26 AM</a><br><br>

A bit off-topic but it fits your pattern, that the "rising spiral of problems" is met by insistence that "the problems don't exist and denouncing those who demur". <br><br>This week I have read and heard to my face, several examples where white people try to make the case to me that the rising protests in Fergusen and now NYC are completely off-base, and justice and the law is obviously on the side of the police officers who killed these black persons during the course of their duties. When it's a personal friend saying this to my face, I try to explain, "You don't have to make the case to _<b><i>ME</i></b>_, I'm white and I'm not out there protesting. You have to make the case to _<b><i>THEM</i></b>_, that a pattern of beatings and shootings against unarmed members of their local population which have been going on for decades or centuries by authority figures is merely well-deserved justice." The conversation usually stops right there.<br><br>Who was it who said "When faced with the choice between changing yourself, and proving there is no need to do so, most people get busy on the proof"? Historically, it is so very much more comforting to just sit back in your gated castle and tell yourself the barbarians are crazy and will go away soon. Unfortunately that doesn't stop the barbarian hordes from storming your gates. <br><br>A month ago I would have given more credence to your Ebola prediction, than your prediction that the unrest in Fergusen might continue and expand into a broader protest against the system itself.

Yes, that's very much what's going on at this point -- the idolization of science and technology is a poster child for the effect Toynbee discussed. <br><br>Avery, this is one of the reasons I'm interested in seeing letterpress technology make it through the current decline.

It's interesting, to use no stronger word, that D&amp;D and so many other roleplaying games are set in an age of constant violence and warfare, with a relatively primitive technology confronted by ancient artifacts no one understands any more -- a world, that is, like the one our descendants will inhabit. <br><br>Jonathan, I'm not sure I'd agree. Economics is simply a game played with arbitrary tokens, and if one set of tokens stops working, another can be cobbled together in fairly short order. It's the decline in real wealth -- energy resources, etc. -- that I think will turn out to be critical. <br><br>Edde, rail will only be an option in those regions that have a fairly resilient rail system now. The United States is not one of those regions, and at this point the window of opportunity to change that has probably closed. <br><br>Daelach, your low-tech tablet is brilliant -- I hope it catches on. As for the art of dying well, and neither too early nor too late -- well, yes; that's as important as anything else a human being can learn.

They both passed away in the 70s, but I think they would have found the current crop of "must haves" amusing.<br><br>After my mom's death, I had to fend for myself at the age of 18. Because I couldn't afford much, I quickly learned how to do without. I recall the dismay from some friends when I told them I washed dishes by hand and hung my clothes up to dry. They thought I was so deprived! Like you, I still do not own a cell phone. My friends marveled when I finally broke down and got a Hotmail account. <br><br>I work at a flower shop, and I'm still amazed when I meet people who can't read a roadmap. They rely slavishly on GPS, and flounder helplessly when it (regularly) gives them false directions. Our shop is on a main road, clearly marked, in the same location for 50+ years, yet some people cannot locate our address without calling on their cell phones, and getting detailed, blow by blow instructions from me. I like to joke, "Smart phone, dumb person." Unkind, I know, since they have never had to learn to navigate on their own.<br><br>So much technology today is the "black box" variety, with little outward clue as to how it works. I joke that such devices are powered by black magic and voodoo. I could understand how a car engine from prior to about 1985 worked. I actually, with almost no practical experience, just reading, fixed a parted accelerator cable on a Ford Aerostar, using only the spring from a ball point pen. I was inordinately proud of that. But a modern car, with all the electronics? I may as well wave a rattle at it.<br><br><a href=#c424993198589303081 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 1:43 PM</a><br><br>

And then, while on a trip in the Tetons I learned that on Grand Teton there was a circle of black stones had been discovered by one of the first climbing parties exploring the route that would eventually take the name of Owen-Spalding. <br><br>A circle of stones placed carefully--perhaps ritualistically--in one of the most daunting locations in the world. It was like a spell had been broken. The circle of stones (though I never saw them and I'm not sure if they are still there) seemed to show that life was still possible (perhaps better, even!), that the passion and devotion I felt for this activity, this ritual, were still possible, and, in fact, took on more humane and humbling contours in this previous iteration. <br><br>And so, I believe, it will go with many things.<br><br><a href=#c3339553919006740658 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 2:14 PM</a><br><br>

Very generic but yet highly illustrative. I came close to this when giving talks on the topic but I hadn't thought of just visually moving the borders. It is great because I can see an important part of the relevant audience grok this in seconds. I just don't like the letter designations. I suggest animals or products help with talking about it. <br>I wasn't very happy with the post and discussion of last week, although I was mostly in agreement on the main drivers and likely consequences - so I guess that makes it academic...<br><br>I think it may be useful to consider this whole development not "at thermodynamic (or social) equilibrium", but with many of the dark age factors sketched out by JMG making it very "kinetic" at times. It is not unlikely if you stumble into this blindly you will end up in a very small local optimum in the desert.<br>Also once a different paradigm is accepted things become extremely political as resource bases for any planning period tighten. The definition of utility will become particularly difficult/contested (also when mating behavior comes into play...). Ripples of uncertainty may knock over many techs or forestall investment, on the other hand price spikes may attract investment if the customer has deep enough pockets not to go broke directly.<br><br>I guess one could call it an industrial "revolution" in the original sense of the word. How many RPMs is that?<br><br>@Merle re Windmill power (I'll run right into it)<br>Umm... the Netherlands a good while ago? Of course not exclusively windmills but significant chunks for sure...<br><br>@Paul K. re Making the cut<br>Yeah I'd be very interested as well, also what people perceive are the most likely showstoppers for techs. I assume the ripple of uncertainty that goes through complex technical fields whenever something vaguely related goes offline for good and no one is really sure if and when this will impact their own corner of tech will cost a lot of opportunity. People may get very conservative about innovation (in many cases the adaptation that would have been necessary).<br>re Metal re-purposing: <br>If you have the space, collect aluminium cans and scraps NOW. Mold making and casting is low tech but fun and takes some practice. Watch a couple of youtube videos and download them or film them. When you need the video is when you won't get it anymore. You need hardly anything for this except the costly refined aluminium. For gardening tools it is probably second or third choice but it'll be one of the easiest ways to keep a foot in metallurgy I assume.<br>re Mining versus Salvage:<br>I believe that will depend strongly on the (paying) capita development. If it is for a tech that is perceived as necessary and people will choke up the money, mining may continue unless we get a steep enough drop in capita.<br><br>re 3D printing: <br>Here's one for ya: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9IdZ2pI5dA<br>I've talked to one of their sales people and they are acutely aware of the interdependent tech situation. I did not have the time to breach the decline aspects in our last conversation, but seeing that the person collected roman artifacts I may assume that possibility has crossed his mind once or twice after watching the news. To me it makes more sense to refer to 3D printing as an additive manufacturing tech. The computer is optional, I can do it with hot glue or toothpaste if you like. The utility of the products is not different in many of the cases. But printing a mold for my equally additive carbon or glass fiber lay-up may come in quite handy indeed. Or making spare parts you need for some of the designed to break plastic products. It is not the individual tech that makes or breaks a civilization.<br><br><a href=#c6161102914280537663 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 2:15 PM</a><br><br>

You don't need much up there in terms of raw materials and can do most of your import/export via airship on a few calm days. Until someone lays waste to your place with a large mortar. The next time you'd better produce some more optical lenses for your feudal warlord friend on the side.<br>Clean room tech may really not be so much of an issue. There wasn't really enough pressure, time, and understanding in semiconductor fabs for innovating a small footprint clean room (just think of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_Exactly! , http://www.scribd.com/doc/56719916/Intel-Copy-Exact) support tech. Small mesh filters aren't terribly complex. Low vapor pressure sticky stuff may be easy enough to source. Shave the staff, drench them in oil or something and have a look what the particle count is like. Of course it is kinda hard to copy this exactly if you source most things locally. But you have to keep in mind that the pressure to make a new product will slow down dramatically - which allows for rather different engineering.<br><br>@John D. re Open Source Ecology:<br>I've heard that some (most?) of the plans require you to ditch the metric system and most of their products, which made it a no-starter in a place in Senegal that was looking into using it. Trying not to criticize their effort but highlighting some of the complications...<br><br>re Gas turbines<br>High end designs may be pretty complex at the moment. But there's also the money to pay for it (and probably will be as long as there is a lot of gas hydrocarbons to burn). Turbines in general are not terribly new, complex, or costly. Diesels probably span a similar range in technological complexity (optimized burning, injection, etc.)<br>I have high hopes that large scale (safe) air travel may hear the shot but not the echo. They attract a lot of bright minded people that seem to lack guidance or judgement. When they talk about systems engineering they should try a wide cut-off range at times... Also if air travel/bombing goes it leaves much more utility for less forceful communication tech such as radio or glass fiber.<br><br>re Bikes and rubber:<br>I've said it before. Grow some russian dandelion for starters: http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/20/us-dandelion-rubber-idUSKBN0GK0LN20140820<br>I think they may be useful longer than 2-3 generations if there's demand in some cities. Bikes are mostly useful in a dense urban environment I'd say. Wait till the cars are gone - they'll shine. In rural areas where good surfacing is too expensive and you have long distances to go - you often have the space and feed for a horse.<br><br>@donalfagan: "Frightening stuff, but apparently the allure of new discoveries was so great some of them ignored the risks."<br>I would put this in present tense having worked in the development of new materials.<br><br><a href=#c1137776357046632844 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 2:16 PM</a><br><br>

It consists of a metal blade, a wooden handle, and a metal piece that joins the two. It relies on woodworking and metalworking machinery and skills surviving and on people who know its value preserving the knowledge of how to make and use it. How many of you have used a scythe to mow or trim, or even seen anyone using one? I had not before I bought a scythe. For me it turned out that in order to use a scythe well, I could not just read about it, I had to watch someone use it. Easy enough now via video, and in fact that is how I learned to use it. But later on, when video is no longer available because it hits its technological bottleneck first, the scythe too could be lost if knowledge of how it is used isn't passed on person to person, by someone who knows how to use it showing someone else who wants to learn. <br><br>I'm not the person to learn how to do woodworking or metalworking. On the other hand, I have learned how to use a scythe and can show other people how to do that.

I know enough tech geeks to know that, if anything, it's an understatement. <br><br>Beneath, heck of a good question. The long-term viability of cell phones depends on so many variables I'm not going to hazard a guess. <br><br>Wagelaborer, next time you take a train trip, tell the people who'll be picking you up to check the status of your train on the Amtrak website, and give 'em the train number.

My guess is that we'll see soil fertility collapse over large parts of the world, but those people and groups who invest the time into building their soil now will be able to take up at least some of the slack. <br><br>Donalfagan, thanks for the link.

Steam engines relied on plentiful coal or wood, later. Early automobiles got very poor mileage--most of the improvements in MPG are a result of computers replacing the earlier systems and of synthetic materials lighter than metal. Earlier societies denuded their forests just to run simple smelters and forges.

(Which does not mean that I discount it.).<br><br>You might want to look up the Pew Research Report, "The Rise of the Nones", which caused a lot of hearts to stop when it was released in 2013. The Religious 'Nones' are the fastest growing group in America today (without an "outreach" budget or campaign), and currently comprise 1 out of every 5 adults in the U.S. (1 out of 3 for those under 30, more than double the number of young people who self-selected as "Evangelical Christians"). The category of "Other" for Religions is now up to 6%. <br><br>Churchleadership.org reports that 1/2 of those who report themselves as Christian rarely attend church. They also report that 4,000 churches close their doors every year, while only 1,000 new churches are started.<br><br>Research by the Barna Group (a Christian organization) also highlights the decline of Biblical knowledge/views and church participation. <br><br>Yes, America will continue to be a religious country, particularly in the South, where I could forsee an eventual theocracy taking place (just my opinion, folks, so Bill, don't freak out on me....:-) But things are changing really, really fast. <br><br>I don't know that these trends are 'good' - one could easily argue that a people w/o a unifying belief system is a powder keg, but they are there, nonetheless. I personally think that the decision to mix religion and politics, starting in the 70's/80's, was a death wish (there were several prominent Christian leaders who were urging Christians not to go that route - to no avail). However, that trend shows no sign of slowing, either, so we'll probably continue to get growing fractions, with each side hardening. Sigh.<br><br>We live in interesting times.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c8190890521268007432 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 5:07 PM</a><br><br>

I might not have the time, means, or skills to go through Edison's journal and try to recreate all his inventions from scratch or do something on that scale right now. But I can get a few hobby books, start tinkering with circuits and batteries, and see where it leads.

Yes, there are those who have old copies of MS-DOS on floppy, but how many of the thousands of different software drivers for different peripherals do you have? Remember all the fun of configuring the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUTOEXEC.BAT rel=nofollow>autoexec.bat</a> and <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONFIG.SYS rel=nofollow>config.sys</a> files with <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIMEM.SYS rel=nofollow>himem.sys</a> and other programs? Those are all necessary to make those old computers run, along with all the lost documentation. You won't get one of those systems to start without a functional floppy drive and these and many more programs already on a readable floppy. Just like trying to read a 50 year-old ebook!<br><br>When I first started working with computers, in the early 1970's when I was in High School, the two types of systems I got familiar with were the Data General NOVA series and an even more “primitive” processor, the Autonetics D17B Inertial Guidance Computer from the Minuteman I missile. These had been released by the military for use by researchers. It was a simple 24-bit computer with only a 2700 word or so Hard Drive. No RAM. This was built with all discrete components, no IC's at all. In fact the logic was built using RDL (Resistor-Diode Logic) unless gain was required and then DTL (Diode-Transistor Logic) was used. This is a computer that I can see being able to dig out of a scrap pile and, with maybe just some documentation like <a href=http://www.greenwizardsradio.org/Autonetics.html rel=nofollow>this</a>, get up and running. No Internet though! And not power economic, it takes 28 Volts at 25 Amps to run it.<br><br>The Data General NOVA computers were similar, the basic model came with 4K 16-bit Core memory and was built entirely from SSI (Small Scale Integration) and MSI (Medium Scale Integration) IC's and discrete transistors. No LSI (Large Scale Integration). All schematic diagrams, truth tables and diagnostic information was provided. See <a href=http://www.greenwizardsradio.org/Data_General.html rel=nofollow>here</a>. I did much repair of CPU, Memory and Peripherals on these computers as well as designing and building custom interfaces. The CPU was built from about 200 IC's on a 15 inch square board and with the diagnostic programs, which could even be entered from the front panel switches if necessary, you would trace signals through the entire CPU with an oscilloscope until you found the bad gate. These also can be brought alive without any special software, you can enter a program on the front panel switches directly from the Programming Manual provided. Yes, you may need to find old TTL IC's to repair one, but that's easier than the special proprietary IC's in later computers that have no documentation. None of this is possible without a massive store of very special and no longer available hardware(working floppy drives anyone?) and readable software for an obsolete IBM PC Clone computer. However, even these older computers are often just as extinct as the later computers, they pretty much only exist in a few people's memories and in long-buried landfills and scrap piles.<br><br><a href=#c7266452296716971060 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 6:16 PM</a><br><br>

Be on the lookout for rolls of wire and pieces of plastic and metal tubing in your neighborhood! My preferences in actual radio equipment will seem archaic to some, I prefer the older tube and solid state radios that don't have an microprocessors in them. I like a radio that's really repairable. Yes, it's often possible to repair newer radios but there are so many obstacles compared to radios that don't have all the extraneous stuff stuck on the side of a basic superhet radio. The microprocessors add so many different loops that it's often not possible to figure out what's the actual dead part without resorting to shotgun replacing of things until you get it working.<br><br>Keeping the skills and knowledge alive for simple radios will be invaluable, it's possible to build radio receivers and transmitters from almost any scrap electronics that still contains discrete transistors. Not to mention that there are huge piles of components stored away in many people's workshops. Given that there are many companies selling surplus components by the millions to hobbyists, there is no shortage of parts for a long time into the future. <br><br>I hope that it's going to be possible to get at least a few people who are genuinely interested in Ham Radio and Green Wizardry on the air and communicating about these types of tech subjects. I have started talking with some local people about a lending library of books covering a wide variety of subjects, for years I've been collecting any how-to, gardening and “Appropriate Tech” type books that I come across, even duplicates to give to those who might need then. It would be nice if a few Green Wizards types also participated in something similar for Radio type equipment, parts and books. I have a great starter heap! I'm also on the lookout for people who want to participate in a so-called Makerspace for Appropriate Tech.<br><br>BTW, my mother only had a washing machine, never had a dryer.

I could afford all of that, but I consider these things as useless.<br><br>As for GPS - there are even dumb drivers riding their car into rivers, despite the warning traffic signs, just because their navigation system tells them to. Maybe installing the "brain 1.0 app" would be a good idea for them?!<br><br>When I was a child, I learnt how to read a map, use a compass, tell the cardinal direction by time of day and position of the sun, how to find the north star. In big cities, bus stops or metro stations usually have maps. I have even come up with the revolutionary idea of just asking a passerby!<br><br><br>@ Rita: no, modern cars are not more efficient - mainly because most of the better efficiency has gone into bigger, heavier and faster cars. Same for the electric cars which have the same range as a hundred years ago, despite modern battery systems. 20 years ago, I could drive a VW Golf 2 at 5.5l/100km (42.8 MPG), and that was with only a 4-speed gear box and petrol, not with 6-speed and diesel. Out of towns and when limiting the speed to 70km/h (44 MPH), even less than 5l/100km (48 MPG) was possible. A modern VW Polo which has about the same size as a Golf 2 from the early 1990s doesn't consume less.<br><br>So despite 20 years of engineering, I don't see progress when it comes to the mileage.<br><br>See also here:<br><br>&gt; http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2008/06/citroen-2cv.html<br><br>It gets even worse because that is just the mileage of the cars themselves. The whole electronics in modern cars takes extremely much energy in the production, plus that they cannot be recycled because the real resource killer starts in the production process, i.e. after having the raw materials available - and it is only the latter step that recycling could hope to aim at.<br><br>That is also a killer point with carbon fibre material. Unlike metal, it cannot be recycled, and even burning it is difficult because of the epoxy glue.<br><br>Maybe today in the US, people drive cars with better mileage than back then. However, that doesn't come from technical progress, but from switching to less overdimensioned cars. Of course a modern VW Polo takes less fuel than a V8 road cruiser. But a Golf from 20 years ago also.<br><br>(I'm not making VW advertisement here, these are just the cars I happen to know personally from the past and from car rental.)<br><br><br>@ JMG: Concerning computers - many of the tasks done today by computers will not make sense in a deindustrial world and with the intermediary system (e.g. administration, office, finance) drastically cut down. Plus that Roman aqueducts and European cathedrals were built without computers, as well as jet planes (e.g. the ME 262 in 1942).<br><br>I once read a study concluding that manufacturing a PC costs as much resources as producing an electronic-free car like the VW beetle from the 1950s. Maybe there will be small scale production facilities e.g. for the military, think of encryption, but by and large, no.<br><br>When resources get scarce, there is not much point in wasting them for mass production or maintainance of tools whose tasks are gone. Or for pure commodities like the internet which isn't sustainable anyway because of the resource demand of its supply chain.<br><br><a href=#c2038542872451535957 title="comment permalink">12/5/14, 4:28 AM</a><br><br>

As a musician myself, that got me thinking about what of our music could survive in future centuries due to technological constraints irrespective of popularity and interest. Up until about 1800, musical instruments were made by hand in fundamentally agrarian economies. There are still folks making violins and guitars by hand, so that's a go. Wind instruments changed considerably after 1800 -- all the 'orthodontia' added to flutes and oboes, for example, made economic by the rise of Modern Industry in the 19th century. I'm sure machining will still exist in centuries hence, but it may be more economic to go back to 'baroque flutes', and you can't play Mahler on a baroque flute. Somewhat ditto for brass -- brass generally had no valves -- slides at best -- pre-1800. Keyboard instruments like harpsichords and pianos were made by hand in low-tech shops until after 1800-ish; early pianos would have been the small low-tension instruments of Mozart's day -- nothing like the big beast modern concert grand that is completely dependent on large scale industry (start with piano wire -- high grade steel polished to eliminate surface micro-fissures, allowing the modern piano to have 200 lbs of string tension per string vs. the Mozart era piano of maybe 30 lbs). Thus, if distant future generations were so inclined, it would still be feasible build instruments to play Bach and Mozart, but Chopin and Mahler could be simply out of the question. (The knowledge of HOW to play those instruments is yet another discussion.) Electric guitars could also be problematic. Of course future generations may have little interest in playing Chopin, but this little thought experiment furthers the useful exercise of realizing how much current technology we take for granted. (BTW, piano technology is another one that's disappearing, as most folks are perfectly happy with an electronic one. So the knowledge of how tune by ear, for example, is disappearing into the aether.)<br><br><a href=#c3745751712286646249 title="comment permalink">12/5/14, 8:01 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not sure if we agree or not on how things will unwind for the simpler technologies.<br>At the risk of grossly oversimplifying the development of technologies from low to high, let me suggest the following: Generally we picked the low hanging fruit first. From there the combination of information, energy, and matter becomes increasingly rarefied and complex; typically to meet increasingly abstract and less essential desires. But the basic technologies did not disappear as the more complex ones were added. The model I'm suggesting is that of a pyramid. The most complicated tech only exists based on the continuing existence of the simple stuff. <br>I think we agree that the pyramid will lose its cap first and easily. I think we also agree that, though this will cause a lot of disruption, industrial societies will not fall apart all in one go because of it. Air travel, computers, and electronic gadgets are the last layers of complexity in industrial societies. I can see these disappearing first and very quickly along with their associated technology-specific knowledge for the reasons you gave. Fortunately, for the most part, we don't really need them.<br>The next layer of technologies down, as I see it, are the ones that we really are dependent on to meet our most basic needs in an industrial society. These are “steam engines, diesels, gasoline engines, electric generators and motors, refrigerators, pumps etc.” These all require the same basic information, stuff, and energy to make, transport, use, and maintain. These technologies often contain embodied knowledge that is easily deciphered. Unlike a computer or cell phone, open up one of these most basic machines and one can figure out how they work by just looking at them. Its not that big a step backwards to retool the numerically controlled lathes etc. to make the end product without computers or robots. <br>So the weak link in these more foundational technologies is not likely to be information (your exception (c)). By definition, low tech is simple. Its energy (and so getting the basic stuff) that is the limiting factor. We should see the large firms that produce the big stuff going bankrupt first because their profit is too unreliable and their profit margins are too thin due to (respectively) wild swings in, and gradual escalation of average, energy costs. I'm more sanguine for small machines producers but, nonetheless, eventually we'll be back to the village blacksmith with plenty of scrap metal, a steam powered generator, a basic foundry, and a lathe. If he can't make it, it won't exist. This is your squeeze into a smaller and smaller “Area A”. <br>Admittedly there is an issue of how diffuse low tech knowledge and skills are right now. None of the foregoing suggests people should not immediately get the low tech skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to make the transition more comfortable for themselves personally. There may not be any immediate concern about essential knowledge, skills, and resources disappearing completely; but everyone should be concerned if they themselves possess these now.<br><br><a href=#c2649651597299694867 title="comment permalink">12/5/14, 1:48 PM</a><br><br>

I see that your link on transistorized computers even mentions the D17B computer that I mentioned. 1521 transistors, and that does not include any memory. They used a hard drive with one head per track for the program as well as data memory. To get a decent program execution time, you had to play all sorts of tricks with the programming storage locations, you had to know the execution time of each instruction and place it on the hard drive so that it was read just as it was ready to be executed, if you just placed the instructions in sequential locations on the track, you’d have to wait a full revolution for the next instruction to be read as the processor wasn't fast enough to pick up the next sequential location. I don't think hard drives will be built by anyone in their workshops, so let’s make static RAM instead. Add 2 or 4 transistors per bit for memory if you are using flip-flops for memory (2500 words x 24 bits x 2 = 120,000+ a few more for addressing). Now how long is it going to take you to make and assemble them into a computer?<br><br>Let’s go a bit farther and see what’s needed to make a packet radio TNC as first built by TAPR in the early 1980’s. Intel 8085 processor, 16K bytes RAM, I won’t bother with the peripheral chips, only a few thousand more transistors. 8085 Processor = 6500 transistors, memory 16,384 x 8 bits x 2 transistors/memory cell = 262,144.

The plot: WWII nurse finds herself in 18C Scotland a couple of years before the Battle of Culloden. As you can imagine, she finds a lot of nursing work to do. When she returns to the 20C she retrains as a surgeon, which is handy, because when she returns to the 18C she can now do rather painful surgery. In the course of her soap-opera-worthy adventures she finds herself in America, on a homestead, doing experiments with ether and making penicillin with mouldy bread and a microsope. It was like Little House on the Prairie with modern surgery and a knowledge of germ theory. Her daughter, with a degree in engineering, was trying to make pottery plumbing pipes at the point of the series that I am up to (waiting for the next book at the library). <br>The series has been intriguing primarily in that it has prompted me to think that yes, when it comes down to it I would become resigned to living without most of my mod cons but I would be so relieved to know that my children would not die of an infection or a burst appendix.. so my vote goes to basic modern surgery and a way to treat infection (penicillin not looking so good for that any more..). Oh, and indoor plumbing is always a bonus.<br><br><a href=#c2877726599971558854 title="comment permalink">12/5/14, 5:22 PM</a><br><br>

Its the standard trade off of losing efficiency to gain resilience. <br>In my second post I used the metaphor of a pyramid. The core technologies are the base of our industrial culture. Computers, digital electronics, air travel, etc. are not nearly as essential and are far more complex and so far less resilient. I expect we will lose these first and fast. Though doing so will be very disruptive, it will not end industrial societies. On the other hand, no diesels does mean the end of industrial societies.<br>Ditto about the forests. The area where I live was deforested 150 years ago to make charcoal to run a failed iron smelter. The smelter failed because the poor quality of the ore (for the time). The issue is scale. I make charcoal from a few dead elms every year (elm is too much trouble to split for firewood or heating). My next experiment is to use it to work iron. I don't need a smelter, there is loads of old farm machinery around to get scrap iron from. In the mean time I hope to keep my core (non-computer controlled) technologies of chainsaw, truck &amp; car, wood splitter, and rototiller running for as long as I can. <br>You are also right about simple tech not making the cut due to the cost of production. Here I suspect scale will also play a dominant role in sorting out what we lose first. I don't have a full cogent argument, but my guess is we will lose the large machines first as economies of scale work in reverse on the downside.<br>But just to be clear, computers and their like generally have very short lives by design. A simple small diesel farm tractor (with some maintenance) can last longer than many of us … also by design. This is typical of core technologies. Because they are so essential, if you design it to fail early, you go out of business fast. (No so for the more trivial parts of our economies.) These machines are so necessary to our way of life that there is a much stronger market for them in the long run. Still they too will fail as you suggested, but later and I suspect (for small engines especially) more slowly<br><br><a href=#c8865348309427305230 title="comment permalink">12/5/14, 6:48 PM</a><br><br>

Thought it's time to introduce myself since this topic of technology is one of interest for me.<br>I am an Indonesian and currently works as a software developer in Singapore after graduating from a university in Singapore. I think those facts alone should place me as a minority among your readers.<br><br>I'd like to offer my opinion as a member of the startup community on new "technologies". I personally think that the utility of many new startups (both Silicon Valley or local) has been pretty marginal lately. For example, Alfred (TechCrunch Disrupt 2014 winner) is simply an internet version of a maid/butler services. I see it as yet another way to make people work for less than minimum wage level in the same vein as TaskRabbits or Uber in the increasingly "crapified" economy (as Yves Smith from Naked Capitalism) put it. <br><br>Another major development is in the data-mining discipline. The essence of data-mining is to discover hidden correlation between variables. I have friends working day and night to discover the next Amazon suggestion algorithm for their Information System PhD. I see this development as another technology to support more advertisement/marketing. There might be some merit for suggestion algorithm that leads us to new and useful related information, but this can be achieved with a "low-tech" solution by forming an interest club in your community. I think we have forgotten how to "share" knowledge without internet.<br><br>I would actually put many of these "new and cool" ideas in box D, given their marginal utility and high cost. I have a few questions to ask you and the community here:<br><br>1) What is your view on the sustainability of a city-state country like Singapore and their fate during the period of decline? There is certainly not enough arable land to feed the 5-6 millions soul in the city. Will those states dissolve given their primary role as an intermediate hub in the global economy (providing administrative/business services and logistics hub)?<br><br>2) What is your advice for people who are living in metropolitan cities? For people living in the cities, technology is at the center of their life. What can they do to start preparing for the decline? Many of the skills taught (and valued) here (in Singapore) are intermediary skills: management, accounting, law, etc.<br><br><a href=#c6847311301153257361 title="comment permalink">12/5/14, 7:55 PM</a><br><br>

I doubt if even a village working alone would be able to do it. <br><br>Most probably it would require the effort of a town or city to do it that too by collaborating with other cities. The clean room required to prepare even semi pure silicon wafers alone is a very challenging task and if someone wishes to build a gemanium diode like the one built by Shockley and Bardeen, it would be very hard to source a semi-pure germanium ingot.<br><br>The point of my vid was that it does not take billions of dollars to make transistors just because today's fabs require billions of dollars to run. The fabs we have today manufacture transistors at nano meter scale, they do it because the economy demands that, if someone wanted to setup a fab that built transistors at millimeter or centimeter scale it would be very cheap and very much doable with probably 1/100th of the resources.<br><br>Moreover there are billions of individual transistors manufactured today and they don't decay so easily if stored properly, it's more than likely that people wouldn't even need to manufacture their own transistors anytime soon, the mountains of e-waste lying around guarantees cheap electronic components for generations. People would also be very careful with how they use their electronic stuff when the economy isn't doing so good, I am sure you are familiar with TV's running for 20 years or more.<br><br><a href=#c801060031948030302 title="comment permalink">12/5/14, 9:04 PM</a><br><br>

That is a surprisingly hard job to do as very little materials sticks to that particular plastic other than itself.<br><br>Anyway, the 3D printing device comes in a flat pack form and takes upwards of 5 days to assemble (I'm unsure whether they were joking around, but they looked serious and matter of fact).<br><br>The small object that they'd printed as a demonstration which was about 2 inches by 2 inches with a funky twisting shape - but otherwise completely useless - took 3 days to manufacture on the printer from start to finish.<br><br>Now call me a luddite, but 3 days to print some bit of rubbish that I could have whittled out of a wood block with a sharp knife in an hour or so, seems excessive at best. <br><br>The 3D printers churn out plastics too, not high temperature metals - which would actually be reasonably useful.<br><br>I don't know much, but I wouldn't want to bet the farm on those toys making any practical contribution to the future.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c6526439176719209272 title="comment permalink">12/6/14, 2:29 AM</a><br><br>

This Dark Age series is shaping up to be amongst your best works.<br><br>I want to chime in on the case of horses v. bicycles. I think right now we fail to take into account where the horse lies on that graph right now, and in the immediate future. To whit-- most horses are toys. Expensive toys. I've heard that already the horse population has begun to drop in the face of rising expenses, as many animals become luxuries the middle classes cannot afford to keep; moving into quadrant D, since they don't actually have any use for the animals.<br><br>There are enough far-sighted horse lovers that I don't have any worry we'll lose more than a few good breeds, but! It's going to make for a mean shortage of horseflesh in the near term, I suspect. <br><br>What will compound that shortage of horseflesh is a serious reduction in fertility --remember that huge swaths of our continent are totally leached of fertility, kept in production only by massive applications of artificial fertilizers. Extra land to feed the horses is a luxury I fear we won't have until the human population is out of overshoot. <br><br>Given that, and the plentiful supply of old bicycles and scrap that can be made into bicycles, I suspect that in the short term at least, the bike will be king. I even suspect that for a brief window, pedal-tractors like this one http://www.notechmagazine.com/2013/02/the-culticycle-a-pedal-powered-tractor.html will be more common in rural areas than horse-drawn equipment.<br><br>In the end, of course, horses breed, and populations align with resources, so that window will close and the bicycle will most likely be pushed off the farm to more suitable occupations. That's my guess, anyway. Only time will tell.<br><br><a href=#c4033642262928703007 title="comment permalink">12/6/14, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

People feel joy, as opposed to mere pleasure, to the extent that their activities are creative; while the growth of tools beyond a certain point increases regimentation, dependence, exploitation, and impotence."<br><br>He focuses considerably on the way medicine takes over self-care, and eventually starts creating disease (he opens the book with this example, calling the former The First Watershed, roughly around 1913, and the latter The Second Watershed, roughly around 1955); but also considers education, which in much the same way takes over self-learning (first watershed), and then the institution of education actively begins serving its own interests first and treating the problems it creates with yet more of the same prescriptions - more "standardization" is the word du jour (second watershed). <br><br>Illich also describes how automobiles become a "radical monopoly" - not just a monopoly of ownership but a monopoly that practically compels people's participation, or marginalizes them.<br><br>Notably, Illich, like many others, seems not to see the self-terminating nature of the industrial civilization. He also seems to dream of designing society a little bit - as per many of his class and his education (ironically).<br><br>He gets at the core of the industrial civilization's degenerate status: everything is about "having." Real communion among many people except in almost secretive intimacy is such a distant and unimaginable state of being... people literally can't imagine what they're missing, buried under all this junk.<br><br>Notably, radio would be a very convivial tool. But really, I think most of the technologies just kind of fade in importance beyond the centrality of hopefully recovering or re-learning how people will need to rely on each other and work together in joy.<br><br><a href=#c2458982014264105055 title="comment permalink">12/6/14, 1:03 PM</a><br><br>

Science is now used to label a spectral production agency which turns out better knowledge just as medicine produces better health. The damage done by this misunderstanding about the nature of knowledge is even more fundamental than the damage done to the conceptions of health, education, or mobility by their identification with institutional outputs. False expectations<br>of better health corrupt society, but they do so in only one particular sense. They foster a declining concern with healthful environments, healthy life styles, and competence in the personal care of one's neighbor. Deceptions about health are circumstantial. The institutionalization of knowledge leads to a more general and degrading delusion. It makes people dependent on having their knowledge produced for them.

Of course it didn’t happen, and such fantasies about living in comfortable stability are part of human nature (think Garden of Eden), as are Utopian fantasies.

My impression is that while those in the collapse-aware communities discuss food and shelter quite frequently, not much is said about clothing. With regard to your exposition this week on technology and its limitations given its utility vs. its cost and our looming inability to pay for some of those costs, be they in tokens or availability of resources, I wonder how clothing, one of the apparent absolute necessities, fits into the picture. <br>Granted, clothing is relatively cheap and abundantly available currently, but some of that availability has to do with transportation and ability to ship large quantities over long distances, not to mention cheap and abundant labor (overseas), machinery, and raw materials, both animal- and plant-based. Clothing, including shoes and warm outerwear, might not be so readily available in the future with a decline in transportation and cheap labor. Who knows how to make a pair of shoes? Cobblers are few and far between in my experience to the point where it’s even difficult to find someone who is able to do a simple shoe repair, easier to throw away and buy new.<br>And who knows how to construct a pair of pants or a shirt? As someone who learned to sew as a matter of course in grade school/junior high “home economics” classes, and as a result at one point knew her way around a simple sewing machine and could wield a needle and thread quite handily, follow a pattern, even create and modify one, I wonder what we are all going to be wearing over the long course of the decline. And will fashion trends fall away, will clothing fads continue to cycle through the populace, or will clothing be ultra-utilitarian and homogeneous? Will we wear the uniform of our guild/community/family group even more commonly than what occurs now? I realize there are still quite a number of people who sew and make clothes, so it's not as if the technology will disappear, it's too much of a necessity, but I suspect the quantity and almost limitless choice in color, style, fabric, quality, etc. that make up today's clothing industry will be severely constrained.<br>And who knows how to create fabrics from plant and animal materials? I would guess that polyester, being oil and natural gas based, may become a distant memory. I have considered learning to weave but that implies first learning how to spin yarn, which in turn requires some sort of natural fiber, cotton being the most common, which requires climate to grow, a harvesting method, and ginning before even thinking about the spinning wheel. Perhaps yarn will continue to be available given that spinning was one of the first processes to be industrialized. And that leads back to the necessity of weaving yarn into cloth. What will the huge cloth and clothing industry look like locally once current systems of mass agriculture, cheap overseas labor, and long distance transportation break down?<br>A fig leaf just doesn't cut it in most climates. <br><br><br><a href=#c1795418762061234777 title="comment permalink">12/6/14, 7:50 PM</a><br><br>

My apparent and real pessimism comes from the experience of working with a wide variety of computers during the best of times and understanding just what it takes to make them work. By “working with” I mean bringing them up from scratch, not just programming an already running system.<br><br>My early times, during and after High School, were with both then current and older computers. After High School I was working in research labs at the University of Arizona. None of my 19 year career at the U of A was at all high paying, in fact I was often at the mercy of Professor's research grants which weren’t all that reliable. I worked directly with the hardware of several of the Data General Nova series and the Digital Equipment PDP-8 variants. I built both MITS Altair 8800 and IMSAI 8080 computers from kits and designed and built interfaces from both the Data General buss and the S-100 buss to different laboratory experiments.<br><br>I was also deep into the software on these computers, from doing SYSGEN’s on DG DOS and RDOS operating systems, we had a primitive multi-user system with Fortran IV compiler, assembler and relocatable linking loader running on a NOVA 2 with 32K 16 bit words of RAM and a 5 MB Hard Drive, to progressing from the original 4K MICROSOFT BASIC on paper tape up to CPM on dual 8” Floppy drives on the Altair/IMSAI systems. All of us in the lab were thrilled to have me carry a $500 check down to the local Altair store to buy the first copy of Altair/Microsoft BASIC on paper tape when it came into town. We got the first copy in Tucson! Then it took a half hour to load into the computer with a 10 cps ASR-33 teletype.<br><br>I was also at UC Berkeley for a few years supporting the IBM and UNIX systems there in the early 1980’s. IBM 4341 and 3081 mainframe systems running CMS, DEC PDP-11/70, VAX 11/750 and 11/780 systems running BSD 4.2 Unix. IBM PC, IBM AT and many clones.<br><br>Yes, there are some who have built relay based computers and others who say we can still do it with lots of salvaged or unused transistors. Take a look at the power consumption of this type of computer. The simpler computers of the past were by no means power misers. Think about how to power that computer while you're thinking about building it. Those computers from the past were built with a very different kind of resource base than ones in a low energy future will have.<br><br><a href=#c3373365414626172926 title="comment permalink">12/6/14, 8:41 PM</a><br><br>

We were using the suite of programs written by Phil Karn KA9Q for running TCP/IP over 1200 baud packet. We had mountaintop radios to connect cities together with packet. Here’s some info on the new at the time G3RUH 9600 baud modems that we used to make the first 9600 baud 220 MHz radio link in Arizona, from Mt. Lemmon near Tucson to Pinal Mountain near Globe.<br><br>http://www.amsat.org/amsat/articles/g3ruh/109.html<br><br>I contrast the really massive complexity of even these systems, which are considered “primitive” today with the relative ease of building and using simple radios which can be (and have been) built by almost any child of High School or even earlier age. Read books on the history of computers and compare this with books on the history of Radio, or specifically Ham Radio.<br><br>I’m not saying that we shouldn’t be using the equipment we have today and only use “primitive” stuff, but we should be aware that this great modern resource we have won’t always be available.<br><br>I’ll really be surprised if things “crash” fast enough that many of us alive today actually <b>need</b> to use these simple radios for important communications, but as JMG keeps reminding us, we need to keep this knowledge alive to be used in the future. That's why I hope we can get a group of Green Wizards on the air to keep this knowledge alive in all it's forms, from current digital communications to simple Morse Code networks. Yes, there are some people who still enjoy the simpler modes, but by and large, those are the older Hams who are dying off. We need younger Ham Operators with a Green Wizards interest to preserve this ability. If you read books on the history of Ham Radio such as <i>200 Meters and Down</i> and <i>The World of Ham Radio 1901 – 1950</i>, you will be totally amazed at what communications networks were built with totally home-built spark-gap Transmitters and Coherer Receivers.<br><br>I apologize for the length of my posts this time, but these are the things that come to mind whenever I see the casual assertions that we will keep computers available even when we have far less energy to work with.<br><br><a href=#c6891393739890983488 title="comment permalink">12/6/14, 8:42 PM</a><br><br>

That's partially a factor in the long existence of the species, (it's 50 million years old, 48 million more then human beings! With essentially, all of it here on this continent!) And strangely enough wild horses are generally less spooky then domestically bred horses. As I've said before, equids and horses in particular, are extremely adaptable. There was a herd at White Sands until they polluted the watering holes to the point the herd was being poisoned. There have even been wild herds in the Mojave Desert, around the fringes of Death Valley. A wild herd will travel around 30 miles a day in their quest for herbs, minerals and calories needed for their good health. Since they only digest 1/4 of what they eat they excell at distributing seeds over their home ranges. The main threat to wild herds RIGHT NOW is corporate ranches! They have the asinine idea that the horses are 'stealing' grass from their strip grazing cattle herds. (This is on open range legally allotted to horses!) Cows pull plants out by the roots and they stay in one place until the feed is gone. Buffalo is better for the land but Ranchers can't hold a buffalo herd with a simple wire fence. Being migratory when they want to go they're going! IMO the nation would eat better and healthier if we went with a buffalo common but the meat industry wouldn't quite know how to maintain their strangle hold on the market. Sorry for the digression but when things really begin to break down wild horse herds will come back in the millions, along with buffalo.<br><br><br><br>sgage, I like the Morgan horse for a good all around farm animal. The breed is prepotent, easy keepers, calm personality. I should know, I had a Morgan Appaloosa cross and his build couldn't be mistaken for anything BUT Morgan! He was beautiful, willing, agile and strong and I still miss him terribly. And for a generic farm draft horse if they don't destroy those herds, the horses around Tule Lake Calif. are heavily influenced by draft breeds. During the winter when the draft horses weren't needed the farmers turned them loose on the open range. When that area went to mechanized farming most of the farmers never retrieved their teams. You get some really typey horses out of those herds. Huge, dramatically majestic, built like a rock and just about as strong and durable as basalt.<br><br><br><br>As a side note, America developed more draft horse breeds than any other country in the world.

The solar photovoltaic (PV) here which is of 4.2kW PV capacity and can produce 115A at 28.4V easy (remember PV solar output is only really 80% of the rated panel output under normal conditions), only produced 130Ah in the past 2 days because of the very serious and heavy cloud coverage / rain here. Not sure I'd spare the power on that particular PC.

To me it seems that the instability and aggressiveness of Christianity goes back almost to the very beginning, when Paul had a falling-out with James, John, Kefa (Peter) and the rest of the <i>Evionim</i> followers of the historical Jesus over the keeing of the Torah, the Noachide Code, and (possibly) setting up Jesus as an idol -- although that last bit seems to have been expurgated from all of Christian history (thanks, Luke and Eusebius!).<br><br>On a similar note, recent archaeological findings have exonerated Nero Caesar from starting the 64 CE fire of Rome. Yet Tacitus tells us that the incendiaries told the people fleeing the flame that they had a principal (<i>auctor</i>) behind them. So who else could have started the fire, save the Christians?<br><br>And now we get to the Christians' response to a chaotic, unjust and indifferent universe: Apocalypse! Basically throughout Christianity's history Christians believed that the Paroisia of Jesus would bring on the Apocalypse, followed either by a Millenium or the Final Judgement, depending on who you asked. And they got their belief from the Jews, who, until Rome finally put paid to their revolts in 135 CE, believed God was about to intervene, cause the Apocalypse to happen, and usher in the Messianic Age.<br><br>Well events didn't exactly pan out as expected, either for the Jews or the Christians, did they? But the Christians got a boost with the union of Church and Empire, beginning with Constantine and becoming as intimate as can be under Theodosius I.<br><br><a href=#c6904224443651925932 title="comment permalink">12/7/14, 8:43 AM</a><br><br>

That's one of the main reasons that chip makes today keep making things smaller on the chips. The smaller the transistors are, the less power they consume. The newer Data General computers I used that were built out of IC's needed a 5 volt 25 amp power supply to run them. That only ran the processor, an input/output interface and 64K bytes of core memory. Transistor memory would have used far more power. I really don't want to think how much power would be needed to run something built out of thousands and thousands of discrete transistors!

For your readers who may not know, in the USA there are 3 levels of FCC licensing for amateur radio: Technician, General, and (what JMG has) Amateur Extra. Each license requires the passing of a progressively more difficult exam, and allows you to transmit on progressively more radio bands. Also note that Morse code (or “CW”) is no longer required for licensing. You need to be licensed just to transmit though; anyone with the proper equipment can listen in. My interest in amateur radio is mainly focused on emergency communications, and I (like many Hams) am equipped to operate indefinitely off-grid if needed. Amateur radio is a great hobby with lots of practical applications, and I've found the Ham radio crowd to be a great self-supporting learning community. <br><br>73 to all.<br><br><a href=#c7828347921889488601 title="comment permalink">12/7/14, 1:59 PM</a><br><br>

Well, I went and saw it a few nights ago and three things stood out:<br><br>- Given that they were a civilisation short on food, all of the actors excluding the lead Matthew Mconaughey looked pretty well fed;<br><br>- I'm unsure whether anyone noticed just how much fuel they were chucking around around on frivilous activities;<br><br>- The corn farms seemed to be run completely by very large automated machines. Firstly, as energy intensive as corn is, you have to eat other food types. Sorry, but thats the truth. Secondly, why would machines be doing work that could easily be done by people? There seemed to be a lot of standing around looking thoughtfully off into the distance and not a whole of work being done. Just sayin...; and<br><br>- Blights are a problem in a mono culture: i.e. you're growing the same stuff, in the same paddock and only that crop, year in year out. It can't actually be that way in a deindustrial future farm and can only be done now because of all of the energy we throw at large scale agriculture. We are eating energy...<br><br>Oh yeah, that's four points. Oh well. I enjoyed the film, but the premise was slightly off and fed into the apocalypse meme.<br><br>One more point... It is crazy to think that something in nature won't adapt to take advantage of a widespread blight. For example, the Portuguese millipede entered the country here in the 1950's and exploded as a population because nothing ate them here. Eventually selection pressures meant that a local nematode which normally eats the local millipedes adapted to eat the introduced species. Just sayin...<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c1741141397836875340 title="comment permalink">12/7/14, 2:50 PM</a><br><br>

I don't use Wikipedia, though -- it's too heavily distorted by political biases for my taste. <br><br>Wiseman, okay, that's one step. I'm aware that transistors can be made in the basement. What about a computer -- even a very simple one? "In theory" isn't good enough in a situation like this one. <br><br>Russell2000, now go back and read what I said about how the failure of a technology doesn't need to happen for technical reasons to matter. Barbarian invasions aren't technical problems, but they have to be included in the whole picture, you know. <br><br>William, I play lap and hammered dulcimer, both of which can unquestionably be made and used in very simple conditions -- the lap dulcimer aka Appalachian dulcimer was the traditional folk instrument of the poorest region of the United States, and it's a very elegant if idiosyncratic instrument. Still, as you point out, you can't exactly play Chopin on it, and the instruments necessary for most of the last two centuries of music pretty much require either extremely demanding craft techniques or an industrial system.

That kind of analysis is what'll get you past the bottlenecks before they have a chance to form. <br><br>Cherokee, everything I've seen about 3D printers makes me think that, like so many of the current gizmocentric cyber-fads, it's a complicated and very expensive way to do something an ordinarily competent craftsperson could do in a fraction of the time, for a fraction of the cost, using hand tools.

Many US hospitals are already riddled with resistant microbes, and the toll from hospital-borne resistant infections rises year after year. <br><br>Ed-M, well, yes, that was among my points. <br><br>Tyler, possibly, but there are plenty of working horses in the US these days, and quite a few people who know how to use them. It'll mostly be a matter of how fast horses can be bred and drovers and riders trained. <br><br>Roger, good. That's another of the reasons I prefer to keep the electronics turned off, if they're even in the house, and do things less vulnerable to intrusion. <br><br>James, good. My guess is that when computers are once again as bulky, expensive, and energy-intensive as they were in the days of Bletchley Park, they'll only be used for things as urgent as the decipherment of enemy codes in wartime, or what have you. <br><br>Chris, as far as I know, I never got the earlier comment -- Blogger's been eating comments of late.

It only took about 10 minutes to repair with an electric drill, a screwdriver, and six woodscrews. I needed the ladder to do repairs on the roof.

It occurred to me that this might be similar with societies facing catabolic collapse, that our attitudes about our roles toward the future, with goals of preserving and passing down knowledge we gained through our “youth” among other things, helps us accept and see this as a natural process we can embrace and find meaning in rather than just a tragic disaster.<br><br>Also, as another of your readers who saw Interstellar I will say that there is a sort of sad desperate logic to the film's message that was not without entertainment value.

I have been reading the ADR for years, but this the first time I have commented, as most of the commenters are so learned, and I certainly am not!! But to your point, it is not difficult at all to spin yarn and thread, to weave cloth, rugs, blankets, etc., to knit sweaters, socks, and etc., using your own yarn, and to sew serviceable clothes. People have been interested in clothes and fashion for thousands of years, but until fairly recently, styles have changed very slowly, and in some cultures, barely at all. And cost doesn't need to be too much of a factor, as far as sewing goes. My eldest daughter recently found a fabulous sewing machine, a 1957 Singer made in Scotland, for $40 at our local Goodwill.<br>I read this blog religiously, more often than I make it to Mass sometimes!, but so many of the commenters appear to be men and clothing is rarely, if ever <br>discussed. That's not necessarily bad, just an observation. Also, I wanted to tell you that adult Ed. classes and libraries will sometimes have people who can help you learn sewing, knitting, weaving, spinning, etc. I volunteer at my local library 2x a month by helping people finish old knitting projects or who need help starting new ones. I also, for several years, taught the Senior Girl Scout badge in Textiles--preparing the fiber, spinning, dying it, making a simple backstrap loom, and then weaving on the loom. We made our looms from from found sticks, not store bought stuff.<br>The other comment I had was all the despairing here is getting really old. Why are so many people so spoiled?? Yes, life will change, stop complaining and learn a skill and work on a craft. Change can be exciting, it doesn't have to be so negative!<br>Anyway, my two bits!<br>Blessings to all,<br>Heather<br><br><a href=#c4518058600110220431 title="comment permalink">12/8/14, 7:22 PM</a><br><br>

Certainly, there is a serious antibiotic resistance problem, particularly around hospitals, and it is getting worse. However in the general community, even the penicillin antibiotics are still considered one of the standard, effective antibiotics for many infections.<br><br>The reason is that antibiotic resistance imposes a metabolic load on the bacteria. In an environment where antibiotics are freely distributed such as in a hospital, the advantage resistance confers easily outweighs the cost. In the absence of antibiotics selection ensures that the non-resistant bacteria out-compete the resistant ones.<br><br>So as the use of antibiotics wanes, due to increased cost and lower availability, resistance should gradually decline, and it will become less of a problem, albeit over a significant period of time. <br><br>Andrew<br><br><a href=#c5134021618580324036 title="comment permalink">12/8/14, 8:58 PM</a><br><br>

The problem might be climate to grow them in which may require trade and transportation. As to method of delivery, inhalers and gas cylinders might work, though ingestion or topical application might be easier to manage. There's always alcohol to fall back on, and papaver somniferum are relatively easy and legal to grow. It's just illegal to harvest the sap (at least in the US).<br><br>@ Patricia Mathews - You had me in stitches with your description of hemming with staples and duct tape.

For instance, science should not be portrayed as a key to the secrets of the Universe. William of Ockham (13th century Irish Catholic monk) made it a rule not to use the 'God factor' in discovering the world. That doesn't say anything about God or no god, it just asserts that we seem to discover and improve the world better if we don't think of God as moving everything in the world all the time. Does God cause Newton's apple to fall the way it does? Possibly, we can neither prove nor disprove it. Are we better off supposing that God is smarter than to tinker with each atom in the Universe all the time - suppose G set up rules that do the trick, rules that we can observe? We seem to be better off supposing that. That's all Ockham ever said. Apparently, what became known as his 'razor' didn't rattle his faith.<br><br>Modern scientists use an Irish monk's approach and then some of them turn around and say we'll soon prove that God doesn't exist.

None of the following greatly changes JMG's basic point, but just for fun:<br><br>Lets take any set of technologies that fulfill similar functions. <br><br>Lets start with heating a house. Lets look at a firewood stove, wood pellet stove, gas furnace, oil furnace, and electric heat. The utility of each is about the same (they all heat the house) but those that are easier, cleaner etc may be said to have marginally greater utility at increasing cost. If one wanted, one could fit a curve to these data point. It would be relatively flat (small slope) drifting more or less up to the right. <br><br>One could do the same for any set of technologies that fulfill similar or identical functions. Long distance and large cargo transportation is a good example. You would have points for boat, train, truck, and plane cargo transport. Again, one could fit a curve to these data point. It might have a steeper curve or not. But in any case, it to would more or less drift up to the right. <br><br>Yet another example may be personal (one person) land transport over large distances. Here one might pick, bicycle, train/bus, car, and commercial airplane, private jet as data points. These may plot out on a more convex curve (sleeper slope at the start, then gradually less so) but still trending upward to the right. The techs in common use for the function in question must be on or near the curve biased to the left (least expensive for same utility). <br><br>All three examples, and any set of technologies that fulfill similar functions, would all trend upwards to the right and all would have an upper bound of utility and upper bound of cost. These upper bounds are determined by the data point furthest from the origin. <br><br>There is of course yet a third limit, that of the price most people can pay to allow the technology to be widespread. As resource limits increase costs, the technology furthest to the right drops from common use. It may not disappear altogether, but it is no longer economically significant. As it falls from common use, the upper bounds of utility and price may be said to drop to the next tech furthest from the origin. <br><br>This is not to say some intermediate tech might not be eliminated first. Maybe land lines go before cell phones because the latter moves to the left and so land lines drop off the curve. But generally one might expect the tech to the farthest right to be affected by resource limits first. <br><br>In this way, perhaps a better model is to think of ourselves being squeezed further and further into box B, not box A, as resource limits eliminate the techs on the upper right. All this to say we lose utility as we experience collapse. <br><br>Then again, a careful reader may note a possible error on my part. Perhaps I've inverted JMG's utility axis; easy to do if JMG's values are inverse to those of society at large. Maybe JMG would have used the term “greater utility” in the sense of “more essential” or “more necessary.” If so, then I'm just proving him correct. Oh well … ahhh ... never mind that … just let me finish.<br><br>As these curves of similar function are biased to the left (because between two competing techs of the same utility, the cheaper one wins out), but fixed at the origin, most such “function” curves will tend to be convex (steep slope initially then dropping off). This is the good news. It means we lose very little extra utility for each big drop in affordability at the start of collapse provided the next data point is close on the “function” curve. This relates directly to my technology pyramid comments as each tech going to the right tends to be higher tech than the one before it. The bad news is, once the fluff is gone, the drops in utility are steeper.<br><br><a href=#c1326096175054900362 title="comment permalink">12/10/14, 8:20 AM</a><br><br>

I see a lot of people fall into the common misconception that, once a variety of bacteria has picked up resistance, it will maintain it forever. Not true.<br><br>It costs bacteria energy to maintain resistance genes; bacteria without the resistance genes will multiply faster than those with the genes. There are apparently areas where old drugs against malaria have regained potency simply by not being used in those areas for a couple of decades.<br><br>A system that had a dozen broad-spectrum antibiotics, rotated three of them in use for five years or so and kept the others off the market for a couple of decades might well be sustainable indefinitely.<br><br>Of course, it ain’t going to happen in the current political and medical climate.<br><br>@<br><br>Re: 3-d printers.<br><br>If all you know is the toys available at Maker Faires, Home Depot and elsewhere, yes, these look like toys.

It’s true: she wrote a couple of programs for an IBM 650, and then went back to the accounting department because there was no future in it.<br><br>Vacuum tubes and head-per-track drum storage were the go-to before transistors and core memory. If you’re old enough to remember inventory systems where there was a punched card taped to inventory items, then there might have been an IBM 305 in the background.<br><br>If you’re going to do anything with older tech, you’re going to need vacuum tubes. I have no idea how easy they are to make in a properly equipped home workshop, but the ones for analog equipment like radios need to be reasonably precise; ones for computers not so much.

What you’re seeing is the beginnings of the next stage of Peak Oil. The countries with the highest petroleum reserves are showing that they have complete control over the market. Even working from the original Hubbert curve, you’ll notice that a few oil rich countries (say, the gulf nations) could still be producing more oil than the US at its 1970 peak a century from now. The last energy crisis made the high cost of Fracking and other unconventional technologies economically viable and led to a small energy boom (mostly paid for with government money through federal stimulus programs.) That led the US to start talking about a return to the boom times of the ‘60s, becoming a net exporter of oil again, etc. That caught the attention of Saudi Arabia who called our bluff and increased production. America is now learning the hard way that there’s no way to make Fracking compete with abundant shallow crude under natural pressure. There’ll be a production cut once the US Fracking industry finishes shutting down, but the wells that have already been drilled will continue to produce at negative net income for another year or two flooding the market further and pushing the companies that own the wells beyond hope of recovery. That means in 1-3 years when those wells die and there are no invested projects to replace them, we’ll see another energy crisis. The companies benefitting from the cheap oil will go under, the companies that are crashing right now won’t have recovered, and there’ll be no stimulus money for a bailout. It won’t be pretty. Compound that with the political unrest that’s currently escalating from protests to full blown war in the US right now and things could get really interesting.<br><br><a href=#c2062916321056608095 title="comment permalink">12/10/14, 12:58 PM</a><br><br>

They're the people who provide robust communications for the Red Cross after disasters. They're often associated with a club that supports one or more VHF repeater stations, and since it costs a little bit of money to keep a repeater on the air, they're likely to welcome contact with anyone who might be likely to donate. ARES is organized by counties, so search for contacts in yours. You'll probably need to spend some money on a commercial radio receiver to get started, but it doesn't need to be new, and so not too expensive. If you try too hard to save money, by building some little kit radios, you might just get discouraged.<br><br>You can reach me at at gmail.com if you have further questions.<br><br><a href=#c177690543055811739 title="comment permalink">12/10/14, 2:36 PM</a><br><br>
