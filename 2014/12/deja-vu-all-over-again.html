<div class=MsoNormal>
Over the last few weeks, a number of regular readers of
<i>The Archdruid Report</i> have asked me what I think about the recent plunge in the price of oil and the apparent end of the fracking bubble. That interest seems to be fairly widespread, and has attracted many of the usual narratives; the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>blogosphere is full of claims that the Saudis crashed the price of oil to break the US fracking industry, or that Obama got the Saudis to crash the price of oil to punish the Russians, or what have you.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I suspect, for my part, that what’s going on is considerably more important. To start with, oil isn’t the only thing that’s in steep decline. Many other major commodities—coal, iron ore, and copper among them—have registered comparable declines over the course of the last few months. I have no doubt that the Saudi government has its own reasons for keeping their own oil production at full tilt even though the price is crashing, but they don’t control the price of those other commodities, or the pace of commercial shipping—another thing that has dropped steeply in recent months. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s going on, rather, is something that a number of us in the peak oil scene have been warning about for a while now. Since most of the world’s economies run on petroleum products, the steep oil prices of the last few years have taken a hefty bite out of all economic activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The consequences of that were papered over for a while by frantic central bank activities, but they’ve finally begun to come home to roost in what’s politely called “demand destruction”—in less opaque terms, the process by which those who can no longer afford goods or services stop buying them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That, in turn, reminded me of the last time prolonged demand destruction collided with a boom in high-priced oil production, and sent me chasing after a book I read almost three decades ago. A few days ago, accordingly,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the excellent interlibrary loan service we have here in Maryland brought me a hefty 1985 hardback by financial journalist Philip Zweig, with the engaging title <i>Belly Up: The Collapse of the Penn Square Bank</i>. Some of my readers may never have heard of the Penn Square Bank; others may be scratching their heads, trying to figure out why the name sounds vaguely familiar. Those of my readers who belong to either category may want to listen up, because the same story seems to be repeating itself right now on an even larger scale. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The tale begins in the middle years of the 1970s, when oil prices shot up to unprecedented levels, and reserves of oil and natural gas that hadn’t been profitable before suddenly looked like winning bets. The deep strata of Oklahoma’s Anadarko basin were ground zero for what many people thought was a new era in natural gas production, especially when a handful of deep wells started bringing in impressive volumes of gas. The only missing ingredient was cash, and plenty of it, to pay for the drilling and hardware. That’s where the Penn Square Bank came into the picture. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Penn Square Bank was founded in 1960. At that time, as a consequence of hard-earned suspicions about big banks dating back to the Populist era, Oklahoma state banking laws prohibited banks from owning more than one branch, and so there were hundreds of little one-branch banks scattered across the state, making a modest return from home mortgages, auto loans, and the like. That’s what Penn Square was; it had been organized by the developer of the Penn Square shopping mall, in the northern suburbs of Oklahoma City, to provide an additional draw to retailers and customers. There it sat, in between a tobacconist and Shelley’s Tall Girl’s Shop, doing ordinary retail banking, until 1975. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In that year it was bought by a group of investors headed by B.P. “Beep” Jennings, an Oklahoma City banker who had been passed over for promotion at one of the big banks in town. Jennings pretty clearly wanted to prove that he could run with the big dogs; he was an excellent salesman, but not particularly talented at the number-crunching details that make for long-term success in banking, and he proceeded to demonstrate his strengths and weaknesses in an unforgettable manner. He took the little shopping mall bank and transformed it into a big player in the Oklahoma oil and gas market, which was poised—or so a chorus of industry voices insisted—on the brink of one of history’s great energy booms. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course this involved certain difficulties, which had to be overcome. A small shopping center bank doesn’t necessarily have the financial resources to become a big player in a major oil and gas market, for example. Fortunately for Beep Jennings, one of the grand innovations that has made modern banking what it is today had already occurred; by his time, loans were no longer seen as money that was collected from depositors and loaned out to qualified borrowers, in the expectation that it would be repaid with interest. Rather, loans were (and are) assets, which could (and can) be sold, for cash, to other banks. This is what Penn Square did, and since their loans charged a competitive interest rate and thus promised competitive profits, they were eagerly snapped up by Chase Manhattan, Continental Illinois, Seattle First, and a great many other large and allegedly sophisticated banks. So Penn Square Bank started issuing loans to Oklahoma oil and gas entrepreneurs, a flotilla of other banks around the country proceeded to fund those loans, and to all intents and purposes, the energy boom began. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At least that’s what it looked like. There was a great deal of drilling going on, certainly; the economists insisted that the price of oil and gas would just keep on rising; the local and national media promptly started featuring giddily enthusiastic stories about the stunning upside opportunities in the booming Oklahoma oil and gas business. What’s more, Oklahoma oil and gas entrepreneurs were spending money like nobody’s business, and not just on drilling leases, steel pipe, and the other hardware of the trade. Lear jets, vacation condos in fashionable resorts, and such lower-priced symbols of nouveau richesse as overpriced alligator-hide cowboy boots were much in evidence; so was the kind of high-rolling crassness that only the Sunbelt seems to inspire. Habitu<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">é</span>s of the Oklahoma oilie scene used to reminisce about one party where one of the attendees stood at the door with a stack of crisp $100 bills in his hand and asked every woman who entered how much she wanted for her clothes: every stitch, then and there, piled up in the entry. Prices varied, but apparently none of them turned down the offer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s only fair to admit that there were a few small clouds marring the otherwise sunny vistas of the late 1970s Oklahoma oil scene. One of them was the difficulty the banks buying loans from Penn Square—the so-called “upstream” banks—had in getting Penn Square to forward all the necessary documents on those loans. Since their banks were making loads of money off the transactions, the people in charge at the upstream banks were unwilling to make a fuss about it, and so their processing staff just had to put up with such minor little paperwork problems as missing or contradictory statements concerning collateral, payments of interest and principal, and so on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, some of the people in charge at those upstream banks seem to have had distinctly personal reasons for not wanting to make a fuss about those minor little paperwork problems. They were getting very large loans from Penn Square on very good terms, entering into partnerships with Penn Square’s favorite oilmen, and in at least some cases attending the clothing-optional parties just mentioned. No one else in the upstream banks seems to have been rude enough to ask too many questions about these activities; those who wondered aloud about them were told, hey, that’s just the way Oklahoma oilmen do business, and after all, the banks were making loads of money off the boom. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All in all, the future looked golden just then. In 1979, the Iranian revolution drove the price of oil up even further; in 1980, Jimmy Carter’s troubled presidency—with its indecisive but significant support for alternative energy and, God help us all, conservation—was steamrollered by Reagan’s massively funded and media-backed candidacy. As the new president took office in January of 1981, promising “morning in America,” the Penn Square bankers, their upstream counterparts, their clients in the Oklahoma oil and gas industry, and everyone else associated with the boom felt confident that happy days were there to stay. After all, the economists insisted that the price of oil and gas would just keep rising for decades to come, the most business-friendly and environment-hostile administration in living memory was comfortably ensconced in the White House; and investors were literally begging to be allowed to get a foot in the door in the Oklahoma boom. What could possibly go wrong? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then, in 1981, without any fuss at all, the price of oil and natural gas peaked and began to decline. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In retrospect, it’s not difficult to see what happened, though a lot of people since then have put a lot of effort into leaving the lessons of those years unlearnt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Energy is so central to a modern economy that when the price of energy goes up, every other sector of the economy ends up taking a hit. The rising price of energy functions, in effect, as a hidden tax on all economic activity outside the energy sector, and sends imbalances cascading through every part of the economy. As a result, other economic sectors cut their expenditures on energy as far as they can, either by conservation measures or by such tried and true processes as shedding jobs, cutting production, or going out of business. All this had predictable effects on the price of oil and gas, even though very few people predicted them.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As oil and gas prices slumped, investors started backing away from fossil fuel investments, including the Oklahoma boom. Upstream banks, in turn, started to have second thoughts about the spectacular sums of money they’d poured into Penn Square Bank loans. For the first time since the boom began, hard questions—the sort of questions that, in theory, investors and bankers are supposed to ask as a matter of course when people ask them for money—finally got asked. That’s when the problems began in earnest, because a great many of those questions didn’t have any good answers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It took until July 5, 1982 for the boom to turn definitively into a bust. That’s the day that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>federal bank regulators, after several years of inconclusive fumbling and a month or so of increasing panic, finally shut down the Penn Square Bank. What they discovered, as they dug through the mass of fragmentary, inaccurate, and nonexistent paperwork, was that Penn Square had basically been lending money to anybody in the oil and gas industry who wanted some, without taking the trouble to find out if the borrowers would ever be able to repay it. When payments became a problem, Penn Square obligingly loaned out the money to make their payments, and dealt with loans that went bad by loaning deadbeat borrowers even more money, so they could clear their debts and maintain their lifestyles. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The oil and gas boom had in fact been nothing of the kind, as a good many of the firms that had been out there producing oil and gas had been losing money all along.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rather, it was a Ponzi scheme facilitated by delusional lending practices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All those Lear jets, vacation condos, alligator-skin cowboy boots, heaps of slightly used women’s clothing, and the rest of it? They were paid for by money from investors and upstream banks, some of it via the Penn Square Bank, the rest from other banks and investors. The vast majority of the money was long gone; the resulting crash brought half a dozen major banks to their knees, and plunged Oklahoma and the rest of the US oil belt into a savage recession that gripped the region for most of a decade. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was the story chronicled in Zweig’s book, which I reread<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>over a few quiet evenings last week. Do any of the details seem familiar to you? If not, dear reader, you need to get out more. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As far as I know, the fracking bubble that’s now well into its denouement didn’t have a single ineptly run bank at its center, as the Oklahoma oil and gas bubble did. Most of the other details of that earlier fiasco, though, were present and accounted for. Sky-high fuel prices, check; reserves unprofitable at earlier prices that suddenly looked like a winning deal, check; a media frenzy that oversold the upside and completely ignored the possibility of a downside, check; vast torrents of money and credit from banks and investors too dazzled by the thought of easy riches to ask the obvious questions, check; a flurry of drilling companies that lost money every single quarter but managed to stay in business by heaping up mountains of unpayable debt, check. Pretty much every square on the bingo card marked “ecoomic debacle” has been filled in with a pen dipped in fracking fluid. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course a debacle of the Penn Square variety requires at least one other thing, which is a banking industry so fixated on this quarter’s profits that it can lose track of the minor little fact that lending money to people who can’t pay it back isn’t a business strategy with a long shelf life. I hope none of my readers are under the illusion that this is lacking just now. With interest rates stuck around zero and people and institutions that live off their investments frantically hunting for what used to count as a normal rate of return, the same culture of short-term thinking and financial idiocy that ran the global economy into the ground in the 2008 real estate crash remains firmly in place, glued there by the refusal of the Obama administration and its equivalents elsewhere to prosecute even the most egregious cases of fraud and malfeasance.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now that the downturn in oil prices is under way, and panic selling of energy-related junk bonds and lower grades of unconventional crude oil has begun in earnest, it seems likely that we’ll learn just how profitable the fracking fad of the last few years actually was. My working guess, which is admittedly an outsider’s view based on limited data and historical parallels, is that it was a money-losing operation from the beginning, and looked prosperous—as the Oklahoma boom did—only because it attracted a flood of investment money from people and institutions who were swept up in the craze. If I’m right, the spike in domestic US oil production due to fracking was never more than an artifact of fiscal irresponsibility in the first place, and could not have been sustained no matter what. Still, we’ll see. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The more immediate question is just how much damage the turmoil now under way will do to a US and global economy that have never recovered from the body blow inflicted on them by the real estate bubble that burst in 2008. Much depends on exactly who sunk how much money into fracking-related investments, and just how catastrophically those investments come unraveled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s possible that the result could be just a common or garden variety recession; it’s possible that it could be quite a bit more. When the tide goes out, as Warren Buffet has commented, you find out who’s been swimming naked, and just how far the resulting lack of coverage will extend is a question of no small importance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At least three economic sectors outside the fossil fuel industry, as I see it, stand to suffer even if all we get is an ordinary downturn. The first, of course, is the financial sector. A vast amount of money was loaned to the fracking industry; another vast amount—I don’t propose to guess how it compares to the first one—was accounted for by issuing junk bonds, and there was also plenty of ingenious financial architecture of the sort common in the housing boom. Those are going to lose most or all of their value in the months and years ahead. No doubt the US government will bail out its pals in the really big banks again, but there’s likely to be a great deal of turmoil anyway, and midsized and smaller players may crash and burn in a big way. One way or another, it promises to be entertaining. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second sector I expect to take a hit is the renewable energy sector.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the 1980s, as prices of oil and natural gas plunged, they took most of the then-burgeoning solar and wind industries with them. There were major cultural shifts at the same time that helped feed the abandonment of renewable energy, but the sheer impact of cheap oil and natural gas needs to be taken into account. If, as seems likely, we can expect several years of lowerr energy prices, and several years of the kind of economic downdraft that makes access to credit for renewable-energy projects a real challenge, a great many firms in the green sector will struggle for survival, and some won’t make it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those renewable-energy firms that pull through will find a substantial demand for their services further down the road, once the recent talk about Saudi America finds its proper home in the museum of popular delusions next to perpetual motion machines and Piltdown Man, and the US has to face a future without the imaginary hundred-year reserve of fracked natural gas politicians were gabbling about not that long ago. Still, it’s going to take some nimble footwork to get there; my guess is that those firms that get ready to do without government subsidies and tax credits, and look for ways to sell low-cost homescale systems in an era of disintegrating energy infrastructure, will do much better than those that cling to the hope of government subsidies and big corporate contracts. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The third sector I expect to land hard this time around is the academic sector. Yes, I know, it’s not fashionable to talk of the nation’s colleges and universities as an economic sector, but let’s please be real; in today’s economy, the academic industry functions mostly as a sales office for predatory loans, which are pushed on unwary consumers using deceptive marketing practices. The vast majority of people who are attending US universities these days, after all, will not prosper as a result; in fact, they will never recover financially from the burden of their student loans, since the modest average increase in income that will come to those graduates who actually manage to find jobs will be dwarfed by the monthly debt service they’ll have to pay for decades after graduation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the core reasons why the academic industry has become so vulnerable to a crash is that most colleges and universities rely on income from their investments to pay their operating expenses, and income from investments has taken a double hit in the last decade. First, the collapse of interest rates to near-zero (and in some cases, below-zero) levels has hammered returns across the spectrum of investment vehicles. As a result, colleges and universities have increasingly put their money into risky investments that promise what used to be ordinary returns, and this drove the second half of the equation; in the wake of the 2008 real estate crash, many colleges and universities suffered massive losses of endowment funds, and most of these losses have never been made good. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Did the nation’s colleges and universities stay clear of the fracking bubble?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That would have required, I think, far more prudence and independent thinking than the academic industry has shown of late. Those institutions that had the common sense to get out of fossil fuels for ecological reasons may end up reaping a surprising benefit; the rest, well, here again we’ll have to wait and see. My working guess, which is once again an outsider’s guess based on limited data and historical parallels, is that a great many institutions tried to bail themselves out from the impact of the real estate bust by doubling down on fracking. If that’s what happened, the looming crisis in American higher education—a crisis driven partly by the predatory loan practices mentioned earlier, partly by the jawdropping inflation in the price of a college education in recent decades, and partly by rampant overbuilding of academic programs—will be hitting shortly, and some very big names in the academic industry may not survive the impact. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
As Yogi Berra liked to point out, it’s hard to make predictions, especially about the future. Still, it looks as though we may be in the opening stages of a really ugly fiscal crisis, and I’d encourage my readers to take that possibility seriously and act accordingly.</div>

The story of Oklahoma in the '70's and '80's is very familiar to me, being the son of the son of Alberta Oilmen. We went through the very same boom and bust, which subsequently became a big part of the local and family mythos. Up here, however, the bust was and still is blamed exclusively on our then Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau and his semi-nationalization of the energy sector. Ironically, his son stands a good chance at becoming PM next year (in yet another good example of the cloistering of the elite that you discussed several posts back).<br><br> At any rate, I'm afraid my home province is about to get clobbered worse than it has at any point in my memory. I can only hope that this might at last lance the insane housing bubble we've got here as a side effect - If I were so inclined, I think I could have made good money developing a concept for a TV show called "It's worth WHAT?" featuring American's reactions to Canadian real estate prices!<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c5646428207155217019 title="comment permalink">12/17/14, 6:39 PM</a><br><br>

I spent years paying back loans, from back when education was still a “bargain,” ended up frustrated and impoverished, with a vague distrust of anything I need to borrow money to do. Ultimately this coalesced into a “but is it worth it, borrowing tens of thousands, from a personal economic standpoint?” argument in favor of at least looking at higher education like the transaction it is. If you haven’t read the fine print, better not to sign on the dotted line.<br><br>But I can’t tell you how many times in more recent years I have had to justify our family’s approach to our kids’ higher education: figure out what you want to do, the figure out who can best teach you what you need to know, learn it, then go do it. But first, get a trade. But that word--“trade”—it has such a powerful effect on members of the educated middle class. Never mind that most folks of reasonable intelligence can get themselves a great liberal arts education with nothing but a library card. Never mind that the tradesfolks I know make a bundle, and work when they want to, and write their own ticket. Insisting that my kids take up a trade, even if only to subsidize the rest of their education, makes me some sort of class traitor. Maybe I’ll have more company in this category, in the near future.<br><br>(As for the fracking bubble, we’ve had good news here in New York State today—the governor is to ban fracking, after years of dithering.

You point out that most of the time these things are quite predictable, and more often than not are in fact predicted by a few people on the periphery, who are of course ignored. But I wonder if you aren't missing a more interesting story - namely that many of the people involved, the bankers and investors and such, know full well that they are investing in a Ponzi scheme, but do it anyway. Short term gain wins over long term pain, especially when there is a chance you can foist the pain onto someone else before the Ponzi scheme fails.<br>In other words, understanding is not the problem - it's a more fundamental aspect of human behavior that drives us to discount the future to the point that we make terrible long term decisions. If true, what does it say about the project of your blog (or any other project out there with the aim of educating)? Knowledge is necessary, but not necessarily sufficient. Will enough people act in their own long term interest even with all the information they need academically? <br>Seems like an important question because your idea of voluntary poverty now to beat the rush (and preserve some cushion for learning pains) is incompatible with the human tendency to maximize relative advantage today.<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c5168520729380006654 title="comment permalink">12/17/14, 6:54 PM</a><br><br>

Smart guy.<br><br>Mourning in America... I can’t have been the only person to think of that?<br><br>I have had a strong suspicion that the Saudi's are turning up the volume of flows from their wells because it is an expedient method of reducing funding and reach for the Islamic State insurgency whom are reliant on oil revenues.<br><br>At the same time, lower prices for oil brings the chooks home to roost in the fracking game. If it is only sustainable at high oil prices, the companies themselves are funded by debt and lease commitments - both of which have to be serviced regardless - then clearly lower oil prices are not good for them or the US economy.<br><br>But there is the bind; both situations are contrary to US interests. Perhaps there is no easy road to take as all choices have costs.<br><br>There is a lack of flexibility in debt arrangements, I’ve noticed here that up north in the drought affected areas there has been much talk of farm repossessions by the banks and government loans to farmers. What is meant by the term poisoned chalice? Still, banks can’t run farms.<br><br>I sort of reckon that given the natural systems on this planet use the suns energy and manage to convert about 2% (someone please correct me if I'm wrong on that figure) of that energy into other forms after a few hundred million years of evolution, then that really is about the best we can ever achieve on a long term basis (2% of the available sunlight as energy, not a 2% return).<br><br>To achieve anything more represents us eating our infrastructure whether it is natural or manmade. And once that infrastructure is gone, it isn’t easily replaced.<br><br>Sun Tzu warned about destroying a countries infrastructure and rather promoted the idea of taking it “whole”. Who would have thought that some dude 3,000 years gone has some fascinating insights into our current woes?<br><br>Sun Tzu the master wrote all those years ago: "For, while quick accomplishment has been known to give victory to the unskilful, the skilful general has never gained advantage from lengthy operations. In fact, there has never been a country which has benefited from a prolonged war."<br><br>Sound familiar to anyone? It should as our entanglement in the web that is the Middle East is a disaster. I would have to guess that he might say that it saps both our treasuries and our spirits.<br><br>Another ripper quote: "he who is ignorant of the enemy, and fixes his eyes only on his own side, conquers, and the next time is defeated; he who is ignorant of the enemy, but also of his own resources, is invariably defeated."<br><br>Wise words. I noted he appreciated disenssus in his strategies: "If a victory be gained by a certain stratagem, do not repeat it. Vary the stratagem according to circumstances."<br><br>But what I found chilling was the quote: "If the enemy be at rest in comfortable quarters, harass him; if he be living in plenty, cut off his supplies; if sitting composedly awaiting attack, cause him to move".<br><br>Sun Tzu, that guy knows people's hearts and motivations.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c3750977846288324507 title="comment permalink">12/17/14, 7:23 PM</a><br><br>

I would venture that the Penn Bank collapse was one of several - remember the savings and loan collapse in the 80s? The south American banking collapses of the 80s and 90s? Dot Com? This has been a repeated cycle with us, again and again, as we seemingly never learn. Or perhaps greed overpowers logic.<br><br>I would add two elements to your thesis, which will only magnify its import. First, we cannot forget the power of fear in these things. I remember well the oil embargo of 1973, gas station lines, people being shot, and in the context of such fear all sorts of predatory and evil creatures emerge to feast. Compared to the 70s the current period is like the 70s fears on steroids - NSA, Russia, Warming, Terrorism, Ebola, Police....the list is long. When a people is terrified their logic deserts them. <br><br>I would add as well that the high prices that brought us fracking also brought us highly costly arctic and deep water projects and these too will be set aside for a period of time. Jobs will end. Equipment will decay and rust so when it is eventually used terrible accidents will occur.<br><br>And I have recently had this thought that wonders how many of the Fed's $ 4 trillion of QE have gone straight to this fracking bubble, the student loan bubble, the auto loan bubble. In other words, has the Fed in its effort to keep the system running only made much larger and more terrible the bubbles we now know will burst?<br><br>I expect you will get to it but at some point your excellent analysis needs to move toward solutions, as in, what can we do? I know the list is long. I suggest you look at a story in the blog real economics concerning spending $ 100 trillion worldwide to move us to a sustainable mostly non fossil fuel power system in the coming two or three decades. In addition to helping with global warming, such a solution makes sense in and of itself as a way to put us all back to work, to get us off a militarized empire struggle, and perhaps find a way to print and use money that goes into the hands of the working man and woman and not the financial handlers....it's exactly the kind of big simple idea that entirely avoids pro and anti warming arguments, left and right arguments. It is an idea that is doable and limited only by those many who will always remain in the "no department" and argue against any solution. A one hundred trillion future - sustainable, endurable, real work for real people, not about killing and armies, or terror, but about life, and survival, and a future. Kind of like Kennedy's call to place someone on the moon 55 years ago (nearly) except now a tad bit bigger....<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c4837116914060767354 title="comment permalink">12/17/14, 7:33 PM</a><br><br>

That was followed by an increase in oil prices of more than 50% in less than twelve months, which led to the recession of 2001. I expect that's what's going to happen here. Prices will stay low for the next year or two until the current tight oil wells run dry, then rise as supply drops and U.S. demand increases. By late 2016 or early 2017, we'll be back in recession. The analogy may not extend too far, as the 2001 recession ended when the American people heard "go shopping or the terrorists win," even if President Bush didn't actually say such a thing. I have my doubts that either the American people will have enough unused credit or the U.S. government will be able to provide enough of a stimulus to make history repeat that closely!<br><br>As for the financial panic spreading, it took two years for the popping of the housing bubble in 2005 and 2006 to turn into a recession in 2008, and that was accompanied by both a 50+% increase in the price of oil as well as the U.S. spending more than 4% of its GDP on oil. Of course, the price of oil had been rising throughout much of the housing bubble, and I strongly suspect the rising cost of commuting and heating helped prick the bubble in 2005 and 2006.

Saudi Arabia is determined to destroy the wildcat financing that has allowed shale oil to be produced in such quantities as to crash the market. When the smoke clears it will be a lot harder to finance shale production and the price of oil will go right back up to $100+ a barrel once that extra 2,000,000 barrels a day has decayed to 500,000.<br><br>I agree with you that there is liable to be a lot pain but I'm also quite confident that our beloved .gov is hard at work figuring out how to make the taxpayers pay the tab.

A very large portion of the health care sector might be at great risk.<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c3499143717719619796 title="comment permalink">12/17/14, 8:51 PM</a><br><br>

Living in New Orleans, I noticed that President Obama approved, and oil companies began carrying out, fracking operations offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Fracking. Off Shore. In the Gulf. Previous oil extractions tell me that once you start drilling off shore, you've basically run out of places to drill on dry land.<br><br>In related news, the fracking operation near Dallas is shutting down due to the decrease in liquid fossil fuel prices. Something tells me fracking won't resume there any time soon, because even at petroleum oil prices at and above $100 US a barrel, that play in Texas will still be unprofitable.<br><br>And about your remarks that Oklahoma and the rest of the petrol belt suffering a hard, savage recession when oil prices collapsed like this the last time, New Orleans entered a long depression that didn't end until after Katrina when US rebuild money and vast amounts of it changed the equation. Looks like our housing bubble in N. O. is about to pop!<br><br>Other sectors that will be hard hit will be the Engineering and Heavy Construction. Well right now my mum just passed away :'^( and I'll be getting a small trust fund to restart my old civil engineering career...

I take that as evidence that, despite the delusions of modern votaries of the Great God Progress, human beings haven't actually changed that much in the last three thousand years. <br><br>Dujin, hmm. I gather you haven't been reading this blog very long. I've discussed at quite some length why we're way past the point at which it's possible to prevent the decline and fall of industrial civilization, and no, this notion of flinging $100 trillion we don't have, in an attempt to build technologies that aren't economically viable and require resources that are already gone, doesn't offer a way out of that. Sure, you can dismiss that by insisting that I'm just being negative; so? The logic of the cargo cult is always popular in times like these, but it's not especially useful. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, well, we'll see. In 1998 the US economy wasn't anything like so much of a house of cards as it's subsequently become. <br><br>Villager, as I noted in my post, the Saudis don't control the price of coal, iron ore, or any of the other commodities that are cratering, or such other measures of economic activity as shipping indices, which are also down hard. This isn't just a matter of market manipulation -- the wheels are coming off the global economy. That's my read, at least. <br><br>Svencow, good question. My guess is that debt relief for people crushed by predatory student loans will be a massive political issue in a few years, but we'll see. <br><br>GHung, my guess is that it'll be possible, for the next few years, to get renewable energy systems very cheap -- and I'd encourage any of my readers who have the funds to do so. Over and above the personal benefits, when the price of energy soars again -- and it will -- if there are enough people around who know how to live with the sharply limited energy supply that can be gotten from homescale renewables, and can teach others, much might be salvaged. <br><br>Indrajala, I didn't know the Japanese university system was into the same mistakes. That's unfortunate, though not surprising. <br><br>Repent, human beings are social primates with a bad case of grandiosity. It would be nice if we were capable of living according to reason, but -- well, let's just say that it's been tried, repeatedly, and the results haven't lived up to the billing. <br><br>Brad, I've been wondering for years now whether the academic industry or the medical-pharmaceutical industry would be the first to implode. My guess is that the academic industry is ahead by a length or so, but no question, it's going to be a tight race all the way to the finish line. <br><br>Ed-M, sorry to hear about your mother. I wonder whether you can retool your civil engineering skills so that you provide some kind of service that individuals need and can barter for. <br><br>Cathy, glad to hear you've been proactive. Thanks for both of the links; the North Dakota piece is in its own way bitterly funny -- I like the way that the state official insists that the current downturn is just a blip -- and the Aeon piece is, as you've noted, partly thoughtful and partly idiotic. I notice that as usual, the only two futures they're willing to consider for humanity are endless progress and extinction...<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c3033975123165944431 title="comment permalink">12/17/14, 11:13 PM</a><br><br>

Being a former newspaper man I thought it would be amusing to predict the headline "Christmas comes early for consumers" in the wake of the oil price crash. Putting quotes around that phrase, Google returns some 11.2 million results - although admittedly not all of them can be ascribed to the price crash. "Christmas comes early for motorists" also returns an acceptable amount.<br><br>Of course, such short-sightedness won't come as a surprise to the readers of your blog. I'm more interested in the collateral damage that the price dip will cause.<br><br>Still, it gives us an insight into one of the driving narratives of our time - that the industrial economy is a benevolent god who dishes out goodies to His minions (consumers). If we've been good He'll give us a lower oil price, record 'holiday season' sales and a thinner iPad. Bad behaviour is rewarded with inflation, expensive petroleum and clunky electronic gizmos. <br><br>I wonder what Jesus would have thought. <br><br>In any case I've asked Santa this year to bring down the fracking industry before it spreads around the globe and poisons us all.

The following caught my attention and I think demands much more discussion, particularly since I think you have been politely sending this message out for a while. <br><br>“Still, it looks as though we may be in the opening stages of a really ugly fiscal crisis, and I’d encourage my readers to take that possibility seriously and act accordingly.” <br><br>I was forwarded some information on a new Netflix show, in the theme of Marco Polo, which is focused on Hypatia – funny coincidence given your last posting. Filtering out all the gratuitous nudity and sex their basic storyline is interesting…<br><br>Hypatia, as part of the Greek intellectual elite, had managed to draw the threads together that Alexandria was in serious decline. Ever since the tsunami the city infrastructure was not being repaired properly and she had certainly heard rumours that unrest was growing among the culturally and religiously divided citizens. Based on her discussions with colleagues, who had studied the decline and fall of previous great civilizations and cities, she had come to agreement with them that Alexandria, and the entire Greek elite civilization, was on the path to collapse. Certainly, they agreed, this would take at least one or two centuries but certainly there must be something that could be done to preserve things for the future. They couldn’t lose all their knowledge!<br><br>Hypatia had decided that she wanted to ensure the most important mathematics tomes that had been collected in the library would be passed on to future generations. She had been “borrowing” the best examples and quietly taking them home in her chariot. She would have a great library in 20 years that, surely, would be immensely useful to future generations.<br><br>Colleagues had warned her about driving her chariot alone through the streets. But how else to smuggle the books out? Besides, collapse was not going to happen in her lifetime…Unfortunately her books were found by some scavenging street folk and burnt to roast a goat in an alleyway – they never were read again.<br>And there we have it…<br><br>I think, John Michael, you are often too polite. For sure, as we sit enjoying some fine home-brewed beer no one wants to get into the dirty discussion of the short-term contingency plans. It is far more stimulating to debate what philosophy or tech might be most useful to someone in 100 years. That is, while it is certainly a great task to do things such as develop a quality library that will be useful in 50 to 100 years, one should definitely also be ready in case of more immediate needs to act.<br><br>I have a friend who has been greatly concerned about decline. This person is also vegan. I asked about what his plans were for when some items that are imported from the Far East no longer are transported here. “I’m not worried, it won’t happen in my lifetime.”<br><br>I’m not so sure and I certainly in having plan a, b, c and even d for some priorities. Who else is of the same mind?<br><br>John Michael, to add more to your comments above, I can recommend some other folks who also agree that we could have some bumpy drops fast approaching.

My suspicion is that the Saudis don't cut production because they have bills to pay like everyone else.

NG needs pipelines and a retail pipe network; oil can make do with trucks and rail and relatively few trunk pipelines. The highly developed legacy infrastructure of USA makes increases in production of these marginal energy supplies just about useful when they are competing with high price imports of oil &amp; NG<br> <br>Although USA for a long time has been a massive producer of NG, US nevertheless has needed to import a relatively small amount of NG at the margin, and rather surprisingly perhaps, still does.<br> <br> USA remains of course a very large net importer of crude oil (It looks that JP, SK, &amp; Germany are ahead per capita). As Number One crude oil importer, USA has narrowed the gap somewhat since 2012, but is still in front I think.<br>Oil Imports 2012, '000 barrels per day (EIA): United States 7,372; China 5,608; Japan 4,559; India 2,460; Korea, South 2,261; Germany 2,225<br> <br>One of the big questions you have posed in the past is whether the US can maintain its position as the largest net ‘sink’ for world resources, extracted and supplied at whatever rate sufficient to keep up with its own legacy requirements and their maintenance. Thus ‘Diminishing Returns’ could easily mean that US, along with Japan and perhaps Germany have ‘topped out’ in the use they can make of the resources they can import, even if for a few months/years the price is again low. <br><br>As you rightly raise the matter, it appears USA will not be able to grow substitute economies (e.g. ‘electrical economies’ such as nuclear or renewable) that evade this gradual (?) loss of ‘return’ from the resources and their associated investment in extraction etc. <br><br>This idea takes some getting used to because ‘we’ (including Europe) until very recently demonstrated the enormous ‘growth potential’ (‘economic utility’) of petroleum and other carbon fuel, while China in the last 15 years has given us another stellar example following the same ‘model’ of industrial expansion.<br> <br>We seem, perhaps, to have arrived at the cusp. Ugo Bardi did a nice historical comparison of demand / supply curves for a 19th C ‘world fuel’. http://cassandralegacy.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/the-collapse-of-oil-prices-lessons-from.html In that case there were resources waiting in the wings to make not only substitutions but provide sufficient new fuels for enormous growth. However, during the tricky transition period, the price of this particular old fuel suffered rapid and dramatic fluctuation, even while the diminishing returns on investment in extraction went inexorably south.<br> <br>In ‘our’ case, rapidity, (months or perhaps several years), of the average period of price oscillation will make all the difference at both a personal and geopolitical level, and even rapid rearrangement of legacy structure (including academe and illness industries) will not stabilise outcomes. Indeed, future arranging of substitutes for this ‘fragile’ kind of infrastructure is no small matter in a ‘no-growth’ economy, let alone one where profitability flickers across key sectors. <br><br>As you say, we will see.<br>Thanks<br>Phil H<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c5822871674852699008 title="comment permalink">12/18/14, 6:32 AM</a><br><br>

My wife, ten years younger than I, was not so lucky, and was able to discharge her student loan debt only after an inheritance. Otherwise, she would still be paying it. We have friends in their thirties and forties with engineering, law and medical degrees who are struggling with six-figure student loan burdens even though their incomes are much higher than ours. They will remain debt slaves for many years.<br><br>Coming as we do from academic backgrounds, it has long been dogma for my wife and I to counsel young people to get a university education. She teaches high school to a largely working and under class population, and sees daily the waste of talent as bright but economically distressed students graduate with few prospects beyond the military, becoming lifelong student debt slaves, or working minimum wage jobs and living with their parents. Her school district long ago cut its trade programs like woodworking, machine shop, auto mechanics, home economics -- too, expensive, you see -- that might offer students a path to some level of self-sufficiency.<br><br>My local four-year state institution about fifteen years ago "rebranded" itself from a college to a "university," in order to attract more students, which its marketing department unabashedly considers "customers." The school's six-figure-salaried administrators seem to be much more concerned about selling the "college experience" to more and more "customers" than they do an actual education in the traditional sense. Thus in the last decade there have been significant capital expenditures on new buildings, cafeterias (which serve discounted meals to the general public in competition with local restaurants -- more customers!), dormitories, etc. Meanwhile, this "university" has laid waste to entire departments in an effort to save money. Physics is gone, as are geology and geography. Can mathematics be far behind? After all, gosh, math is really, really hard and may not attract enough "customers." The only foreign language left standing is Spanish. In time, this institution may devolve into a business school with a football team.<br><br>I think that the coming bursting of the student loan bubble, will pick off the little public schools like my local unversity a lot sooner than the big schools that have deep connections in state legislatures. But small private universities that are more dependent on their endowments may be even more vulnerable. And so the academic racket will unfold. <br><br>It hasn't been brought up on this board yet, but under US law student loan debt cannot be discharged through traditional bankruptcy. Default is the only option. And I have heard more than one story of the collectors going after a student's parents after a default.<br><br>All of which is to say that my wife and I no longer automatically recommend a university education. What would I say now to a bright young student? Be disciplined enough to use the resources out there to give yourself the best classical education you can, but stay the hell out of debt. And learn to weld.<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c6950043861162883842 title="comment permalink">12/18/14, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

I certainly agree regarding the fracking bubble popping. But things, as JMG likes to say sometimes, have their own cussedness and behave as they please. And negative feedback loops exist and they tend to limit the effects of the positive feedback loops that we like to focus on. (Note to those not versed in system modeling: a "positive" feedback loop is one that builds on itself, while a "negative" one is self-correcting. This has nothing to do with whether the affected phenomenon is desirable.)<br><br>But let's look at a prediction which was a big topic here a couple of months ago: that there would be a million ebola cases by the end of the year. Here we are past mid-December and the official total cases is less than 20,000, and the official total deaths less than 7,000. Which is plenty of bad news, and the real numbers are probably considerably higher, and the epidemic is far from over, but this is far, far short of the predictions.<br><br>Why did it turn out this way? Because, again like JMG often says, negative feedbacks exist, and governments will do whatever it takes to restore order. In this case governments in, e.g., Liberia, have closed all schools for many months now, imposed curfews and quarantines, and focused their small but non-zero resources into case-tracing and education of the public on how to avoid the disease.<br><br>Similarly it is hard to predict the details of the future of the industrial economies, other than the long-term decline. One trend that stands out to me is a global fracturing. Countries literally split apart into more than one country, and groups of countries split partially off the supposedly global economy. E.g., since Russia is being actively pushed away by the Western industrial countries, it is apparently rebuilding its economy as less globalized, and in bilateral partnership with some other countries, China in particular. Such fracturing may eventually put a big dent into the dreams of the global banksters. Alas it also may be an early stage of the build-up to WW3.<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c4301482894651442606 title="comment permalink">12/18/14, 9:16 AM</a><br><br>

This book shows, using official US government figures, that within 40 years 68 of the 92 materials identified as essential to our current economy will be in declining production, with a few uneconomically rare. Hubbert's Peak for oil has analogues in virtually all the essential ingredients of our tech society today. There is enough sand to make all the silicon you could ever want, and there is probably enough mineral to make concrete at our current consumption levels for centuries at least. But, imagine that in 50 years you cannot make high speed tool steel to make bits for your automated lathe or milling machine! Or high tech steel for the bearings in the axle of a car. Basically, we will have to revert to 1920's technology levels, and fall back to things like carbon tool steels assuming you have a way of making steel at all.

When planning in the 70s for my college, they carefully avoided student loans. After my dad died, because they had paid off the house, I was not eligible for any aid other than Social Security, and loans. My mother impressed on me her fear and loathing for debt. I'm so glad she did. In November of 1979, two months after starting classes, my mother died of a massive stroke, leaving me, at 18, to pick up the pieces. It would have been an order of magnitude more difficult with debt on top of that. In the years since, "smart" people have mocked me for not having credit cards, saving rather than borrowing, living a frugal, even impoverished life to try and stay within my means. The few times I have borrowed, I got in trouble, listening to the "Oh, why not?" voice in my head, like a drunk on a bender. I now wish I had listened more closely to my parents' stories of the Depression. They might have come in handy.<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c59319465326607499 title="comment permalink">12/18/14, 10:05 AM</a><br><br>

That may wind up going down as one of your best timed calls yet. It has been fascinating and frightening to watch the events unfold the way they have, especially seeing everyone in a position to cushion the impact of what’s coming doing the exact opposite of what needs done. The federal reserve is treating stimulus packages and lowered interest rates like a lab monkey treats a pleasure button, using government money to push the market to record highs while the economy that’s supposed to support it sours and starts to crumble. Back in the Permian Basin town where I grew up, the oil companies who have been veterans of a century’s worth of boom and bust cycles and learned their lesson in the Great Depression are hunkering down for a bust while Frackers in the Dakotas are still contracting new projects that are already losing them money. Economists are trying to coax speculative spending out of investors without even hiding the fact that they believe economic downturns are caused by pessimistic feelings that can be countered by feeding them positive thoughts. And the lives of ordinary people on the ground still haven’t recovered from a recession that was never allowed to run its course and do its job of skimming excess credit off the top of the economy and bringing the market a little closer to reality (meaning the federal stimulus money is all going to investors rather than workers). Thanks for recommending “The Great Crash 1929,” this has been a good time to read it. I can understand the appeal of conspiracy theories at times like this.

Are you familier with the work of Steve Ludlum, especialy his triangle of doom analysis. Using the convergence of decreasing world credit creation and the rising cost of the last marginal barrel of oil he seems to have acuratly predicted the current oil price "event". The interesting thing is that he predicts the decline in credit is a permanent phenomenon resulting in permanently declining oil prices, resulting in eventual shortages. If he is right, it means this is not a cyclical oil prices decline like the 1980's but a permanent stair step down the road to catabolic collapse.<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c6844685444694892918 title="comment permalink">12/18/14, 11:18 AM</a><br><br>

I have conscientiously read each week's post along with people's comments for about a year. I took time to read all of 2012 and 2013, and a good number before that. I have let your writings seep into my heart and soul. I have a lot to say in this one note, relevant to this and past weeks' posts. In the future, rather than saving up stuff like I have been, I hope to post smaller comments often. I'm new at this, so please forgive this relatively long post.<br><br>Another of my regular reads is John Hogue's prophecy website.<br><br>Great post this week. I remember the 1973 OPEC oil crisis, the early 1980's slump, the pumped-up late 1980s, the flush 1990s, the 2006 real estate crash, the slow recovery since, and wondered what the heck happened each time. Between your writings and commenters, things are beginning to make sense.<br><br>My husband and I don't drive much so don't need to get gasoline much, and when I do, I people-watch. We got gasoline on Monday, three days ago, at Costco, midday, when there should have been no one there. It was packed. Ten lines of at least five cars long. Over the last week, I have seen evidence that people are out spending like crazy. Here, people have money and are spending it — for Christmas. Christmas is the yearly fix where they imagine that everything is okay if only a person can spend enough.<br><br>We live in a relatively mild climate but where, for a couple months in summer, temperatures are 85º F. and above. We are stuck in a hot town, and have to make the best of it. We bought a new house in the late 1990s but, after several years (do-dos as we are), we realized that the builder had not insulated the attic correctly, plus (which we knew) had only put in average (meaning cr-p) efficiency heating and cooling. Even if the central air conditioning had been perfect, the trapped heat from the attic came down into the second floor living space — half the day was a living hell. Over years, we got credit card debt to zero, saved money and last spring paid cash to get the attic properly insulated, and had new high-efficiency furnace and air conditioning installed. This summer was the first summer in eight years where we were comfortable enough to do work in our offices at any hour. Since World War II, population growth has forced more and more people to live in inhospitable climates, and individually modify living space as they can manage, over time.<br><br>A new housing development is going up near us. The sales office had been open several months. I stopped in to get the low-down. I asked "Do you get many people asking about how fuel-efficient the heating and cooling systems are that the builder is putting into these houses?" The lady said that she knew nothing about the heating and cooling — she had to research the answer — she came back saying that the builder was putting in "average" (meaning cr-p) heating and cooling — and that I was the FIRST person to inquire about heating and cooling. I thought "Oh God, people are not the least bit interested in fuel-efficiency of furnaces and air conditioning systems of new homes. They care more about the color of their washer and dryer than about their proposed monthly utility bill." Collectively, in buying a new home, buyers could demand better from the builder, but aren't, so if their monthly utility bills are sky-high long-term, they are partly to blame. THEY did it.<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c6430841227274256216 title="comment permalink">12/18/14, 1:24 PM</a><br><br>

We have contemplated paying for (not renting) solar power for our house, but we'd have to fork over tens-of-thousands of dollars (reducing cash needed for emergencies), and may not make that money back in 15 years (the life of the system), so what is in it for us? Prices of buying solar systems are dropping but it seems the later we put in a solar system, the better — or maybe never put in a solar system at all.<br><br>As for renting a solar system, that is a racket if ever I saw one: the installer, like Walmart's SolarCity, gets the vast majority of the proceeds, not the homeowner. Renting is horrible.<br><br>A technology that I find helpful is iPhone/iPad's ability to read aloud what is on a page. On my iPhone, I listened to your last post with eyes closed listening. Wow. Even my Macintosh can't read aloud what is on a page.<br><br>In my 60-odd years, even with a Bachelor degree, I never learned how to write essays. I aim to correct that. I did a survey on how to accomplish how to learn to write essays. I learned how much traditional college costs (mega-bucks, whether in-person or online). I learned that colleges are not organized so that anyone, at whatever age, at whatever time of day or year, can learn what they need to learn affordably much, but there are companies/schools that are making inroads. I learned that most colleges are still pushing the old way of doing things (degree programs; have to be there in real life). I learned what online writing courses are out there for people to take, one course at a time, as needed, without having to apply to a formal college degree program. I learned that teaching people how to write is not high on the list of things available to learn or teach, even though it is a fundamental skill. It is my educated guess that I will be able to cobble together, between paper books, online paid courses, and online free courses, my own independent study program where, cheaply, in a year, I will have learned how to write better. I have already started, and am learning tons. What I am trying to say is that it looks like I won't have to spend mega-bucks and be forced to become an English major at some real-life college. I will let you know how it is going.<br><br>Another conclusion I came to is that organizations (old schools, new schools) that offer in the direction of straighterline.com will flourish. I looked at what I need. I need specific courses, one at a time. I do not need, nor will I consider, to commit myself to any sort of degree program. Straighterline.com is not perfect, but it is going in the right direction. I was surprised to see that khanacademy.org has no reading or writing courses.<br><br>The demand for education, I believe, will always be high. It is the suppliers of education that are having problems. Once I saw that there are a few companies on the cutting edge of education, I saw that I could cobble together the courses I need affordably — for example, it matters not whether a person is 17-years old or 60-years old to learn to write better; it doesn't matter where a person is located, as long as they have access to a Macintosh, Windows-machine, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad, or other tablet, and courses are offered online. Third-world students in India and Indonesia are getting higher educations on their iPhones — why not Americans? As another example, I feel disappointed because there is a writing program but because I am not in high school, I am not eligible. I am too old. Traditional location-based, age-based, non-online courses are so out. I am looking for courses I can start immediately where I don't have to wait until Septembers or Januarys to start. There are several types of online courses, which I won't go into here.<br><br>One should not discount community colleges. California's community colleges still offer trade courses, to their credit. It would be good for Californian's to take advantage of these programs.<br><br>Please forgive the mish-mash.

I doubt anyone on this side of the pond would notice the difference.<br><br>Ed, I'd be surprised if the price goes back up that fast. I don't think this is just a speculative bust -- there are massive economic downdrafts also in play, and those may take quite a while to get worked out. <br><br>Cherokee, they'll keep on yelling that until the water rises over their heads.

He might just haul the entire fracking industry away in his basket this year.<br><br>Sheep, yes, but the thought of a beefy Oklahoma oilman wearing a castoff party frock is, well, less than appealing!<br><br>Thomas, good question. I'd encourage you to do the research! (BTW, I don't reply to comments on old posts, in case you were wondering.)<br><br>Rashakor, the Satanists have really been going for publicity of late, no question. I wonder when the Ayn Rand fans in the GOP will 'fess up to their devil-worshipping ways. <br><br>Zentao, there are plenty of other forums where people talk about short-term contingencies. It's the bigger picture that tends to get neglected these days, and that's what this blog is about. <br><br>Donalfagan, no question, one possible outcome of the economic crisis that seems to be on our doorstep is a cascading series of dollar crises that eventually lead to dollar hyperinflation. <br><br>Bill, yes, I've been watching that dynamic play out in the stock market. I'm pretty sure that profits from the various financial games being played around fracking have been boosting stock prices generally, and the end of that hidden subsidy may lead to a prolonged bear market. But we'll see. <br><br>Zaphod, JK Galbraith pointed out that bitter memories of the last economic disaster are one of the few things that can stave off the next economic disaster.

I suspect that an attempt to force a bail-in on bank customers in the US would probably lead to something not far from mass revolt. <br><br>Phil, granted -- it's impossible to know just how violent the oscillations of price and production will be, and that makes a lot of difference. <br><br>Strovenovus, obviously I disagree. There are pervasive signs of economic contraction globally and in the US, among them significant continuing declines in the consumption of important commodities and energy resources. That suggests demand destruction to me. Still, we'll see. <br><br>Paulo, you're welcome and thank you! No question, making the shift -- "collapsing now and avoiding the rush" -- is a wrench, but it does have its consolations. <br><br>Dennis, thanks for the graphs! Your read is the same as mine. As I see it, there was never actually a recovery from the real estate crash, and the attempts to paper over the resulting Great Recession are losing their effectiveness. <br><br>Carl, $1 trillion <i>is</i> serious. It'll probably end up being more than that. <br><br>Patricia, I've talked to a lot of very old men in the Masons and other lodges, and learned from the experience!<br><br>Andrew, fascinating. It's rare to see a government bureaucracy being quite so blatant about their role as cheerleaders for big corporations...<br><br>Friction Shift, I've heard the same thing from people all over the country, in and out of the academic industry. A very large number of US colleges and universities are making the same choices, and yes, a vast number of them are likely to crash and burn in the years ahead. In the not too distant future, I plan on doing a series of posts on adult education, and will be talking about this at quite some length. <br><br>TJ, I haven't the least idea. I don't have any investment money -- I'm unusually successful as a writer, but all that means is that I don't quite live from paycheck to paycheck -- and so haven't researched the subject. <br><br>Moshe, no argument at all. I expect that once a downturn gets well under way, we'll hear yet again from the folks who insist that the global economy is going to freeze up in a matter of weeks, leaving everyone to freeze and starve in the dark. Negative feedback is why that won't happen -- which won't prevent trillions of dollars, euros, etc. from being lost, millions of people from ending up out of work, etc. <br><br>Shark, that'll definitely work!<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c3875597197959456632 title="comment permalink">12/18/14, 3:49 PM</a><br><br>

Now can we get that put on the business end of a branding iron and apply it to the backsides of those cornucopian true believers who think that yelling "technology!" is a meaningful answer to the hard limits of a finite planet? <br><br>Leo, your attitudes toward debt are the wave of the future. Take heart!<br><br>NosVemos, thank you! Yes, China's a wild card -- though there are a lot of other wild cards just now. I think the deck is full of them. <br><br>James, glad to be of help. If you can find a copy of the book I cited in the post, <i>Belly Up</i>, by all means read it -- it's an entertaining story, and should help put your experiences in context. <br><br>Ellen, you lost me at the interstellar bit. We don't have the energy or the resources to do more than a little interplanetary exploration, and won't have that once the fossil fuels run out; the stars? Not a chance. <br><br>Justin, nah, I'm not the head of a religion, just the executive officer in charge of one midsized religious organization on one end of a relatively small and eccentric faith. Most people online call me JMG, which is fine -- hipsterish or not! As for the academic bust, exactly -- these are all factors setting the higher-ed industry up for a world-class collapse. <br><br>Unknown, thanks for the links!<br><br>Eric, it's really easy to look like a prophet when an economic bubble gets going; predict that it'll eventually crash, and you're guaranteed to be right. That said, I was a little startled to watch things unfold as precisely as they have! It'll be interesting, in the sense of the apocryphal curse, to see how it unfolds from here, because you're quite right: those who could have done something to prevent a debacle have one and all done exactly the opposite. <br><br>Clay Dennis, no, I haven't encountered Ludlum's work yet; the "triangle of doom" sounds entertaining, if nothing else. Can you recommend a good introduction? <br><br>Marin, I suspect they'll have much more to worry about in the not too distant future. Thanks for the link to the solar site, though -- very useful stuff. <br><br>Larz, welcome to the list! I'm far from sure online courses are a good solution for everyone -- a growing number of poor people have limited or no access to the internet at this point, and that's only going to become more common as we proceed. Still, all this will be fodder for the future series of posts here on adult education, because you're certainly right that that's a critical piece of the puzzle.<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c6307765185417088463 title="comment permalink">12/18/14, 4:08 PM</a><br><br>

I am not sure what that graph really sows - what does "Retail Sales by Refiners" mean? I've never seen a refiner sell retail... And 20 million gallons per day (2014) is only about half a million barrels per day - a small fraction of the total US gasoline use. To quote the EIA (same source): "In 2013, ... gasoline were consumed in the United States, a daily average of about 368.51 million gallons (or 8.77 million barrels). This was about 6% less than the record high ... consumed in 2007."<br>http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=23&amp;t=10<br><br>Back to the bigger question of whether the current drop in oil price is an overall decline in global economic activity. It seems to me that signals from China and other countries is of a slowdown in growth, while in some other countries such as in Europe there is an actual slight contraction. This can explain a few percent drop in the price of copper. It by no means explains a 50% drop in the price of oil. But oil demand is famously inelastic in the short term, and thus a slight "glut", say 1% more supply than demand, can easily fill the commercial storage space and drop the price.<br><br>Plus, a lot of it is psychology. The endless hyping of the "shale miracle" has not only duped investors, it also facilitated the myth of a "glut". Psychology can change quickly, and indeed it often does when bubbles pop, resulting in the suddenness of the pop.<br><br>It may be that oil prices will rebound as fast as they did in 2009, i.e. over less than a year. Especially if and when reports of canceled drilling, and drying up of existing wells, start circulating, along with ongoing "unrest" in Libya, Iraq, Iran, Venezuela, and who knows what other oil-producing countries as they fail to find the monies to keep things quiet.<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c9206959586019601820 title="comment permalink">12/18/14, 4:57 PM</a><br><br>

I don't remember anyone predicting that the fracking bubble would be popped because of overproduction, glut, and price collapse! Of course it has not actually popped yet, and it might be rescued -- the housing bubble was kept inflated many years longer that I ever imagined it could. Still it's a great example that, even when you can foresee the broad outline of the future, you are certainly going to be taken by surprise by many of the events that happem within this broad outline. And, since in the long run we're all dead, these short-term surprises are very important, indeed!<br><br>Larz, donalfagan, etc, about solar: I retrofitted our victorian with an active solar system -- a portion of the existing attic painted black, equipped with with polycarbonate roofing, and hot air from this solar furnace moved to the rest of the house with flexible duct and inline fans. I even use outside air instead of closed inside cold air return, and I still get plenty of almost free heat on sunny days. It provides much more heat to the interior of the house than any retrofitted passive solar system ever could, and it has very little impact on the house's historic character.<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c3675642517666829595 title="comment permalink">12/18/14, 4:59 PM</a><br><br>

I would guess that about half of the people who are on the cutting edge of research are from other countries.

I'm aware of the Baltic Dry Index, but as far as I know that only gives the current prices for shipping various cargoes, not how much of them is being shipped. This seems easier than climbing a hill or a bridge and counting how many freighters and tankers are sailing in &amp; out the SF Bay (it's cold out there this time of year). <br><br>I want to acknowledge an intellectual debt to yourself and especially to Violet Cabra, who posted a few weeks back on the way in which extended reading of anthropological materials substantially altered her view of human nature, and, by extension, of human polities. In brief, she expressed the idea that humans are essentially social primates, a fact which determines whether assorted sets of political arrangements do or don't work as advertised. This clicked with my recollections of a long-ago college anthropology course, specific details of which are highly confirmatory of that view. Consequently I now subscribe to the hypothesis that we're neither angels nor devils, nor are we fallen quintessences of corruptibility, nor are we really perfectible; we're just monkeys with overdeveloped brains. And experience and Jane Goodall have demonstrated that if you concentrate waaay too many bananas in the hands of a few dominant chimps, they're bound to behave badly. That, I fancy, is the basis of corruption in our socioeconomic &amp; political systems and of the tendency of some individuals to game them. <br><br>I've always found anarchy the most attractive of doctrines, and still think it provides a fine critique of many a status quo, but like you I've observed too much of baboon politics to believe in its practicability on anything like a large scale or an extended basis. (I've even tried reading Roberts Rules of Order, but I'm afraid I found even the briefest passages excruciatingly boring.) <br><br>I think we can finally chalk up a sound prediction of deflation to Nicole Foss, at least if Chris Martenson's Peak Prosperity site is to be believed; one of the latest articles there is "Deflation Is Winning," by Brian Pretti.

Its relatively a lot more than is committed to anything else, and that's what matters in the financial economy - the portion of the whole that any allocation comprises. That sum for sustainability would pull a lot of resources to it. Bit what would it pull resources away from? Likely just about everything else - everything. Considering that current gdp is about $15 trillipm, an influx of $100 trillion inflates prices<br>across tje board by a factor of 6. You then designate funds for sustainable projects but you are assuming that the industrial infrastructure can even accomplish it. Probably the prices of components of solar or PV such as cadmium or copper or manganese or whatever would skyrocket. Any other designated "sustainable industry" (oxymoron) the prices for its goods or services would<br>skyrocket.<br>I think what might work better is to substantially raise taxes on the financial sector much like tje eisenhower era and redirect those funds as well as most of the entitlements to pay for the transition back to farm labor- In other words to pay people for actually working the land organically. But even this has insurmountable barriers such as housing transportation population overburden... collapse is pretty well baked in to the cake nlw<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c408883633992175094 title="comment permalink">12/19/14, 6:16 AM</a><br><br>

Like most unstructured (aka. unconstrained) things, most people blow it. Just don't!!! The 4 year wild party will give you a 40 year hang over.<br><br>If you do decide that indeed you have to study, you should make goals and stick to them. You must take and oath to devote yourself to a very scholastic/spartan lifestyle. First you schedule 3 hours of independent reading/studying (because coursework will take you only so far), then you schedule whatever activities you must to in order to survive, then you can attend coursework in your spare time. If there's no spare time, you cannot have a meaningful education in this environment anyways, so do not waste your time/money.<br><br>About surviving activities. You must hold a part time job. It must pay enough to cover your expenses and it must have a fixed and sensible schedule so that it will not interfere with your school activities. Therefore, all the typical low status jigs that most students take are probably not worth it. This means it is a good idea to take a few years off to learn a trade. Then you can come back to school from a strength position, instead of putting a lease on your future.<br><br>Finally, there is the financing question. All options seem to be pretty bad, at least in the US, but do yourself a favor and shop around. For what I heard, most people take on debt to go to college, but some get grants/scholarships that come with no further strings than doing what every student should be doing anyways (aka. devote at least as much time and effort to their educations as a full time job requires). Also, there are Universities that offer fee wavers to employees, so you may consider that as well. And if you know any languages besides English, there are countries that offer much better deals to foreigners than US offers its own population, so there is that.<br><br>Finally, I know the social expectations are very different in the US... but if at all possible consider not moving out of your parents' place. If the relationship is good, have a candid talk with them. This is the wave of the future. In my home country, the expectation is that people will move out when they get married... perhaps... to live with the in-laws (or have their sweetheart move in). Then the young couple will actually move out whenever they can afford it... or when the 2nd rugrat is on the way.<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c887779572105727592 title="comment permalink">12/19/14, 8:04 AM</a><br><br>

To my mind it is required reading for anyone studying the collapse of civilization. He takes a different approach to economics than the mainstream. His work recognizes that since the 70's. most of the industrial worlds economic systems have not run on earned income but on credit growth. The income most people earn from "working" is not really earned at all but borrowed by their employer, or their employers customers. A perfect example is a college administrator who's income comes from the debt taken out by students. He focus's on the phenomenon that most of the use of fuel in cars does not pay for itself but instead must be borrowed. His analysis is very detailed and dense, it takes me several readings to understand it. But it is showing predictive powers that Neoliberal economics sorely lack now.

The top layer has two items: a slowly improving miles-per-gallon ratio in the mix of vehicles on the road, and the actual miles driven have essentially flatlined over the last five or six years. Here’s the official chart: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/M12MTVUSM227NFWA . Here’s an earlier version with an analysis of what’s going on.<br><br>Why have miles driven flatlined? One answer is demographics: older people don’t drive as much, especially since they don’t commute back and forth to work. Second, the Millenials simply are not driving as much either, and the ones that do aren’t looking at their cars as something to tinker with the way young people did a generation ago.<br><br>There’s also demand destruction, but that’s only part of the equation.

It will be used as far as possible. I think, even this hard stuff. Even if human life has to further adapt to one-dimensional calorie food, pollutants, and general discord.<br><br>Thus, I see the problem as one of finance at present - this is a temporary dip and there will be a return to fracking in the future. Might be five or ten years, depends on contingencies. But for now all the pieces of the debt puzzle are juggling around. Naturally they will congeal again and another effort will be made. It may come after production from the big easy fields in the middle east start to drop. <br><br>In general, the comment regarding the $100 trillion has got me thinking about approaching the subject with the uninitiated. For one, it's a big step to even search out and find this blog or your books, for instance. People don't go there. What they pay attention to in the mainstream is climate change, which is connected.<br><br>Well, so, low gas prices make life easier for roughly 75% of Americans; but it makes climate change harder - for the ones who both bother to think about it, and agree with science - which is not a high percentage, maybe 30% of people.<br><br>Prices down, but demand's still not there. I'm sure the powers that be can find a way to remedy that - it's the one thing the financial sector seems to get right, since the money keeps flowing into their hands by its perverse love of rubbing against itself. <br><br>So this downward flow of prices makes other energy-consuming businesses more affordable, if they have enough time to gear up and get running before prices go up again. Actually, it would be an ideal time to build up solar stock, ready to sell the next time oil crosses $80 or so.<br><br>Solar, just like fracking, is going to start and stop - as much as it can within its infrastructure needs - and probably beyond the point of being economical, just for nostalgia's sake.<br><br>You might think climate change would jump in to the conversation at some point and say, "enough already, what's the point? you're just making it worse - it's going to run out anyway..."<br><br>The heartfelt but nonsensical reply is, "not in my lifetime...but anyway, we're limitless." <br><br> Oh how convenient...

Really an incredible book. I intend to follow deeper into those ideas. For now, I'd like to make a comment about cargo cults. After reading Overshoot, I have a lot better sense now of what that means - it is a sort of Arthur C. Clarke, "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" - but with a satisfaction having come, some miraculous boon, followed by an expectation of continuance, that is only if the correct rituals or practices, beliefs or prayers are undertaken. For example, Gretchen in Goethe's Faust was an innocent in accordance with God's will, and along with her Faust was rescued for his misdeeds - after which he turned to good by using his magic to feed the masses.<br><br>It's not an idle comparison because a key component of people's belief systems is that God would never punish good people, thus delaying a reckoning of the matter that is less allegorical and closer to scientific facts.<br><br>But there is also a smarter, more daemonic form of the cargo cult that sees an underlying scientific principle surrounding exponential growth. coal was developed once growth reached a certain level. At the higher complexity, oil was developed. Nuclear was a step higher in complexity, and thus of a higher level of danger. Or, we might make discoveries at the higher levels of complexity that we can keep at lower levels. somewhat like radio. But maybe it would be nano-integrated organically grown circuitry that runs on photosynthesis and interfaces with animals, like humans. Some kind of organic computer system. Who knows? The only way to know is to run the machine as far and as fast as it will go. It's far beyond what a person can discover individually. But there may be some secret around the corner. Gotta travel to find out.<br><br>As one example, the science of ecology was not fully developed until the nuclear age, and many of the insights in ecology were close to some insights in chemistry and physics that also led to the nuclear age. Perhaps we would discover something as truly elegant as ecology. We might find it alongside truly dangerous material sciences, such as whatever incredible energy source lurks behind the Higgs boson, supposedly.<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c3191680736940037472 title="comment permalink">12/19/14, 10:23 AM</a><br><br>

A tangent anecdote was Beep’s Friday afternoon celebrations. Standing on a counter in the lobby he would drink Champaign from his alligator boot and the party would be on. <br><br>As the economic party aged and troubles developed King Air aircraft would circle rural towns with a troubled bank like vultures only to land and disgorge their cargo of shark skin suited investors with pockets full of cash to buy the troubled banks in an attempt to further fund their financial circus; the Bush family – of dubious presidential fame – was among this scum covered crew. It was glorious and the aftermath was gory with millions of dollars of equity lost, many small towns destroyed and the livelihood of thousands wiped-out.<br><br>I was in the clean-up crew after the Penn Square debacle attempting, and rarely succeeding, in an attempt to salvage troubled community banks. For all their care in staying local in lending even they were impacted because their entire community had become dependent on the excesses in the oil patch and profits based on loan participations with fast dealing correspondent banks. The economic damage spread from New York west to the pacific and north to the Canadian border; such is the power of oil in our economy – but those events are all a distant memory now.<br><br>We keep on repeating this from tech to real estate and now back to commodities – oil among them – with the same result. It is on longer learning from the mistakes that opportunity has been lost, It is now about how we survive at a community, family and individual level and that is a daily exercise in adaption. <br><br>Excellent post and it brought back a lot of memories – thanks.<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c5745640847242837171 title="comment permalink">12/19/14, 10:59 AM</a><br><br>

We have a 4.25 kW PV grid-tied solar system (no batteries). As part of a neighborhood group purchase, we got a price break, and didn't have to sort through the options as individuals. According to the installer's analysis (which all makes sense to me), the break-even time is only four years (taking into account various taxpayer-supported incentives, credits, rebates, etc.) The electrical work was inspected as complete on November 4. So, how's it working? <br> <br>I'll let you know when I get authorization from the local utility to THROW THE SWITCH!<br> <br>Apparently, the utility is vastly unprepared and under-staffed to issue the authorizations, even after they've installed the "smart" electric meter which can run backwards on sunny days. <br> <br>I suspect that it might be a computer billing problem, maybe that they just want to let my meter run forward long enough that I won't roll it back below zero. But who knows? They respond to no one.<br><br>We've made the investment, but can't start to pay it off until they say "go".<br><br>(Other "investments" have been in insulation, tools, books, ham radio equipment, a fine made-in-USA kitchen knife (Lamson), a fine pair of made-in-USA leather boots (RedWing), and a fine warm (USA) winter coat (Carhart).

First part on student loans. Second part, advice from someone from the grandparent generation about how to do college today.<br><br>Some student loans are forgivable with strings attached. There are programs that forgive medical school loans if the doctor practices for a number of years in a rural area that has a hard time attracting doctors. That was the premise of a TV sitcom called Northern Exposure quite a few years ago. Some federal government loans can be forgiven in full if the debtor works full time at a nonprofit for ten years.<br><br>A couple of years ago, there was talk of enacting a law to cap the monthly payment on student loan debt at a certain percentage of income, and to partially forgive loans to graduates who never succeed in getting a good paying job. I don't think any of those laws were enacted, but I'm sure Senator Elizabeth Warren will get to work on it.<br><br>Obviously the time to find out under what conditions a loan can be forgiven, or the terms renegotiated, would be before taking out the loan.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c2905029900689037009></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/05554905422672638784 rel=nofollow>Unknown</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>(Deborah Bender)<br><br>@latheChuck--my advice to the would-be college student of today:<br><br>Back when prosperity was more widely spread, I had the benefit of four years of decent, not great, undergraduate education paid for by my parents and the taxpayers. I got an economically worthless Bachelor of Arts degree without any work experience or useful connections, waited on tables for a year or two, then went to what was called junior college and picked up a trade practically for free. Those were the days. Nowadays, a university education paid for by someone else is probably as hard to come by as it was in the 1920s. <br><br>For most students today, I think the best way of getting the bachelor's degree without a ball and chain of debt is as follows:<br><br>1. While in high school, take as many advance placement academic courses as you can in order to get breadth requirements out of the way and rack up some college credits for free. Of course, advance placement courses are plentiful and easy to come by in elite high schools and unavailable in the public schools of the poor.<br>However, the parent/guardian/enterprising high school student should take the initiative to find out what advanced placement courses are offered anywhere in the school district. I'm fairly sure that if such courses are available at all, a student with the requisite qualifications is entitled to take the courses even if they aren't offered at his or her school. It probably will take both research and pushiness to exercise this right, if one is of the wrong ethnicity or class. Local community and four year colleges may also offer advance placement courses for gifted or worthy high school students, and if you do well in those, you might be on track to get admitted with a scholarship. <br><br>2. Save money by living at home and getting the rest of the freshman and sophomore class credits at community college--much cheaper, and your chances of having an instructor who is a PhD instead of a graduate student is higher than at most universities, where the PhDs' careers are based on research, not teaching undergraduates.<br><br>Think about where you might like to transfer for your junior and senior years. Check the course catalogs and graduation requirements of your aspirational four year colleges. Try to find out through unofficial channels which of the required courses for graduation and for your possible major (if you have any idea what that would be; don't stress if you don't) are hard to get into because the school doesn't offer them often enough to accommodate all the students who want to take them. This is unfortunately a common situation that turns what should be four undergraduate years (already one year too many) into five, just to get those last few required courses finished. If at all possible, avoid this extra tuition trap by getting those requirements out of the way at community college. <br> <br>3. Apart from that, courses should be selected to do one of the following: a) be a fully transferable credit which satisfies a requirement for the bachelor's degree at the place you hope to transfer to and/or at the cheapest state college you think you can get into or b) fulfill a requirement toward a vocational certificate from the CC which will immediately lead to a paying job or c) be something you are truly interested in and would like to explore even if it has no obvious practical application. If you don't sign up for anything in the third category, you are wasting your youth.<br><br>4. Take as long as you have to to earn the AA degree and/or a vocational certificate, but don't go into debt. Then, take a gap year or two and get a grown up job, or travel, or raise some hell, or some children, and figure out what kind of life you want as an adult. <br><br>5. After that, you will have a much better idea of what additional education or training you want, and how to get it.<br><br>My elders did not give me any advice like this, but if they had, I wouldn't have listened. Good luck to you young'uns.<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c2905029900689037009 title="comment permalink">12/19/14, 11:31 PM</a><br><br>

Naturally it caught my attention. You noted the cultural influences of the early 80s. There’s a couple of big changes on that front.<br><br>I remember Carter telling us to conserve, wear a cardigan, turn down the heat. (I went back and watched his 1977 speech on energy as a refresher).<br><br>Reagan, on the other hand, came in and told everyone that, in effect, Carter was wrong, you can have your cake and eat it too. (While he did not literally say this, it’s the impression I’m left with after all these years)<br><br>Unlike then, I can't see the next president coming to office and pulling a “Regan.” (Telling everyone what the want to hear instead of what they should hear). <br><br>The other cultural influence that is new and different is climate change. That influence did not exist in the late 70s and early 80s. As an influence now, it will continue to make additional fossil fuel generation harder to build and should provide some check on renewable defection.<br><br>Despite all that, your point still stands. RE will take a hit because lower traditional energy prices make it harder to sell alternative energy.<br><br>(As an aside Reagan had the solar hot water panels removed from the White House and he eliminated the tax subsidies for solar – the subsidies were too generous, but losing them devastated the solar thermal industry).<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c5428746433250969199 title="comment permalink">12/20/14, 11:06 AM</a><br><br>

I like to think they are honest, but my personal experience tells me different. - Art Myatt<br><br>Words to live by. Honesty is a quality much to be admired but never practiced in a business environment. <br><br>Did you ever ask a boss about rumors of lay-offs? Did you ever get a direct, truthful answer? No? I thought not. I'll bet what you got were dire warnings to not spread panic. And, incidentally, no, the company is NOT for sale, it will NOT be sold, so keep your head down, keep working and, most of all, keep quiet. Or else...Because news like this has a tendency to sneak out and get employees worried. You know, concerns about nickel and dime little people stuff. Like, for example, mortgages. Stuff like that. <br><br>I wish I had a buck for every time someone (typically someone from human resources) said "but we can't say that" such as in reference to upcoming corporate disembowelments, ones that typically come with big bonuses for the c-suite but massive loss of employment and income for everyone else. <br><br>You've seen it, parsimonious with facts, tricky with half-truths, every utterance carefully lawyered, bobbing, dodging, weaving in response to questions, slippery as Hillary on a Sunday morning news show. <br><br>And, if you're nimble enough to corner a boss and have the cojones to ask a direct question, they'll look you straight in the eye and lie like hell. They'll say no, contrary to rumors, yadda, yadda. Or emit meaningless word-fogs. I guess this is much more fun than telling it straight. <br><br>But most of all (and worst of all) the bosses deceive themselves. Not just small deceptions but great big ones. If you wonder why the business world and the economy are such a mess, if you wonder why the list of failed companies and failed economic policies goes to the moon and back, THAT'S why. That's the main cause. Co-incidentally, that's why the USSR and all its eastern bloc allies went down the drain, it was the unwillingness to tell the truth, especially the honchos to themselves, and to face it. The truth is painful. But avoiding it is ruinous. <br><br>And I think it was Dilbert that said the HR Director is a black winged demon. He was right.<br><br>Watch and listen when the corporate flacks speak. The amount of truth is inverse to the forthrightness apparent in the pronouncement.

I saved my money and every few months grabbed my cash stake and bought flying lessons finally earning a commercial license, (single and multi-engine land and sea)by age 19. I then worked summers as a bush pilot and winters as an apprentice obtaining a red seal journeyman ticket in my late twenties. Married with two children, a house payment etc., I returned to school earning an under-grad, mostly by correspondence. I would wake up at 5:00am, head out to my shop where I had a small office. I would hit the books for two hours, and then go to work. I used 1 entire weekend day studying as dictated by weather. Poor weather was the school day. When I finally returned to university I was in my late 30s and completed the under-grad and the 5th year teaching certification by living away from home. It was tough. I used the same study formula to earn a masters degree but by then we were just beginning online work and using FTP to send our assignments around the world. It was pretty cutting edge at the time. The point of this is that I did not have a loan, ever, as I had work skills that paid the bills.<br><br>When my daughter went to university I preached over and over, "never borrow money". She did, and one winter took her boyfriend (now husband) to Mexico. When she ran out of money that winter I co-signed a Credit Union loan and made her pay it back $200/month. It took about two years. I made her sign a formal contract with me. It was a hard lesson for her.<br><br>By the way, our formula for her schooling was Dad pay 1/3, she had to work for at least 1/3, and if she ran short could use a student loan knowing it was up to her to pay it back. Obviously, Dad helped out as needed. It was very costly at times.<br><br>Despite working all through university she graduated owing approx. $16,000. She now has a pretty good job and is paying off her loan as I write this. The bank of Dad has been closed for awhile.<br><br>My son, on the other hand, actually listened to Dad. He attended the local college just 3 blocks from home. He did a pre-app electrician course for one year. I paid the very modest tuition, for the course books, and he also worked nights and weekends for extras as needed. He drove a mustang which he paid for himself. He then obtained a red seal and worked for almost 10 years in the Oil Sands as an industrial electrician. From age 20 he has never made less than $120,000/yr and has a river front home about 300 metres from me. He is now 30 and works as a contractor doing drywall and electrical. In the Oil Sands he would work 2 and 2, sometimes 2 and 1, (weeks on and off), and as a contractor 7 days/week as required. On time off he would fly home to Vancouver Island.<br><br>I always...always tell young people to get a trade first, and then if desired attend university with a solid work background. I ask, "do you want to work summers at minimum wage, or on the tools at $30/hr? Think about it".<br><br>For God's sake, don't attend school to 'find yourself', or figure out what you want to do.<br><br>One year I held down 3 jobs. I taught high school full time, flew DHC-2 (Beavers) into logging camps after school and on weekends, and did renovations over the summer. I hired my son to help me when he was 13. It was a blast.<br><br>My formula worked as I retired 2 years ago at 57.<br><br>Don't borrow money, ever, unless it is for something big like an affordable mortgage. Never buy anything unless you already have the money in the bank. That is the advice I give young people thinking about going to school.<br><br>regards...Paulo<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c7694077781740077432 title="comment permalink">12/20/14, 6:49 PM</a><br><br>

I also like that the protagonist has escaped both from his wordless guide and some long-lost blue-clad villains - a rival gang presumably, but uniformed in the tradition of law enforcement (?) - on an e-bike, which I can only imagine. And all to set up cell phones again, which to the present mind probably seems almost farcical. Looking forward to the next chapter and to the surprises it will unfold!

Hence Alaska, but I didn't actually know about the pretend oil &amp; gas boom in Oklahoma. <br>Now I understand the basis for the subsequent savings and loan scandal that broke right after the oil bust. Since most of the whole delusionally overpriced subdivisions built in the middle of nowhere were mostly across the southwest. Obviously if money was rolling in, then real-estate speculation cannot be far behind.<br>But I think the echo of that boom went further: first what we got was Reagan taking credit for 'rescuing' the U.S. from Carter and all that negative conservation stuff. ("Morning in America" was the 1984 slogan). But I note that the fallout from Regan's "success" was, unfortunately, the re-election and increased support for pseudo-conservatives around the western world. Britain retained Thatcher; Canada got one of the most corrupt governments in Canadian history, led by Brian Mulroney.

When it first got started it was a local phenomena - Pennsylvania had the first wells, so it was "homegrown"... by the time they had to go further afield, it had become essential... so many resources follow that pattern - we're hooked and have to follow the supply! So complexity can be factored in as part of the problem... what if we had stopped or reduced usage once we realized we couldn't source it locally (or at least nationally?) Might have contained the problem, if not solved it. Re-localizing is one of the main challenges in this predicament, as has been mentioned many times before.<br><br>@KL Cooke - Narcissistic Personality Disorder was retained in DSM V though they had talked about removing it... the whole process apparently had been very political, so I'm not surprised it was mentioned; glad they decided not, though.<br><br><br>@ ChrisG &amp; Donalfagan - thanks for your comments.

[Examples of such thoughts deleted to avoid derailing this discussion.]<br><br>I'm in no position to criticize people who go into debt for an education because I got mine pretty much as a birthright. My father passed a competitive exam to get into a military academy, and served as an officer during wartime. My mother started college but had to drop out because of the Great Depression. They were the first in their families to go to college. They tried to make it easier for me, probably to the detriment of my character.<br><br>As you observed, I only addressed one aspect of your original post, the charge that people who take out school loans and then try to get out of repaying them are dishonest. I wasn't really taking on the question of whether they should have borrowed money in the first place.<br><br> Opportunity for upward mobility is a big part of American culture. Early on one might rise in class by some combination of hard work and enterprise, stealing from the Indians, and slave labor. After the US got well into the industrial revolution, we had a century in which white men and some others had multiple paths to better themselves economically. <br>In my lifetime many of these opportunities have disappeared. Farming takes too much capital, lone inventors can't do much, there are few apprenticeships because skilled trades have been outsourced, small businesses are squeezed out by oligopolies and regulation, wages are kept down by a volume of immigration not seen since the 1890s, etc. <br><br>Apart from organized crime and professional sports, not much is left for working class and lower middle class youth who wish to get ahead. Social mobility here is below that of other advanced industrial countries. Elites have been over promoting higher education as the panacea for class struggle and the word has not yet gotten around that this is a false hope for most.<br><br><a href=deja-vu-all-over-again.html#c3149623045361206868 title="comment permalink">12/23/14, 1:34 AM</a><br><br>

Although touted to be capable of producing enough power for 450,000 homes, the real purpose is to supply power to compress massive amounts of natural gas for sale to Asia. The current premier has promised the future fortunes of B.C. for decades will be guaranteed by fracking gas and selling the LNG.

The Peace River Valley that will be flooded is prime valley-bottom farm land that is valuable for food production now and will be even more so in the coming decades with Global Warming.
