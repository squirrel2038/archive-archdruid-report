<div class=MsoNormal>
The three environmental shifts discussed in earlier posts in this sequence—the ecological impacts of a sharply warmer and dryer climate, the flooding of coastal regions due to rising sea levels, and the long-term consequences of industrial America’s frankly brainless dumping of persistent radiological and chemical poisons—all involve changes to the North American continent that will endure straight through the deindustrial dark age ahead, and will help shape the history of the successor cultures that will rise amid our ruins. For millennia to come, the peoples of North America will have to contend with drastically expanded deserts, coastlines that in some regions will be many miles further inland than they are today, and the presence of dead zones where nuclear or chemical wastes in the soil and water make human settlement impossible. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All these factors mean, among other things, that deindustrial North America will support many fewer people than it did in 1880 or so, before new agricultural technologies dependent on fossil fuels launched the population boom that is peaking in our time. Now of course this also implies that deindustrial North America will support many, many fewer people than it does today. For obvious reasons, it’s worth talking about the processes by which today’s seriously overpopulated North America will become the sparsely populated continent of the coming dark age—but that’s going to involve a confrontation with a certain kind of petrified irrelevancy all too common in our time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Every few weeks, the comments page of this blog fields something insisting that I’m ignoring the role of overpopulation in the crisis of our time, and demanding that I say or do something about that. In point of fact, I’ve said quite a bit about overpopulation on this blog over the years, dating back to <a href=../../2007/06/depopulation-explosion.html>this post from 2007</a>. What I’ve said about it, though, doesn’t follow either one of the two officially sanctioned scripts into which discussions of overpopulation are inevitably shoehorned in today’s industrial world; the comments I get are thus basically objecting to the fact that I’m not toeing the party line.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Like most cultural phenomena in today’s industrial world, the scripts just mentioned hew closely to the faux-liberal and faux-conservative narratives that dominate so much of contemporary thought. (I insist on the prefix, as what passes for political thought these days has essentially nothing to do with either liberalism or conservatism as these were understood as little as a few decades ago.) The scripts differ along the usual lines: that is to say, the faux-liberal script is well-meaning and ineffectual, while the faux-conservative script is practicable and evil. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus the faux-liberal script insists that overpopulation is a terrible problem, and we ought to do something about it, and the things we should do about it are all things that don’t work, won’t work, and have been being tried over and over again for decades without having the slightest effect on the situation. The faux-conservative script insists that overpopulation is a terrible problem, but only because it’s people of, ahem, the wrong skin color who are overpopulating, ahem, <i>our</i> country: that is, overpopulation means immigration, and immigration means let’s throw buckets of gasoline onto the flames of ethnic conflict, so it can play its standard role in ripping apart a dying civilization with even more verve than usual. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Overpopulation and immigration policy are not the same thing; neither are depopulation and the mass migrations of whole peoples for which German historians of the post-Roman dark ages coined the neat term
<i>v<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>ö</span>lkerwanderung</i>, which are the corresponding phenomena in eras of decline and fall. For that reason, the faux-conservative side of the debate, along with the usually unmentioned realities of immigration policy in today’s America and the far greater and more troubling realities of mass migration and ethnogenesis that will follow in due time, will be left for next week’s post. For now I want to talk about overpopulation as such, and therefore about the faux-liberal side of the debate and the stark realities of depopulation that are waiting in the future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All this needs to be put in its proper context. In 1962, the year I was born, there were about three and a half billion human beings on this planet. Today, there are more than seven billion of us. That staggering increase in human numbers has played an immense and disastrous role in backing today’s industrial world into the corner where it now finds itself. Among all the forces driving us toward an ugly future, the raw pressure of human overpopulation, with the huge and rising resource requirements it entails, is among the most important. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That much is clear. What to do about it is something else again. You’ll still hear people insisting that campaigns to convince people to limit their reproduction voluntarily ought to do the trick, but such campaigns have been ongoing since well before I was born, and human numbers more than doubled anyway. It bears repeating that if a strategy has failed every time it’s been tried, insisting that we ought to do it again isn’t a useful suggestion. That applies not only to the campaigns just noted, but to all the other proposals to slow or stop population growth that have been tried repeatedly and failed just as repeatedly over the decades just past. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
These days, a great deal of the hopeful talk around the subject of limits to overpopulation has refocused on what’s called the demographic transition: the process, visible in the population history of most of today’s industrial nations, whereby people start voluntarily reducing their reproduction when their income and access to resources rise above a certain level. It’s a real effect, though its causes are far from clear. The problem here is simply that the resource base that would make it possible for enough of the world’s population to have the income and access to resources necessary to trigger a worldwide demographic transition simply don’t exist. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As fossil fuels and a galaxy of other nonrenewable resources slide down the slope of depletion at varying rates, for that matter, it’s becoming increasingly hard for people in the industrial nations to maintain their familiar standards of living. It may be worth noting that this hasn’t caused a sudden upward spike in population growth in those countries where downward mobility has become most visible. The demographic transition, in other words, doesn’t work in reverse, and this points to a crucial fact that hasn’t necessarily been given the weight it deserves in conversations about overpopulation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The vast surge in human numbers that dominates the demographic history of modern times is wholly a phenomenon of the industrial age. Other historical periods have seen modest population increases, but nothing on the same scale, and those have reversed themselves promptly when ecological limits came into play. Whatever the specific factors and forces that drove the population boom, then, it’s a pretty safe bet that the underlying cause was the one factor present in industrial civilization that hasn’t played a significant role in any other human society: the exploitation of vast quantities of extrasomatic energy—that is, energy that doesn’t come into play by means of human or animal muscle. Place the curve of increasing energy per capita worldwide next to the curve of human population worldwide, and the two move very nearly in lockstep: thus it’s fair to say that human beings, like yeast, respond to increased access to energy with increased reproduction. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Does that mean that we’re going to have to deal with soaring population worldwide for the foreseeable future? No, and hard planetary limits to resource extraction are the reasons why. Without the huge energy subsidy to agriculture contributed by fossil fuels, producing enough food to support seven billion people won’t be possible. We saw a preview of the consequences in 2008 and 2009, when the spike in petroleum prices caused a corresponding spike in food prices and a great many people around the world found themselves scrambling to get enough to eat on any terms at all. The riots and revolutions that followed grabbed the headlines, but another shift that happened around the same time deserves more attention: birth rates in many Third World countries decreased noticeably, and have continued to trend downward since then. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same phenomenon can be seen elsewhere. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, most of the formerly Soviet republics have seen steep declines in rates of live birth, life expectancy, and most other measures of public health, while death rates have climbed well above birth rates and stayed there. For that matter, since 2008, birth rates in the United States have dropped even further below the rate of replacement than they were before that time; immigration is the only reason the population of the United States doesn’t register declines year after year. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the wave of the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As fossil fuel and other resources continue to deplete, and economies dependent on those resources become less and less able to provide people with the necessities of life, the population boom will turn into a population bust. The base scenario in 1972’s <i>The Limits to Growth</i>, still the most accurate (and thus inevitably the most vilified) model of the future into which we’re stumbling blindly just now, put the peak of global population somewhere around 2030: that is, sixteen years from now. Recent declines in birth rates in areas that were once hotbeds of population growth, such as Latin America and the Middle East, can be seen as the leveling off that always occurs in a population curve before decline sets in. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That decline is likely to go very far indeed. That’s partly a matter of straightforward logic: since global population has been artificially inflated by pouring extrasomatic energy into boosting the food supply and providing other necessary resources to human beings, the exhaustion of economically extractable reserves of the fossil fuels that made that process possible will knock the props out from under global population figures. Still, historical parallels also have quite a bit to offer here: extreme depopulation is a common feature of the decline and fall of civilizations, with up to 95% population loss over the one to three centuries that the fall of a civilization usually takes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Suggest that to people nowadays and, once you get past the usual reactions of denial and disbelief, the standard assumption is that population declines so severe could only happen if there were catastrophes on a truly gargantuan scale. That’s an easy assumption to make, but it doesn’t happen to be true. Just as it didn’t take vast public orgies of copulation and childbirth to double the planet’s population over the last half-century, it wouldn’t take equivalent exercises in mass death to halve the planet’s population over the same time frame. The ordinary processes of demography can do the trick all by themselves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s explore that by way of a thought experiment. Between family, friends, coworkers, and the others that you meet in the course of your daily activities, you probably know something close to a hundred people. Every so often, in the ordinary course of events, one of them dies—depending on the age and social status of the people you know, that might happen once a year, once every two years, or what have you. Take a moment to recall the most recent death in your social circle, and the one before that, to help put the rest of the thought experiment in context. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now imagine that from this day onward, among the hundred people you know, one additional person—one person more than you would otherwise expect to die—dies every year, while the rate of birth remains the same as it is now. Imagine that modest increase in the death rate affecting the people you know. One year, an elderly relative of yours doesn’t wake up one morning; the next, a barista at the place where you get coffee on the way to work dies of cancer; the year after that, a coworker’s child comes down with an infection the doctors can’t treat, and so on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A noticeable shift? Granted, but it’s not Armageddon; you attend a few more funerals than you’re used to, make friends with the new barista, and go about your life until one of those additional deaths is yours. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now take that process and extrapolate it out. (Those of my readers who have the necessary math skills should take the time to crunch the numbers themselves.) Over the course of three centuries, an increase in the crude death rate of one per cent per annum, given an unchanged birth rate, is sufficient to reduce a population to five per cent of its original level. Vast catastrophes need not apply; of the traditional four horsemen, War, Famine, and Pestilence can sit around drinking beer and playing poker. The fourth horseman, in the shape of a modest change in crude death rates, can do the job all by himself.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now imagine the same scenario, except that there are two additional deaths each year in your social circle, rather than one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That would be considerably more noticeable, but it still doesn’t look like the end of the world—at least until you do the math. An increase in the crude death rate of two per cent per annum, given an unchanged birth rate, is enough to reduce a population to five per cent of its original level within a single century. In global terms, if world population peaks around 8 billion in 2030, a decline on that scale would leave four hundred million people on the planet by 2130. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the real world, of course, things are not as simple or smooth as they are in the thought experiment just offered. Birth rates are subject to complex pressures and vary up and down depending on the specific pressures a population faces, and even small increases in infant and child mortality have a disproportionate effect by removing potential breeding pairs from the population before they can reproduce. Meanwhile, population declines are rarely anything like so even as<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the thought experiment suggests; those other three horsemen, in particular, tend to get bored of their poker game at intervals and go riding out to give the guy with the scythe some help with the harvest. War, famine, and pestilence are common events in the decline and fall of a civilization, and the twilight of the industrial world is likely to get its fair share of them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus it probably won’t be a matter of two more deaths a year, every year. Instead, one year, war breaks out, most of the young men in town get drafted, and half of them come back in body bags.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Another year, after a string of bad harvests, the flu comes through, and a lot of people who would have shaken it off under better conditions are just that little bit too malnourished to survive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yet another year, a virus shaken out of its tropical home by climate change and ecosystem disruption goes through town, and fifteen per cent of the population dies in eight ghastly months. That’s the way population declines happen in history. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the twilight years of the Roman world, for example, a steady demographic contraction was overlaid by civil wars, barbarian invasions, economic crises, famines, and epidemics; the total population decline varied significantly from one region to another, but even the relatively stable parts of the Eastern Empire seem to have had around a 50% loss of population, while some areas of the Western Empire suffered far more drastic losses; Britain in particular was transformed from a rich, populous, and largely urbanized province to a land of silent urban ruins and small, scattered villages of subsistence farmers where even so simple a technology as wheel-thrown pottery became a lost art. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The classic lowland Maya are another good example along the same lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Hammered by climate change and topsoil loss, the Maya heartland went through a rolling collapse a century and a half in length that ended with population levels maybe five per cent of what they’d been at the start of the Terminal Classic period, and most of the great Maya cities became empty ruins rapidly covered by the encroaching jungle. Those of my readers who have seen pictures of tropical foliage burying the pyramids of Tikal and Copan might want to imagine scenes of the same kind in the ruins of Atlanta and Austin a few centuries from now. That’s the kind of thing that happens when an urbanized society suffers severe population loss during the decline and fall of a civilization. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That, in turn, is what has to be factored into any realistic forecast of dark age America: there will be many, many fewer people inhabiting North America a few centuries from now than there are today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Between the depletion of the fossil fuel resources necessary to maintain today’s hugely inflated numbers and the degradation of North America’s human carrying capacity by climate change, sea level rise, and persistent radiological and chemical pollution, the continent simply won’t be able to support that many people. The current total is about 470 million—35 million in Canada, 314 million in the US, and 121 million in Mexico, according to the latest figures I was able to find—and something close to five per cent of that—say, 20 to 25 million—might be a reasonable midrange estimate for the human population of the North American continent when the population implosion finally bottoms out a few centuries from now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course those 20 to 25 million people won’t be scattered evenly across the continent. There will be very large regions—for example, the nearly lifeless, sun-blasted wastelands that climate change will make of the southern Great Plains and the Sonoran desert—where human settlement will be as sparse as it is today in the bleakest parts of the Sahara or the Rub’al Khali of central Arabia. There will be other areas—for example, the Great Lakes region and the southern half of Mexico’s great central valley—where population will be relatively dense by Dark Age standards, and towns of modest size may even thrive if they happen to be in defensible locations. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The nomadic herding folk of the midwestern prairies, the villages of the Gulf Coast jungles, and the other human ecologies that will spring up in the varying ecosystems of deindustrial North America will all gradually settle into a more or less stable population level, at which births and deaths balance each other and the consumption of resources stays at or below sustainable levels of production. That’s what happens in human societies that don’t have the dubious advantage of a torrent of nonrenewable energy reserves to distract them temporarily from the hard necessities of survival. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s getting to that level that’s going to be a bear. The mechanisms of population contraction are simple enough, and as suggested above, they can have a dramatic impact on historical time scales without cataclysmic impact on the scale of individual lives. No, the difficult part of population contraction is its impact on economic patterns geared to continuous population growth. That’s part of a more general pattern, of course—the brutal impact of the end of growth on an economy that depends on growth to function at all—which has been discussed on this blog several times already, and will require close study in the present sequence of posts. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br>
That examination will begin after we’ve considered the second half of the demography of dark age America: the role of mass migration and ethnogenesis in the birth of the cultures that will emerge on this continent when industrial civilization is a fading memory. That very challenging discussion will occupy next week’s post. </div>

As you noted about the Demographic Transition, birth rates have dropped in the industrialized countries as people voluntarily decided to have fewer children and population growth rates have followed suit. The incentives and techniques for reducing population growth have worked in those countries, including the U.S. to a lesser extent than, say, Japan. I list those methods for my students: lowering childhood death rates so that people don't have to have extra children to ensure that enough survive to support them in their old age (my estimate is four children on average for one "retirement plan"--two of them will likely die before the parents and one will be the wrong sex and be married off to become part of another family, leaving just one); getting the population off farms and into cities, where children become a lot less economically useful (a five year old can feed the chickens, while a child has to be about eight to ten to be economically useful in a city, even without child labor laws); widespread pensions to not rely on one's own children at all financially; increasing access to contraception; and the most effective, increasing the requirements for education, especially educating women and allowing them to work outside the home. Those all seem to work in reducing the birth rate where they have been tried, even places like Iran. Oh, I forgot one--television. Watching TV really seems to make the birth rate go down, as India is finding out.<br><br>Then there is the example of China, which imposed a one-child policy for ethnic Han (the Chinese in China) in cities in 1979 and a two-child policy for everyone else. That worked in reducing births by 200 million to 400 million over the past 35 years. China did all of the above plus fining families for extra births, reducing benefits for families that violate the law, and imposing sterilizations on women who have more children. Added to all of the incentives and policies above, that has reduced China's population growth at a very high cost. China's efforts seem to have had an effect on the world population, too. When I first started teaching about population, the textbook I was using projected the world population would reach 7 billion by 2000. The reduced birth rate in China and other countries delayed that to 2011. That may be too little, too late, but it did work to slow down the increase and delay the inevitable. Of course, if one tried the one-child policy elsewhere, the population would revolt. I understand Indira Gandhi attempted something similar about 1975, but India is the world's most populous democracy and the citizens voted her out.<br><br>I do, however, agree with you that they likely *won't* work on a global scale because they requires too much in the way of resources to happen. The important factor is environmental impact, not population per se, and impact is the result of population times affluence times technology (I = P * A * T). All of the "faux-liberal" ideas involve increasing affluence and as you correctly noted, there aren't enough resources available to support the current population, let along eight to nine billion people, at the level of prosperity required. Right now, if all seven billion of us lived at the average Chinese standard of living, let alone the U.S. one, we would exceed the planet's carrying capacity.<br><br><a href=#c529930073144315156 title="comment permalink">8/27/14, 7:23 PM</a><br><br>

One of the key aspects of the process, and the one that led to rapid increases in the populations of the industrialized countries and has caused the massive population increase you described during your lifespan for the entire planet is the lag between death rates and birth rates. In Europe, North America, and Japan, it took at least two or three generations for people to get used to the idea that most of their children would survive, so that they wouldn't need to have so many of them (the Chinese tried to short-circuit the process and do it in one). During that time, lots more people were born than died. Now Americans expect that up to 95% of their children will live to adulthood. As conditions get worse, I think that expectations game will work in reverse. People in advanced countries will still behave as if the current regime will return and restrict births waiting for good times to return. It's already happened in the U.S. Between 2007 and 2011, birthrates fell by 300,000 a year as women delayed childbirth because of the recession. That's a million fewer babies born.<br><br>http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2011/12/next-media-animation-thinks-low-birth.html<br><br>It may take decades for people to grow up in a high death rate environment to change their attitudes and have more children, speeding the process of depopulation along.<br><br>On another note, immigration isn't the only reason why the population of the U.S. isn't already in decline; all of the people born before 1971, when fertility rates dropped below replacement rate are still alive. We'll have to wait for more of us, as that group includes both you and me, to die off before birth rates and death rates equalize in the U.S. so that immigration is the only way that the U.S. grows, much like immigration is the only reason Canada's population has increased for several decades.<br><br>Finally, your figure of 20 to 25 million people in North America during the depth of the coming Dark Age looks familiar. It turns out that's just above the high estimate of the pre-European contact population of North America, 18 million people.

What a lot of rubbish as that rising tide could also just as easily drown low lying coastal areas.<br><br>People seem to be fixated on believing that the underlying problem is some sort of error in the distribution process. I reckon that is what feed the 1% meme which incidentally I see referred to less and less as time goes on. However, from my perspective it feels more like eagles circling around carrion waiting to take on all the others who may also wish to sup at their dinner. Incidentally, we just posted the highest youth unemployment figures here in 15 years and interestingly the current government blamed rising population eclipsing the available jobs. Mind you, the incumbent government are also reasonably responsible for the body blows to manufacturing sector here. As you quite correctly point out, there is simply not enough resources and energy to "lift all boats" and so I see that people are fighting over the shrinking pie. It is a big pie still, but I feel that it is not large enough to feed all the demands.<br><br>The fixation may also be an extension of the very long shadow of supply side economics which gripped the developed world in the 1980's? Perhaps also the fixation on demographic transition is simply a way around addressing the future by instead focusing on a delusion. Dunno, but it is sort of consistent with the cultural delusions.<br><br>Malnutrition, or even a lack of one or more of a broad variety of minerals in the human diet can have serious impacts on health. The soils that food in developed countries is grown in, certainly does not produce mineral dense food. To me it tastes lifeless and bland - which is probably why so much sugar and salt gets added to it.<br><br>People's ability to fight off and recover from infectious diseases is linked to their health which as you correctly point out is linked to nutrition. Just sayin...<br><br>It is worth mentioning that a decline in human numbers will be a boon to many birds, animals, microbes etc. both directly and indirectly. Our story is a circle after all and everything gets recycled in the end, only to become something new.

If I know a hundred people, and say one per year were dying already, and I add another one per year, that would be doubling the mortality rate, not a one percent increase. A one percent increase would be for every hundred people who used to die before, now a hundred and one would die. Right?<br><br>Also, I think there may be more to be said about the faux-conservative response. First, I know very few who would admit that overpopulation is a problem at all; secondly, those who do would note (perhaps callously) that insofar as it is, it's a problem in the Third World, not in the US. <br><br>Thirdly, a good portion of it shouldn't in my opinion be connected to racism, but rather tribalism of a sort. We've seen the rather spectacular failure of multiculturalism throughout Europe over the last few decades, primarily on account of a lack of integration (itself a product of cultural self-doubt and self-loathing). Not only this, but the demographic situation, when extrapolated forward without any crash assumption, means that big changes are on the horizon. France will be a Muslim country a century from now based on these linear sorts of forecasts, for example. I'm not saying they're right or wrong (I believe we'll see some large declines as you do), just that they weigh on peoples' minds.<br><br>There is a fear, in some ways legitimate and based on the very forces you've identified that accompany civilization-wide collapse, that American culture (such as it is) and values will be erased by an influx of people who hold to totally different values. Many conservatives and faux-conservatives don't want to see that happen. And I think it's unfair to attribute that to racism.<br><br>I don't consider the Japanese racist, for instance, for being an insular culture, nor would I consider it racist if for example Poland became restrictive on immigration to preserve its culture. I myself want to live among my own people and culture, and this is only loosely correlated to skin color, insofar as a northern European is more likely to hold to northern European social norms and mores. Skin color doesn't matter to me; preserving the life and culture I know does (though I want to cut the fat from it to be sure). I think most people feel this way, which is why immigrant populations that do not assimilate - or do so gradually over generations - tend to form enclaves among their countrymen. I'd do the same thing most likely if I moved to Bhutan, so I can't fault them for it. But if I hope to preserve my peoples culture, then I have good reason not to want to be overwhelmed by mass immigration. Humans are tribal, always have been and always will be. I don't want to harm other tribes, nor do I find them inferior. I just want mine to continue. Is that racism? I don't think so.<br><br>That being said, I live in North Dakota. It's not exactly a real worry; Canadians are so close to the same culture that one can hardly tell the difference. Just some food for thought. I seem to be making a habit of trying to explain the thinking behind conservative (and faux-conservative) positions on here, so I apologize, but I hope it's useful and informative to a few at least.<br><br><a href=#c1187561758512680684 title="comment permalink">8/27/14, 10:19 PM</a><br><br>

However, I will agree that the important thing is that they won't scale up to avert disaster in the future.

I've told my students that if we could continue using resources at the current rate for the rest of the century, that might work. I also tell them that I have my doubts that will be true. They've heard me say for years that if we're really lucky, world population will get to nine billion by 2050 and slowly decline. If we're not so lucky, we'll get to nine billion and then start to crash. If we are really unlucky, then we won't get to nine billion and crash after we hit eight billion.

You could call that a kind of magic - the ability to be unaware of change that takes a long time. <br><br>In fact, the magic really is the historical perspective, of which we can partake because of the change of consciousness that comes about with language, the ability to keep the story of an entire people as though the people was one individual, with a long memory. <br><br> But there's another kind of magic at play, this belief in the ability of humans to continuously progress in the unlimited control of their environment - the world in accordance with imagination. One of the consequences that magic is that people can go on living day to day without much thought to the long-term prospects of the lifestyle - and really full bellies, pretty good medicine, within the borders created by military Leviathan. To the extent that some people recognize there are problems, barbarians at the gates, real world limits to our unlimted imagination, it's not surprising that their responses more of the same: more magic in the form of making the outside world meet our expectations.<br><br><a href=#c3495802932267749187 title="comment permalink">8/27/14, 11:10 PM</a><br><br>

So it goes. <br><br>Anyway, as for population, I have heard that in Russia these days you are paid hard cash for producing children, and people are lining up for the privilege. This is occurring elsewhere in the industrial world too, such as in Denmark, where one day a week parents are permitted to pick their children up from nursery a couple of hours late in the understanding that they spend the time, er, making some new ones. <br><br>Being a resident of the British isles, I sometimes wonder whether those four horsemen will have quite as much time to play poker, at least in the early days of any severe breakdown of the norm. With so many people relying on expensive drugs just to stay alive any disruption in their supply is likely to have serious consequences. Furthermore, many farmers are now unable to grow food without the artificial props of chemical fertiliser and oil-hungry machinery. Let's not even mention delicate supply lines and the corporatisation of the food chain. <br><br>Nevertheless, in time things will level out. I, for one, regard the recent wave of immigration of people from Eastern Europe as a possible lifeline: among their number are many who still have practical skills and know how to grow food.

Knowing that organic population growth is an exponential, it made perfect sense that a small increase in the death rate compared to the birth rate could drastically affect populations. Just to be sure, however, I put it into equation form (just like some of your other users). I used the same rates you described so that people get a perspective on the scales involved when exponentials are in play.<br><br>In a very simple quick model (Mathematicians, please forgive me) we can take the rate of population births to be 'b' and rate of deaths to be 'd'. For example, a birth rate of 1% is b=1.01, while a death rate of the same amount is d=1.01 as well. To spare everyone the derivation, basically in exponential models the rate of change is proportional to the value itself at any time.<br><br>In this case:<br>N = N(0)*e^((b-d)t) where you can take t as years, N as final population and N(0) your starting population at any time.<br>When your birth rate and death rate is the same, b=d so N=N(0) (as e^0=1), and you have a stable population.<br><br>Imagining that the birth rate is 1%, and assuming the death rate is less than that, it means population growth. What if, however, over the long term the death rate increases to 2% as you suggested?<br><br>Putting that into the model, (to keep it short), how long would it take for the population to decline to 5% of the original N(0)?<br><br>299.6, i.e. 300 years. Augment that extremely simply model with the other things we're likely to see as you explained, and we're all guaranteed to hit that 5% figure far under the 300 years I calculated with my back-of-the envelope estimate.<br><br>I hope this helps those who are still struggling to understand exponential rates.<br><br>YJV<br><br><br><br><a href=#c6956101727639514493 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 5:11 AM</a><br><br>

I see the difference, but hadn’t understood that aspect before. Here the police are a state run organisation, with a federal body for the territories (eg. Canberra) and national and international activities. I'd imagine there'd be marked differences in quality, service delivery and culture between the forces in the different cities in the US? What happens when a city becomes bankrupt? Yikes!<br><br>Hi Cathy,<br><br>Exactly spot on! It is the available energy which drives the cultural response. When you know your neighbours and have to talk to them regularly, it is hard to be rude to them.<br><br>hehe! Very funny.

Friends always think that it is somehow amusing to serve me meat dishes, but I just go all honey badger on them and don’t give a...<br><br>Hi Roger,<br><br>Yeah it is complex. Youth unemployment is on the up here. Not good, especially when they're locked out of the housing market and their elders aren't. It's going to get ugly and it is hard to have a family on the street. Our rental market here is driven by investment issues and it is an unpleasant place to be in and has little long term tenure.<br><br>Still a wife and kids isn't the only solution. The military has always absorbed large numbers of youth just for one example and just because it looks like it does today, doesn't mean that's how it will continue to look tomorrow. During the depression large scale civil projects absorbed a lot of that energy here too, as did bush walking (true story).<br><br>Hi GuRan<br><br>It is a huge problem and the change has happened over such a long period of time that people don't seem to have noticed. Occasionally people complain about the food here because it tastes "too strongly". Rocket (arugula) is a good example as it has a rich mustard like flavour but when people serve me the purchased stuff it is paper thin (a dead giveaway) and tastes like cardboard.

A bit like history, big rapid changes can happen, but on the ground they can seem quotidian - like science, progressing funeral by funeral. Yet the big dramatic things from which apocalyptic tableaux are so vividly and casually painted really amount to little more than a hill of beans in the big scheme of things. <br><br>For example, take the big landmarks of the 20th century - WW1 and WW2. Without diminishing the human impact, their impression on population didn't really make any great shakes. Say the loss of a single low-to-middle ranking country of the day. Dramatic, horrendous, traumatic and fuelled by some genuine evil in places, but still really just a light snack for the equestrian quartet.<br><br>In the blue corner, though, are the regular demographic trends - say something obvious, such as referring to the fact that over the next century, around seven billion people will die, and phrases like 'die off', 'apocalypse' and 'armageddon' will surely be whispered all about. But that's just the march of time, all on its own. Said like that - seven billion people will die in the coming century - it sounds dramatic, and people will deny and bluster, yet the same people when asked 'How many people do you know who will live for another hundred years?' will probably give an answer very close to zero (maybe barring the Singularitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses - at least one of those groups still believe that 'millions living today will never die').<br><br>Of course, the number of deaths is only one side of the equation. The birth rate is just as significant to the analysis. The actual population arises from the interplay between the two. The marginal difference in rates is what drives the long-term prognosis, and at the margins it's very hard to see what's really happening on the grand scale. <br><br>Still, the political responses to population dynamics are probably more significant to our quality of life than the<br>dynamics themselves. I enjoyed the characterisation of the 'faux' ideologies - the useless vs. the evil, though I suspect there's a bit of uselessness and a bit of evil on both sides. <br><br>(Ooops, I have waffled too much and over-flowed the allowable post size.... to be continued)<br><br><a href=#c2307861700056114491 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 5:55 AM</a><br><br>

It's another bit of deniable faux-liberal racism in drag - a way of saying that the overpopulation problem is one of too many poor, dark-skinned people breeding, pointing to the massive resource use of rich, pale-skinned people as the solution by contrast. There's a certain internal dissonance in all that, in that it denies that resource consumption (especially extrasomatic energy) is what drives the population explosion initially. By and large it's NOT poor, resource constrained communities that have the higher growth rates. Sure, they may have higher birth rates, but birth isn't survival and it isn't the whole dynamic. The marginal birth-death rate is the determinant, and in the industrialised societies, we've used our extravagant resource use to tackle the death side rather (too) successfully, leaving us to mull over the birth side as the only option for keeping our own numbers in balance, and largely failing to do so. Still, we can always assuage our consumption guilt by exporting birth control to those former colonies where it's no longer politically expedient to export Bibles and smallpox. <br><br>Trying to address population issues as though they had some bearing on lines drawn on a map also strikes me as pointless in terms of population. That particular trope is all about culture, but as culture will inevitably change with declining civilisation it seems a wasted effort trying to control that aspect of things. Inappropriate adaptation seems just one of the many unintended consequences, and with a changing ecology of humanity, the cross-pollination of societies and cultures seems a better way forward than trying to maintain rigid boundaries. Equilibrium is always dynamic, and attempts at stasis always decay. I think the fact that linguitics never coincide neatly with ethnicity in the formation of nations gives us a big clue there.<br><br><a href=#c6104687498693278048 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 5:55 AM</a><br><br>

I would argue that industrial civilization has increasingly been a degenerative force on our culture and that the silver lining in the "progress" of decline is that we will be given the opportunity to culturally evolve in new directions that inherently will bring our species back into balance with our biosphere and relationship with our fellow flora and fauna. <br><br>Looking back a few hundred years from now it will be obvious that we never would have been able to evolve culturally otherwise without the forces of decline?<br><br><a href=#c2677129949054449264 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 6:26 AM</a><br><br>

To say that something that clearly worked at a local level (China, Iran, but there are other examples) failed because it was not replicated at the global level seems a bit illogical to me. Hundreds of millions of people who were almost certain to be born had these policies not been implemented were not born: therefore, the policies worked. Had everyone implemented them, they could well have worked on a global scale too.<br>Many African and Asian governments are starting to try and provide easy access to contraception to whoever wants it, which to me proves that this kind of policy is considered effective (which of course doesn't necessarily mean that it is).<br>As someone who is supremely interested in the issue of population, I have read my fair share of articles proving that very often the reason women have many children is that they cannot choose how many to have. Of course, this is not the only reason, and of course we could simply ignore contraception and let children be born and starve instead (or tell people to never have sex), but I still think that a post about population should not fail to mention contraception. The main reason Europeans and North Americans, afterall, could decide to have less children, is because birth control was available and accessible.<br>Finally, how would you explain the fact that the population in Africa, which obviously is not capable of supporting the people it already has, keeps increasing? I would say it's a mixture of overexploitation of resources that cannot last for long, and foreign aid.<br><br><a href=#c6272454775911930230 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 6:41 AM</a><br><br>

There is also a happy marriage between the Christian "go forth and multiply" and the cult of progress "technology with make everything better forever" that insists that the only real problem gumming up the works is heathen Luddites such as your and me. Essentially insisting that the pyramid/ponzi scheme of exponential growth in population will match up with the unrelenting march of science and technology onward and upward to infinity and beyond.<br><br> Which segues nicely to "the difficult part of population contraction is its impact on economic patterns geared to continuous population growth... ...the brutal impact of the end of growth on an economy that depends on growth to function at all" Adam Smith and James Watts were born less than 10 years apart and less than 100 miles away. Watts increased the efficiency of the steam engine from 1% to 4% and made it more economic than horses and Smith told us that specialization of labour gave us returns to scale.<br><br> And we built on that. For the last 300 years we have had improvements in thermodynamic efficiency, population growth, and increases to economy's of scale. We've come to depend on it. But the early gains can't be repeated. A 400% increase in efficiency can only be repeated so many times. Thermodynamic efficiency can't be increased beyond 100%, and for all practical purposes it is much lower than that. And economies of scale are constricted by energetic gradients as elaborated by Ilya Prigogine and his dissipative systems.<br><br> Everything we know is predicated on a continuous expansion, modern economics takes continuous growth as foundational, and all of our systems and structures and plans are built upon it. But the world will not abide. The energetics of our present predicament constrain us and population and complexity will be going down. Much like it has in other civilizations and populations in overshoot. Whether it is a cataclysmic crash or a slow decline depends on one's perspective. If looked at in thousands of years since agriculture this is a flash in the pan, but if looked at from a day to day perspective this train wreck is going very, very slowly.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br><a href=#c121958765886475497 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 7:50 AM</a><br><br>

In some of the classes I took on human ecology we’d talke about resource limits, read things like Limits to Growth and Collapse (my first exposure to those books), but when we actually talked about human carrying capacity we just kind of hit a blind spot. The familiar models and logistic equations didn’t work anymore and we went to discussing the usual solutions. Some students would talk about Education or widely available birth control. Others would talk about spreading their political system of choice or terraforming mars. We stopped using the language of ecology.<br><br>Could some of that blindness towards obvious patterns be cognitive dissonance from a system of inquiry hitting up against walls it can’t cross? When discussing human ecology, climate change, etc. you have to step beyond yeast cultures or fenced off nature reserves in the Serengeti and deal with complex global systems. And while science is great at working out cause and effect relationships in controlled environments it seems to have trouble when it faces the irreducible complexity of the real world. Richard Dawkins’ Selfish Gene theory, for instance, tells you a lot more about Dawkins than evolution. And the entire field of psychology focuses on human behavior and neurology but can’t even address the complexities of consciousness they arise from. Perhaps the most important questions of our time are questions we haven’t yet invented the methodology to even address properly, and that element of uncertainty itself drives people away from thinking about it.<br><br><a href=#c671124747940861600 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 8:01 AM</a><br><br>

Your point -- that demographic decline need not be catastrophic -- is a good one. It may have one paradoxical effect, though, and that is the repopulation of areas that are currently being depopulated. You see it in the towns in West Virginia close to Cumberland -- everyone is old, because all the young people have moved to Washington and other, greener pastures. It's even more evident on the Great Plains. With the reduction in the energy available for raising food, it's inevitable that there will be a reverse migration, away from the big cities back into rural areas. It's quite possible that, 200 years from now, Washington is 10% (or less) of its current size, while places like the Shenandoah Valley are more densely populated than they've been since the early years of the 20th century.<br><br><a href=#c3852091856189195835 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 8:45 AM</a><br><br>

Under such a scenario, any "reservoirs" of old and chronically sick people are exhausted within the first few years (unless society manages to continue its current practice of preferentially supporting the elderly to the detriment of young people, in which case the reaper must cut into the younger population all the sooner). One extra funeral per observer per year is a nice way of putting it, but the supply of elderly relatives to absorb the blows won't last long, and people will probably be aware that the barista and the child are each representative of millions of others outside their personal circles.<br><br>However, that model is probably not realistic for describing the near term or the early years after peak population anyhow. An S-shaped curve is more likely, with the steepest part some years in the future acting upon an already partially reduced population. This is a bit harder to model mathematically, but it can be represented as an exponential increase, following peak population, in the cumulative number of excess deaths, changing over (during the "steep part") to an exponential decay of the remaining population above the carrying capacity.<br><br>That scenario is in some ways much worse than the scenario of exponential decay from the outset, because it takes longer to relieve population pressure on the environment. Dr. Meadows at the Age of Limits '14 conference said that the most intense problems occur at the point where population levels off, because that's when the "negative pressure" required to arrest the still-strong pressure for growth is the greatest. But in the catabolic collapse model, the initial decreases in population don't ease conditions any, because the decrease in the immediate effective carrying capacity (toward a much lower long-term-sustainable carrying capacity) can continue to run ahead of the declining population, possibly for centuries. Conditions would become most abject just before and during the steep part of the S, while the environment is most in danger a few years in advance of that, when desperation could lead to many otherwise-renewable resources being over-exploited to extinction.<br><br>Conclusions regarding which types of scenario lead to the better long-term outcomes are clear enough, and morally paradoxical enough, for me to self-censor discussing them explicitly in public.<br><br><a href=#c709307413376069753 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 8:53 AM</a><br><br>

It wasn’t at all apocalyptic. It was just, as Dmitry puts it, that one morning you woke up and realised that half the people in your high-school year photos were now dead. Not with a bang; not even with a whimper; just silently, invisibly.<br><br>There’ll be some spectaclar famines and epidemics, without doubt; much chaos, exceedingly lethal wars, and on.

And so it begins.<br><br>Interestingly, both ‘The Limits To Grow’ and ‘TLTG – The Thirty-Year Update’ show human population plunging quite sharply, beginning sometime around the late 2020s/early 2030s both the death-rate AND the birth rate rise sharply (sic! Dmitry has interesting observations on why the birth-rate does that when times get really hairy). But the key point is that the death-rate is well ahead the birth-rate, and stays there; and the total world human population comes down drastically to a much lower level than the overshoot where we are now – as populations do in all these corrections, whichever species is going through them.<br><br>It’s interesting too that, despite the near-universal trashings by the guardians of othodoxy which – supposedly – annihilated TLTG and buried it ‘permanently’ when it came out, The Thirty Year Update makes it unarguably clear that the original 1972 projections have proven to be remarkably accurate, in the upshot.

Given the large rate at which first-world Boomers consume resources per capita - certainly larger than the average reproductive-age person - this population decline would definitely lessen the ecological impact, thus helping along the younger generation. (But no, I'm not volunteering to walk out on the iceberg ahead of my time.)<br><br>And like the archdruid said, this is visibly happening as we speak, in Russia, for example. Older men are dying at a rate somewhat faster than in the past, and the population as a whole is therefore declining. 40+ million fewer people in North America within a decade may sound like catastrophe to you, but that's the normal number of people dying in North America in about 7 years under the present circumstances. Thus a different balance (or lack of balance) between birth and death rates could easily reach the level of 40 million population reduction in a decade without any visible catastrophe.<br><br>That's ignoring immigration, which we'll talk about next week, but I wonder how long into our decline will the USA seem like a desirable destination for immigrants - there has reportedly already been a large dip in net immigration post-2008.<br><br><a href=#c9050483904657725260 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 10:17 AM</a><br><br>

I'd think a couple of selfies with "little brown people" in certain restricted areas would get the message across with less waste and destruction then conventionally. Maybe that can drive a reassessment...<br><br>@Pinku<br>Thanks for the comments, saved me a lot of writing. Sadly there seem to be only few family traditions from which one can draw from in this respect ;). <br>I assume rules &amp; tax(breaks) for kids, inheritance, should really be changed.<br>The up-front cost versus bottom line cost/benefit of kids is a significant factor I believe. Next to social considerations that can vary a lot. Like you say it is very much dependent on your environment (also in time I guess, i.e. life experience) and your anticipation of change. This is where I think there is the most potential for reducing fertility rate, especially with regard to women. Weed/porn/xbox may be too resource intensive as a general solution (even though it is a start), and may need some tweaks to push it onto women successfully :). Also, I expect men to be far more easy to manipulate than women in matters of fertility. On the other hand my impression is we never really tried until now. And even now, most of the time we just allow women "to be like men" in most respects (at least in the West). Would it be possible to design fulfilling, attractive, yet low footprint lifestyle that does NOT mix with kids for women?<br><br>@Derv<br>There's a handful of points where I would beg to differ. Although, I believe given enough back an forth we would not see much qualitative difference. But there are one and a half exceptions:<br>"We've seen the rather spectacular failure of multiculturalism throughout Europe over the last few decades, primarily on account of a lack of integration (itself a product of cultural self-doubt and self-loathing)"<br>This is a rather complex issue, and in my opinion, not adequately addressed with a pass/fail metric. I am not so sure I share the mores with "the dominant tribe" the way things are going. <br>The other reason: There was a nice little video that showed a timeline of battles (granted not of violent deaths in general) superimposed on a map. Sobering with regard to Europe to say the least.<br>The other thing is whenever I hear sentences to the effect of "Humans are tribal, always have been and always will be." I need to stop yapping and turn of the flashing red light. Sure, we can argue about what tribal means in this or that context...<br>I just have to think of the Angles and the Vandals that at some point did not live very far from another (not sure how long the Angles go back though). These two should be enough to illustrate that results of large scale migrations are a very mixed bag and hard to predict for all parties involved. And "Germany" is a bit of a construct too from that perspective. I probably agree with you that one should take mores seriously. However, I don't want to stand in the way of an ongoing ethnogenesis on the grounds of vested short term interests peddled to me via mass media. <br><br><br><a href=#c269690476060511624 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 12:08 PM</a><br><br>

Pull is what is going on most of the time, where there is an economic pull (more or less acknowledged) with subsequent family reunification. Push is refugees from mostly temporary hot-spots within a nation. And rolling would start when cultural entities of sufficient scale and inertia start moving into (or through) a place in such a scale that they are their own political (and military) representation. I don't see that happening today or tomorrow, but once a different narrative of the future catches on, who knows. Maybe just a couple of families in the beginning.

From Titusville to the first year of the Bush I presidency, was over130 years (1989). Yet in the ensuing 25 years we've burned through an equal amount of oil. Not surprising, given that no "oil-burning technology" existed in 1860, very little for decades to come, but, by 1989, a voracious oil-hungry infrastructure was ready to gobble up any available petroleum, using technologies undreamed of even in the 1940's (I thinking here of oil-based textiles, but I'm sure there are at least dozens of others).

It'd be quite different if they were thoroughly Japanese (which, once again, is not at all an insult to the Japanese or any other culture).<br><br>@Shawn...well, I'll wait for JMG's response, but I think you're incorrect. He says immediately after the thought experiment:<br><br>"Now take that process and extrapolate it out. (Those of my readers who have the necessary math skills should take the time to crunch the numbers themselves.) Over the course of three centuries, an increase in the crude death rate of one per cent per annum, given an unchanged birth rate, is sufficient to reduce a population to five per cent of its original level."<br><br>And then he says:<br><br>"Now imagine the same scenario, except that there are two additional deaths each year in your social circle, rather than one. That would be considerably more noticeable, but it still doesn’t look like the end of the world—at least until you do the math. An increase in the crude death rate of two per cent per annum, given an unchanged birth rate, is enough to reduce a population to five per cent of its original level within a single century."<br><br>That seems to pretty obviously associate "two more deaths" with "two percent increase," which is incorrect. It might be a simple phrasing issue, but an increase in deaths by 2 people per year does not at all equate to a 2% increase.<br><br>@latefall<br>I suspect that you're right, in that we'd mostly agree after a back-and-forth. It is a complex issue, and certainly overly simplistic to simply say "failure" or "success" to multiculturalism, but I don't think it's unfair that the vision once held of a unified European set of values combined with myriad diverse cultures living in harmony hasn't turned out as hoped. Rather we are seeing fracturing, "balkanization," resurgent fascism, far-right reactionary movements, and a lack of adoption of European values by many immigrant populations even after two generations. I don't quite get what the flashing red light comment means, but understand that my comments aren't meant to make a value judgment on these things. I'm simply observing them. Humans have always been tribal, and something that was not tribal would in many significant ways not be human as we currently understand it. Any expectations we have of human activity needs to account for it. And if we categorize it as racism, well, then humanity is itself inherently racist (which I don't agree with).<br><br><a href=#c7833749176341243110 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 1:58 PM</a><br><br>

Thoughtful, informed speculation on the long road down is preferable to simplistic WAGs or weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br><br>I think human extinction is possible but not probable, but I’ve also been wondering if it would be such a bad thing. We are looking at a long, hard road down, with many deep and dangerous valleys before our descendants finally start a gradual climb up again (if they ever do). Commenters here say that a good and satisfying life is possible with a very much reduced lifestyle (and I know they’re not talking about just giving up cars and ipads and supermarkets!). Yes, that’s true, but there will come a point in our descent where even that lifestyle, with whatever happiness and satisfaction it has, will be available to very few (if any), and our descendants will then have to struggle through the misery, deprivation, and death of those dark valleys before they have any possibility of attaining anything like that “reduced” lifestyle on the other side.<br><br>So my question is: why? It may be for the good of the species to survive the morass to come, but it’s going to be tough on the people. To borrow an example from the instructor in a Coursera class I’m taking (great class; more about it later), the child dying of starvation and malnutrition in first century China did not say to herself, “I’m dying, but it’s ok, because my death is justified - redeemed? – by all the benefits the agricultural revolution will give to people 2000 years from now.” Will our many-greats granddaughters say to themselves, as they watch their children starve, “It’s ok, their deaths are justified – redeemed? – because the human race will eventually have a better future”? Somehow, I don’t think so.<br><br>And it’s not like homo sapiens is exactly necessary for the earth to function. More like the opposite, I would say.<br><br>Regardless of what the answer is to my question, I know that the “life force” will go on, people will continue to have children, the species will continue to try to survive. I myself already have a grown son and two grandchildren committed to the effort. Given that, I think the best response to the situation is the one that you, Mr. Archdruid sir, propose: to figure out as much about the possible futures as we can, to face those futures, and to try to preserve “needful things”, in hopes that the knowledge we preserve can ease the long road down for our descendants and that some of it will still be available to those who climb out the other side of the morass.<br><br>And yes, before you ask, I am working on it.<br><br>This has been on my mind for awhile.

It's standard for a civilization in the early stages of decline. <br><br>Derv, I see the confusion. Let's say the death rate was one per cent per annum. It increases to two per cent. That's an increase of one per cent per annum -- not a one per cent increase in the sense you mean!

Imagine, for instance, something that anecdotal evidence suggests may be happening in the US: the increase in death rate kills older people preferentially over younger people. Of the last four people who died among my circle, three of them were in their 60s; two of them died of cancer, one of a progressive lung disease. Repeated over a whole society, this would shift median age downward over time. Now imagine, instead, that it preferentially affects children to young adults: the median age would shift upward. It seems to me that this would have noticeably different effects on the human ecology of the two societies even if other factors are the same. Is there any consistent trend along this line among civilizations in decline? If there is, what is its effect?<br><br>From the birth end of things, about ten years ago, in his book Radical Simplicity, Jim Merkel wrote that his calculations indicated that if everyone has only one descendent who in turn has only one descendent and so on, it would only take 100 years to drop the world population from 6 billion (about what it was then) to 1 billion. This assumed no change in death rate. Similar to some other readers, my birth family has seen something close to this. My parents had four children. My siblings and I have six among us (two sons each per sibling, no children for me). Of those children, who range in age from 9 to 30, not one has had a child to date. True, the two youngest, at 9 and 11, have lots of years to have children. But my 30 year old nephew has been married two years with no children so far. <br><br>On the other end of things, my father, who died two years ago at age 86, might be the last person in our family who dies of old age. He had medical insurance so he could have medicines and surgeries in his 60s that prolonged his life (and quality of life) and another surgery and nursing home care during the last several weeks of his life that increased the GDP even though they did nothing for him. I don't expect to have any of these; I can't afford medical insurance and don't have a personal physician as a result. I have not been in an MD's office in 13 years. I do my best to stay healthy and useful, but the stress of living in an age of declining economic output will, I expect, kill me earlier than I would have died if the resources my parents and grandparents had available in middle and old age were available to me. So be it. I'd still rather have my life than theirs, for my own reasons. At least that's what I think now. Ask me again in 10 or 20 years, if I'm still around.<br><br><a href=#c5910568474035179892 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 2:57 PM</a><br><br>

Just one of the services I offer...<br><br>Scott, 200 years from now, Washington DC will be mostly under water, so its population will be fairly low!

It's "the machinery of heaven," the ordinary not-quite-balance of births and deaths, that do the thing.

I expect to see different regions, nations, and social strata take demographic hits at different rates, with steep dieoff in one place balanced by relative stability in others. Thus where the misery is worst will vary drastically depending on where you are, and a galaxy of other variables. <br><br>That said, I've noted several times already in these essays that I expect the next four or five decades to witness a crisis on the scale of the one that slammed Europe between 1914 and 1954. That on top of the downward demographic pressures already coming into play may cause some very steep declines for a while in North America, among other places: not just among the old, but spikes in child mortality, not to mention young men of draft age! More on this as we proceed.<br><br>Donal, exactly! You get tonight's gold star for noticing that. <br><br>Thrig, I'll take your word for it -- I don't speak C. ;-)<br><br>Michael, that's a valid choice, and one that a lot of people are making these days. <br><br>BoysMom, the canary in the coal mine I'm watching is childhood and infant mortality -- that's already very high in the US compared to other industrial nations.

Much more on this as we proceed. <br><br>Rudyspeaks, a lot of the oil-burning technology we have could be left rusting with empty fuel tanks without causing any particular loss to the rest of industrial society. Go look up, for example, just how much fuel could be saved if the global tourism industry were to be shut down, the way it was during the Second World War! That's among the reasons why I continue to find the shark-fin scenario unconvincing. <br><br>Jonathan, thank you -- I've got a copy. <br><br>Joe, any linear process extended far enough ends in absurdity. The estimate you've quoted is a great example. <br><br>Wolverine, as I see it, nothing I will or won't do will have any impact on how soon humanity goes extinct. Whether or not humanity should survive is thus not something I worry about. On the other hand, what I do now may have a real impact on the next few centuries, so that's what gets my attention. Of course your mileage may vary!<br><br>SLClaire, and of course that's a massive issue. When times are hard, the old and the young tend to die more often; the old don't have much of an impact on the overall population, but a spike in infant and childhood mortality -- since it removes people from the population before they can breed -- has a disproportionate effect. <br><br>Derv, not a problem. I wasn't as clear as I could have been.<br><br>Maria, exactly. It's not an easy subject, but it has to be taken into account. <br><br>Ray, I think you're right -- add on the impact of a collapsing empire to the other downward pressures on US demographics, and a very steep early decline rate is a real possibility.<br><br><a href=#c6502080613931366780 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 5:09 PM</a><br><br>

And please don't tell me I don't understand when I'm appreciating a nuance which is being overlooked. I get exponential growth very well. I learned about it when learning calculus as a pup and also when I learned physics.

Because fellow readers, WE ARE STILL GROWING! The change in cultural values needed to begin a planned decline would be huge and nothing on the radar says it is even in the pike.<br><br>Beyond which, this is beginning to be nonsensical. The world is not going to cooperate with any 'barely noticeable' population decline planned or otherwise. We could easily be out of resources to maintain half our present population within fifty years. Very easily. Kiss slow collapse goodbye, no hardly noticeable drop in population per year is going to cut the population in half within fifty years.<br><br>The odds of the world cooperating with or producing on its own a population exponential with the time constant we are discussing is nil. That what the -.009779 in my equation is called by the way. It has a name.

We are a civilization in severe overshoot and we will fall long before an 'extra death or so a year' can possibly save us.<br><br>However it happens, the world in 300 years will have far fewer people in it.

We are looking at a long, hard road down, with many deep and dangerous valleys before our descendants finally start a gradual climb up again (if they ever do). Commenters here say that a good and satisfying life is possible with a very much reduced lifestyle (and I know they’re not talking about just giving up cars and ipads and supermarkets!). Yes, that’s true, but there will come a point in our descent where even that lifestyle, with whatever happiness and satisfaction it has, will be available to very few (if any), and our descendants will then have to struggle through the misery, deprivation, and death of those dark valleys before they have any possibility of attaining anything like that “reduced” lifestyle on the other side."<br><br>I have a somewhat different perspective here. Rates of depression (a pretty good index of "misery") are higher in the developed world now than they have probably ever been. The problem, as I see it, is that the human psyche did not evolve in a safe environment, and that absent real risk, pain, and threat there is little that truly matters. When nothing really matters in a life-or-death way we attach great meaning to things like sports, prized possessions, TV shows, and celebrity relationships. Our never-used fight-or-flight response morphs into a continuous low-level anxiety about our jobs, our security, our children, etc.<br><br>Wars come and go, and battles last only days to weeks. Plagues pass, and for any one person the sickness strikes only once, resulting in either death or survival and recovery. Droughts and crop failures create famines, but ensuing good years will bring periods of plenty, at least to those who are growing the food. <br><br>I cannot say I look forward to a world where physical suffering becomes more common, but I long for a return to an existence where real things matter. Where a good harvest brings joy and celebration. Where good farm planning is important not just for satisfaction but for health and survival. Where the cycles of weather and seasons cease to be mere curiosities through the windows of our climate-controlled spaces but instead become realities in which we are enmeshed. There is a certain spark of life in those people who have come close to death and survived. There is a certain joy that is inextricably intertwined with a inevitability of change and loss. If JMG's vision of the future comes to pass, I have a feeling that life will become both more difficult and more meaningful for the creatures we call humans.<br><br><a href=#c197298023785523732 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 7:36 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not sure its as complicated as some have presented. The implied assumption is that the before the increase in deaths, the birth rate and death rate are equal. After the start point you just decrease the population by 1% every year by increasing the death rate by that amount but keeping the birth rate constant. Thus after t years you will have (0.99)^t of the original population. If your end point is 5% (or 0.05) then:<br><br>(0.99)^t = 0.05<br><br>Take the log of both sides of the equation and solve for t and you have (recalling log (x^y) = y log(x))<br><br>t = log(0.05)/log(0.99) = 298 years<br><br>Similarly for a 2% decrease per year<br><br>t = log(0.05)/log(0.98) = 148 years<br><br>You were close enough for a net 1% per year decrease in population. You were a little off for the 2% per year decrease. I expect you relied on somebody else's math.<br><br>Just for completeness sake; a decrease to 5% in 100 year can be determined as follows:<br><br>r^100 = 0.05<br><br>Again take the log of both sides and divide both sides of the equation by 100 and you get<br><br>log (r) = log (0.05)/100<br><br>Now raise 10 to the quantity on both sides of the equation (recalling 10^log(x) = x for base 10 logarithms)<br><br>r = 10^[log(0.05)/100] = 0.97<br><br>This implies a 3% decrease per year (not 2%)<br><br>None of this affects your basic point which is well made regardless.<br><br><a href=#c1038575537651308183 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 8:56 PM</a><br><br>

It's refreshing to read something that fully admits the reality of overpopulation but doesn't fall into predictable thought camps on the issue.<br><br>I find that people around me tend to fall into two categories. The 1st: Quite a few believe that overpopulation is not a problem. "Malthus was wrong," they say, and treat any mention of overpopulation as automatically racist. These folks have no concept of carrying capacity (maybe for other species, but not for us) nor of the phantom carrying capacity that has been temporarily enabled by fossil fuels. <br><br>Unfortunately, I tend to find myself at odds with those of the 2nd category, who do grasp that the world is overpopulated. They often view population as an independent variable not as a dependent one, looking at it in isolation from other factors. "People should stop having children," they seem to say. Statements about choices people "should" make tend to annoy me, for they usually indicate what's not going to happen. I think what also bothers me is the tone of judgement, the lack of understanding of the reasons why people do have children, and that such statements tend to come from older overprivileged white males. I say this as someone who has chosen not to have children for multiple reasons, one being overpopulation. For me though, it's a personal decision, not a directive of what choices others should make. Nor do I believe that it makes much difference in the scheme of things. For myself, passing myself down genetically to future generations is unimportant to me, but passing myself down through cultural means (in whatever small way) is something I hope I accomplish.<br><br>One other point: While I think it's impossible to prevent a deep drop in human population over the coming century or two, I don't think that's an excuse to sit back view all increased deaths as just "nature taking its course" and not to work to avoid the most evil kinds of deaths, to the extent we can. Even though an increase of suffering is unavoidable these next few centuries, I think some kinds of suffering are more abhorrent than others. I would rather that genocide not be a major depopulation force, and less traumatic processes contributing more to lower life expectancy. For one small example, the end of energy/resource-intensive modern medicine that has prolonged the dying process for the elderly will increase the death rate some, but in my mind, that's not entirely a tragedy.<br><br>It's paradoxical the amount of attention we place on death in our society. In some ways, death is all around us: in violent movies and video games, in the daily news media, yet so few of us deeply and fully contemplate our own deaths and thus never fully live. In the process of become more collapse-aware, I have started to contemplate my death more (which would have been good to do regardless of the future trajectory). I recently went to the memorial for my grandmother, who died at age 100. I was thinking how I'll likely die earlier than all my grandparents (all who lived to at least 86), but to me the quantity of years is not what I strive for. I want to die having lived fully, regardless of whether I die at 41, 73, or 100...<br><br><a href=#c7805314773727032716 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 9:22 PM</a><br><br>

I'm startled, though, that you think I'm talking about planned population decrease. I'm not -- I'm talking about war, famine, pestilence, the collapse of public health, death rates soaring as the economy grinds to a halt and some semblance of a replacement has to be jury-rigged, etc., etc. Because there's a great deal of waste and unnecessary expenditure of energy and resources in the current industrial system -- again, consider the energy and resources that could be saved almost at once by shutting down the global tourism industry! -- I think there's a lot more wiggle room than you do; more wiggle room will become available as war, famine, pestilence, etc. hammer the human population and free up resources for the survivors. That will likely spread out the demographic decline, as I see it. <br><br>One of the reasons why the thought experiment may actually turn out to be closer to the reality than, say, an S-shaped curve is that it's entirely possible we could get a really sharp dieoff in the next few decades: say, a global pandemic, or a civil war here in the US that shreds what's left of the economy and public health infrastructure, with all sides doing their best to deny food and other resources to the others. I think you can see how that could take out a fairly large fraction of the North American population in a hurry, and leave the following decades to proceed at a slower pace. Still, all this is in the realm of incident, which can't be predicted in advance. <br><br>Nuku, well, I've mentioned here several times that I've long suspected that the Baby Boomers may manage one more mediagenic fad on their way out: suicide parties, where they get together with their aging friends for one last fun evening, then down the pills and booze and help each other tie plastic bags over their heads. <br><br>Kutamun, that seems plausible enough. Underground dwellings, like those hobbits prefer, might indeed be worth exploring with an eye toward brushfire season. <br><br>Agent, fair enough. No, I worked this up on my slide rule -- clearly I got something messed up partway through the second calculation. <br><br>Beneath, excellent. The whole issue of what I like to call "yotta language" -- "yotta do this, yotta do that" -- and the corruption of morality by the word "should" is one that needs a discussion here one of these days. As for making sure that the causes of death shift toward the less hideous, yes, that's something that deserves attention: Nature will certainly take her course, but that doesn't imply any particular route to get there.<br><br><a href=#c8110572286005743698 title="comment permalink">8/28/14, 10:08 PM</a><br><br>

It wasn't at all apocalyptic. It was just, as Dmitry puts it, that one morning you woke up and realized that half the people in your high-school year photos were now dead. Not with a bang; not even with a whimper; just silently, invisibly.<br><br>By not producing any actual numbers Dimitry gives the impression here that the population decline was something like 50%. This has led to an exaggeration of what happened in Soviet Russia. So let us define “sharp downturn” using some real data, shall we?<br><br>Russia lost: 4% of pop, or about 6.8 million over a 20 year period beginning in the early 1990’s (And how much of that was emigration?). To get to the 10% per decade loss we are proposing for the US, Russia would have needed to lose 29.7 million during that two decade period. So to get our 10% decrease in US population per decade, we need something 4 times worse than what happened to Soviet Russia. So the question is: What would have to happen to produce conditions in the US that are 4 times worse than the collapse of Soviet Russia? (And to follow up on K-dogs point we are growing much faster that Russia was before its collapse). By my estimates the US needs an extra 4.7 million deaths a year to decline by 1% per year if the number of births stays the same. That won’t be easy or unnoticed. Come on secret Monsanto plague labs, work your magic!<br><br>JMG said Gaiabaracetti, they didn't keep the world's population from doubling. That's a tolerably good meaning for "failed," as far as I can see.<br><br>This seems a bit harsh. Something cut global birth rates in half since the 1950’s. What was it? Maybe it wasn’t “liberals”, but if they did contribute towards keeping the population from being 14 billion instead of 7 billion, I’d have to give them at least a C rather than an F.

Most ecologists are pretty aware of the things behind the issue of human population growth, and also pretty aware that the networks that make it possible are pretty rickety. The problem is that once the opportunity for people to start testing the theories and models about how, when, and where these changes will start hitting hard come, those theories and models will be the last things on anybody’s mind. When you turn the things we know about nature onto the lived experience of the whole of the human species today, there’s not a way to step out of the mess and make sense of it. Our society’s entire approach to knowledge requires that you be able to study things from the outside. When an anthropologist starts experiencing the culture they’re studying internally, the research is corrupted. Psychologists study behavior and neurology of others without reflecting internally on the workings of our own minds, and ecologists study ecosystems and population dynamics very well, even those that include humans. It feels like there’s another myth at work in the failings of science to capture the workings of global systems of which happen to be a part. Perhaps it could be called the myth of the detached observer.

All was going well until WW1 broke out and the authorities attempted to conscript him into the then Queens Army of Canada to fight the Hun.

The technique: I kept the crude birth rate constant at the current rate of 2%. The crude death rate starts off at the current rate of about .8%. Each year the rate increases by 40%. The multiplier of 40% is chosen empirically to give a world population of 0 at the end of 2030. All numbers are in millions. Year Deaths Pop. 2015 58 7,200 2016 82 7,286 2017 117 7,350 2018 167 7,379 2019 235 7,360 2020 328 7,273 2021 451 7,091 2022 610 6,781 2023 802 6,307 2024 1,011 5,631 2025 1,201 4,732 2026 1,300 3,626 2027 1,215 2,398 2028 881 1,231 2029 378 374 2030. Four years have more than a billion deaths per year (over 100 times the WWII death rate), but they come near the end of the die-off. There is no way to predict the shape of the curve. It all depends on what kind of shit hits the fan and when. To provide some context, my article on sustainability from last year estimates that a truly sustainable global population is around 35 million. You can see from the numbers just how close that is to zero given our current population. But it’s more people than existed on the planet until about 3000 BCE – 5,000 years into the agricultural revolution. To be absolutely clear, I do not think that 100% extinction within 15 years has more than a 1% or 2% probabilit Also note that even under these draconian assumptions the population doesn’t drop back below today’s value until the sixth year. Here, I’ll see if this makes the chart more readable: Year | Deaths| Population 2015 |||| 58 | 7,200 2016 |||| 82 | 7,286 2017 ||| 117 | 7,350 2018 ||| 167 | 7,379 2019 ||| 235 | 7,360 2020 ||| 328 | 7,273 2021 ||| 451 | 7,091 2022 ||| 610 | 6,781 2023 ||| 802 | 6,307 2024 | 1,011 | 5,631 2025 | 1,201 | 4,732 2026 | 1,300 | 3,626 2027 | 1,215 | 2,398 2028 ||| 881 | 1,231 2029 ||| 378 | 374 2030. Oh, as to causes – my top candidate is infectious disease, followed in descending order by starvation, dehydration and violence. There may well be massive wars in that period, but I don’t think even a thermonuclear war has the ability to kill this number of people directly.

And that is the goal, as it is in all the other collapse preparation topics mentioned here.<br><br>Regarding the exponential math, there are so many ways to do it. The easiest, for quick "in your head" approximation, is the concept of doubling time. Or in this case, halving time. Divide 70 by the percent-per-unit-time rate to get the doubling time. E.g., in the 1% per year thought experiment, that is 70/1 = 70 years for a halving. I.e., 70x4 = 280 years for 4 halvings, meaning a division of the population by 2x2x2x2 = 16 fold. That's to 100%/16 or about 7% of the original number. A bit further by 300 years (280 + another 20), as seen in other's calculations above.<br><br>Double the rate (to 2% per year) and you halve the doubling time, so it'll take 150 rather than 300 years. No fancier math needed!<br><br>Yes this is the late Albert Bartlett's logic in reverse. Once in a while, when I can grab an audience, I give talks with the essential points from his famous lecture that he repeated thousands of times. Others need to take up that torch now that he's passed on. As he said, "the greatest shortcoming of the human race is the inability to understand exponential growth". Any cracks we can make in that "inability" may help reduce suffering.<br><br><br><a href=#c8838127965353656883 title="comment permalink">8/29/14, 10:19 AM</a><br><br>

One thing I would like to mention that I feel will greatly contribute to population decline in North America is the increase in the percent of people who are infertile or have fertility problems.<br><br>I am in my early 30s and have had significant issues with my reproductive system for several years, as has my wife. A few times a year I go to visit a reproductive specialist who, ahem, helps keep my biological cycles in working order.<br><br>I've talked with him several times about his clientele, and while his bread and butter are the upper middle class clients who pay for IVF, he treats many women for the same problems I have and the number of younger women (under 25) who come in with serious issues has, in his words, "exploded" in the past 10 years alone. He sees a lot of women between 16 and 21 who come in with NO ovarian reserves (and therefore no chance of ever having children naturally) and who have no risk factors for this condition. Granted he sees only the extreme cases, but how many less extreme ones are being treated by their OB/GYNs?<br><br>Sorry to make the men on here uncomfortable, but I think it's a significant problem. The quantity and quality of male sperm in the U.S. is also declining.<br><br>Finally, I have one more relocation question for you JMG. Where do you think an aquatic biologist would do well in the future? I happen to be married to one, and we're trying to find some place more hospitable to same-sex couples, be more sustainable in the long run, and will also offer her likely job prospects.

We both no better than that. <br><br>But as we have been discussing a smooth exponential decrease it is somewhat implied for the world would certainly then be behaving 'as if'. And my language has reflected that fact. Last vestiges of idealism perhaps, but it would be the best way to preserve cultural continuity, or what I'll call anti-collapse here.<br><br>Leaving that fairy tale behind your answer of a fairly large fraction of the North American population being taken out in a hurry, with following decades declining at a slower pace makes sense. An initial rapid decline would result from civilization falling apart. Survivors would find themselves in a damaged world but in a stable though far more uncomfortable environment than we experience. Numbers now would be determined by the earth's natural carrying capacity.<br><br>The world in a sense stabilizes as it adjusts to the loss of our <i>phantom carrying capacity</i> which resulted from having resources, and from being civilized. (Thank you <i>beneaththesurface</i>) However stability in this stage is only relative to the circumstances lived through when civilization unwound. Survivors would continue to decline as the earth’s surface becomes more adverse. Decline is at a slower rate with natural carrying capacity being the driver. Radiation hot zones expand and climate change brings new deserts. Life is generally difficult brutish and short. Part of the decline at this stage would result from not having skills needed for survival in the new world environment. Development of these skills would be one of the factors that would finally arrest population decline. Evolution of new culture.<br><br>Two kinds of carrying capacity come into play, but at the end of it all, in 300 years. There could be 20 million in North America and a stranger might be able to walk into a village without being eaten. A stranger might even be welcome in town.<br><br>Imagine yourself a stranger walking into this village, a hundred and fifty miles from where you have lived and grown. You have never been there before. Whom do you see? Are the villagers diverse in appearance or do they all look the same, like brother and sister? Hopefully, you see diversity in the village which would represent the cosmopolitan constitution of our present population. <br><br>If all you see is brothers and sisters it could mean we passed through a time very close to Guy Mcpherson's near term extinction; a bottleneck between then and now where only a remnant remained. A measure of diversity shows how difficult the struggle has been.<br><br>Contemplating the realm of the incident, which can't be predicted in advance, a myriad of paths to twenty million in a future world temporarily living within limits are possible. While not everything we can imagine is possible an infinity of possibilities still remains.<br><br><a href=#c7922618023309867097 title="comment permalink">8/29/14, 12:10 PM</a><br><br>

I was unaware of that. <br><br>Gloucon, I figured that war, famine, and pestilence had something to do with it. The years from 1960 to now have seen quite a few of those, you know. <br><br>Pierluigi, there are a few historical parallels -- the Black Death comes to mind, and might be worth research. Still, if you think I'm talking about a BAU decline, I'd like to suggest that you haven't been paying attention. I'm talking about the collapse of a civilization, drastic depopulation, wars, famines, pestilences, etc., spun out -- as it's usually spun out in the real world -- over one to three centuries of chaos. A 10% or 20% drop in population during one of the decades in the middle there is entirely plausible.<br><br>Raven, good. You're asking the right questions. <br><br>RPC, my take is that population rose following its usual curve, and is now peaking for biological rather than political/social/etc. reasons. Certainly the grand projects for controlling population didn't do what their proponents claimed they would do. <br><br>St. Roy, White's Law pretty much requires that, so Chefurka's on solid ground.<br><br>Mortal, true enough. <br><br>Progress4what, given that assumption, shouldn't you be delighted that other people are removing their genes from the game, since that makes yours that much more likely to be propagated? <br><br>Eric, oh, granted -- and it's when people are too deeply involved in something to think clearly about it that they fall back most automatically on the mythic narratives that structure their thinking. <br><br>Ed-M, the precontact people of the Americas didn't have most of our current range of livestock, which are extremely efficient at turning biomass to human food, and they lacked a range of other relatively simple technologies that boost human carrying capacity. That's the basis of my estimate. As for clathrates, I expect to see those being hawked one of these days as the basis for another fracking-style boom. As with all the other "extreme hydrocarbon" projects, the fossil fuel industry is being very careful not to talk about the cost or the net energy...<br><br><a href=#c1464247765075543534 title="comment permalink">8/29/14, 12:48 PM</a><br><br>

If we start seeing more of that -- well, in that case I'm going to have to revise some expectations of mine, as I didn't expect a general collapse of faith in the Great God Progress to happen anything like this soon. <br><br>Moshe, fair enough. <br><br>Rebecca, yes, that's also an issue -- dump toxic chemicals into the ecosystem with that kind of abandon, and you're going to get problems like that. As for relocation, have you looked into the Great Lakes basin? That and the Ohio and upper Mississippi watersheds ought to be fairly tolerant, as well as having jobs for an aquatic biologist -- I hope she knows her way around freshwater as well as saltwater ecosystems. <br><br>WW, that's one crucial point. Another is that "ought" implies an objective standard of values, and a very strong case can be made that values are irreducibly personal and perspectival. As Nietzsche pointed out, unless you've got a divine legislator handing out "Thou Shalt Nots" to all and sundry, the entire notion of moral exhortation and condemnation becomes very difficult to justify. <br><br>K-dog, the point of the thought experiment was simply to show that huge losses can happen while people just go about their lives. I suspect there will be a fair bit of that -- just as the standard of living for most Americans has dropped sharply since the 1970s, and yet very few people have made a big fuss about it. I also expect a flurry of crises, fast and slow, that also hammer down population, but it's crucial not to miss the underlying demographic tide. <br><br>As for the village 300 years from now, if it's like most villages, it's used to strangers -- tinkers, traders, religious pilgrims, perhaps a mobile caste of blacksmiths or horse thieves, all part of the normal texture of village life.

I’ll probably to see some of those horsemen ride through town a few times, and one of them will probably be offering me a ride before I’m even middle aged… Any achievements I make toward my life dreams will be short-lived, and any work that I put towards the earth or the future will be absorbed and lost in the static of the time. The young children I know will be facing much the same future I will, crushed dreams, grinding poverty, and early death. Even the religious tradition I find truth and fulfillment in, as you’ve pointed out in the past, is unlikely to link to a lineage that touches the future in any lasting way. One of the themes of this series of posts is that the future, like the stars, does not belong to us. It comes back down to those questions of meaning and purpose that you raised early on in this series. My motivation has often been my place in a greater whole and the hope my actions may echo beyond me in some shape or form, now I’m realizing I may not have a place in that thread. Where do you turn when you find you no longer have a place in that whole, and that even what few positive actions you make will be silenced in the chaos of the times? Where do you find the strength to do what needs to be done when it means ridicule and alienation even from people you care about?

True, (.99)^300=~.05 and (.98)^100=~.13, so indeed the 4 horsemen need not show up for serious population contraction. And I completely understand your stairstep view: young men not returning from war, common diseases carrying weakened people off in bad times, exotic diseases indiscriminately carrying people off at other times.<br><br>Like many here I like history and do a lot of reading.... What I've read suggests that in most collapses there occur almost unimaginable episodes that go far beyond even the disasters you've described. Also, maybe more importantly, I believe you've left out two basically universal aspects of collapse. The first is a general uptick in the violence in society (and not just due to warfare), and the second is that warfare does not confine itself to "elsewhere" (borderlands, foreign adventurism, young men going off and not returning), but eventually makes it *everywhere*, though not all at once.<br><br>I'd love to illustrate with examples ('cause that's what history nerds do), but don't want to monopolize space.<br><br>As for decimation, I understand there is some dispute as to how common it actually was.

The gist: "Seven in 10 [Americans] believe the U.

It’s the new “new frontier.” Because it’s so antithetical to dominant ideology and the industrial agenda, it’s a concept that gets far too little attention. Once you scratch the surface, it appears to be a very complex matter. Psychologically, given the prospect of contraction and all it represents when defined by the established growth paradigm, we are faced with a collective sense of failure. An increased death rate can only add to the substantial shift in the collective psyche of the emergent dark age. Uncharted territory for “Salad Shooter Nation” for sure…<br>Obviously if you are attuned to White’s law, and the concept of “Bartlett in reverse” you’ll have a much easier time wrapping your head around the concept of contraction. But it flies in the face of so much automatic thinking (assumptions), that it really is hard to have an “on the same page” conversation about this prospect with people who just kind of go with the flow… <br>Even with some perspective, it’s very difficult to anticipate the myriad ways in which contraction will affect business as usual. <br>The notion of “business as unusual” springs to mind as an economic/cultural equivalent to “Weather Weirding”…<br><br><a href=#c5820023443201156586 title="comment permalink">8/29/14, 3:39 PM</a><br><br>

There are the stomach-churning examples of Ugarit ~1180BC or maybe Baghdad 1258AD, but in these twilights the scale of cultural and human destruction was just over the top, so some might think the comparison unreasonable.<br><br>Then how about Alaric's more understandable saga? A "charismatic warlord," he was actually relatively tame for his era (seems he more "took" cities than sacked them---for a really crazy dude, look at Clovis a generation or two later). His ranks swelled up with many thousands of Rome's discontents: its impoverished, its slaves, its ethnic Germans revolting from the era's racist government policies, etc. Many brought their whole families on the march, so despite starting with an army, he (probably inadvertently) ended up leading what amounted to a migration. He brought his bands through Dalmatia and Italy, which were populated, settled areas that hadn't seen serious disruption in *centuries* if not half a millennium or more.<br><br>Now Alaric's people would not have fed themselves by taking honest coin to the local shops on their way through. This sort of group supplied itself on the road as they could; there was no other way for masses of unemployed, impoverished people, who largely wouldn't have spoken the local languages, to travel together---obviously not having sophisticated, long range logistical networks, planned months or years in advance and at immense expense---Alaric fed his people directly on Rome's gangrenous, dying body. What does that mean in human terms? It means if you were anywhere near their path and felt disinclined to join up, they'd just take your stuff: your food, your winter supplies, desperately needed pack animals, even family members (maybe women as wives for themselves, maybe boys for replacement manpower). And if you felt your treatment was unfair..... well, I guess you could complain.<br><br>To me JMG's example of post-Roman Britain looks like a kind of outlier, though obviously this can be debated. It certainly saw an uptick in violence, but, true, it seems society-cracking warfare never came (Britain produced some warlords, eg Constantine III, but apparently didn't attract too many). Seems to Britain came just poverty, shorter lives, Germans, and relatively controlled warfare.<br><br><a href=#c7445398102054777349 title="comment permalink">8/29/14, 3:42 PM</a><br><br>

What meaning and purpose can you make of your existence <i>right now</i>? At this moment? <br><br>Brian, I take it you're not a regular reader. I'd encourage you to glance back over the archives a bit, and you'll find that I've been saying for a long time that drastic crises are a standard part of the process of decline and fall -- yes, including the kind of drastic crises that involve, say, the entire population of a city dying in a very short time. The fact that I reject the sort of overnight apocalypse beloved of Hollywood scriptwriters emphatically does not mean that I'm proposing a calm and gentle future; it fascinates me that so many people are incapable of seeing any ground between those extremes. <br><br>Morgenfrue, condoms made from sheep intestine were in common use in the 1700s -- they were made by hand, and were washed and reused -- and there's a very good reason why they'll remain in use: venereal disease, which was what got them invented in the first place. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, entirely on topic. As that sentiment builds, so does the likelihood of an explosion. <br><br>K-dog, actually, food availability might well decline over any number of curves, including exponential ones -- the end of one set of supply chains, for example, will be met by all-out attempts to create new ones, since people normally dislike starving to death and will do almost anything to prevent it, and governments that fail to do something about such things are normally replaced in short order. Will the new ones be less efficient and more of a burden on the economy? Very likely. More on this, again, as we proceed. <br><br>Kyoto, "business as unusual" earns you tonight's gold star. Thank you. <br><br>Brian, not so. Britain actually had a worse time of it than most of the other European provinces of the Western Empire -- there's a reason why people in those other provinces still speak languages descended from Latin, you know, while the English speak languages descended from the speech of the barbarian invaders. I'd encourage you to read up on post-Roman Britain and the Saxon invasion; it might give you a better idea of what I'm talking about here. <br><br>Dr. Kris, you're right -- I should talk about <i>Nightfall</i> one of these days. It's a particularly interesting piece, and very atypical for Asimov, in that it shows how scientific rationalism can dismiss crucial data because the form in which that data is transmitted is that of an older, mythological stage in the culture. <br><br>Shane, my point exactly. Thank you. <br><br>Rabtter, it sounds as though you're getting set up to function as a Barbarian Support Specialist -- quite possibly a major new growth industry! ;-)<br><br><a href=#c8372469866582669345 title="comment permalink">8/29/14, 8:44 PM</a><br><br>

Because while we in the developed countries are fairly decent at counting people, the procedure in some parts of the world is simply the town mayor or village chief sending a number in to a central authority, and the number sent in determines how international aid is distributed. It is to the mayor/chief's advantage, and that of his tribe, to lie about how many people live in his village: the more people the more aid. If anyone ever comes to check up on the numbers, "They moved to the city" or "they died".<br>If my acquaintance is correct, peak population may well happen sooner or even have already happened.<br><br><a href=#c710954163373477681 title="comment permalink">8/29/14, 9:17 PM</a><br><br>

How much of that growth did you feel or experience intimately on a day to day basis? There's no reason to think the reverse would be any different" you replied "Shane, my point exactly.

A series of exponentials stitched together with different time constants, infinitely more likely. On the tree of mathematics the smooth equation which has been discussed is way out on a stochastic limb and it is the only one that is uniformly smooth. Every other curve has times when the inexorable change becomes up close personal and would certainly be noticed. Not all the time, but some of the time. <br><br><i>Governments that fail to do something about such things are normally replaced in short order.</i> <br><br>Daniel Defoe discussed this in '<i>The Plague Years</i>'. <br><br>Throughout the London plague of 1665–66 the price of bread rose very little. The lord-mayor of London made sure it did not happen. Defoe's novel was based pretty much on reality. My copy is footnoted as to where and why poetic license was taken. It might take some reminding but our politicians would learn not to interrupt bread supplies. Politicians are being reminded of exactly that fact in the Middle East right now where food security has become a problem.<br><br>The scenario you suggest is approaching an exponential but those times when the supply chains are unhooked when supply chains are being changed will be where the action is. It would only look exponential from a distance. Close up it would be seen to be piecewise linear. Short bursts of dying when shortages become acute while a new equilibrium and regime is established. <br><br>Yet overall food supply still would not likely decline exponentially from personal points of view. Small changes in the environment can mean big changes in how much and what an area can grow. Growing conditions will be very chaotic and by this time in the future everything will have to be significantly localized. This means people will be living and dying subject to local harvests for the insurance of ready transportation will not cushion losses. Transportation won't be available; supply chains will certainly not be global. Not for anything that matters to ordinary people. <br><br>Overall population decline can resemble a smooth curve but for individuals the situation will more likely look random and chaotic. People can be totally unaware of how the decline looks from a global point of view. <br><br>To participants it may be normalcy interspersed with periods of great stress. The odds of centuries of a continual but milder stress as the road to twenty million, is astronomically small.<br><br><a href=#c6667570012634670439 title="comment permalink">8/30/14, 12:07 AM</a><br><br>

Witness the annual Heritage Spudfest in Boonsboro, Md., or the World’s Largest Ball of Twine in Cawker City, Kan.<br>But it is probably fair to say that no place has come up with a concept quite like “Behold! New Lebanon,” in Columbia County, N.Y., in which this struggling Hudson Valley town in the shadow of the Berkshires is being reimagined as what it hopes will be a “living museum of contemporary rural American life.”<br>Over four weekends, starting with this one and running through Nov. 2, ticket-buying visitors are promised an unvarnished glimpse of present-day country culture, organizers say, which includes being ferried by school buses to working farms, forests, kitchens, corrals and a speedway. There they will “behold” guides like Cynthia Creech, showing off her genetically rare breed of Randall cattle; Eric Johnson, training Border collies to shoo Canada geese off public fields; and Melissa Eigenbrodt, 46, the local postmaster, who can demonstrate the art of tracking deer — without a gun — by following hoof scrapes along the trail.<br>Part museum-without-walls, part reality show, “Behold! New Lebanon” is being packaged as a deliberate contrast to the stereotypical bonneted butter churners at Old Sturbridge Village and other re-creations of yesteryear, which focus on nostalgic practices….The museum project has already raised about $55,000, Ms. Abram said. Tickets are $15 to $25 daily, and $40 for a weekend, including events like “Hitching the Horse to the Plow,” “Auctioneering 101” and “Surviving in the Wild.” (Take mosquito repellent.)<br>…In Green River, Utah (population 953), a group of Auburn University design and architecture graduates and former AmeriCorps/Vista volunteers started the nonprofit Epicenter in 2009 (motto: “Rural &amp; Proud”). They have restored 14 houses and run school arts programs and sponsor a “frontier fellowship” for artists in residence.<br>In Reedsburg (population 9,000), between Chicago and Minneapolis, Donna Neuwirth, 60, and Jay Salinas, 55, are urban transplants who started as farmers but went beyond food, creating the nonprofit Wormfarm Institute to develop what they call a regional culture-shed. The Fermentation Fest — which includes artist-designed farm stands, a drive with scenic overlooks of art installations in fields, and opera performed in a hay wagon — drew 12,000 people last October.<br>On the Abode Farm, Evan Thaler-Null and Sarah Steadman, both 23, will show visitors how they cultivated seven acres of vegetables, using two Belgian draft horses, Lou and Belle. Mr. Null enjoys the partnership with a working animal, but even more, the silence. “You can actually hear the soil, how stony or gravelly it is,” he said. http://abodefarmcsa.com/<br>http://wormfarminstitute.org/</i><br><br><a href=#c212412068289707964 title="comment permalink">8/30/14, 7:22 AM</a><br><br>

How directly will that affect your life?

Surely the issue here is unless something happens to bring the birth rate down drastically the population will carry on growing in the 3rd world with corresponding impacts on resources. Though those countries are most likely to have large scale occurences of famine, pestilence, war &amp; death from other causes. It seems to me there are two (or more) different trajectories here - for the developed world and the 3rd world, which maybe need looked at separately.<br><br>On a much more personal note I am trying to plan and prepare for the remaining decades of my own life (current age 48). I don't have children and neither does my only sibling, so my nearest relatives in the future will be my husband's nieces, not sure how far I could expect any practical help from them. I have 15-20 more years in the health service before I can retire, but that depends on their still being job for me for that whole time (with current 5% cuts to mental health services funding in the UK I can't bank on still having a job in 5 years let alone 15-20) and the state still being able to pay me a pension that I can live on, which could well not be the case by then. We are doing what we can to adapt &amp; prepare for worse to come. I am following a weight-loss programme primarily to reduce my risk of obesity-related diseases in the future and am planning on learning more about how to look after my own health needs through use of herbs &amp; can grow &amp; forage. We grow some of our own food &amp; meet some of our fuel needs through using wood for our wood-burner, but we are aware that this will get less practical as we get older. A contingency plan would be to take in a lodger who could help do the heavy work when we can't in the future. But we will still need a viable water supply, enough money to still buy necessities we can't produce ourselves and a functioning infrastructure that can still provide these necessities. Hopefully these will still be around for long enough for us, though a lot of shit will have hit the fan by then I'm sure. But those of us who are already recognising the issues and choosing to do what we can to adapt are in a better position than those who are not doing so and this blog is a great guide to what we and our descendents will need to prepare for as best as we can.<br><br><a href=#c648981139853820352 title="comment permalink">8/30/14, 1:35 PM</a><br><br>

The basic concern being that the most intelligent and capable people are committing, as Spengler call's it, "race suicide"<br><br>This "race suicide," again according to Spengler, is pretty much standard across the landscape of dying civilizations. He claims that the "best blood" is always lost during this time.<br><br>As background I am transgender, and quite literally don't have a reproductive system. Most of my close friends are queer intelligentsia and don't want children. I live and work at an organic farm. About 1/3 of the farm workers here are white downwardly mobile intellectuals. 2/3 are East African refugees.<br><br>The first group are a remarkably infertile. For one reason or another we all have no children because, to paraphrase Spengler we "can no longer rationalize it." Also many of the downwardly mobile white intellectuals drink quite a bit, and have frequent, sometimes intense existential crises.<br><br>The East African's, on the other hand, are mostly illiterate and many know relatively little English. They live in big families in relative poverty and have lots and lots and lots of babies! One older gentleman told me he has sired 20 children! A lady who I adore has given birth to 9! A man younger than me has just had his first daughter and instead of being filled with terror or regret is thrilled to be a young father!<br><br>The East Africans are devout Muslims, are usually kind, generous, surprisingly tolerant, super fun to be with and deeply rooted in their communities.<br><br>As far as I can tell, in strictly evolutionary terms, the downwardly mobile white ecology isn't adaptive. We produce no offspring and as conditions change we, our assumptions about the world, and are value systems will likely disappear, maybe forever. The East African human ecology is far more likely to be adaptive to changing conditions. They raise many children in poverty, have for generations, and will most likely continue for generations. Their assumptions and value systems will likely endure, at least for awhile.<br><br>I posit this is what evolution looks like in real-time. "High IQs" and all that go with them, may not be adaptive in certain contexts, which is impossible to square with the Myth of Progress. Evolution, it bears remembering, doesn't have an agenda or a direction.<br><br><a href=#c1080020455382832344 title="comment permalink">8/31/14, 6:49 AM</a><br><br>

Perhaps a higher birthrate simply means more visits from the four horsemen? More people means more crowding, means more opportunity for disease transmission between people and even animals (Ebola in Africa). Population explosion means fewer resources (e.g., food) to go around means more intergroup conflict/fighting for remaining resources (ISIL, etc in the Middle East) So perhaps lower birthrates in the West simply delay the onset of the four horsemen due to less population pressure.<br>I'm not sure if this falls under this week's topic or next, but one thing to consider is the role of natural disaster in population control, particularly as it hits up against people's sense of entitlement to live wherever they want, regardless of environmental suitability. I see uncontrolled fire destroying most of the suburban west in short order, and hurricanes taking out a lot of the low lying populated Atlantic areas. Just to wrap your mind around natural disasters proceeding full force with little effective response, and the death that would result from the initial incident and any after effects.<br><br><a href=#c3968927282854744621 title="comment permalink">8/31/14, 8:55 AM</a><br><br>

I can only think of one that has 3 kids and 3 that own houses.Most of those with kids are madly trying to juggle their work schedules and childcare. Of the ones in academia, only one has a tenure track position. My daughter has had a series of jobs, some paying quite well, that ended when they lost their funding or their grants expired.<br>Of the people I worked with at the middle school in CA, mostly now in their mid 40s to early 50s, most had houses and after two careers into their mid 30s, they would have one or two children and one parent, usually the mother, would quit or telecommute to care for them. They also tend to have much more secure jobs. Big changes in those few years.<br><br><a href=#c8576841488548764478 title="comment permalink">8/31/14, 9:16 AM</a><br><br>

A lot of my peers didn't even seem to like their children. Other than social norms and pressure, I,m not sure why they even had them. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has seen an enormous RV with a bumper sticker reading"we are spending our kids inheritance"<br>I don't think my daughter's peers who have kids now think of them as a future insurance policy. Having them is a real financial sacrifice and they make it because they love the kids. Most of them have no idea where the future is going, other than that they can't count on it. As to consciously thinking their children will support them then: forget about it.<br>I also have seen less evidence of people wanting to preserve their genetic heritage than a lot of those commenting refer to. I agree with Chris that it is greatly overrated.I love my daughter more than anyone in the world, though she is not genetically mine. I also love a lot of the kids I taught and worked with in middle school. Perhaps the important thing is to feel you have passed on something that is important to you.<br>This may well be a luxury of the boom years, and will doubtless change as we enter the years of decline and the dark ages.

But what happens to concentration of resources? The Elites (borrowing a metaphor from M.

This would be a much more radical restriction in per-commoner-capita resources than the straight population numbers suggest, and any cultural edifice won't have much to stand on. I do wonder how inevitable this is.<br><br>@David and JMG:<br><br>There's a book I've been thinking of getting by an author the name of John Mann, it's titled "A Thousand Years of Shadow Warriors" or something to that effect. It's about the area of Japan that the ninjas originated in. It was particularly rugged and escaped the control of the ruling class because of the difficulty of the terrain, until I believe, the Meigi (?) restoration. They were in fact so ornery that they had a nascent democracy going in their rugged little corner of the world complete with elected representatives. Not that I'll live to see such a thing but here in Cascadia it sounds like it could be a dandy idea!

According to the myth of progress, one hopes that their children will be better off than they are. Absent a belief that the future will be better than the past, the rationale for childbearing according to the myth of progress is gone. However, in a cyclical, nature based belief system, childbearing completes the birth/death cycle, and is a necessary part of the cycle of life and death. Going back to the existential post a few weeks back, there are reasons for going on and continuing the cycle of life absent the myth of progress. Non-progressive peoples have found reasons to rejoice in childbirth in the past, and our ancestors will, too.<br><br><a href=#c7070898484496478760 title="comment permalink">8/31/14, 4:41 PM</a><br><br>

Absolutely true.<br><br>Here in St. Petersburg, there's a major program underway to replace the old Soviet-era water pipes with more modern infrastructure. All over the city there are great pits being dug, and stacks of black plastic pipes.<br><br>My (Tsarist-era) apartment complex was upgraded over the summer. The water supply came and went unpredictably. This coincided with an uncommonly hot and humid period of weather. At the time I was doing a lot of travelling - by metro, bus, and foot - between clients' offices, and fairly rapidly developed an uncomfortable heat rash. <br><br>You can imagine, perhaps, how uncomfortable it was to get up after a hot night, with a hot day ahead, to find no water coming from the taps.

(You wrote, in part, "nightmare of self-reinforcing social decay, violence, famine, bad decision-making, destruction.") When it comes, it comes, and boy is it bad. <br><br>Grandma and Mum fled Petseri (present-day Pechory) with some exceedingly light baggage, including a couple of oranges. Heaven knows how Estonia managed to have oranges in the September of 1944, but there you are. (Unless Mum was misremembering when she recounted this to me, decades later? My guess, knowing Mum's general capacity for handling facts, is that she was accurate.) The retreating Nazis said fine, we'll give you ladies a lift, but we can't stop: when this truck slows down at a specially sharp bend, you will have to jump. So Mum and Grandma jumped (I am inclined to think jumping in the night, but am unsure on this point), with no bones broken. Eventually they got out to the Estonian west coast, then out to Germany, then into the greater safety of Denmark. After that came Sweden, then in Mum's case nine or so days of tedious acute nausea in lower berth from Göteborg to Pier 21 in Halifax. <br><br>In later life, Mum did not enjoy travel. <br><br>I listened last night to an archive file of the BBC news from the evening of the first day of the war (the Friday which was 1939-09-01) and started Ye Olde Hyperventilation - as the London announcer was intimating, I guess, that HM Govermnent would be taking irrevocable steps shortly. Such fun, being poised to be a new war casualty, on the eve of the 75th anniversary. But no chest pains, LOL LOL, and physiological normalcy rapidly restored :-) . <br><br>Two days after 1939-09-01, on the morning of the Sunday, at 11.15 by the London civilian clocks and 10.15 by what was then called "Greenwich Mean Time" (now in essence Universal Coordinated Time), dear old Neville was on the air from the Cabinet Office, saying HM Government's ultimatum to Germany had expired. <br><br>Although we are not yet in the Dark Ages, we have been in a bad way for a long time. This bad stuff comes on bit by bit, in this jurisdiction and that, pretty unevenly. Now we have Ukraine, and one is not quite sure what comes next.

Children: I have 2 beloved male children who will be turning 18 in 2020 and 2026, so the War horseman keeps popping in my mind from time to time. It is not only organized warfare either, but the general social disintegration and rise of criminality. I have more than once reflected on my own foolish youth and come to the conclusion that I would not have survived if I had run into some hardened delinquent instead of other fool boys playing rough-man. <br><br>2. Choice into to have children: Yeah, I respect that. I do not know what I would have done, since I was a cornucopian back when my kids were born (though neither of them was planned, strictly speaking). However, I'd like to offer a piece of reflection: It was never about ourselves, it was about them.<br><br>3. Resource contraction vs overpopulation: There is something that have always bothered me but never seems to get mentioned. People in industrialized settings have stopped having children, but begun to treat pets like children. I have never understood this... it is like voluntarily taking on a profoundly disabled child that will never learn to talk, or to walk (in two feet), go to school or learn a trade... and that will die in it's teens no matter how well cared for. Still, people seem to find some meaning in the lives of their pets... so, who am I to judge.<br><br><a href=#c2498816623462448141 title="comment permalink">9/1/14, 10:05 AM</a><br><br>

A woman was expected to have multiple children, as a man was expected to have a career. The price of not following this path, which I didn't,was quite effective social scorn and almost ostracism. I can attest to this mostly in the anglosphere, but I'm sure it was also prevalent in other cultures. It was certainly the push that drove so many non conforming people to Greenwich Village, NY and North Beach, SF and ultimately to the hippie movement in the 60s.<br>I am not sure that people consciously thought of preserving their genetic heritage, though that was one club used to beat those who didn't reproduce. It was just part of the social fabric of those times, like being patriotic or going to church.<br> I remember as a landmark when my mothers friends stopped saying "Its just a phase he is going through" I had then been totally written off. I almost felt like Cyrano De Bergerac saying "there goes, thank God, another enemy. Not for the faint of heart, but the conformist track felt like suicide on the installment plan.<br>cheers,Steve<br><br><a href=#c7992376727768767835 title="comment permalink">9/1/14, 11:18 AM</a><br><br>

No, what we said (if we thought about it at all) was "great, I can have children because I'll be able to provide for them".<br><br>I think that historically most people in most times have said something like: "OK, I'm having children because I need an heir/I need someone to look after me when I'm old/I need help on the farm/it's my duty (to god or the state or whatever)/it's just natural/it proves I'm a man - and I just hope my children have a better life than I do, but who knows?"<br><br>Is it any wonder that some people now look at possible futures and say, "my children's lives would almost certainly be more difficult than mine, and I might not be able to provide for them, so I choose not to have children. I'll make my contribution to the world some other way" ?<br><br>I agree that at times our ancestors "found reasons to rejoice in childbirth" and that at times our descendants will do so too. But I've stated my belief before: I do not believe in propagating the species just for the purpose of propagating the species.

Only in our affluent and decadent modern societies have people gotten the strange, counter-evolutionary idea that not having children is a reasonable choice. Evolution being what it is, it is quickly routing around this sort of decadence – see Europe, where the postmodern natives are in the process of ethnically cleansing themselves and being replaced by more fecund cultures.<br><br>So the people who survive modernity will tend to be those who preserve the old values, the religious and tribal values which, in the name of progress, so many have abandoned, but without which their culture dies.<br><br>As a side note, I would be very interested in knowing what the birthrates are among people in the peak oil community. I suspect there is a strong correlation between them, perhaps suggesting a certain psychological and cultural tendency. A poster child for barren, doomer despair might be Michael Rupper, childless, as far as I know, and driven to suicide, but saying it was "for the children". I can't help but noticing that it is overwhelmingly my kind (white men) who are deconstructing themselves out of existence in this way, and thinking that at some point we have to look for deeper causes and solutions. But again, memetic and genetic evolution will have the final word. Fecundity always wins eventually.<br><br>So in general, I think we should ask whether doomer culture is itself a symptom of the widespread decadence, and whether it will be one of the first casualties of a dark age. How can it be otherwise? How can this sort of barren pessimism survive for long?<br><br><a href=#c5435422634182208623 title="comment permalink">9/1/14, 2:04 PM</a><br><br>

Not so with a center supported pagoda roof! And then we could use the neat industry and influence of Japanese farmers in the inland valleys.

There's definitely some sort of reverse evolution going on, and I do worry about it. <br><br>But I don't care for Sean Strange's strange take on it either, because why call it decadent to respond to reality, i.e., that there are too many people in the world? Why praise other cultures who have overpopulated their geological environments and who will be in a world of hurt once the artificial life support stops? I find that depressing because it means that people have no more ability to respond to their own increasing numbers like homo sapiens than the non sapien animals do. They overpopulate sometimes, too, and then they crash. <br><br>I agree that family, reproduction and other values will become important again, but it could also be argued that people were overpopulated long before this last superduper episode.

For example, if two people are born and three people die during one year for every hundred people alive, then that results in a one percent decrease in a year.<br><br>Another way of saying that the population decreases by one percent a year is that each year, the population becomes 99 percent of the population of a year before. So if the population starts out at 470 million, after a year it's at 99% of 470 million, which we calculate as 470,000,000 * 0.99, which works out to 465.3 million.<br><br>After another year, its 99% of 465.3 million, or 465,300,000 * 0.99. That's also 470,000,000 * 0.99 * 0.99; that is, 99% of the previous year's population that was 99% of the initial two-years-ago population. We can write that as 470 million * (0.99^2). (The symbol ^ means "raised to the power of," so ^2 means "squared" or "raised to the power of two.")<br><br>After three years, the population will be 470,000,000 * (0.99^3).<br><br>After four years, the population will be 470,000,000 * (0.99^4).<br><br>After <i>x</i> years, the population will be 470,000,000 * (0.99^ <i>x</i>)<br><br>It's an exponential function because as years go by, the population is multiplied by increasing powers (aka exponents) of the factor 0.99. Because 0.99 is less than one, raising it to higher and higher powers, which means multiplying it by itself more and more times, produces a smaller and smaller number. So the population is decreasing. This type of decrease is called "exponential decay."<br><br>When you raise a number greater than one to higher and higher powers, it gets larger and larger instead. That's also a type of exponential function, often described as an "exponential increase." That would happen, for example, if a population increased by the same percentage each year.<br><br>Using high school level math such as logarithms, you can answer questions about the scenario, such as "how many years will it take for the population to be reduced by half?" The answer, in this case, is about 69 years, no matter what year or what population you start with (as long as the population is high enough so that rounding off to the nearest whole person doesn't affect the numbers significantly.)<br><br>(Why isn't the answer 50 years? If the population decreases by one percent a year, won't it have decreased 50 percent, or half, after fifty years? That would be true if the population always decreased by one percent of the starting population, but that's not what's happening in our scenario, where the population decreases by one percent of its new value each year.)<br><br>Once you know the halving time is close to 69 years, you can get a rough idea of the population graph just from that. If you start with 470 million, after 69 years it's about half of that or 235 million. After another 69 years, or 138 years total, it's halved again to about 117 million. After another 69 years, or 207 years total, it's about 59 million. At 276 years, it's about 29 million.<br><br><a href=#c9150017397419532982 title="comment permalink">9/1/14, 8:26 PM</a><br><br>

Spengler writes: “There is a deep relation between the attitude that is taken towards the historic past and the conception that is formed of death, and this relation is expressed in the disposal of the dead." I have been giving this some thought this past week as I read the post and the comments. <br><br>I fear this may be slightly macabre but I thought it might be of interest to those considering what more deaths may look like in the ground and what could be done now in preparation. My small community ran out of burial spaces in the cemetery a number of years ago. While I was on the board of the local conservancy, we donated a small piece of land for a "green" cemetery. A broad outline of what this entails is an affordable, non chemical, simple burial in a fir forest attached to a local park. A local fellow has begun to accept orders for local willow woven caskets at very reasonable prices, although being composted surrounded by untreated wood or fabric are also possibilities. A lively dialogue has also been created around how to speed up the composting process! I think what I was most surprised about when the community was initially accessing the possibilities around the most simple ecologically sound burial possible was all the rules, money, refrigeration, and bureaucracy attached. <br><br>As an aside, In response to the fellow who speculated that perhaps those who participate in peak oil narratives generally have no children. I have found, as a parent, that talking about population (explosion and implosion) with people who have consciously chosen not to have children largely unhelpful. I have been charged with irrationality, being a slave to biology, selfishness etc. no matter how carefully I try to articulate how I arrived at my decision. It also seems disingenuous to not "confess" that I had one child in my late thirties. I think the notion of dissensus might be helpful here. We can agree roughly on what the current landscape looks like and that there are any number of ways to flip a coin into the future.<br><br><a href=#c2043715863031000677 title="comment permalink">9/1/14, 8:33 PM</a><br><br>

Several early varieties of Christianity valorized virginity and celibacy. Some married couples who converted to Christianity made vows not to have sex with each other (or anyone else) any more. Some men castrated themselves. Legends of early Christian martyrs, whom Roman Catholics at least are taught to admire, include young women who chose a martyr's death over marriage and continuation of their family line. <br><br>In some branches of Christianity, it's regarded as controversial to think that Jesus had blood brothers and sisters and a sex life of his own. Paul of Tarsus famously said "It is better to marry than to burn," meaning, if you can't control your lust, then marry. Not the first choice; that would be to control your lust.<br><br>One thing that made early Christianity attractive to women was that it said it was not only okay but best for an ordinary woman never to have sex. If she took the option of holy.virginity, she would be respected and had a better chance of living to old age instead of dying in childbirth or being worn out and toothless at the age of forty. <br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c2757346033867389930 title="comment permalink">9/1/14, 10:03 PM</a><br><br>

Earlier this spring we decided to buy some meat chickens, and were given cheaply a bunch of so-called white rock mostly rooster chicks, which I'm pretty sure are really white leghorns. They have grown slowly and the meat is tough. Just as we got down to the last two roosters and a hen, why she began to lay eggs. This impressed my husband greatly, who vehemently denies that her eggs are small, and he decided that the final couple will be allowed to live, and therefore we might as well give them free range. We do have two dogs. Now we are letting them out in the afternoons, earlier and earlier, and he sits in a chair for hours near their area and takes the dogs to teach them they mustn't bother them, and he is greatly entertained by watching this couple explore their new freedom and interact. The rooster communicates to his precious hen constantly, watches over her, suggests when it is time to come in for the night, where he has found food, and so on. He is like a shepherd.<br><br>I think people are making a category error when they compare animal intelligence so miserably against the human. Animals are very intelligent, but they are specialists, whereas humans are generalists. Compared to them we are like gods, yes, able to explore and appreciate the whole cosmos, but a fox is very sharp and good at being a fox, and a crow is very smart as a crow.<br><br><a href=#c5348273767047949759 title="comment permalink">9/2/14, 5:55 AM</a><br><br>

I became p.o. aware in 2003 when my daughter was one year old and my son was conceived the same vacation I was reading Matt Savier's Life After the Oil Crash.<br>Anyway, it has been scary having children knowing what I know about their not so bright future. I don't share much of it with them, and I often cringe when my son sees a new Camaro that he thinks he'll be driving some day, or my daughter wants the newest digital gadget. Knowing what I know now about the future, I probably would choose not to have kids. <br>I can't worry about that now, but instead focus on getting out of California in the near future, and if they and my wife don't want to come with me, at least I'll have a safer, more livable place for them to come to when the time comes. <br>A state heading into the forth year of drought and 30 million people is ripe for problems. Not to mention my home town of Napa just having a 6.0 earthquake and the fault is only miles from my house (house did ok but lots of stuff broken). I do not want to see what a 7 or higher would do. <br>Many water mains busted in the earthquake and it was only because of gas powered machines that they got fixed in a few days. Without the fuel, it would have taken them weeks or months to fix, and people can't make it that long without water not to mention the people trying to dig them up to repair. Not a good scenario. Imagine the Bay Area's Hayward Fault, that has a 30% chance of having a 7.0 or higher in next 30 years, letting loose. This fault runs all along the east side of the bay parallel with the San Andreas . Looks like one of the steep and local population drops you were talking about. <br>Carl<br><br><a href=#c6102355144307276663 title="comment permalink">9/2/14, 8:24 AM</a><br><br>

Someone commented that nomad overlords were resposible for the ecological damaging farming practices that destroyed North Africa, and other similar areaas. Our current very and ultra rich that control the economy (effectivly, out overlords) are also a nomadic group, jetting to whatever locale is most attractive to them at the moment. Second, on causes of possible increases in the death rate, I see two major issues. Recently, the city near me was having much hand waving that ambulance service had degraded from an average of 7 minuites, to over 11 (or approximatly so). These kinds of response times require a lot of fully stocked ambulances, with the required paramedics, driving on well maintained streets, delivering the paitents to properly operating hospitals. Take any of those elements away, and the number of people who then die between onset of symptoms or accident, and medical help, will jump dramatically. The other big thing to increase the world wide death rate is when industrial (oil fueled) agriculture shuts down, for a varity of reasons, and food is not exported around the world in bulk, those third world counties with degraded soil will not be able to feed their population, let alone in years of bad harvests.<br><br><a href=#c88581204458312362 title="comment permalink">9/2/14, 9:45 AM</a><br><br>

The point I was trying to make was that it is the attitude of pet owners, and only those who treat their animals as children, which results in a frustrating experience.<br><br>Domestic animals are without doubt part of the "human ecology" *(for lack of a better term), but in their form of pets it can be challenging to let them express their unique character and potentials. <br><br>There are many good and proper reasons to keep animals at home, and not all of them have to be utilitarian (my grandmother used to keep around half-a-dozen of canaries, and they earned their modest keep by offering their beautiful songs). I just don't happen to think that satisfying unconscious maternal/paternal feelings to take care of some cute little thing is a valid one.<br><br>From an internal point of view, a pet is never going to fulfill the same satisfaction as having a child, for the reasons expressed in my previous comment. I don't think it is healthy for the pet either, because it must be confusing to not be given the limits they have evolved over many generations to thrive on.<br><br>From an external point of view -and one related to this week post - there is a phantom population besides the 7+ billion humans in this world: it is that of their pets. Resource wise, a significant amount is expended on pet's behalf by their owners. I have never done the research, but I am pretty sure that the pet of a typical family in the 90-percentile of income has a higher carbon footprint than the average child in the 10-percentile... and maybe a longer lifespan too.<br><br>And still, there are so many people that are happy to extend to their pets status as full members of the family.

I got the idea from some neighbors who say their daughter was advised by the local guys who maintain the clear passage around electric lines (this place turns into a temperate jungle in the summer) to eat a leaf each spring when they are new and shiny, and she does it every year and does not get poison ivy. Of course, it is possible she is one of the immune ones.<br><br>I myself got poison oak so bad when I was twelve that it covered me from head to toe, was down my throat and also in another sensitive area - I believe I got it during a camping trip when I went out at night to pee and used some leaves.

Perhaps it's because he's from Europe and had zero exposure, but the first time he got it we were truly worried he had leukemia, as his groins were swelled with walnuts in them for at least two months. It took a while for me to even connect the possibility that the two might be related, so I called the poison control center and asked if that were a possible reaction and they did not think so! I finally got hold of a heme-onc doc at work and asked him what he thought, and he said, "Of course it is." Whew! We were already looking into flying him home to Ukraine for medical treatment.<br><br>I don't eat all that much honey, but I buy local honey and I'm pretty sure it has little or no effect.

Just yesterday we were walking in the city and the boulevard was lined with Ginko Biloba trees, and they had fruit on them. My husband picked up a couple, and I bit into one. It was astringent like crazy, and my throat was burning a good while. So I googled it last night and to my surprise they said the Ginko fruits should be handled with gloves as they have the same chemical urushiol as poison oak and ivy. I think you only eat the nut inside. Anyway, it's been over 24 hours now and I have no reaction at all, nor does he.<br><br><a href=#c2179834018605455587 title="comment permalink">9/2/14, 3:46 PM</a><br><br>

The likes of Chesepeake Energy and Suncor can't survive long if their oxygen is cut off.<br><br>Production from shale or tar sands depends on a continuous flow of new money. Ask the Weimar Republic how that worked out for them.<br><br>On the other hand, it seems we have an example of how this could play out in the Former Soviet Union. Dmitry Orlov says you don't really notice population decline very much until you look through your high school year book, and realize that half the people in it, who should be comfortably middle-aged, sliding into retirement, are instead, dead.<br><br>I do agree with JMG that collapse will come with a whimper, not a bang. But it may be much quicker than many think.<br><br><a href=#c7328161030559723753 title="comment permalink">9/10/14, 6:40 PM</a><br><br>
