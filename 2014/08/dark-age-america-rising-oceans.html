<div class=MsoNormal>
The vagaries of global climate set in motion by our species’ frankly brainless maltreatment of the only atmosphere we’ve got, the subject of last week’s post here, have another dimension that bears close watching. History, as I suggested last week, can be seen as human ecology in its transformations over time, and every ecosystem depends in the final analysis on the available habitat. For human beings, the habitat that matters is dry land with adequate rainfall and moderate temperatures; we’ve talked about the way that anthropogenic climate change is interfering with the latter two, but it promises to have<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>significant impacts on the first of those requirements as well. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s helpful to put all this in the context of deep time. For most of the last billion years or so, the Earth has been a swampy jungle planet where ice and snow were theoretical possibilities only. Four times in that vast span, though, something—scientists are still arguing about what—turned the planet’s thermostat down sharply, resulting in ice ages millions of years in length. The most recent of these downturns began cooling the planet maybe ten million years ago, in the Miocene epoch; a little less than two million years ago, at the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch, the first of the great continental ice sheets began to spread across the Northern Hemisphere, and the ice age was on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We’re still in it. During an ice age, a complex interplay of the Earth’s rotational and orbital wobbles drives the Milankovich cycle, a cyclical warming and cooling of the planet that takes around 100,000 years to complete, with long glaciations broken by much shorter interglacials. We’re approaching the end of the current interglacial, and it’s estimated that the current ice age has maybe another ten million years to go; one consequence is that at some point a few millennia in the future, we can pretty much count on the arrival of a new glaciation. In the meantime, we’ve still got continental ice sheets covering Antarctica and Greenland, and a significant amount of year-round ice in mountains in various corners of the world. That’s normal for an interglacial, though not for most of the planet’s history. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The back-and-forth flipflop between glaciations and interglacials has a galaxy of impacts on the climate and ecology of the planet, but one of the most obvious comes from the simple fact that all the frozen water needed to form a continental ice sheet have to come from somewhere, and the only available “somewhere” on this planet is the oceans. As glaciers spread, sea level drops accordingly; 18,000 years ago, when the most recent glaciation hit its final peak, sea level was more than 400 feet lower than today, and roaming tribal hunters could walk all the way from Holland to Ireland and keep going, following reindeer herds a good distance into what’s now the northeast Atlantic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What followed has plenty of lessons on offer for our future. It used to be part of the received wisdom that ice ages began and ended with, ahem, glacial slowness, and there still seems to be good reason to think that the beginnings are fairly gradual, but the ending of the most recent ice age involved periods of very sudden change. 18,000 years ago, as already mentioned, the ice sheets were at their peak; about 16,000 years ago, the planetary climate began to warm, pushing the ice into a slow retreat. Around 14,700 years ago, the warm B<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>ö</span>lling phase arrived, and the ice sheets retreated hundreds of miles; according to several studies, the West Antarctic ice sheet collapsed completely at this time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The B<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>ölling gave way after around 600 years to the Older Dryas cold period, putting the retreat of the ice on hold. After another six centuries or so, the Older Dryas gave way to a new warm period, the Alleröd, which sent the ice sheets reeling back and raised sea levels hundreds of feet worldwide. Then came a new cold phase, the frigid Younger Dryas, which brought temperatures back for a few centuries to their ice age lows, cold enough to allow the West Antarctic ice sheet to reestablish itself and to restore tundra conditions over large sections of the Northern Hemisphere. Ice core measurements suggest that the temperature drop hit fast, in a few decades or less—a useful reminder that rapid climate change can come from natural sources as well as from our smokestacks and tailpipes. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>Just over a millennium later, right around 9600 BC, the Boreal phase arrived, and brought even more spectacular change. According to oxygen isotope measurements from Greenland ice cores—I get challenged on this point fairly often, so I’ll mention that the figure I’m citing is from Steven Mithen’s <i>After The Ice</i>, a widely respected 2003 survey of human prehistory—global temperatures spiked 7° C<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in less than a decade, pushing the remaining ice sheets into rapid collapse and sending sea levels soaring. Over the next few thousand years, the planet’s ice cover shrank to a little less than its current level, and sea level rose a bit above what it is today; a gradual cooling trend beginning around 6000 BCE brought both to the status they had at the beginning of the industrial era. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>Scientists still aren’t sure what caused the stunning temperature spike at the beginning of the Boreal phase, but one widely held theory is that it was driven by large-scale methane releases from the warming oceans and thawing permafrost. The ocean floor contains huge amounts of methane trapped in unstable methane hydrates; permafrost contains equally huge amounts of dead vegetation that’s kept from rotting by subfreezing temperatures, and when the permafrost thaws, that vegetation rots and releases more methane. Methane is a far more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but it’s also much more transient—once released into the atmosphere, methane breaks down into carbon dioxide and water relatively quickly, with an estimated average lifespan of ten years or so—and so it’s quite a plausible driver for the sort of sudden shock that can be traced in the Greenland ice cores. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>If that’s what did it, of course, we’re arguably well on our way there. I discussed in a previous post here credible reports that <a href=../../2012/04/seascape-with-methane-plumes.html>large sections of the Arctic ocean are fizzing with methane</a>, and I suspect many of my readers have heard of the <a href=http://www.nature.com/news/mysterious-siberian-crater-attributed-to-methane-1.15649>recently discovered craters in Siberia</a> that appear to have been caused by methane blowouts from thawing permafrost. On top of the current carbon dioxide spike, a methane spike would do a fine job of producing the kind of climate chaos I discussed in last week’s post. That doesn’t equal the kind of runaway feedback loop beloved of a certain sect of contemporary apocalypse-mongers, because there are massive sources of negative feedback that such claims always ignore, but it seems quite likely that the decades ahead of us will be enlivened by a period of extreme climate turbulence driven by significant methane releases. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>Meanwhile, two of the world’s three remaining ice sheets—the West Antarctic and Greenland sheets—have already been destabilized by rising temperatures. Between them, these two ice sheets contain enough water to raise sea level around 50 feet globally, and the estimate I’m using for anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions over the next century provides enough warming to cause the collapse and total melting of both of them. All that water isn’t going to hit the world’s oceans overnight, of course, and a great deal depends on just how fast the melting happens. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>The predictions for sea level rise included in the last few IPCC reports assume a slow, linear process of glacial melting. That’s appropriate as a baseline, but the evidence from paleoclimatology shows that ice sheets collapse in relatively sudden bursts of melting, producing what are termed “global meltwater pulses” that can be tracked worldwide by a variety of proxy measurements. Mind you, “relatively sudden” in geological terms is slow by the standards of a human lifetime; the complete collapse of a midsized ice sheet like Greenland’s or West Antarctica’s can take five or six centuries, and that in turn involves periods of relatively fast melting and sea level rise, interspersed with slack periods when sea level creeps up much more slowly. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>So far, at least, the vast East Antarctic ice sheet has shown only very modest changes, and most current estimates suggest that it would take something far more drastic than the carbon output of our remaining economically accessible fossil fuel reserves to tip it over into instability; this is a good thing, as East Antarctica’s ice fields contain enough water to drive sea level up 250 feet or so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus a reasonable estimate for sea level change over the next five hundred years involves the collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic sheets and some modest melting on the edges of the East Antarctic sheet, raising sea level by something over 50 feet, delivered in a series of unpredictable bursts divided by long periods of relative stability or slow change. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>The result will be what paleogeographers call “marine transgression”—the invasion of dry land and fresh water by the sea. Fifty feet of sea level change adds up to quite a bit of marine transgression in some areas, much less in others, depending always on local topography. Where the ground is low and flat, the rising seas can penetrate a very long way; in California, for example, the state capital at Sacramento is many miles from the ocean, but since it’s only 30 feet above sea level and connected to the sea by a river, its<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>skyscrapers will be rising out of a brackish estuary long before Greenland and West Antarctica are bare of ice. The port cities of the Gulf coast are also on the front lines—New Orleans is actually below sea level, and will likely be an early casualty, but every other Gulf port from Brownsville, Texas (elevation 43 feet) to Tampa, Florida (elevation 15 feet) faces the same fate, and most East and West Coast ports face substantial flooding of economically important districts. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>The flooding of Sacramento isn’t the end of the world, and there may even be some among my readers who would consider it to be a good thing. What I’d like to point out, though, is the economic impact of the rising waters. Faced with an unpredictable but continuing rise in sea level, communities and societies face one of two extremely expensive choices. They can abandon billions of dollars of infrastructure to the sea and rebuild further inland, or they can invest billions of dollars in flood control. Because the rate of sea level change can’t be anticipated, furthermore, there’s no way to know in advance how far to relocate or how high to build the barriers at any given time, and there are often hard limits to how much change can be done in advance:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>port cities, for example, can’t just move away from the sea and still maintain a functioning economy. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>This is a pattern we’ll be seeing over and over again in this series of posts. Societies descending into dark ages reliably get caught on the horns of a brutal dilemma. For any of a galaxy of reasons, crucial elements of infrastructure no longer do the job they once did, but reworking or replacing them runs up against two critical difficulties that are hardwired into the process of decline itself. The first is that, as time passes, the resources needed to do the necessary work become increasingly scarce; the second is that, as time passes, the uncertainties about what needs to be done become increasingly large. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>The result can be tracked in the decline of every civilization. At first, failing systems are replaced with some success, but the economic impact of the replacement process becomes an ever-increasing burden, and the new systems never do quite manage to work as well as the older ones did in their heyday. As the process continues, the costs keep mounting and the benefits become less reliable; more and more often, scarce resources end up being wasted or put to counterproductive uses because the situation is too uncertain to allow for their optimum allocation. With each passing year, decision makers have to figure out how much of the dwindling stock of resources can be put to productive uses and how much has to be set aside for crisis management, and the raw uncertainty of the times guarantees that these decisions will very often turn out wrong. Eventually, the declining curve in available resources and the rising curve of uncertainty intersect to produce a crisis that spins out of control, and what’s left of a community, an economic sector, or a whole civilization goes to pieces under the impact. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>It’s not too hard to anticipate how that will play out in the century or so immediately ahead of us. If, as I’ve suggested, we can expect the onset of a global meltwater pulse from the breakup of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets at some point in the years ahead, the first upward jolt in sea level will doubtless be met with grand plans for flood-control measures in some areas, and relocation of housing and economic activities in others. Some of those plans may even be carried out, though the raw economic impact of worldwide coastal flooding on a global economy already under severe strain from a chaotic climate and a variety of other factors won’t make that easy. Some coastal cities will hunker down behind hurriedly built or enlarged levees, others will abandon low-lying districts and try to rebuild further upslope, still others will simply founder and be partly or wholly abandoned—and all these choices impose costs on society as a whole. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>Thereafter, in years and decades when sea level rises only slowly, the costs of maintaining flood control measures and replacing vulnerable infrastructure with new facilities on higher ground will become an unpopular burden, and the same logic that drives climate change denialism today will doubtless find plenty of hearers then as well. In years and decades when sea level surges upwards, the flood control measures and relocation projects will face increasingly severe tests, which some of them will inevitably fail. The twin spirals of rising costs and rising uncertainty will have their usual effect, shredding the ability of a failing society to cope with the challenges that beset it. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>It’s even possible in one specific case to make an educated guess as to the nature of the pressures that will finally push the situation over the edge into collapse and abandonment. It so happens that three different processes that follow in the wake of rapid glacial melting all have the same disastrous consequence for the eastern shores of North America. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>The first of these is isostatic rebound. When you pile billions of tons of ice on a piece of land, the land sinks, pressing down hundreds or thousands of feet into the Earth’s mantle; melt the ice, and the land rises again. If the melting happens over a brief time, geologically speaking, the rebound is generally fast enough to place severe stress on geological faults all through the region, and thus sharply increases the <span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>occurrence</span> of earthquakes. The Greenland ice sheet is by no means exempt from this process, and many of the earthquakes in the area around a rising Greenland will inevitably happen offshore. The likely result? Tsunamis. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>The second process is the destabilization of undersea sediments that build up around an ice sheet that ends in the ocean. As the ice goes away, torrents of meltwater pour into the surrounding seas, and isostatic rebound changes the slope of the underlying rock, masses of sediment break free and plunge down the continental slope into the deep ocean. Some of the sediment slides that followed the end of the last ice age were of impressive scale—the Storegga Slide off the coast of Norway around 6220 BCE, which was caused by exactly this process, sent 840 cubic miles of sediment careening down the continental slope. The likely result? More tsunamis. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>The third process, which is somewhat more speculative than the first two, is the sudden blowout of large volumes of undersea methane hydrates. Several oceanographers and paleoclimatologists have argued that the traces of very large underwater slides in the Atlantic, dating from the waning days of the last ice age, may well be the traces of such blowouts. As the climate warmed, they suggest, methane hydrates on the continental shelves were destabilized by rising temperatures, and a sudden shock—perhaps delivered by an earthquake, perhaps by something else—triggered the explosive release of thousands or millions of tons of methane all at once. The likely result? Still more tsunamis. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>It’s crucial to realize the role that uncertainty plays here, as in so many dimensions of our predicament. No one knows whether tsunamis driven by glacial melting will hammer the shores of the northern Atlantic basin some time in the next week, or some time in the next millennium. Even if tsunamis driven by the collapse of the Greenland ice sheet become statistically inevitable, there’s no way for anyone to know in advance the timing, scale, and direction of any such event. Efficient allocation of resources to East Coast ports becomes a nighmarish challenge when you literally have no way of knowing how soon any given investment might suddenly end up on the bottom of the Atlantic.</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>If human beings behave as they usually do, what will most likely happen is that the port cities of the US East Coast will keep on trying to maintain business as usual until well after that stops making any kind of economic sense. The faster the seas rise and the sooner the first tsunamis show up, the sooner that response will tip over into its opposite, and people will begin to flee in large numbers from the coasts in search of safety for themselves and their families. My working guess is that the eastern seaboard of dark age America will be sparsely populated, with communities concentrated in those areas where land well above tsunami range lies close to the sea. The Pacific and Gulf coasts will be at much less risk from tsunamis, and so may be more thickly settled; that said, during periods of rapid marine transgression, the mostly flat and vulnerable Gulf Coast may lose a great deal of land, and those who live there will need to be ready to move inland in a hurry. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>All these factors make for a shift in the economic and political geography of the continent that will be of quite some importance at a later point in this series of posts. In times of rapid sea level change, maintaining the infrastructure for maritime trade in seacoast ports is a losing struggle; maritime trade is still possible without port infrastructure, but it’s rarely economically viable; and that means that inland waterways with good navigable connections to the sea will take on an even greater importance than they have today. In North America, the most crucial of those are the St. Lawrence Seaway, the Hudson River-Erie Canal linkage to the Great Lakes, and whatever port further inland replaces New Orleans—Baton Rouge is a likely candidate, due to its location and elevation above sea level—once the current Mississippi delta drowns beneath the rising seas. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Even in dark ages, as I’ll demonstrate later on, maritime trade is a normal part of life, and that means that the waterways just listed will become the economic, political, and strategic keys to most of the North American continent. The implications of that geographical reality will be the focus of a number of posts as we proceed.<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode"; mso-fareast-language: #00FF; mso-font-kerning: .5pt'> </span></div>

In fact, some of it is already starting to happen in and around New York City in response to Hurricane Sandy. Computer and electrical infrastructure has been moved out of basements into higher stories of buildings, copper wire is being replaced by fiber-optic cables, and even the Army Corps of Engineers is realizing that replenishing the sand around Coney Island has a shelf life of only a few decades before it's no longer cost effect--and that's assuming business as usual continues in the face of climate change and sea level rise.<br><br>http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2013/11/pbs-newshour-on-hurricane-sandy-one.html<br><br>Also, I agree that the inland waterways of North America will become more important. In fact, they already are. Freight traffic has finally surpassed recreational traffic on the Erie Canal. This will help support new roles and revive old roles for the cities of the Great Lakes in the future, including Detroit, although those new roles won't be enough to maintain the current populations.<br><br>http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2014/06/great-lakes-cities-and-their-roles-in.html<br><br>The one quibble I have is on the scope and effect of tsunamis from Greenland on the east coast of the U.S. Yes, there will be earthquakes from isostatic rebound after the ice sheets melt, but I don't know if there will be enough uplift from each event to produce a wave bigger than a very large storm wave. One of those might be a couple feet high and go up a river a mile, but I have trouble seeing anything bigger from a reactivated normal fault with a magnitude 6 earthquake, which is what is going to happen around Greenland. Submarine landslides are a different story, and those could produce the kinds of tsunamis you are predicting. As for the methane eruptions, I suppose, but I don't recall one big enough to actually produce a measureable tsunami.<br><br>As for the effect, most of the U.S. east coast is around the bend of Labrador, Newfoundland, and the Grand Banks from Greenland and facing southeast, so most of it should be doubly protected from tsunamis from Greenland. Europe, on the other hand, will get direct hits from the northwest.<br><br>A better candidate would be landslides from the Azores and Canary Islands.

Some of the papers on that have documented masses of sediment up to 2000 cubic miles that, if the theory is right, were displaced by sudden methane hydrate releases. <br><br>I was interested to note that one of my readers posted something to last week's post referencing a book on exactly this subject I haven't seen -- Bill McGuire's <i>Waking the Giant</i>.

I will make the same quibble you said you frequently receive: that global temperatures spiked 7 C in the space of about a decade based on Greenland oxygen isotope data. Are we sure this has nothing to do with local conditions - polar amplification makes a 7 C jump in the far north quite possible, but on the whole it doesn't make much sense. IIRC, the entire global temperature change from the last glacial maximum to the Holocene was no more than 6 C. <br><br>If I get time, I'll do a little more looking around and see if I can find out what the magnitude of that change really was, and also to see what the ice cores in Antarctica say about that spike.<br><br>That reminds me: while interviewing at a grad school (not the one I later got into) in March, I was handed a chunk of 20,000 year old ice from an Antarctic core. They have to shave off the outer parts of the core due to possible drill bit contamination, so they like giving little chunks of that to visitors. It's amazing how large and widespread the bubbles of air from the LGM were thoughout the ice. The slowly melting ice cracked like Rice Krispies as the bubbles popped and released a little bit of LGM air with ~190 ppm CO2. Finally, after most of it had melted, I ate the remaining chunk. I was told that may not be the best idea due to the drilling fluid...but then they broke down and said it was a pretty minor danger; they have cocktails with rejected ice several times a year!<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-rising-oceans.html#c1604363660838960171 title="comment permalink">8/6/14, 8:01 PM</a><br><br>

Ever. It's wireless or none, which means those places have lost access to some 'basics' of city life. ATMs, for example, usually need to be wired.<br><br>I live in a small city with a deepwater port to the east of NYC. The land rises steeply up from the harbor and most folks live at 50' or more, but all the infrastructure is at sea level. The power plant, loading docks, chemical plant, tranformers, and especially the railroad. If the sea rises 15', the most trafficked rail line in the country will be underwater at high tide!<br><br>Now, the state cannot even come up with the money to fix the 115 year old swing bridge across the harbor ( yet another sign of the shameful neglect of our infrastructure) so this may all soon be a moot point. <br><br>But from my vantage point up here on the hill overlooking the harbor and downtown (140' elevation, thank you very much) it looks like such a waste.

It would certainly take a much more intense warming to melt it than Greenland or Wast Antarctica, and the CO2 alone from fossil fuels wouldn't do it, but add in methane releases and there could be something akin to the PETM. All the paleoclimate information I've seen does seem to indicate that it's very hard for the climate to warm past 9 or 10 degrees C above today's average (the PETM got a little higher, but it arose out of a climate already substantially warmer than today's. That indicates to me there's probably some negative feedback that kicks in once the climate gets that warm, making the runaway climate doom/NTE scenarios extremely unlikely.<br><br>It may only take 4 or 5 degrees C of global temperature change to cause collapse of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. The late Eocene was about that much warmer than today and there were no ice caps, they didn't form until the Oligocene when it became sharply colder. Polar amplification means that a 4 or 5 degree global change can create many times that much change at the poles.<br><br>I used to see the figure of a possible 300 foot rise eventually if all the ice melted. However I've more recently been seeing smaller numbers. The USGS estimates are that there is enough ice in all the world's ice sheets to raise sea level by 206 feet. This page breaks it down (at the end of the article) http://www.thewire.com/politics/2013/11/map-sea-level-rise-probably-wrong-its-too-optimistic/71246/<br><br>Thermal expansion would raise the sea level higher, a half meter or so for every degree C increase in the global temperature.<br><br>I'm also curious why you expect return to ice age conditions in a few millennis? The peak of the PETM lasted 100,000 years. If that happened again, we would skip the whole next ice age.

I suspect that when the sea ice to the north of Greenland is gone in the summer we'll see glaciers flowing into the sea much faster than now. Ice doesn't have to melt to raise sea levels. It can do the same thing by moving from land to sea. The recent discovery of the "Grand Canyon" of Greenland under the ice raises the likelihood that this scenario might play out.

When the maintenance is neglected due to lack of funding or parts, or perhaps even before that if a very large flood occurs (not too unlikely with increasingly chaotic weather), the Atchafalaya will steal all of the water, leaving Baton Rouge, many chemical plants, and all else on the lower part of present channel of the Miss.

I've often speculated about changing sea levels where I live. The Puget Sound land plateau is generally above three hundred feet rising slowly to the cascade foothills. The low areas are the result of erosion and glaciation. The result of water, ice and time. As sea levels rise the area overall won't submerge. Valleys will fill and coastlines retreat. Bellevue will be on Puget Sound. Large areas now dry will be overtaken by the expanding sound. <br><br>I got a good sense of the terrain when I became a bicycle rider, it made me very elevation aware. Climbing the last hill home I'd crawl out of the sea and then climb something close to four hundred feet to get home if oceans rise thirty feet. For now the bottom of the hill is dry. <br><br>But will anyone notice? I'll be a lucky man to live long enough to see any changes. An observer, a historian will live hundreds of years hence. In those years many '<a href=http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Black_swan rel=nofollow>Black Swans</a>' as described by N. N. Taleb will surely descend upon the land. The social and economic changes a flock of 'Black Swans' may bring could obliterate all memory of present life and things past. <br><br>In a few hundred years people may become predominantly illiterate. They may have no connection to us at all. People living in the Puget Sound then may know no more of the internet and television then than we do of Roman Music. How many libraries will survive a flock of a thousand landing black swans? Of any that do will the language in their books be understood? The future inhabitants of the land may not be the sons and daughters of present inhabitants. They may speak a different tongue. Die-offs to come will bring changes as great as any tsunamis you describe. Books moldering in remaining libraries may at some future time be called work of a devils hand. Then they will be disposed of accordingly. Like religious shrines being destroyed in <a href=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28177841 rel=nofollow>northern Iraq</a>. <br><br>But if there is a quiet monastic cell somewhere and a future historian lights a candle carefully unfolding some old, rare and yellowed maps next to some freshly penned travelers tales of his own time. He will know the world has changed. Then with a trembling hand his goose quill will dip into his inkwell and seeing the ancient connections flickering in the candlelight, he will begin to write. In a language we may not be able to read. A history of things to come.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-rising-oceans.html#c4766020509766676004 title="comment permalink">8/7/14, 12:52 AM</a><br><br>

As the comments suggest many, at the micro level, are already thinking about the various decisions likely to confront much of the population alive today, or their closest descendants. Since the majority of the population is located within 50 miles of our diverse coast lines the majority of our expensive infrastructure in located in these area. The role of sunk costs in important deliberations is believed to be a major factor for considerations. <br><br>A 2004 paper in the Journal of Ecology and Society, http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss1/art6/ , discusses the sunk costs decisions made by ancient collapses societies. " .. this paper, we propose an explanation why overexploitation seems more common in ancient societies that built larger structures. This explanation is based on the well-studied sunk-cost effect in human decision making: decisions are often based on past investments rather than expected future returns. This leads to an unwillingness to abandon something (e. g., a settlement) if a great deal has been invested in it, even if future prospects are dim." <br><br> Keep sunk costs gentle on the mind!<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-rising-oceans.html#c1732450210022723902 title="comment permalink">8/7/14, 6:23 AM</a><br><br>

Large ships of equally large value cargoes would be too risky. We would soon be back to schooner scale shipments. Eulogies for Walmart and Costco would appropriate at this time.

At the summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet, temperatures climbed by 5-10 C (best guess about 7 C) in a very short time period (&lt;30 years, much of it was in &lt;10 years). That was then followed by a more gradual warming over the next 1300 years during the Preboreal until it reached its typical Holocene value of about 15 C warmer than the Younger Dryas average.<br><br>Crucially, though, this was only the figure for the Greenland Ice Sheet summit. They used a number of isotope proxies, including H-2, N-15, and Ar-40 along with O-18; they all paint very similar pictures. They relied on the fact that molecules with heavier atoms settle disproportionately due to gravity and that this effect is highly temperature-dependent, enriching those isotope ratios disproportionately more at colder temperatures.<br><br>Paleoclimate studies in mid-latitudes show equally rapid temperature rises, but not of the same magnitude. Some studies of several temperature proxies in southern Switzerland (at around 47 N) showed the Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition resulted in warming of only about 3-4 C in the summer, although winter temperatures responded by a substantially greater (but less certain) amount.<br><br>I haven't looked at any papers about the subtropics or tropics, but I from what I gather the effect should have been much less. I'd hazard a guess that the average over the planet couldn't have been more than something like 2.5 C, given that half the land area on the planet is between 30 S and 30 N, and that land temperatures respond far faster than the ocean to rapid warming.<br><br>Not sure if you can access them, but here are some papers:<br><br>Greenland summit<br>http://www.sciencemag.org/content/278/5339/825.full<br>http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v391/n6663/full/391141a0.html<br>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379199000621#<br><br>Switzerland<br>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018200000936#<br>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033589401922574<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-rising-oceans.html#c6282819316589918086 title="comment permalink">8/7/14, 9:31 AM</a><br><br>

I never even thought about the tsunami issue. One thought I have, and you may also be entertaining this as well, is that sea level rise will likely be so far off in the future that we'll be gone as a civilization long before then anyways. So it's not as much an issue of how will civilization react to sea level rise, but more of what kind of human civilization will there be left to even notice sea level rise. <br><br>One issue is that during previous instances of dark age collapse there were no nuclear weapons. If overpopulation is our primary problem then inevitably wars will break out over scarce resources and whether dropped for the purpose of reducing population or not, nukes will be very effective in that regard. So there might not even be a Sacramento left to worry about. <br><br>Secondly, the bigger primary problem is that we'll almost certainly run out of usable energy long before significant sea level rise (I'm thinking 50 years?), and without energy there will be no way to maintain current population levels. The simple numbers revealing how dependent we are on fossil fuels for everything are staggering. When society is in such a state of rapid population decline I don't think infrastructure is going to be maintained and it will be looted. Without maintenance it will become irreparably useless pretty fast. <br><br>Both oil and natural gas will be over in a few decades, with only small amounts coming from stripper wells supporting Mad Max style oases of life. How long coal will last remains a big question mark, but I think that any large accessible reserves will be plundered pretty fast after oil and gas run out. Then we'll hit the net energy cliff and fossil fuel extraction will drop to almost nothing as the social support structures enabling it collapse (where are the nuts and bolts going to come from to keep the stripper wells pumpng?) In this case I don't see how we'd have much maritime trade at all, except using sailboats. Made out of what? Trading what?<br><br>The only thing that might save us is if someone figures out how to make solar panels with a better net energy return than they have now.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-rising-oceans.html#c5899121176888824750 title="comment permalink">8/7/14, 9:53 AM</a><br><br>

Perhaps losses of human transport, communication, industrial and agricultural areas and their consequences will be easier to foresee and less drastic than the consequences of losses to land and ocean habitat. Since we are already well into overshoot territory for carrying capacity, there are bound to be dramatic and dimly perceived consequences that need to be discussed and not glossed over.

You indicate that we might have something over a fifty-foot rise in the next 500 years. Expressing this more formally, I take your ballpark quantity to be, to one significant figure, 2e10 metres. (I don't think you will want to be as precise as two significant figures, so I don't think that "2.0e10", or indeed "15 metres" or "16 metres" or whatever, will capture your intention. "20 metres", which I have been tempted to write here, is problematic, as being ambiguous between the low-precision"2e10 metres" and the higher-precision "2.0e10 metres".) <br><br>Taking an interest in the long-term future of Estonia, I now feed into the cartographic tool http://flood.firetree.net/ an assumed 2e10-metre rise. I thereupon find that inland Estonia, unlike the present Netherlands interior, **HAS** an agricultural future: the coastline changes only slightly. :-) :-) <br><br>Admittedly, the seaport future of Tallinn becomes questionable.<br><br>Perhaps the present port infrastructure is hopelessly ruined, while Parliament continues its oratory, high and dry on the ancient central-Tallinn citadel eminence of Toompea? Toompea is a Baltic-region, 13th-century, analogue of the the 17th-century upper town in Quebec City. The Quebec upper town, too, will stay dry for a while. <br><br>Estonia is a specialized topic, unlikely to interest other readers greatly. But the fate of London is a matter of general concern, since here we have one of the cultural citadels of the Anglo-Saxon world. <br><br>The present Thames Barrier will fail, in the sense of being overtopped, long before the averaged global sea-level rise reaches the top of the barrier. Early overtopping will occur because the Thames estuary is subject to surges (at any rate from storms; however, I suppose tsunamis, which JGM highlights this week, would be a further worry). <br><br>There admittedly are proposals to build a more ambitious Barrier. <br><br>My hunch, as an uninformed layman, is that London, whether protected only by the present Barrier or protected by some successor thereto, will become a poster child for sea-level rise - one of the great iconic disasters, destined to be remembered centuries from now in ballad and epic and monastic chronicle, with the dome of St Paul's visible above the waves for a while (until key load-bearing structural elements fail), in a watery reprieve of <a href=http://www.frugal-cafe.com/public_html/frugal-blog/frugal-cafe-blogzone/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/st-pauls-cathedral-london-blitz-1940.jpg rel=nofollow>that celebrated wartime photo</a>. <br><br>With the failure of London, British institutional life, so heavy concentrated in recent centuries on London, will need to be reorganized.<br><br>In digging around for a while this morning, I find an easy, concrete Internet resource, to supplement the pleasantly concrete http://flood.firetree.net/. This further resource is a table of Barrier-closing incidents,<br>year by year since the early 1980s, laid out roughly halfway down the long page which is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Barrier. <br><br>The table suggests a sustained deterioration, of uneven pace, since the early 1980s, in the overall Thames situation. <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>(near Toronto, Canada)<br>(Toomas dot Karmo at gmail dot com, www dot metascientia dot com)<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-rising-oceans.html#c7412092495768008585 title="comment permalink">8/7/14, 12:38 PM</a><br><br>

Chicago has been a trade crossroads as long as there have been people, from the times of the earliest immigrants who became the people we call Native Americans. There never was one truly ancestral population because there were always travelers and people coming in from other regions. It was common for people from multiple tribes to live in one village. <br><br>As far as I know, people settled along the rivers, not actually on the Lake Michigan shore or in the tallgrass prairie: the shore and prairies were great places for hunting in different seasons.<br><br>So I can see a new version of that kind of culture re-arising, as infrastructure declines and the rivers are relied on more.<br><br>Also, it takes a great deal of work to keep the Chicago lake plain, a natural swamp/marsh/flat, wet region, more or less dry. So one can imagine changes in residency patterns should the pumps turn off and the Chicago river turn back around. In the near term a great deal of effort will be made to keep Chicago's water management system functioning in order to keep trade going and tap water available.<br><br>One other thing to consider: fluctuating lake levels. The lakes might shrink as temps rise. What would that do to settlement patterns?<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-rising-oceans.html#c9108671684730459138 title="comment permalink">8/7/14, 2:45 PM</a><br><br>

Those thoughts can be summarised as: the world is transient in nature. Perhaps that summary doesn't express the current in your essay so well, but that seems to me to be the underlying theme.<br><br>It's funny, but when I look at all of the plant communities about the mountain range here, they all tell a story about change. No location is immune to that change either. <br><br>For example: The giant mountain ash trees are slugging it out with the alpine ash and messmates for dominance. It all depends on shifting patterns of rainfall, fire, elevation and aspect to the sun. But the contenders are waiting in the background for their day in the sun again. A little bit more rainfall, a little bit less fire and the blackwoods (acacia melanoxylon) will re-establish a solid canopy of drought hardy rainforest. People have also gone and thrown exotic species into the mix too with all sorts of other contenders just waiting. I spotted a feral radiata pine in the nearby forest happily growing. It is a complex drama of change and it is happening right in front of our noses and is there for all to see.<br><br>People on the other hand tend to believe that nature does not change, despite clear evidence that it does. Global weirding challenges people’s core assumptions about their lives which is why it is such a hot button topic.<br><br>A great example here is the reaction to the Black Saturday bushfires in Feb 09. Yeah, I'm always banging on about it, because it is part of my reality. With 2,000 houses burnt or destroyed and 173 dead, and 450,000ha of forest burnt, the authorities chose to enforce stringent building codes and there is also some anecdotal evidence that they deny new building permits in areas outside of established townships.<br><br>That was simply one approach based on the assumption that nature is some untouched wilderness and change is never to occur. However, they could have chosen differently and legislated that houses be built of a more temporary nature. Like the Japanese do in earthquake / tsunami affected areas. Or the Aboriginals used to build less onerous constructions. There are plenty of valid responses to this situation however, it is my gut feel that responding in different ways would challenge many of our cultures core assumptions. Nature will sort it out eventually anyway.<br><br>Your analysis will get no argument from me.

Over the history of the Earth the CO2 concentration has been steadily decreasing as fossil fuels got deposited underground (along with carbonates). This decreasing CO2 conc offset the gradually intensifying Sun which resulted in a relatively stable planetary temperature ("stable" is all relative to what Earth could be -- Venus or Mars). At some point there won't be any greenhouse gases left to deposit underground and the planet will burn up (and actually get swallowed by the Sun). I presume that this is nowhere within the time frame of our CO2 pumping exercise and the ability of the planet to soak it up again? So basically we aren't going to extinguish life on Earth and evolution will again have a long time to develop interesting new life forms?<br><br>I could do the research myself, just thought it might be something you have looked into and it might be interesting to mention it to readers.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-rising-oceans.html#c4064511871550810534 title="comment permalink">8/7/14, 8:27 PM</a><br><br>

Its pretty good; I have followed up the references given to the original papers, and it looks good. The current situation is that we are entering an interstadial period, of small or no glaciations, between stadial or large glaciations. This is primarily driven by the eccentricity of the earth's orbit, which is now very low. The addition of a lot of CO2 to the atmosphere has biased the global temperature upward to the extent that it now seems likely that even the mild 'glaciation' that might have occured in the next few millenia has been cancelled.

Turcotte and Gerald Schubert, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1982, p.244-9); data therein for the Angerman River, Sweden for elevated beach terraces that were corrected for changes in sea level indicate that the post-ice surface displacement decreases exponentially with time, though the earliest data fits that model the worst, showing over a course of ~500 years three bumps of ~60m, 30m, and 50m, before the much more sedate recent changes kicked in (where recent is &lt; 7,000 years). These began ~1,000 years after the ice was removed; Anders Romundset in his 2010 thesis "Relative sea level, deglaciation and tsunami history deduced from isolation basins" also notes a 1,000 year rebound onset delay for his study area—lazy mantle syndrome, I guess. Offsets of that magnitude are no sniffing matter, though there are upper limits to the energy that rocks can store, so I cannot see Idun's apples as being any much larger than the orangutans of fire, and not all earthquakes generate tsunami (Anders has record of a sole big one), and not all tsunami waves get to populated places (Norway or Baffin Island would be far more likely targets for any tsunami off Greenland, though maybe the waves could diffract around Newfoundland somehow? That would be the Maine line of research...), and some populated places do put up "do not build below this memorial" markers. Memory of such ~150 year earthquakes (beginning around the year ~3100 assuming assuming a Greenland not tardy with the deicing and the same hurried mantle flow as in the above studies) might otherwise be tricky; hopefully future generations will still know what to do with untimely and unusually low tides. The more constant nuisance of storm surges (annual, decadal) will likely be far more damaging to human activities than something some graybeard says some other graybeard said they once survived.

I put all the known relevant factors into my mentat computer, and the answer that pops out is Fall River, Massachusetts. Like the Rust Belt it's been "collapsed" for decades, so (unlike most of the Connecticut coastal towns that also have good topography) the real estate prices are, if not reasonable, at least manageable. It's a good location for a coastal or trans-Atlantic trade waypoint, and it's got the elevation; the town climbs a steep river bank so all they need to do is move the street signs for "Water Street" and "Front Street" one block up the hill every century or so. (Okay, it's nowhere near that easy but the topography is there.) The steep cross streets make for hard work for a milkman, but easy tsunami escape.<br><br>Neighboring New Bedford collapsed a century earlier still (in the 19th century it was the world whaling capital) but doesn't have the elevation, though it does have a unique massive low-tech stone sea wall that should help out for quite a while.<br><br>The New England culture outside the major cities is favorable too. Self-sufficient "off the grid" living isn't as popular as in e.g. Appalachia or Colorado (not even back in colonial times; the New England colonies were very organized and regimented), but thrift and old know-how are and always have been highly valued. The version of stoicism associated with the "New England Yankee" still exists. (Not to be confused with the "New York Yankee." To the latter, "thrift" means getting the lowest price; to the former, it means doing without.) It is, I think, one of the better mental frameworks for preparing for and dealing with crisis.<br><br>The biggest uncertainty for "Nuwinga" is probably the future recoverability of the coastal and Grand Banks fisheries, after the peak overshoot population does its worst to scour the oceans of their protein.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-rising-oceans.html#c7713777943291889008 title="comment permalink">8/8/14, 9:49 AM</a><br><br>

That's usually how a major greenhouse event on this planet judders to a halt.

When I mentioned that most of the Netherlands would likely be flooded, he quickly stated that's why the Netherlands was working against climate change and changed the subject.

Perhaps the most important and least appreciated aspect of the Earth's climate system is that the heat content of the oceans are the dominant factor---the heat content of the atmosphere is insignificant in comparison. As a criticism, I'd like to note that the Archdruid didn't really acknowledge this either. As long as cold deep water formation continues, it's hard to see how the Earth will leave its current icehouse state.<br><br>And where is cold, deep water formed? The artic and the Antarctic. It's possible that AGW will lead to year-round ice-free conditions in the arctic (though I think this is unlikely---I doubt the Gulf Stream transports enough heat to keep the arctic ice-free in winter, though I could be wrong) in which case deep water formation in the arctic may slow dramatically or cease. But it is almost impossible to imagine a halting of deep water formation around Antarctica.<br><br>Why? Due to quirks of recent geology (past 30 million years or so), Antarctica is encircled by an ocean, and the circum-polar current and the ice sheets covering Antarctica reinforce each other in a system of powerful feedbacks. To wit, in winter powerful, frigid katabatic winds continually blow seaward off the ice sheet, making the surrounding ocean cold, and driving the current. For its part, the powerful current prevents any serious encroachment of warmer subtropical waters.<br><br>Basically the triggering event for our current ice-house climate state was the opening of the Drake passage and subsequent glaciation of Antarctica (though there were other factors). This occurred in a substantially warmer world than present, and until planetary geology alters the Antarctic current, it's hard to see Earth returning to hothouse. Now I'm not a denialist... We can certainly warm the planet, just not by THAT much. All-in-all I think the Archdruid's take is reasonably likely, though probably with some unforeseeable surprises.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-rising-oceans.html#c4728693474426118775 title="comment permalink">8/9/14, 9:30 AM</a><br><br>

Contempt that Protestant Anglos felt for Catholic Mexicans, and Catholic Hispanics in general, fueled a great deal of the United States' early moves toward empire.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-rising-oceans.html#c3464602818026124103 title="comment permalink">8/9/14, 10:03 AM</a><br><br>

I believe you missed the point. First, I was referring to the seas themselves being too rough to navigate, not the errosion due to wave action. I usually post as BC_EE but this linked through my Google account so it got my secret identity revealed. As an electrical engineer designing and constructing large windfarm projects I do know a little bit about systems theory. In my field this knowledge base is really manifest when one prefers to work in the frequency domain as opposed to the time domain.<br><br>It is a safe assumption with complex systems that when an accelerant, or forcing function is applied something is going happen that was not deterministic. That's why we always make sure we have the big red button that says "STOP". Some of the relocations proposed by other commentators display the temptations of linear thinking. If the seas becomes too rough or unpredictable for effective shipping the issues around maintaining a viable point will be moot. It is also a safe assumption the outcomes will be nonlinear. Think S-curve.<br><br>It may not have been clear, but I was inferring the use of nuclear powered ships would be of a large scale making them feasible. Like an aircraft carrier, they would probably be a small marine city state. Consequently, shipments would be massive and much less frequent. Again, rendering many small port locations unusable.<br><br>Finally, for the East Ontario person heading for the Gulf Islands - oh no, not another one! I'm a native BC'er (BC stands for Beyond Canada because that's how we were treated by eastern Canadians until they found out we had oil and gas and plenty of temperate regions to inhabit). On a serious note, in the Gulf Islands potable water is an issue. Regions investing in both catchment and possibly alternative fresh water production. A little solar powered desalination unit would do nicely.<br><br>And I'm in Ontario building windfalls.

Do you recall the post I made <a href=../../2012/11/on-border.html rel=nofollow>a while back</a> on this same subject? If not, might be worth a read. <br><br>Trog, there'll be a lot of that on the arid plains of the Midwest, in particular, as things settle out. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Ed-M, yes, that sounds about right. <br><br>Brian, I have enough trouble getting people to pay attention to thermodynamics when it comes to such obvious points as the finite nature of energy reserves, I wasn't going to baffle them further by talking about the differential heat storage capacity of air and water! As for the tectonic theory of ice ages, though, it's still a theory -- plausible but unproven -- and as I'm sure you know, there's evidence for shutdowns of the thermohaline circulation, so the permanent nature of deepwater formation isn't necessarily that solidly proven. For the purpose of this survey, I decided to stick with the known -- in this case, paleoclimatological evidence -- without dragging in current theoretical debates. <br><br>As for soot, that's another driver for the climate chaos I discussed last week. I'll look into it, but I'm not sure that it's important enough by itself to warrant a discussion in any detail. <br><br>Scott, no, I got your point. If the seas had been either much rougher or much smoother at different temperature regimes, that would have left a clear proxy marker in variations in the wake of wave erosion. Remember the first rule of scientific method -- when you come up with a hypothesis, look for some test that can disprove it, and see what happens. It'll keep you out of a lot of trouble. As for nuclear ships, if a technology isn't economically viable, it's not going to happen -- and if the necessary infrastructure can't be supported on the available resource base and economic surplus, it's not going to happen, either. Nuclear ships fail both tests. Again, look for disconfirmation! <br><br>Alan, take ten billion tons off a single large island and distribute it across the world's entire ocean surface. Do you notice a difference in the impact on the mantle? I thought so. As for the Greenland measures, I'd encourage you to read the book I cited.

Few people fear climate change because they think that tomorrow will be much like today, but with a different shoreline.

The Aboriginals have lived with the consequences of radioactive sites for more millennia than you'd care to imagine and they simply adapted. As some of those radioactive sites were close to the surface, they had very real world impacts for those people. Those radioactive areas were simply marked as taboo sites inhabited with evil spirits and who can even say that the Aboriginals are wrong in this belief? I fully concur with their approach.<br><br>The subject of nuclear weapons also comes up fairly regularly here. They obviously feature heavily in the national imagination as a potent projection of power.

Plus it also includes significance for the past as a link to the current time. It is sort of hard to explain and I am no expert.<br><br>One of the funniest comments that I've read on this blog was long ago when someone suggested that the local Indigenous population were unable to see the sailing ships of the Europeans. I'm unsure, but I think that the commenter was referring to American natives rather than the Australians.<br><br>Why it is funny to me, is because the commenter genuinely meant that the native people wouldn't have been able to see the sailing ships. They meant it literally. My understanding is not perfect, but I'm pretty sure that the Dreamtime would have and does encompass Europeans, their germs and their technology. This is simply because it have been observed and accepted as part of the world around that culture as it was and not as it should or might have been. <br><br>The funny thing is that it is our Industrial culture which has the blind spots and cannot see that, say for just one example that springs to mind: dumping dioxins as a by-product of the paper making process (incidentally one of the most toxic chemicals known to man in the ocean - or including it in your batch of herbicide which you purchased ironically at the local garden centre) is actually a really bad idea. We just don't see any of this stuff and it is going on all around us, all of the time. It is ironic because it is actually our cultural worldview which is clearly not large enough to take it all in. We really pretend that our actions have no consequences and then hide behind this belief as if somehow it can make us safe.<br><br>Most people have commented this week that somehow that their situation is both unique and special. Without trying to alienate the entire commentariat of this blog, I will tell them this: "Your current circumstances are neither unique nor are they special and consideration that the future is going to look like today is far from a safe bet."<br><br>Just sayin, people.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-rising-oceans.html#c272336322543485887 title="comment permalink">8/10/14, 4:03 AM</a><br><br>

Contrary to what many Anglos believe, Latin American birthrates are not actually that high compared with, say, parts of Africa and the Arab world, and Latin America is not as overcrowded as other parts of the world, either. There's a lot less population pressure on North America from Latin America than, say Europe from the Middle East/Africa. As for someone's comment regarding drug gangs in Central America, that was blowback from American deportations--those gangs originated in the U.S., particularly L.A., among immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.

There's already not enough land to go around and the population continues to grow. With the glaciers in the Himalayas melting there will be serious problems with drought as the rivers run dry, of course before there is drought there will be flooding as the the melt-waters increase. Then you have the problem of Bangladesh, a low lying country being eaten by seas to the south and rivers to the north. Mass migration is inevitable. <br><br>My guess is that governments that are able to organize their excess labour into some-kind of eco-engineering army, in much the same way ancients organized themselves for large-scale civic projects, will be the ones to manage what's coming. That basically leaves most of Africa out but I'm still wondering about South and Central America. EU, US, Russia, China, Japan, and Korea all have functional and refined bureaucratic systems.

We will accomplish this by training our readers to be citizen journalists. <br><br>I feel that covering individual, communal, and state initiated transition projects will be vital to the success of those projects. Keeping an eye on which political and business actors actually understand the urgency of the situation will help us support them, and them to support us.

I do like Petaluma and visit over there a few times a year. Though I think faces the same challenges as Napa as far as transportation goes. If we get a sudden increase in sea level change in the area of 3 feet, all major roads coming in from the Bay Area are under water at high tide. I guess this wouldn't matter if we were out of gas by then. The new train will be following 101 south and that already has problems at high tide during a storm in Marin. I don't see how Petaluma would work surrounded by the bay to the south and east, same as Napa.<br>I think most of your water comes from the Russian River and Sonoma Lake which are very low and a couple more years of drought, they'll be bone dry. Napa is not in any better shape with it being dependent on delta water from the Sierras.<br>The best bet for me would be to move somewhere with summer rains away from the coast. Though try telling that to a wife in denial stage and two soon to be teenagers kids.

That said, yes, I think it's probably best to leave the issue until we get there, which will be some time from now. <br><br>Wadulisi, true enough. One of the hot-button issues we'll have to discuss as we proceed is the process of ethnic strife followed by ethnic dissolution that's standard in the twilight of civilizations. <br><br>Cherokee, the more intensely a society fixates on its own theoretical constructs, the bigger its blind spots. I don't think ours has set a record, but it's well up there. <br><br>James, I read Bateson long before I got to Berman -- <i>Mind and Nature</i> was required reading in the circles I ran with back in the day. I read Berman's <i>Reenchantment of the World</i> in the late 1980s, and didn't find it especially useful -- Theodore Roszak was more to my taste, and of course there were a number of other people saying much the same sort of thing at that time. I haven't read much else of Berman's, as I don't find his political stance useful as an explanatory tool. My primary sources, as I've discussed at some length, are Vico, Spengler, Toynbee, and Nietzche, plus a lot of historians dealing with the collapses of specific societies.<br><br>Nigwil, true enough. I'll be talking about what can be done later in this series of posts. <br><br>Dorda, fascinating. Can you point me to some accessible literature on this effect? <br><br>Phil, many thanks! Those will be useful sources as we proceed. <br><br>Shane, that's an interesting question and one I'll have to research. As for voelkerwanderung, I have a somewhat different model, which I'll be discussing in upcoming posts. <br><br>Cathy, don't get me started about eco-chic status symbols!<br><br>Bear, exactly. Once you can see that in specific examples, it becomes possible to trace the same patterns more broadly. <br><br>Carl, in your place I'd move a good long way east, far enough that it rains regularly.

I've caught myself thinking "Well, I live at 100' above sea level, and it's a shoreline that will have incursions at streams, but they'll make useful protected bays..." And then I remember: I'll be dead. 500 years is a long time. I'm already a bit older than standard life expectancy in a dark age. This isn't about how I'll fare. It's more about how long my legacy will last. How long will someone find this house useful as shelter? How long will someone be digging in my garden? <br><br>Something not much addressed here is the cultural equivalent of Catastrophism versus Gradualism. In Geology, these two schools of thought struggled with the causes and effects of change in the landscape. We now understand that slow erosion, and rapid change by storms and earthquakes, each have their place in geologic history. In Tim Flannery's book The Weather Makers, he spoke of "magic gates" in climate change. These are years when there is a paradigm shift in the climate, and even though the environment as a whole goes on, something is forever changed. The monsoon pattern changes. Glaciers change their melt rates. I think we'll see these culturally, and it's probably appropriate to acknowledge them. 9/11, Katrina, Sandy, The Great Recession, a decade of wars. Are these the cultural equivalent of erosion or of geologic catastrophes? I don't know, but they each seem like a magic gate. Once through, things are different forever, even if only slightly. <br><br>I said something above the other day regarding what trade will look like, and how nuke freighters are a non-starter. JMG points out that trade will continue, but doesn't say what will be traded. Depending on the society of the time, it could (and probably will) be minimal trading of bits of iron, or something as extensive as the current flow of cheap plastic crap from China, and everything in between. To say, "There will be ocean-going trade" covers a huge range of activities, and it makes a difference within the discussion what activities we mean. When we lose sight of scale, we lose much meaning in our discussion.<br><br>Regarding Tsunamis: The Pacific Northwest is due for an earthquake similar to the Norther Japan and Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis of the last ten years. The plate structure is very similar, with an oceanic plate diving under land, resulting in volcanoes and a trench. In this case, the trench is full of Columbia River sediment, but that doesn't matter. That fault lets loose every 300 years, more or less, and the last time was 1701. We know this about to the hour due to Japanese tsunami records. So within the next 500 years, it'll go twice. I'd guess that the first of these will be a major cultural magic gate for the USA.<br><br><br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-rising-oceans.html#c5718109989496640657 title="comment permalink">8/12/14, 6:28 AM</a><br><br>

So it's somewhere between 64 years overdue and another 236 years before it will arrive, with odds of it happening in any given year increasing as 2250 approaches. There is a recent article in the local paper about a current study of the proxies used to determine the date of the quakes. One of these was undersea sediment slides, long assumed to be cause by the quakes. This study showed there may be other causes for these slides as well; thus they don't all signal a quake, which could mean the intervals are generally longer than previously thought.
