Civilizations normally leave a damaged environment behind them when they fall, and ours shows every sign of following that wearily familiar pattern. The nature and severity of the ecological damage a civilization leaves behind, though, depend on two factors, one obvious, the other less so. The obvious factor derives from the nature of the technologies the civilization deployed in its heyday; the less obvious one depends on how many times those same technologies had been through the same cycle of rise and fall before the civilization under discussion got to them. <br><br>There’s an important lesson in this latter factor. Human technologies almost always start off their trajectory through time as environmental disasters looking for a spot marked X, which they inevitably find, and then have the rough edges knocked off them by centuries or millennia of bitter experience. When our species first developed the technologies that enabled hunting bands to take down big game animals, the result was mass slaughter and the extinction of entire species of megafauna, followed by famine and misery; rinse and repeat, and you get the exquisite ecological balance that most hunter-gatherer societies maintained in historic times. In much the same way, early field agriculture yielded bumper crops of topsoil loss and subsistence failure to go along with its less reliable yields of edible grain, and the hard lessons from that experience have driven the rise of more sustainable agricultural systems—a process completed in our time with the emergence of organic agricultural methods that build soil rather than depleting it. <br><br>Any brand new mode of human subsistence is thus normally cruising for a bruising, and will get it in due time at the hands of the biosphere. That’s not precisely good news for modern industrial civilization, because ours is a brand new mode of human subsistence; it’s the first human society ever to depend almost entirely on extrasomatic energy—energy, that is, that doesn’t come from human or animal muscles fueled by food crops. In my book <a href="http://www.newsociety.com/affil.mvc?Affil=ARCH&amp;Page=../Books/E/The-Ecotechnic-Future">The Ecotechnic Future</a>, I’ve suggested that industrial civilization is simply the first and most wasteful of a new mode of human society, the technic society. Eventually, I proposed, technic societies will achieve the same precise accommodation to ecological reality that hunter-gatherer societies worked out long ago, and agricultural societies have spent the last eight thousand years or so pursuing. Unfortunately, that doesn’t help us much just now. <br><br>Modern industrial civilization, in point of fact, has been stunningly clueless in its relationship with the planetary cycles that keep us all alive. Like those early bands of roving hunters who slaughtered every mammoth they could find and then looked around blankly for something to eat, we’ve drawn down the finite stocks of fossil fuels on this planet without the least concern about what the future would bring—well, other than the occasional pious utterance of thoughtstopping mantras of the “Oh, I’m sure they’ll think of something” variety. That’s not the only thing we’ve drawn down recklessly, of course, and the impact of our idiotically short-term thinking on our long-term prospects will be among the most important forces shaping the next five centuries of North America’s future. <br><br>Let’s start with one of the most obvious: topsoil, the biologically active layer of soil that can support food crops. On average, as a result of today’s standard agricultural methods, North America’s arable land loses almost three tons of topsoil from each cultivated acre every single year. Most of the topsoil that made North America the breadbasket of the 20th century world is already gone, and at the current rate of loss, all of it will be gone by 2075. That would be bad enough if we could rely on artificial fertilizer to make up for the losses, but by 2075 that won’t be an option: the entire range of chemical fertilizers are made from nonrenewable resources—natural gas is the main feedstock for nitrate fertilizers, rock phosphate for phosphate fertilizers, and so on—and all of these are depleting fast. <br><br>Topsoil loss driven by bad agricultural practices is actually quite a common factor in the collapse of civilizations. Sea-floor cores in the waters around Greece, for example, show a spike in sediment deposition from rapidly eroding topsoil right around the end of the Mycenean civilization, and another from the latter years of the Roman Empire. If archeologists thousands of years from now try the same test, they’ll find yet another eroded topsoil layer at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, the legacy of an agricultural system that put quarterly profits ahead of the relatively modest changes that might have preserved the soil for future generations. <br><br>The methods of organic agriculture mentioned earlier could help very significantly with this problem, since those include techniques for preserving existing topsoil, and rebuilding depleted soil at a rate considerably faster than nature’s pace. To make any kind of difference, though, those methods would have to be deployed on a very broad scale, and then passed down through the difficult years ahead. Lacking that, even where desertification driven by climate change doesn’t make farming impossible, a very large part of today’s North American farm belt will likely be unable to support crops for centuries or millennia to come. Eventually, the same slow processes that replenished the soil on land scraped bare by the ice age glaciers will do the same thing to land stripped of topsoil by industrial farming, but “eventually” will not come quickly enough to spare our descendants many hungry days. <br><br>The same tune in a different key is currently being played across the world’s oceans, and as a result my readers can look forward, in the not too distant future, to tasting the last piece of seafood they will ever eat. Conservatively managed, the world’s fish stocks could have produced large yields indefinitely, but they were not conservatively managed; where regulation was attempted, political and economic pressure consistently drove catch limits above sustainable levels, and of course cheating was pervasive and the penalties for being caught were merely another cost of doing business. Fishery after fishery has accordingly collapsed, and the increasingly frantic struggle to feed seven billion hungry mouths is unlikely to leave any of those that remain intact for long. <br><br>Worse, all of this is happening in oceans that are being hammered by other aspects of our collective ecological stupidity. Global climate change, by boosting the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, is acidifying the oceans and causing sweeping shifts in oceanic food chains. Those shifts involve winners as well as losers; where calcium-shelled diatoms and corals are suffering population declines, seaweeds and algae, which are not so sensitive to changes in the acid-alkaline balance, are thriving on the increased CO2 in the water—but the fish that feed on seaweeds and algae are not the same as those that feed on diatoms and corals, and the resulting changes are whipsawing ocean ecologies. <br><br>Close to shore, toxic effluents from human industry and agriculture are also adding to the trouble. The deep oceans, all things considered, offer sparse pickings for most saltwater creatures; the vast majority of ocean life thrives within a few hundred miles of land, where rivers, upwelling zones, and the like provide nutrients in relative abundance. We’re already seeing serious problems with toxic substances concentrating up through oceanic food chains; unless communities close to the water’s edge respond to rising sea levels with consummate care, hauling every source of toxic chemicals out of reach of the waters, that problem is only going to grow worse. Different species react differently to this or that toxin; some kind of aquatic ecosystem will emerge and thrive even in the most toxic estuaries of deindustrial North America, but it’s unlikely that those ecosystems will produce anything fit for human beings to eat, and making the attempt may not be particularly good for one’s health. <br><br>Over the long run, that, too, will right itself. Bioaccumulated toxins will end up entombed in the muck on the ocean’s floor, providing yet another interesting data point for the archeologists of the far future; food chains and ecosystems will reorganize, quite possibly in very different forms from the ones they have now. Changes in water temperature, and potentially in the patterns of ocean currents, will bring unfamiliar species into contact with one another, and living things that survive the deindustrial years in isolated refugia will expand into their former range. These are normal stages in the adaptation of ecosystems to large-scale shocks. Still, those processes of renewal take time, and the deindustrial dark ages ahead of us will be long gone before the seas are restored to biological abundance. <br><br>Barren lands and empty seas aren’t the only bitter legacies we’re leaving our descendants, of course. One of the others has received quite a bit of attention on the apocalyptic end of the peak oil blogosphere for several years now—since March 11, 2011, to be precise, when the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster got under way. Nuclear power exerts a curious magnetism on the modern mind, drawing it toward extremes in one direction or the other; the wildly unrealistic claims about its limitless potential to power the future that have been made by its supporters are neatly balanced by the wildly unrealistic claims about its limitless potential as a source of human extinction on the other. Negotiating a path between those extremes is not always an easy matter. <br><br>In both cases, though, it’s easy enough to clear away at least some of the confusion by turning to documented facts. It so happens, for instance, that no nation on Earth has ever been able to launch or maintain a nuclear power program without huge and continuing subsidies. Nuclear power never pays for itself; absent a steady stream of government handouts, it doesn’t make enough economic sense to attract enough private investment to cover its costs, much less meet the huge and so far unmet expenses of nuclear waste storage; and in the great majority of cases, the motive behind the program, and the subsidies, is pretty clearly the desire of the local government to arm itself with nuclear weapons at any cost. Thus the tired fantasy of cheap, abundant nuclear power needs to be buried alongside the Eisenhower-era propagandists who dreamed it up in the first place. <br><br>It also happens, of course, that there have been quite a few catastrophic nuclear accidents since the dawn of the atomic age just over seventy years ago, especially but not only in the former Soviet Union. Thus it’s no secret what the consequences are when a reactor melts down, or when mismanaged nuclear waste storage facilities catch fire and spew radioactive smoke across the countryside. What results is an unusually dangerous industrial accident, on a par with the sudden collapse of a hydroelectric dam or a chemical plant explosion that sends toxic gases drifting into a populated area; it differs from these mostly in that the contamination left behind by certain nuclear accidents remains dangerous for many years after it comes drifting down from the sky. <br><br>There are currently 69 operational nuclear power plants scattered unevenly across the face of North America, with 127 reactors among them; there are also 48 research reactors, most of them much smaller and less vulnerable to meltdown than the power plant reactors. Most North American nuclear power plants store spent fuel rods in pools of cooling water onsite, since the spent rods continue to give off heat and radiation and there’s no long term storage for high-level nuclear waste. Neither a reactor nor a fuel rod storage pool can be left untended for long without serious trouble, and a great many things—including natural disasters and human stupidity—can push them over into meltdown, in the case of reactors, or conflagration, in the case of spent fuel rods. In either case, or both, you’ll get a plume of toxic, highly radioactive smoke drifting in the wind, and a great many people immediately downwind will die quickly or slowly, depending on the details and the dose. <br><br>It’s entirely reasonable to predict that this is going to happen to some of those 175 reactors. In a world racked by climate change, resource depletion, economic disintegration, political and social chaos, mass movements of populations, and the other normal features of the decline and fall of a civilization and the coming of a dark age, the short straw is going to be drawn sooner or later, and serious nuclear disasters are going to happen. That doesn’t justify the claim that every one of those reactors is going to melt down catastrophically, every one of the spent-fuel storage facilities is going to catch fire, and so on—though of course that claim does make for more colorful rhetoric. <br><br>In the real world, for reasons I’ll be discussing further in this series of posts, we don’t face the kind of sudden collapse that could make all the lights go out at once. Some nations, regions, and local areas within regions will slide faster than others, or be deliberately sacrificed so that resources of one kind or another can be used somewhere else. As long as governments retain any kind of power at all, keeping nuclear facilities from adding to the ongoing list of disasters will be high on their agendas; shutting down reactors that are no longer safe to operate is one step they can certainly do, and so is hauling spent fuel rods out of the pools and putting them somewhere less immediately vulnerable. <br><br>It’s probably a safe bet that the further we go along the arc of decline and fall, the further these decommissioning exercises will stray from the optimum. I can all too easily imagine fuel rods being hauled out of their pools by condemned criminals or political prisoners, loaded on flatbed rail cars, taken to some desolate corner of the expanding western deserts, and tipped one at a time into trenches dug in the desert soil, then covered over with a few meters of dirt and left to the elements. Sooner or later the radionuclides will leak out, and that desolate place will become even more desolate, a place of rumors and legends where those who go don’t come back. <br><br>Meanwhile, the reactors and spent-fuel pools that don’t get shut down even in so cavalier a fashion will become the focal points of dead zones of a slightly different kind. The facilities themselves will be off limits for some thousands of years, and the invisible footprints left behind by the plumes of smoke and dust will be dangerous for centuries. The vagaries of deposition and erosion are impossible to predict; in areas downwind from Chernobyl or some of the less famous Soviet nuclear accidents, one piece of overgrown former farmland may be relatively safe while another a quarter hour’s walk away may still set a Geiger counter clicking at way-beyond-safe rates. Here I imagine cow skulls on poles, or some such traditional marker, warning the unwary that they stand on the edge of accursed ground. <br><br>It’s important to keep in mind that not all the accursed ground in deindustrial North America will be the result of nuclear accidents. There are already areas on the continent so heavily contaminated with toxic pollutants of less glow-in-the-dark varieties that anyone who attempts to grow food or drink the water there can count on a short life and a wretched death. As the industrial system spirals toward its end, and those environmental protections that haven’t been gutted already get flung aside in the frantic quest to keep the system going just a little bit longer, spills and other industrial accidents are very likely to become a good deal more common than they are already. <br><br>There are methods of soil and ecosystem bioremediation that can be done with very simple technologies—for example, plants that concentrate toxic metals in their tissues so it can be hauled away to a less dangerous site, and fungi that break down organic toxins—but if they’re to do any good at all, these will have to be preserved and deployed in the teeth of massive social changes and equally massive hardships. Lacking that, and it’s a considerable gamble at this point, the North America of the future will be spotted with areas where birth defects are a common cause of infant mortality and it will be rare to see anyone over the age of forty or so without the telltale signs of cancer. <br><br>There’s a bitter irony in the fact that cancer, a relatively rare disease a century and a half ago—most childhood cancers in particular were so rare that individual cases were written up in medical journals —has become the signature disease of industrial society, expanding its occurrence and death toll in lockstep with our mindless dumping of chemical toxins and radioactive waste into the environment. What, after all, is cancer? A disease of uncontrolled growth. <br><br>I sometimes wonder if our descendants in the deindustrial world will appreciate that irony. One way or another, I have no doubt that they’ll have their own opinions about the bitter legacy we’re leaving them. Late at night, when sleep is far away, I sometimes remember Ernest Thompson Seton’s heartrending 1927 prose poem “A Lament,” in which he recalled the beauty of the wild West he had known and the desolation of barbed wire and bleached bones he had seen it become. He projected the same curve of devastation forward until it rebounded on its perpetrators—yes, that would be us—and imagined the voyagers of some other nation landing centuries from now at the ruins of Manhattan, and slowly piecing together the story of a vanished people: <br><br> Their chiefs and wiser ones shall know <br> That here was a wastrel race, cruel and sordid, <br> Weighed and found wanting, <br> Once mighty but forgotten now. <br> And on our last remembrance stone, <br> These wiser ones will write of us: <br> They desolated their heritage, <br> They wrote their own doom. <br><br> I suspect, though, that our descendants will put things in language a good deal sharper than this. As they think back on the people of the 20th and early 21st centuries who gave them the barren soil and ravaged fisheries, the chaotic weather and rising oceans, the poisoned land and water, the birth defects and cancers that embitter their lives, how will they remember us? I think I know. I think we will be the orcs and Nazgûl of their legends, the collective Satan of their mythology, the ancient race who ravaged the earth and everything on it so they could enjoy lives of wretched excess at the future’s expense. They will remember us as evil incarnate—and from their perspective, it’s by no means easy to dispute that judgment. <br></div>

Thank you for that understanding.<br><br>Yes top soil loss is profound in industrial agricultural systems and people can ignore it - for now - just.<br><br>A funny example from here recently is when someone mentioned to me that growing companion plants under the fruit trees would provide opportunities for slugs and snails in which to breed. The look they gave me was like, "man, you are asking for trouble". <br><br>After that I explained that those critters were food for the birds whose manure would provide fertiliser for the soil in and around the fruit trees and surrounding forest. The companion plants also have very deep root systems so they can mine minerals and water from deep within the soil and have such fast growth cycles that the deaths of their leaves provides sufficient organic matter for the soil bacteria and fungi - which in turn feeds the fruit trees as well. Phew that was a mouthful!<br><br>The greater the diversity of life within an agricultural system, the more resilient that system is to shocks and generally the more productive it becomes.<br><br>After all of that explanation he just shook his head and gave me a don't say I didn't tell you look. <br><br>There is a complete failure of systems thinking in industrial agriculture that makes me shake my head in disbelief!<br><br>It is worth mentioning that there is no quick fix too with the implementation of organic agriculture. It all depends on how fertile your original soil is in the first place and how biologically active the soils and ecosystem is in your area. Even the soil life has to come from somewhere nearby, so if every one of your neighbours has killed it off, your only option is to either wait or import it.<br><br>There is no getting around it, if you poison your immediate area, then there is no quick fix. It will take many years to remediate it and restore even a basic level of fertility. There are no else where's to go to or for industrial agriculture to conquer. I strongly suspect that yields will decrease over the next few years especially if you chuck global weirding into the mix too.<br><br>I spoke with someone who’d been in France recently and they told me the supermarkets stocked food derived from Kenya of all places! Yikes!<br><br>This comment is to everyone here: If anyone is uncertain, ask yourself, where did your dinner come from?<br><br>On a more pleasant note: I woke up last night to a series of blood curdling screams in the forest and orchard. Oh yeah, you can't sleep through that one!<br><br>After a bit of research this morning, I believe it was the sound that the small marsupial sugar glider makes here. I might have mentioned a few years back that the sugar glider sneaks into the chicken enclosure during winter to feast on the grains and other uneaten food. They have a very high metabolism so require a lot of feeding, but usually eat the sugary sap from the eucalyptus trees.

I agree that reversal of this industrial ag pattern at a national or global level is unlikely, but there are becoming more and more farm scale prototypes of permaculture perennial food crop systems that build topsoil. Replication of these template farms on local and regional bases is my hope that we will leave at least some positive legacy for the future. By itself, it won't bring back critical nutrients like phosphorus, but it does begin our transition to low input, nature emulating food production. Personally, I have retired early from the energy industry, and plan to focus my remaining years on planting woody crop plant communities that mimic the oak savanna native to southwest Wisconsin, where my wife and I have been fortunate enough to secure 40 acres of former overused farmland.

These policies over time foster a culture of "cover it up and paper it over" and encourage the kind of cowboy risk-o-philiac culture that is traditional in mining and drilling.<br><br>The CEO of Imperial [ahem] Metals made one of the most bizarre suggestions (to my ear) ever made by the culprit in the dock for a major poisoning crime. He said that since the company did not at present have the resources to cover the rather large cost of cleaning up the mess they've made, he thought the government should fast-track the permits for their next several proposed mines so that they could make lots of money faster and thus pay for the cleanup... yup, he said that. If you give me a hamburger today, I'll give you two tomorrow, eh.<br><br>Anyway, you can look all over the energy (and factory ag) sector and see the same atmosphere of desperately and increasingly risky praxis chasing diminishing returns; I agree with JMG that the trend is structural and inevitable as resources deplete, and can only be averted by *conscious* acceptance and enforcement of limits -- the l-word that our triumphalist technic idiocracy can't spell or hear.<br><br>Funny thing is, we're not supposed to perceive the desperation (even though to me it stands out like the proverbial indoor elephant). We're supposed to believe the happy-happy triumphalist story, even as the costs and risks of "producing" energy [gawdsteeth, I am chronically vexed by the sheer wilful ignorance of physics embodied in that phrase] rise closer and closer to EROEI 1:1 and Game Over. Truth be told, I think we're already worse than 1:1, if we would just stop dishonestly externalising all the biotic costs and net biotic energy loss (damage to food chain, loss of photosynthetic and soil activity, etc) -- but even as measured by autistic economists, the risks and costs (to the society at large) seem to be getting perilously close to the anticipated returns.<br><br>BTW, another sign of the times: Environment Canada's "Preparedness" pages online list "Chemical Releases" as one of the standard emergencies which one should anticipate and be prepared for -- right up there with tornadoes, avalanches, floods, earthquakes, etc. As if a "release" were just another "act of God", something that just inevitably happens now and then, which you should bear in mind and plan for.<br><br>It's OK that this age of the world is ending.

The garden is happily still going. <br><br>But a question on another topic - what role, if any, do you see the arts and music playing in context of the theme of your blog? I cringe a bit even asking, because of the many important practical things to learn and do, but because I spend a lot of my time on playing/making music because it’s something important to me. I wonder what role the arts/music played in other declining civilisations… we’re also at the moment over-saturated in terms of art/music, there is so much of it that maybe we don’t value it anymore. You’ve written before about Oswald Spengler’s phases of civilisations, maybe I should look to see if he has written about this topic.

I like to imagine a sheer canyon wall with the top of the canyon being current energy per capita and the bottom being the normal energy per capita. somehow it really brings home the concept looking up at the sheer cliffs with no way back up. <br><br> One energy combination I have been looking into though to perhaps provide for some bare necessities in the decades ahead is the combination of Solar Thermal and Steam. Parabolic mirrors boil water in vacuum tubes and run steam engines for electricity and store the excess as pressurized water in a large propane storage tank. It is simple, uses proven technology and relies on no exotic materials. I don't think enough of these will be built to make a large difference but they will be wonderful for those that had the forethought to get one. These might be useful to build in the coming salvage economy. Can solar thermal steampowered railcars work for the cities left with some form of sanity?<br><br>As the world expands I imagine it will be just as big, vibrant and vivid as the world we have now. The only reason it seems so desolate in our minds is because we don't have many narratives to use for them. The history and accounts of The Greek Empire, Medieval Europe or Incan Peru, are just as vibrant and vivid as today. despite these areas containing a fraction of the population. It seems to me in a world where 5% of the current population lives in marginal "luck zones" separated by toxic, radioactive plains, desertified landscapes and inhospitable scrub and forestland, plenty of room exist for stories just as harrowing and inspiriting as the ones we have today. I guess most people miss out on that excitement because they are busy wallowing in self pity or some stage of grief. Most of us spend our days hedging risk against everything avoiding any possible pain or accident. However, a world where the margin of survival is much less would feel a bit more authentic to it. I like the idea of riding a motorcycle but I don't like the statistics that go along with it.

But in 1964 Sir Fred Hoyle put our condition rather bluntly:-<br><br>'It has often been said that, if the human species fails to make a go of it here on the Earth, some other species will take over the running. In the sense of developing intelligence this is not correct. We have or soon will have, exhausted the necessary physical prerequisites so far as this planet is concerned. With coal gone, oil gone, high-grade metallic ores gone, no species however competent can make the long climb from primitive conditions to high-level technology. This is a one-shot affair. If we fail, this planetary system fails so far as intelligence is concerned. The same will be true of other planetary systems. On each of them there will be one chance, and one chance only.' <br><br>In this statement Hoyle is perhaps mixing the concept of 'intelligence' with that of 'high-level technology'. We are indeed hoping that enough of us will make it through the transition to use the human's high intelligence in a civilisation on a planet that is in balance in all regards, albeit in a way that may be viewed today as 'primitive'. <br><br>Its been suggested/calculated(?) that we present-day humans are derived from as few as several hundred samples of the species who made it through a previous extinction/transition event. The way things are going we will be fortunate indeed to have even that much of our DNA make it through to the next round.<br><br><br><a href=#c784301720306208767 title="comment permalink">8/14/14, 3:20 AM</a><br><br>

I regularly get asked “How come you have so much feed [for cattle]?” I then describe why (our grazing management, aimed at increasing topsoil and water retention) and am invariably told “Oh, I can’t do that because {insert spurious excuse here}.”<br><br>A further pointer to why it’s not going to happen: <br>On the 1st of August last, the state gummint decreed that permits would be required for lighting fires, fully three months earlier than normal, due to the drought and hot winter. Result? Thousands of hectares of burnt out farms/forests/national parks all across the state when all the morons lit up on the 31st of July, having decided to beat the bans and burn some annoying grass/trees/rubbish or whatever, then invariably losing control of their fires. <br><br>The “reason” for burning varies, but basically comes down to the idea that the Aborigines used to burn, so you have to burn, ‘cos they knew what they were doing. I guess as the descendants of “those early bands of roving hunters who slaughtered every giant wombat they could find and then looked around blankly for something to eat,” they had reached some kind of accommodation with the landscape, but supporting one million hunter gatherers on a continent is a whole different proposition to twenty four million sedentary bogans.<br><br>Fun times ahead.

We’re particularly happy to see the increase in top level predators around the place, mostly birds like wedge tailed eagles, kites, little eagles and various others – it really does show that the ecosystem in getting heathier by the day. <br><br>Also, just finished planting 107 heritage fruit trees, just in time for some predicted rain on the weekend. All cold weather varieties, which we have been told multiple times can’t be grown here. Funny how just about all the old farmhouses have a big old apple, pear or stone fruit tree out the back that crop reliably every year. We even got 100kg of perry pears from one place last March. Worst cider I’ve ever made, but we’ll have a go again next year and see if we can improve the method. Next we’ll go and find a good selection of tropical and sub-tropicals and see what else will go here.<br><br>“if you poison your immediate area, then there is no quick fix. It will take many years to remediate it and restore even a basic level of fertility”<br><br>Back in May or so, I bought a bunch of pasture seed, on the off chance that it might rain and we could get some diversity of winter pasture happening. The red and white clover seeds were bright blue and yellow, “coated” the salesman told me, with the inoculants that would allow the root nodules to form and fix nitrogen in the soil.<br><br>Research on another topic entirely led me to find out that this coating is primarily there to allow better survival of the sprouts in the early stages of growth. This is achieved through the application of Gaucho, a neonicotinoid insecticide and unspecified fungicides.<br><br>Brilliant! I’ve now poisoned my own paddocks with an insecticide that’ll particularly give the bees a hard time for at least five years (half-life of 19 months in soil) and put back the program of soil rehabilitation for at least as long.

There would never have been 7 billion of us without it. How do you thus become a warrior of good against this evil?<br><br>This leaves me deeply perplexed on how we play the game of musical chairs, being agents of good, as the consequences of overshoot, that you have outlined so well in this essay, undermine the infrastructure that sustains us all. <br><br>An agent of good for me is not defined when dabbling with one foot in alternative energy or permaculture while the other foot is still embedded deeply in industrial civilization. That is only a form of coping or rationalization and is in itself perhaps a worse evil as it is deeply delusional. <br><br>These are still early days I guess.

It's precisely the little organic farms and ranches that get roots in the ground now that, as far as I can see, have the best chance of getting these techniques through to the future.<br><br>Kutamun, the metaphysical implications of nuclear power are another matter entirely, and one that I may eventually have to address over in the other blog. <br><br>Enrique, "what goes around comes around" somehow comes to mind. <br><br>DeAnander, no argument there. I would like to preserve some of the best achievements of this age, but there are a lot of aspects of our present industrial civilization that deserve a quick burial and a water color epitaph. <br><br>Glenn, I thought it had been around then. It might be interesting sometime to work out a list of what's peaked already. <br><br>Onething, I know. We have bees of something like a dozen different species all over our backyard garden every year, because they can get nectar and pollen there that aren't poisoned. The other houses on the street?

As for the broader point you make, I'd go further than that; the world is going to get a great deal larger and richer as our high-speed transport and the other forces driving cultural homogenization break down. It's purely the myth of progress that convinces people that life without the latest round of tawdry technological trash must be boring. <br><br>Orchard, human beings are a durable generalist species, thus about as easy to exterminate as cockroaches or rats.

And it’s a tragedy… and I also know how hard it is to build back soil – not nearly the straightforward “add humus” that they tell us about… I’m doing the mulching routine now, but am getting giant herds of slugs - through August, so far! Even with our record-breaking heat and dry spell, those slugs are nesting in mulch and feasting on my veggies… and I hesitate to kill them all, because they must have an ecological niche…wish it were in Russia, though. Slug migration, anyone?<br><br>Toxins: I think we’re already seeing the effects of this, and people are just in denial. So many more “odd illnesses”, and I even think our decreased ability to think critically, and to resist impulse, is part of the effect of toxins on our brains. It’s like the Romans and lead… when we finally admit it, it will be too late…<br><br><i>I can all too easily imagine fuel rods being hauled out of their pools by condemned criminals or political prisoners, loaded on flatbed rail cars, taken to some desolate corner of the expanding western deserts, and tipped one at a time into trenches dug in the desert soil, then covered over with a few meters of dirt and left to the elements.</i><br>Ahh! You have just described a short story I wrote in 1984 about Hanford in WA, that unfortunately no one would publish – that scenario is probably already happening somewhere, unbeknownst to us…(incidently, Harlan Ellison admitted it was a “decent” story – high praise from him… still didn’t get published…)<br><br><i>Here I imagine cow skulls on poles,</i><br>Human skulls would be much more effective! LOL.<br><br>And the news coming out of Fukushima continues to get worse, though it’s not getting any attention anymore – they are admitting Reactor 3 primary container was melted through and outer reactor vessel “almost”… when at first they refused to even admit meltdown! And they are now going to release “decontaminated water” (yeah, right) into the ocean, because there is no more storage on site for it! And why has no one made a chart of “total costs” for nuclear reactors, <b>including</b> the cleanup costs – <i>why</i> is it that somehow those “costs” are not attached to the reactors themselves?? Because (as you say) it shows how impossibly expensive nuclear is, and they don’t want to know that.<br><br>Certainly the near-term descendants will be calling us every name in the book (they already are), but in the longrun, they won’t know us at all – we’ll be more like the Hittites, vanished because our records are transient, and the world we bequeathed them will be their “normal” and they won’t even know it could have been better. And that’s tragic, too.<br><br>Coincidentally, last night I was watching the first bit of Ralph Bakshi’s “Wizards” (on YouTube) – a cartoon from the 70’s – all about how nasty machine culture destroyed mankind except for some mutant remnants and only the green elves could save decent civilization… good vs. evil, in a rather twisted context, but showing again how the 70’s was a time of warning of our upcoming crisis.<br><br><a href=#c7150415199091692348 title="comment permalink">8/14/14, 7:42 AM</a><br><br>

It's just a matter of getting enough people trained in the method so that some of them get through the next round of crises. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, that final metaphor gets you today's gold star. I'll be quoting it, with attribution, in an upcoming post -- because of course that's exactly what's going on, with all the overtones of madness and self-defeating delusion the image implies. <br><br>Nigwil, Hoyle was quite simply wrong. It only takes a hundred million years or so to replenish petroleum and natural gas stocks -- coal was a one-shot deal, as far as we know, but the other fossil fuels can be produced any time the world goes through an oceanic anoxic event -- and the same span of time will lay down ample new ore supplies in newly risen mountain ranges. If current estimates are correct and the planet has maybe another billion years before it can no longer support life, there's ample room for other species to make the same idiotic mistakes we have, and maybe for one or two to do something smarter!<br><br>And of course you're right that his equation of intelligence with our specific suite of technologies is typically arrogant and purblind. <br><br>Les, they're not bankrupt yet. I mean that quite literally. Here in the US, one of the most important forces driving the adoption of organic methods is the rate at which farmers go broke on conventional methods -- very high these days. If you're staring bankruptcy in the face, and the guy down the road who uses organic methods isn't having to pay for chemicals and is doing a lot better than you are, all of a sudden organic methods can get a remarkably strong appeal; I've met quite a few farmers and ranchers who made the transition that way. <br><br>Jeffrey, if you want more and now, <a href=../../2009/04/peak-oil-advice-from-german-poets.html rel=nofollow>take it</a>. Choose something to learn, and learn it; choose something to get rid of, and get rid of it; choose something to save, and save it. If that's not enough, repeat the process. Daydreaming on the sofa counts for nothing, and there's no shortage of things to be done. <br><br>Patricia, with any luck, Darwinian selection in favor of learning the difference between jellyfish and plastic bags will have a beneficial effect on sea turtles. I'd like to see them make it. <br><br>Peacegarden, and that's certainly one constructive response. <br><br>Don, I don't happen to know the answer to that, although I do know that all the syndromes you've named are becoming more common at a very rapid pace, as are violent food allergies.

It feels like we’re looking at something at least on par with the Triassic or Jurassic extinction events, not quite enough to bring down every life form bigger than a squirrel, but enough to redefine some ecosystems in irreversible ways and kick evolution off in some interesting new directions.<br><br>I’ve started wondering about the future of human sustenance in that sort of a world, since that’ll play a major role in the decisions we today make trying to preserve agricultural technologies for tomorrow. I feel like if our cultural taboos can shift enough, insect farming could very easily fill the nutritional vacuum left by the collapse of ocean fisheries, and I’ve decided to pick up adapting the well established methods for growing crickets and roaches that reptile hobbyists have laid the ground for into a technology for home scale food production as my “learn something” Green Wizardry skill. That’s turning out to involve a lot more construction and supply gathering than I’d initially expected, and it’s going to take me some time to get stable colonies going, but it’s a project well under way and I think it has potential.<br><br>Humans are omnivores, and plants are important too, so I’m also thinking about what crops would be good for a world with depleted and poisoned soil, a climate in a constant state of chaos, and an ecosystem that’s collapsing all around. I may be able to start a garden next growing season and I’m starting to wonder if it might be a good idea to experiment with domesticating things like stinging nettles, amaranth and dandelion alongside more traditional crops like beans, squash, and peppers?

For about 15 years on and off I've been making music, but up until a couple of years ago mainly electronic music - synthesiser based music which was based less in melody and more in timbre, like a lot of that type of music.<br><br>But in the same way that I got involved in organic vegetable gardening because I felt my skills were too computer-based, a few years I started doing less electronic music and began to learn the piano more thoroughly, as well as Western melody/harmonic compositional principles. Basically, musical skills which don't involve electronics-based amplification and the loudspeaker. <br><br>The broader question which interests me is whether the arts in general can play a role in the coming years - if both the topic of artistic works and the practices in which they are made reflect the time period when they are created, then what does the art of declining civilisation look/sound/feel like?<br><br>After I wrote my first comment early, I went on to Wikipedia's article on Spengler's <i>The Decline of the West</i> to get at least a brief overview. In Spengler's model of the rise and fall of a culture/civilisation going through the four seasons, 'spring' sees the art of a culture very much tied in to religion, summer sees the artistic traditions develop into a high art, fall involves first the perfection of artistic forms but also later the exhaustion of them, and winter apparently sees the end of symbolic art, and art becoming mere fashion. <br><br>Well, that's what Wikipedia has to say about it, obviously I now I need to go and read some Spengler...<br><br>The Winter part is what worries me - do all the arts become meaningless, or is there a form of art which is the equivalent of learning organic gardening; a way of preparing for the future.<br><br><br><a href=#c478572262336450936 title="comment permalink">8/14/14, 8:17 AM</a><br><br>

That then also stimulated me to read The Ecotechnic future, and I'm now reading through those of <a href=../../2009/02/deindustrial-reading-list.html rel=nofollow>your deindustrial reading list</a> that I hadn't read yet, which is definitely a project that has been worthwhile so far.<br><br>This weeks post was again very thoughtful in its overall topic and presentation, but in the interest of accuracy maybe I'm allowed some minor quibbles from my own area of expertise, ocean ecosystems:<br>You say "my readers can look forward, in the not too distant future, to tasting the last piece of seafood they will ever eat". But later in this post you correctly point out that there are refuges in the ocean where threatened species can survive until better times, so I think you've overstated the case here. In all the cases that I'm aware of (I'm not particularly well informed on fisheries) those fisheries that have collapsed have decreased stocks to the point where it's uneconomical to do further fishing, or they have exterminated a local population, and different populations of the same species haven't yet recolonised. There have been other instances on this blog where you haven't followed your own repeated advice against binary thinking.<br><br>Then some minor corrections of fact: Diatoms make shells of opal, which is SiO2. It's the coccolithophores that make shells of CaCO3, and how sensitive they are to ocean acidification varies between negative and positive response from one species to the next and in the better studies species even from one strain to the next. Seaweeds, diatoms and coccolithophores are all algae, with seaweeds being macroalgae and the other two (with many others) microalgae. But on the whole, yes, the ocean is “warming up, losing breath, and turning sour” and it's not unreasonable to expect "sweeping shifts in oceanic food chains".<br><br>Thanks,<br>Best wishes,<br>Erik.<br><br><a href=#c997363037493800425 title="comment permalink">8/14/14, 9:16 AM</a><br><br>

Listen to any infant - even though they're not speaking yet, they are vocalizing and singing to themselves. Give a toddler anything that makes a mark on something else and they will doodle. Those impulses continue as long as there are no overwhelming forces that discourage all but the most "talented" to create.<br><br>Unfortunately, our culture has reached that point - "professional" level talent is required in order to sing/play/draw at all now and show in a public forum. Luckily, there are many who are challenging the mainstream culture and creating/perpetuating the human impulses of creating beauty in many forms that do not require electronica. <br><br>My husband and I play guitar; occasionally we play at the local bar/grill. We don't usually get paid much, or sometimes even at all, but it's a lot of fun to find out who is also a musician and give them a spare guitar to play along with us. The owners would like us to get "electrified" for better sound transmission; I prefer sitting on the patio and being purely acoustic. The whole point is that we aren't particularly talented, amazingly skilled, or even original (we do covers of stuff from modern druid music to 50's rockabilly to punk) but people really enjoy listening, singing along, and even playing along. We are busy creating a musical community without anyone but us being the wiser. <br><br>Ironically, JMG, I took a break from spinning alpaca on my 120 year old Canadian Production Wheel to read your blog and drink a cup of coffee. A technology that will last juxtaposed with an ephemeral one, a machine that was designed to stand up to the test of time juxtaposed with one that's designed to fail; that's the theme of my life it seems.<br><br><a href=#c5221146435958186305 title="comment permalink">8/14/14, 9:43 AM</a><br><br>

Another reader mentioned the extinction of the Grand Banks cod fishery. But didn't Canada supposedly have governmental regulation to prevent just that result. Of course it did. And so what? Newfoundland's unemployment problem took priority and they had to keep the fish processing plants humming. <br><br>Nobody talks about it now. In the immediate aftermath of the closure of the fishery, people blamed European fishing fleets. Sure, sure, Canadians had nothing to do with it. <br><br>I saw references in the comment section about regulatory laxity in Canada. Can't point the finger just at Harper. His attitude is nothing new. For example, the cod fishery debacle was the work of multiple Canadian governments of different political stripes. <br><br>This is nothing unique but my home-town has large, contaminated fields previously occupied by industrial processors. Harper wasn't born when those plants started operating. Regardless of who was in power, does anyone seriously think that environmental concerns were going to get in the way of good paying jobs and corporate bottom lines?<br><br>Previous Liberal governments made a great deal of self congratulatory noise about signing the Kyoto Protocol. You see, this distinguished the intellectually superior and environmentally sensitive Liberals from those knuckle dragging, climate change denying Conservatives. <br><br>But it was ALL noise, ALL posturing. The Liberals did nothing to enact Kyoto. Nobody did. The politics of this place would never allow it. <br><br>As one well known commentator said, if Canada's oil sands were located in Quebec instead of Alberta (as an aside, you have to appreciate Quebec's well honed outrage at historic victimization and its highly refined sense of self interest - and, believe me, that's tough for outsiders), the term "Kyoto" would never even have been heard in this country. <br><br>No, you see, if the oil sands were in Quebec, the Kyoto file would have been immediately dispatched to a filing cabinet in the care of the most junior civil servant in the deepest basement in the most remote government building. Which is where the file ended up anyway in the end. Because the oil sands are in Alberta it just took a little longer. <br><br>In this place and especially when it comes to the environment, hypocrisy is a national pass-time. Hockey? Bah!<br><br>And when it come to agility, none of the hockey greats comes close to the balletic virtuosity of our lefties justifying the SUV in the driveway.<br><br><a href=#c4823216382380529964 title="comment permalink">8/14/14, 10:28 AM</a><br><br>

I make offerings and prayers to my ancestors in the hopes of awakening an element of their wisdom and guidance that still lives within me and living a better life by it. Perhaps the same magic can be employed in reverse can be applied in a psychologically and spiritually useful way… the things I do with a mind to the long term have no guarantee of living or being remembered beyond me, but that’s not the only reason I do them. Perhaps I can offer up the privileges I give up, the skills I learn, the legacies I try to preserve as prayers for forgiveness to whatever spark of the future already resides within me. Perhaps that can be one way of tuning in to a greater purpose in those actions, however small it might be. And perhaps actions like that, and the prayers they carry might resonate on some deeper level… perhaps one day, when the world and humanity has healed, someone will look back at us and say “no, they weren’t evil.

I'm a fan of sharks and sea turtles, myself, mostly because they've been around for so long already; still, I can certainly spare a wish for the tuna. <br><br>Eric, it really depends on how soon the crash hits and how fast the dieoff takes place. If it's soon and relatively fast, a great many species may squeak by, and it'll be a minor extinction. The later and slower, the worse it will likely be.

When all that's left are relict populations in isolated refugia, those populations aren't going to be providing anybody with seafood for a long time to come.

I was particularly struck by your cancer metaphor of uncontrolled growth.<br><br>Though I can see why future generations might see as evil, I don’t think it’s at all helpful for us to view things from that perspective. Wallowing in self-disgust will only make us hate our own company. Too late for bulimia now. None of us knew any of this 50 years ago, and even now (as you often point out) few of us are in a position to give up many of the benefits of industrial civilisation – like our gas-guzzling vehicles and our cheap supermarket shopping, even when we also sometimes try to act a bit more sustainably.<br><br>It’s preferable to simply accept that our behaviour is pretty well determined by evolution. Paul Chefurka suggests, for example in his article http://www.paulchefurka.com/EvPsych_Fukushima.html<br>that we simply act according to our nature – as you point out, we’re the same species that wiped out the megafauna, and we don’t look on these forbears as evil; rather we see them as primitive. <br><br>Nor are we special for recklessly using available resources and energy – many animals do (see for instance http://peakoilbarrel.com/natural-resources-human-destiny/<br><br>I think it’s better, given the above, to think of ourselves as intentionally evolved by Gaia to release carbon for future evolution. The earth was getting a bit short of it, I understand –too much was fossilised and locked up- before we came along and mined it. Gaia will obviously be thinking in long-term geological time, whereas we naturally think in the short-term and look to our immediate advantage (after all, we only get the chance of a lifetime). <br><br>We’re clearly intended to be a bright, short-lived species: meteoric.

It means a great deal to me, because this blog has taught me a great deal about how to adjust one's own perceptions, and of course the Bunker's tale has shocked me quite a lot since I have only recently read it. For that and other reasons, I have taken more interest in DIY stuff recently, and the people who matter to me would be very puzzled to know that an Archdruid is among the influences driving my personal change.<br><br><br> Where I live, in an European nation which focuses a lot on abstract reasonning, one should be careful to judge people both on which label they adopt, and on which course of action they adopt. As an example, yesterday I googled "décroissance Paris" (powerdown Paris) and my 1st surprise was to find right away the local "powerdown" group.<br>http://ocparis.canalblog.com/<br><br>My 2nd surprise was... across the span of an entire year, the blog posts were only dedicated to political meetings, or round tables about ideas... Which left me wondering, shouldn't we scale down our ambitions and focus on the really simple stuff ? When to harvest plants, what to do with our poo-pooh... etc. As one of your readers once put it, "when you stare into the Abyss the Beast gets to you". It would be easy to conclude that the powerdown people here have gazed into the Abyss of our predicament and let the Beast of Politics lead them. It is hard for me to envision how the ideas of Power Down could form a significant legacy if we try to transmit them only through the channels of political discourse. Hopefully they are just too busy gardening to post blog entries (no offense meant).<br>Fortunately they link to this guy's amazing blog, passages of which I would happily translate into English if anyone finds a particular post of interest : https://decroissant.wordpress.com/<br><br>I wish my own culture leant a little bit more towards narratives, like the Anglo-Saxon does. I personnally find wizards' hats, knights, fairies or story examples (including my elders' lives) more inspiring than abstract concepts such as "a sustainable society". But maybe abstract thinking is in itself one of the worthwhile legacies to transmit ? That is quite a puzzle to me.<br><br><a href=#c5151875716610586348 title="comment permalink">8/14/14, 2:57 PM</a><br><br>

And as such I've pursued lifestyle choices that further that agenda – I've decided to not own a car, television and to work at an organic farm. The question I ask myself is “am I making the future world a better place or am I simply not contributing AS MUCH to the ways the future will be hideous?”<br><br>I've been wracked by guilt about pollution and biodiversity degradation for most of my life. As a child of the upper middle class it's always been obvious to me that my consumption and inherited lifestyle are a major part of the problems that haunt me. So, like many, first I rebelled, then I tried the tactic of participating in the system in ways that hurt the biosphere as little as possible while maintaining some comforts.<br><br>A major issue is the system of Empire has it's own momentum. My individual choices do little to alter that momentum. This momentum is so big that it affects the entire world. Many people I know who are sensitive and aware are driven up the wall by this. The momentum is, it seems, unstoppable.<br><br>So few if any of my choices, so far, have been tangibly beneficial to future people of the future biosphere. My choices have been merely “less bad”.<br><br>Of course there is an enormous difference between acknowledging collective actions are beyond any individual's control and throwing up one's hands and resigning from participating meaningfully with the world. That being said I know there is more I can personally do to help make the world a better place if I “get off the couch” more.<br><br>If I may be so bold, I would like to ask you to consider doing a post going into detail on creating refuges for species, And also ask you and any readers who are knowledgeable on the subject to recommend a reading list on how-to refuge/habitat creation material. <br><br>While living in Tennessee I made Mason Orchard Bee homes which worked well I think. Creating environments that help foster biodiversity seems to be absolutely VITAL work and I would personally like to implement way more of them where I can.<br><br><a href=#c3695629228750062634 title="comment permalink">8/14/14, 5:58 PM</a><br><br>

The number of people this far north is actually quite small, and without fossil fuel supplies will become a small fraction of that already small number. There are localized disaster areas, but for the most part, after a cycle of growth and forest fires, will just be some interesting patterns in the earth. It is the 100th anniversary of the first world war, and despite the environmental damage done during that time (tons of explosives per square meter!) there is little that wasn’t deliberately preserved from that time. Yes, a trained scholar can point out the effects, but the average person probably doesn’t see it, and a couple of hundred years from now large portions of the planet will go their own ways totally without us. This isn’t to say that there won’t be effects, but will your local disaster site be that big a deal, say compared to Mt St Helens? One of our local lakes went from being badly overfished, with a single train derailment and a lot of bunker oil, to being a premier catch and release fishery, in less than 10 years. I expect that there will be significant changes to the biosphere, but life in general will happily go on in the decades past peak oil. Humans however will drop in number, and loose much of their abilities to bother other residents of the planet.<br><br><a href=#c3019707864786241820 title="comment permalink">8/14/14, 6:52 PM</a><br><br>

For that reason they may not curse us so heavily as your essay suggests. This is not to say they would not be justified in doing so. The link to their woes and out actions would certainly be more obvious than say the dried up springs of the ancient Greeks caused by the deforestation wrought by their ancestors. In their case, as well as for the Sumerians and other ancient civilizations, the changes took place over generations and so were somewhat harder to detect. <br><br>Where I live on the edge of arable land in south east Ontario, most of the immediately local forests were cut down 200 years ago to make charcoal for a failed iron smelter. There are the odd pockets of forest here and there that gives you a hint of what it must have been like before Europeans arrived. A little oasis of park-like old growth on the wrong side of a lake perhaps. Cross a fence line and suddenly you find yourself in juniper scrub land; a sure sign of depleted soils. How many people actually perceive the severe degradation though when they walk through the woods? Not many I suppose. <br><br>Concerning loss of top soil: 3 tons per year per acre does seem terribly high. If I make a rough guess that one ton of top soil occupies about 2 cubic yards, I obtain a top soil loss of roughly 5 inches per century (4.4 actually but lets round up) or 1 inch every 20 years. If we are to lose all North American topsoil by 2075 (with of course regional variation), this suggests we have already lost half the normal full top 6 inch productive layer and so have about 3 inches left on average. This suggests a remarkable degradation of existing arable land that must be affecting yields. Again, who really perceives this degradation now. Who will in the future? Of course they will notice the results; but who will remember how it used to be? <br><br>The same goes for the oceans. Fishermen from Europe started traveling across the Atlantic to the Grand Banks at least 500 years ago. Why make the trip unless your local stocks are already degraded? Frontier fisheries masked this continuing degradation. Locally for me, most lakes are fished out unless stocked every year. There are hints of the fecundity that once existed everywhere in the few isolated lakes that are harder to get to. There the abundance is breathtaking. Such places are kept secret. But do I blame those who went before me? Did the Basque fishermen blame their ancestors for overfishing their local waters? <br><br>We have lived in a vastly degraded and degrading environment for some time (centuries), yet few of use really noticed it until recently (say the last 40 years). Yes the scale and rate have increased enormously, again in the last 40 years, to allow both to be noticed. How will future generations think of us? I don't think they will give us much thought any more than we curse those who fished out Europe, or those who deforested Spain or England, or those who killed off all the North American Bison, or those who killed off the Mammoths and Mastodons. They will just be too busy trying to deal with the fact of a degraded environment and the limits this imposes on their lives … just like us only worse. <br><br>It really is different this time though; there is now no new frontier. As you wrote, this is what human being have been doing for a long time. I'm not saying better decisions could have been made. Nuclear power … I mean really, what a bad idea! But no matter what, I think the grand sweep of the industrial civilization would have been much the same no matter what. As you suggested, there is a trajectory to every type of technology and it will find its mark with certainty. We and future generations might as well blame that first human ancestor who left the trees. Or maybe its these damned opposable thumbs.<br><br>Thank you for another great essay.<br><br><a href=#c367808375275476037 title="comment permalink">8/14/14, 7:16 PM</a><br><br>

And I wouldn't be at all surprised if today's folk songs - Shenandoah, Hey Ho Nobody's Home, Streets of Laredo, Greensleeves - keep right on going, passed along as they've been for centuries.<br><br>By the way, I'm not too worried about sea turtles. You mention isolated refugia - they have a big one in the Hawaiian Islands. Sea turtles are part of why the islands are attractive to tourists, and thus are important to the economy. So they're carefully protected. I can't find any indication that their population is currently declining, either; it's actually increased over the last 25 years, since legal protections were put in place. I went there five or eight years ago; at that time, you couldn't hardly go snorkeling without bumping into a sea turtle - sometimes literally. <br><br>It's possible that, as tourism drops off with the increasing cost of fossil fuels and thus travel, turtles will lose their protected status, and people will probably start hunting them for food again. However, the same high cost of fuel that drives tourism to extinction will also make it hard to get to the remote islands where they build their nests.<br><br>(Sea turtle info here: http://www.fpir.noaa.gov/PRD/prd_green_sea_turtle.html)<br><br>Despite the overall positive tone of this overly-long post, I'm not completely sanguine about the future. I know for a fact that the world will be less kind to me in the future than it has been in the past, and that I'll probably never enjoy my parents' standard of living. Most of my peers seem to have a similar outlook - I think a lot of today's college students have pretty much accepted that our civilization is on the downslope. Maybe my sample is biased because I talk mostly to music people. We've known that our civilization was losing its vitality since the 1920's or so, when "classical" and "popular" music became two separate things...<br><br><a href=#c3338089490447631396 title="comment permalink">8/14/14, 9:44 PM</a><br><br>

This aquifer is already beginning to deplete to the point where farmers have to bring in water from long distances - see series of depressing articles here: http://hppr.org/term/ogallala-aquifer The powers-that-be in Kansas, spurred on by the Orwellian-named Kansas Department of Health and Environment, have approved permits for a new giant coal-burning power plant at Holcomb, Kansas (scene of the Clutter murders in In Cold Blood in 1965). The unlined ash pit will be placed on permeable dune sand, which will allow chemicals in the fly ash from the plant such as mercury, cadmium, and arsenic, along with other nasty stuff, to leach down into the Ogallala Aquifer directly below. This plant is slated to have a lifetime of 20 years, until 2034, at which time the ash pit will hold 17 million tons of fly ash - see http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2007/coal-power-plant-waste-plan-opposed-in-kansas and http://www.cleanenergy.org/wp-conten/uploads/Earthjustice-et.-al.-CCR-comments-11-30-10.pdf - and then the recharge of the aquifer will be accompanied by the toxic chemicals mentioned above, just so that a failing utility company can sell the power to the Front Range cities of Colorado for the next 20 years. So far as I know, we’ve only had one dust storm this year - three days’ worth, and then we’ve had a fair amount of rain since, so no more of those, so far: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-05-29/dust-bowl-conditions-have-returned-kansas-oklahoma-and-north-texas That’s all topsoil blowing away, by the way.

My understanding is that Aboriginals rarely burnt more than 20ha to 30ha at a time and it was a great source of shame to have a fire escape control. As we are lazy land managers, we don’t allocate the resources to achieve that so happily set fire to thousands of hectares at a time. The great wildfires are unprecedented and a direct result of our poor land management. On the other hand, the Aboriginals most certainly did eat all of the megafauna on arrival on the continent. The bones and fossil records stop for the megafauna at the time of their arrival on the continent. There are some interesting caves at <a href=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/naracoorte/Home rel=nofollow>Naracoorte Caves</a> in SA where the animals fell into, died and were preserved, and it is best fossil records on the continent. Well worth the visit.<br><br>Yeah, if you're getting the eagles and the other birds then there is plenty to eat at your farm. Good stuff. I always joke (well, maybe) that the wallaby here is compost fed!<br><br>Nice work with the trees. I hope you are getting some of that rain this weekend? It is meant to hit here Saturday night. Yeah, perry is not as good as apple cider is it? Perhaps a bit of sugar, citrus or apple might help. Even ginger would go a long way to making the stuff palatable...<br><br>That is one painful story. You do what you can though. I bring in composted woody mulch and compost here and it comes from green waste collections in Melbourne. I'd be pretty certain that it contains the full gamut of pesticides and herbicides too given where it originated. It always takes about 2 years before plants really start growing well in it. What do you do? There are no alternatives for broad acre or quantity application. I'd probably try to get some fungal spores out there into those paddocks of yours as all of the fungi here eventually breaks down the woody mulch into a rich black loam. I’ve always assumed that process deals with some of the chemicals too. Out of interest, how thickly did you disperse the seed? You could always cut it back for green manure before it sets flower.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c6660129095262997765 title="comment permalink">8/15/14, 2:20 AM</a><br><br>

The organisms that are probably most sensitive to ocean acidification are the pteropods, they are swimming "snails" (i.e. multicellular animals) of 0.1-1 mm that make shells of aragonite, which is more soluble than calcite, which is what coccolithophores and foraminifers make.<br><br><a href=#c5004716489100829230 title="comment permalink">8/15/14, 4:25 AM</a><br><br>

It has been a huge source of despair to watch it all unfold, never being able/willing to unplug myself from that lifestyle, and resorting to a self-punishing kind of hair-shirt environmentalism. As far as how our descendants view us, I already have an inkling of that in the way I despise my parents' generation. In my case, I'm sure a good deal of that is projection.

Kelley</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Onething, I recently had a very similar experience - and a very similar reaction. You're not alone, and your reaction is a very promising sign... Last month, I discovered the most beautiful patch of the most delicious wild strawberries I've ever tasted, in a vacant lot on my street where I sometimes walk my dogs. I found them about a week before full ripeness, eagerly awaited their arrival, and made two fantastic wild-foraged-and-garden-grown dinner salads with them. (Much of the wild-foraged part came from that same vacant lot, for that matter, an unremarkable gravelly bit of land about 20' by 40'. There was purslane, wild raspberries, the strawberries, lamb's quarters, henbit, and several others.) A few days later, the lot's owner, a local museum, had someone bush hog the whole thing. I was devastated, and genuinely beffled that anyone could miss such an abundance of such an array of fairly familiar foods, and more than that - DESTROY it! By burning gasoline! For looks, of all the pigheaded nonsense!<br><br>I am taking my strong emotional reaction as an extremely positive sign, that my internal narrative is truly re-aligning away from business as usual (or some greenwashed simulacrum thereof). Emotions spur action, and action is what we need. The more people react emotionally with disgust at the actions and methods of BAU, the more likely alternatives are to be tried, and on a larger than individual scale (town, neighborhood, etc.) Passion is necessary, now more than ever. My emotions spurred me to mention something to a director-member of the museum who comes into my cafe, and I now have pretty well permission to dig up &amp; propagate those wild strawberries in a safer-for-them location (which I had sort of planned to do anyway, but...nice to know it's OK) once they recover from their ordeal.<br><br><a href=#c5460974389381374129 title="comment permalink">8/15/14, 1:53 PM</a><br><br>

There were many large turtles there in the 1990’s, but also a human population which was growing at a very large rate relative to resources due to ignorance and the influence of Christian missionaries (more kids for Jesus). So the mature turtles (and lots of fish) were being killed for food with no thought for the future. At the time, there was a marine scientist living on his yacht in the islands who convinced the Tongan government to set aside a marine reserve for turtles. In spite of an education program about the reason for and value of the reserve, the locals poached the turtles to such an extent that the Government had to station a patrol boat on the reserve to enforce the rules.<br>So yes, when human populations get out of sync with available resources, the ethic of protecting the environment takes second place to short-term survival.<br><br><a href=#c5310091627859829955 title="comment permalink">8/15/14, 2:45 PM</a><br><br>

While I would agree that the increase in use and exposure to a variety of chemicals and toxins is somewhat to blame for the increase in rates of cancer, this is far from the whole story. <br><br>Two major public health revolutions changed the entire landscape of what diseases are responsible for the majority of human deaths in industrial society. One was the sanitation movement which involved massive public works and engineering prior to the turn of the 20th century. The other is the development of vaccines which (for the time being) have virtually eradicated some diseases and viral infections. Between immunization and sanitation, the vast majority of causes of premature deaths were removed from consideration.<br><br>One of the reasons that cancer is in the forefront of human illness is simply because life expectancy has increased so much. Now, the major causes of premature death are heart disease and cancer. Diabetes is catching up. Heart disease and diabetes are the consequences of "modern" city planning and the engineering of physical activity out of every day life. That is a major legacy of the post-war era and the car culture which itself feeds off of fossil fuels.<br><br>Again, while I agree that chemicals and toxins are a component of certain forms of cancer, I think you either overstate the case here, or have not fully explored the issue in order to stay on point.<br><br><a href=#c8531887383891027181 title="comment permalink">8/15/14, 3:47 PM</a><br><br>

Instead of coming up with justifications for the collective behavior that guarantees your privilege, I'd encourage you to face that reality, make it part of your consciousness, decide what you're going to do in response to it, and do it. You say you could handle a monastic lifestyle; why not do that, instead of just talking about it? <br><br>Stream, if I'm right, a century from now the Ogalalla aquifer will be bone dry and Kansas will be as dry and barren as the Gobi Desert.

All we can do, it seems to me, is find something we can do to make the future at least a little better than it will otherwise be, and make that happen. <br><br>Matthew, not so. The decline in infectious diseases happened in the early and middle 20th century, and was essentially complete by 1950; the rise in cancer rates happened after that, and is still continuing, even as death rates from infectious diseases are beginning to rise again. Even more telling is childhood cancer; the rate at which children die of cancer isn't affected by other causes of death -- if cancer rates had been constant, the same fraction of living children in 1914 would have had leukemia, or what have you, as have it today -- and, as I noted in my post, cancer in children has gone from a very rare thing to an agonizingly common one.

I really think that the idea that we need to eradicate these plants, is outdated, and think integration and utilisation make far more sensible options. But spending time close to the land, I feel like for the First Peoples of this land, this is the dark age. <br><br>Even though I see ducks and other birdlife and was lucky enough to spot two dolphins moving up stream even in the brackish water of the section of river we were at, the abundance that supported the Noongar people is gone. The river is artificially oxygenated in parts to deal with algae feeding off the fertilisers that flow into the river from gardens and farms alike. The fish stocks have diminished greatly; flocks of birds that once carpeted the skies are reduced to dribs and drabs; plants that once could be killed for food and animals that once fed the locals and then became commonplace in the early markets of the colony are now so rare that to eat them is criminal. that is if they aren't extinct. Even fresh water springs are less frequent due to bores and the evil moves made in past times to fill them with concrete to prevent the gathering of "natives". People come from all over the world to marvel at "Australia's" natural beauty, but in so many ways, paradise is lost.<br><br>On top of all this, despite the valiant efforts of the Noongar to retain their knowledge not just as artifacts, but as a living culture embedded in song, dance and time spent living with the land, much of it is lost for ever. So many of their technologies, including their social structures designed to ensure abundance, are now a shadow of what they were and the people live in a world that so often has more pain than pleasure. Short life expectancies, when on European arrival they outlived the newcomers and were in general much healthier and happier. For their civilisation, this is the dark age that followed.<br><br><a href=#c4642626116463574902 title="comment permalink">8/15/14, 9:06 PM</a><br><br>

But in general -doing it instead of talking about it, giving up all energy-guzzling aspects of civilisation - like the internet and its banks of servers…who is doing that? Some people give up some things - but not everything.<br><br>I’ve made changes. I’ve just harvested 3 boxes of potatoes and over 100 onions. Tomatoes are on the way. I’ve been giving away bags of cucumbers and courgettes (in the UK). But here’s the rub: almost nobody else in my vicinity is doing this. My behaviour here is eccentric. Nobody else is interested -perhaps they realise that in the unpredictable droughts and rainstorms of the future, such eccentric activity will become even harder (and it is already hard!).<br><br>As for slavery, it was an essential means for civilisations of old to grow. We generally think of the Greeks and Romans as being great civilisations. Yet they needed slavery. <br><br>People started to come over all moral when fossil fuels (and the traction engine) allowed human slavery to be abolished (Matt Ridley –“The Rational Optimist”). <br><br>Whatever my personal opinions (and my personal opinion is that slavery is reprehensible), I can have no effect on the way human culture and civilisations unfold. All civilisations greedily seek out energy wherever they can find it. They feed heavily on available resources and produce masses of entropic heat and waste, in accordance with the laws of physics. <br><br>By the way, in Fowler’s 2009 book, "Systemic Management: Sustainable Human Interactions with Ecosystems and the Biosphere", he compares humans to both herbivores and carnivores of similar body size, and concludes that a sustainable human population is only about 7 million. I don’t see us ever stopping at that figure voluntarily (even if we are capable of making decisions of that nature). So, as I said before, I think we’re likely to be a short-lived species.<br><br><a href=#c826160177034052401 title="comment permalink">8/16/14, 4:14 AM</a><br><br>

Perhaps not, but you're still part of a lineage, and there are lots who feel quite differently. I know lots of people who will make sure you have a place right next to Isaac, Nuinn, and others on their ancestor altars someday if they're still alive to do so. I guess what makes it hard to think about that sort of legacy is reflecting on the fact that while our civilization produced much evil, and will leave behind even more... It also gave us Darwin, and Emmerson, and Thoreau, and, and so many other great scientists, philosophers, poets, and novelists (our musicians, painters, photographers and filmmakers will sadly fade, though some of the songs and stories may be passed down orally someday).<br><br>We worked to create a world where people looked beyond race or gender and into hearts.

This rule was initially made to help older folks on lower fixed incomes remain in their homes without starving. This particular crowd is well fed, golfs and takes multiple trips a year. When I asked politely why they were doing it, the best answer they could come up with was a kind of glee at gaming the system..."because we can." It was a curious moment for me where time seemed to lengthen out. I often feel like I am an amateur ant amongst the frolicky grasshoppers. Microcosmic banality of evil! It is not only where is your dinner coming from? but also with whom are you dining? We do seem to be the enemy of long term thinking. <br><br>This embracing of deferral is still all around us, but as your last three posts on the coming dark ages suggest consequences cannot be endlessly deferred. In fact to my mind deferral as an accounting "strategy" manifested as a way of life looks magnitudes worse than bankruptcy.<br><br>I, too, am less worried about our attempts to control (and destroy) nature. My composting efforts this year have had crazy and amazing unintended consequences. Odd volunteer squashes, multitudes of bronze fennel, ladies mantel, pineapple weed, parsley, plum tomatoes, poppies, self-seeded comfrey and chard. I left a lot of it to grow and it has been such a great decision. I will flip the compost more frequently this year....but I am considering a separate compost bin for all seed stalks and a small patch dedicated to growing some of it out each year. <br><br>Thank you for the work that you do.<br><br><a href=#c1277309159238660545 title="comment permalink">8/16/14, 7:44 AM</a><br><br>

There are two main pathways to colon cancer. One requires six mutations, the other seven. Get 5 (or 6) and there may, or may not be, "precancerous cells", depending on the missing mutation.<br><br>Some people inherit one or (rarely) two of the mutations. For them, "cancer runs in the family".<br><br>If the odds of any one mutation are .01, the odds of getting cancer are .01^6 + .01^7 (all mutations assumed to be equally likely in this thought experiment).<br><br>Double the odds of cancer mutations to .02 and the rate of cancer increases by 2^6 for one type (64x) and 2^7 (128x) for the other type.<br><br>There are many ways that we have been increasing the rate of cancer mutations, but one has been treated as just another source of ionizing radiation, Carbon 14.<br><br>Our atmospheric atomic bomb tests spiked C14 in the biosphere<br><br>http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/06/04/the-cosmic-story-of-carbon-14/1000px-radiocarbon_bomb_spike/ <br><br>Unlike other radioactive sources, C14 can be part of the structure of DNA. This provides three potential sources of mutation.<br><br>C14 in or near DNA radiates a beta particle right in the midst of the DNA molecule.

That's not my preference, of course. But it's not my preference more because of the legacy it means we're leaving, rather than any personal offense. It's a fracking shame, the cruelty we're so thoughtlessly inflicting on future (and current) generations, human and otherwise.<br><br>But it doesn't bother me. Future generations will think what they think. It's only my concern insofar as I'm working to live my life well. I'm doing this. And I'm both succeeding and failing, but I do dare think--most of the time, anyway--that I'm succeeding a touch more than failing, at least within the context of our current culture and civilization.<br><br>This is all transitory. I think about my death semi-regularly. It's helpful. I think about how I live on a piece of property at the edge of a river valley, a few miles inland along the north Oregon coast. At some point, the next Cascadia subduction quake will hit and this property I live on will be swept by a tsunami. If it happens in my lifetime, there's an excellent chance I'm dead. If I get through the quake and manage to make it through the following tsunamis and afterquakes (I'm right at the edge of the river valley and could literally run up a hill and out of the tsunami zone within a couple minutes, if I have my wits about me and am not injured) well, then I might very well die in the aftermath, of starvation or disease or infection or . . . there are a number of ways.<br><br>Last Sunday night, I came within a few feet of being t-boned while driving along Highway 26. The driver didn't see me at all--I must assume--and was pulling right into me. Quick reflexes and a tight swerve was the only thing that kept me from a high-speed collision that may well have killed me. Relatedly, a couple years ago, I hit some black ice on the same highway, spun out of control, and swerved into the oncoming lanes of traffic. No traffic coming the other way. A bit of good luck to follow the bad and I, and my passenger, and our truckload of sheep walked away to tell the tale.<br><br>And if I get through all these various, unforeseen threats, I'll just die at some other point in the future, anyway.<br><br>I'm confident enough in my sense of being a good person that I believe most who know me will think well of me once I'm gone. Future generations almost certainly won't know of me. If I become part of a shadowy, past generation of evil, so be it. It's not personal. They didn't actually know me. If they did, maybe they wouldn't feel that way.<br><br>But also, maybe they would. If they knew my life in detail, maybe they would weigh all the good I did and still find it far lacking against all the evil I threw in with as part of this civilization.<br><br>You know what? That would be 100% fair. JMG, I love what you said to Ben: "Instead of coming up with justifications for the collective behavior that guarantees your privilege, I'd encourage you to face that reality, make it part of your consciousness, decide what you're going to do in response to it, and do it." That's exactly what I've spent the last five years doing, and it's what I continue to work on. I have to thank you in part for that--you've been a huge influence on my understanding and walking that path. But the way I see it, I'm far too implicated in the thoughtless, shortsighted, evil actions of our culture to get out of this clean. I believe I've participated in more pain and destruction and blind cruelty than I've given back in life and love, kindness and generosity. I'm working on those scales, but I'm doubtful I'll get them balanced before I go. Not in a viewpoint from outside the confines of this culture, anyway.<br><br><i>(continued . . .)</i><br><br><a href=#c6449450303555311957 title="comment permalink">8/16/14, 1:17 PM</a><br><br>

I can't control it! I won't even know how it shakes out. (Well, I believe in reincarnation well enough to suspect I'll be there in some form or another, but that's something else.) Unless it helps me live better today, worrying about it seems a bit self-indulgent to me. There's too much to do now. I have a large organic garden that needs attention, always. I have so many more things I want to do on this property. I feed people. I feed animals. I feed bees and the local, native pollinators. They're everywhere--I'm astounded and heartened by them. I've barely begun here and already I've managed to create a refuge, a place mostly free of poisons, full of food. I plan to learn more, to better focus my efforts here over the coming years. I've just started.<br><br>I build community. I create connections among the local farmers and gardeners. Serve on the board of a nonprofit working the build the local food system. Am a member of the local grange, one of the few that made it through the 80s without shuttering their doors. I sell food, give away food, try to nourish the people and animals in my life. I still do so much wrong, too, and I fail, and I do less than I could and should, and I succumb to too many desires that do me wrong, that do my community wrong, that do the future wrong. But I try to recognize these failures, accept and acknowledge them, and use them as a driving force to continue to improve.<br><br>I believe without question that I'm a good person. But I still do bad things. I am complicit and, again, I can't get out of this clean. There's no possible way. And so, to continue to do as much good as I can, I have to accept that. It's only in understanding those failures and my own personal cruelties that I have any hope of doing as much good as possible.<br><br>I remember something else you wrote to me in a comment a year or two ago, JMG. You wrote of being able to hold two contradictory truths at the same time in your mind and to make your peace with them. That's not an exact quote, but I think close enough. That's stuck with me. That's some of the best advice, some of the best wisdom, I've ever received. It's incredibly powerful and useful. I'll be working with that truth the rest of my life.<br><br>I can be complicit in evil; be guilty of acts of cruelty; and I can be good and kind. I can be all this, oftentimes at once. And, to be honest, I think the only way I can be my best is to understand all of this, to hold these contradictions together in my mind in their always-tenuous balance. I believe the only way I can do the most good is to understand all the ways I can be terrible <i>and to admit that I am</i>, and then to also understand my good and work always to be more that than the other.<br><br>So let future generations think me evil. They won't be wrong. But they won't be completely right, either. And yet still, it doesn't matter; they have a right to their opinions. I can do nothing about it but be as good as I can be today, and, after everything my actions will be helping put them through, it would be just one more indulgent offense for me to tell them how to think of me. I'll leave future generations to sort out their own thoughts. I have too much to do today, and if I'm to have any impact on those future decisions, it's only going to come through all that necessary work, anyway.<br><br><a href=#c33131980449449361 title="comment permalink">8/16/14, 1:18 PM</a><br><br>

Look at any documentary on african tribes living distinctly pre-industrial lives and even if they have hardly a few grams of corn to eat and the most rudimentary of shelter, they will all conga-shuffle around the fire chanting.<br><br>Your electronica will likely have become inert by then, and as for pianos...<br><br>They could survive quite well I hope, being the possessor of one who likes to indulge in creative musings thereupon. My theory is when all that's left are hide drums and bone flutes the piano will have a curio value which will make many undertake significant journeys to hear such a pre-electronic wonder of the musical past. This will naturally depend on your ability to maintain and tune it, or how stable your climactic conditions are with their effects on the instrument's ability to hold being in tune. If one's playing is sufficiently adept that will help persuade the more ruffian amongst your visitors to abstain from chopping it up for heating.<br><br>Best bet is a more portable instrument that's easier to tune, fiddles, guitars, mandolins, cellos, flutes, percussion, as they can provide much avenue for musicality. Also the ability to lead others in song may well be a highly regarded social skill.<br><br>If you can make people forget their troubles a while and dance, you will probably eat.<br><br>Spreading my eggs, I undertook the serious study of the art of massage, since you did mention Art, though perhaps it's not what you had in mind!<br><br>Taking advantage of cheap travel I studied in Thailand, India, California, Hawaii, Switzerland and Italy and was able to amass a grab bag of techniques to practice these last 20 years.<br><br>In a future age with no cheap and easy to find pharmaceuticals, this art will become prominent again as prohylactic and cure, I have no doubt of that. There is an amazing amount of human pain that can be assuaged through skilled therapeutic touch, indeed it rivals herbalism for its venerable role in healing history. (Another highly useful skill to study, imo).<br>I now study gardening, small-farming, animals and geopolitics with the same passion I once reserved for music and massage.<br><br>In the future scenarios so vividly painted here at the ADR, Music, Massage and compost science are the three legs of the future stool I hope to sit on, secure in my contributions to the tribe's well-being as anyone can fairly expect to be.<br><br>If you can enter light trance while playing or singing that is a bonus as with the new realities transcendence will need all the help it can get, without the plethora of distractions modernity offers as techno-escapism, the ability to rise above suffering through whatever means possible will remain high on the human priority list, right after food and shelter is my bet.<br><br>The coming wave of change is so immense I have no illusions any of this will be any use, but it sure beats paralysis, combining as it does the best of the Platonic, Stoic and Epicurean.<br><br>Oh and last but not least, learning how to cook well could raise your value to the tribe a notch or three... ;)<br><br><a href=#c3867708605356554444 title="comment permalink">8/16/14, 6:20 PM</a><br><br>

Funny things happen when you get some facts together...<br>Finally, on the topic of "civilization diseases", this gentleman has another essay that partly focuses on the topic of new paradigms in biology:<br>http://dfc-economiahistoria.blogspot.com/2013/03/el-cambio-del-paradigma-cientifico.html<br>that shows a very interesting chart:<br>http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZZlKhzgU9f0/UTY-f2HCwKI/AAAAAAAAEBY/fviNbaHXH0s/s1600/Gr%C3%A1ficos+tendencias+inversas+de+enfermedades+infecciosas+y+auto-inmunes.png<br>There you can see a strong inverse correlation between the prevalence of infective vs autoimmune diseases. Indeed, when the human immune system has no external enemy to fight against, it tends to "go rogue" and attack the host. Who could have thought about this???<br><br>And last but not least and actually a bit late: Mr Greer, what do you think about inferring future climate trends from the Eemian interglacial warm optimum? AFAIK, there was also a huge temperature spike around 130.000 years ago with the highest temperatures around 2-3°C higher than today.

It is good stuff, I should know as it is what I get after dumping many cubic metres (cubic yards) of organic matter over the clay here for many years. If what you are seeing is brown (not dark brown, but about mid brown) or an orange/brown then you should be very worried indeed. What you perhaps are looking at is clay. You can grow stuff in it, but I recommend experimenting to see what grows in it without the application of NPK. Give it a go, I dare you.<br><br>Hi Cathy,<br><br>This week has seen many references to your slugs. You are definitely short on Kookaburra's which have an enormous beak and would only be too happy to assist with any slug problem. All of the birds here clean up pests. You should have seen how happy they were the day the locust plague hit here!<br><br>In a funny parallel to your slugs except that it is Down Under: the Portuguese millipede entered the country in the 1950's into - I believe - the Port of Adelaide in South Australia. From there, they have worked across the continent to this location almost 60+ years later. No small feat for something that is only 5cm (about 1/5th of an inch). Here, they hide under logs, happily converting that organic matter into a nice black moist soil. However, it has only been in relatively recent times that a native nematode adapted to feast upon the Portuguese millipede thus taking revenge on the little imported critters. Now they are simply a part of the balance in the local ecosystem.<br><br>There is a lesson in there for humans, should we care to hear it.<br><br>PS: Collect the slugs in a bucket, drown them. Leave for a week until it smells foul. Use it as a plant tonic (watering it down first. Ratio 10:1). They eat plants, therefore they are plant food.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c2887691844241918788 title="comment permalink">8/17/14, 3:56 AM</a><br><br>

There is historical precedent for both views, I suppose, but in the west our two recent dark ages (eastern Mediterranean, c 1200BC-600BC and the medieval, c 450AD-1050AD) saw complex views of their past, but nevertheless saw a prior golden age. Yes, Christendom saw terrific evil in ancient Rome, but starting with Charlemagne (or earlier, maybe Odoacer!) all attempts were actually to re-create Rome in facsimile. A man named "Caesar" continuously ruled one European domain or another from ~49BC (crossing of the Rubicon) until 1918 (deposition of the Kaiser).<br><br>It's obviously speculation, but I think it's possible that the environmental destruction that we clearly see we are responsible for, our progeny might not see so clearly. Possibly they'll see chaotic climate as normal, or more likely they'll think the gods created it as punishment for our pride, to lay us low (and so, children, behave! do what's right! and the wrathful gods may pass you over). People in the future may hate our evil, but may worship our power, as Christian Europe worshiped Roman power while nominally hating the mores than nurtured it. Especially if nature becomes a more destructive force, it is possible they may think our great mistake was not wrecking the environment, but loosing control of it.<br><br>As I said this is speculation, but this *kind* of view has clear historical precedent.<br><br>Now I think TADR is the most intelligent, clear-minded discussion of our post-industrial future we have, and I have tremendous admiration for Mr. Greer's amazing scholarship and wisdom. But I have some disagreements, and my big one is his views on the new religious sensibility he senses. Frankly I think a feeling that nature is home is easy for people living a time where nature has been made safe, and hard when your children risk being eaten by stalk-and-ambush predators, and there's nothing you can do about the abscessed tooth in your mouth. In the future, they may actually admire our control of the forces they have no control over.<br><br>(Yes, I know the common view here is that they'll hate us because we unleashed those forces---my contrary view is that they, like everyone else, will see the world around them simply as a given.

I've just finished reading "A Message from Martha" by Mark Avery about the extinction of possibly the most abundant bird that ever lived. The Passenger Pigeon, a former signature species of the eastern north american deciduous forests. The book catalogues much of what is known about the bird and why it disappeared. The last one died in Cincinatti zoo 100 years ago on 1 September. The main reason for its disappearance was the clearance by european invaders of the forests and the oak, beech and chestnut mast it relied on. The author visited the Ohio/Wisconsin?Michingan area last year and was interested to find there is very little local memory of the bird or what it represented.<br><br>The point is people get on with living the best way they can and once something passes out of living memory, popular culture frequently forgets the detail.

No. I'm sure the next offshore breeze after I left brought a new batch as it always did.<br><br>It seemed to do the community good, though. And just maybe, helped the fish fry that teemed in the marsh land there.<br><br>I can't restore the Grand Banks but I could help protect those fish fry. When the slick from an oil spill came near, my wife and I got snare boom placed across the marsh inlet. It took 36 straight hours of frantic telephoning, research, visiting government offices and environmental organizations, and attending meetings to get that done. It turned out that none of the officials had known where the inlet was. Being recognized as "the guy who always collects trash there" gave me just enough standing to tell them.

It couldn't pay for itself as a casino, which basically means it can't pay for itself by any known means. The future of the lavish six-million-square-foot glass edifice, between its short term destiny as a tax write-off and its long-term one as a navigation hazard, is a mystery. What else are 1,400 bedrooms in a 57-story tower above acres of open floors good for? I can almost imagine an extremely large monastic community for whom walking up and down stairs is part of their daily devotions, but that's unrealistic fantasy. Perhaps slightly more realistic is the prospect of diminishing long-distance travel opportunities at some point making Atlantic City again a viable short-distance resort for residents of Philadelphia and New York. But even if those tourists arrive before the ocean does, the economics of that scenario won't support glass skyscrapers.<br><br>This reminds me of two things. One, the obvious, is these famous lines from The Tempest, which make me wonder if the namers of the complex were already aware, on some level, of the "baseless fabric" upon which it was built:<br><br><i>Our revels now are ended. These our actors,<br>As I foretold you, were all spirits and<br>Are melted into air, into thin air:<br>And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,<br>The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,<br>The solemn temples.., shall dissolve<br>And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,<br>Leave not a rack behind.</i><br><br>The second is, being a lifelong board game hobbyist, any matter involving hotels and boardwalks and Atlantic City is bound to remind me of the modern classic Monopoly. The narratives embedded in that game have been frequently criticized (e.g. by Marxists) but that criticism has barely scratched the surface. Besides Monopoly, there are thousands of other building-up games with similar narratives: Civilization, every Catan variant, every 18XX railroad game, etc.<br><br>I can't think of any games where you start with hotels (or cities, castles, etc.) and unbuild your way down to houses and then nothing. (War games like chess are closer to that, but not really comparable.)<br><br>If the ruinmen dig up my game closet someday, they'll no doubt find most of those games unsettling at best. So, I've started on an unbuilding board game for my next homebrew, though I suspect most people today will find it unsettling at best.<br><br><a href=#c739288411608913548 title="comment permalink">8/17/14, 10:18 AM</a><br><br>

How can you not find solace in the fact that people centuries or milennia ago had problems and limitations so similar to our own?<br><br>If I may quote Epictetus:<br><br>"You have received the philosophic principles with which you ought to be conversant; and you have been conversant with them. For what other master, then, do you wait as an excuse for this delay in self-reformation? You are no longer a boy but a grown man. If, therefore, you will be negligent and slothful, and always add procrastination to procrastination, purpose to purpose, and fix day after day in which you will attend to yourself, you will insensibly continue to accomplish nothing and, living and dying, remain of vulgar mind."<br><br>Change is hard. Looking at yourself and realising that most of our insatisfactions are rooted in our own decisions, conscious or not, is hard. We procrastinate, yes. We find reasons not do do something we said we would, yes. Finding this on the writings of a Roman philosopher is a blessing to me, seeing my difficulties as those of so many of us, even those long gone, gives me courage. They felt and did much the same, and many good things were done. Maybe I'll be able to do some of them, and leave something of value to my daughter and beyond.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br><a href=#c4686622233544324189 title="comment permalink">8/17/14, 3:50 PM</a><br><br>

It might be a good idea for those with health problems to simply start researching alternatives they can test on themselves; then, even if they can't stop the inevitable, they can pass on what might work and steer other, younger, healthier people away from dead ends.

If you deleted it for a reason; its your forum, you can do as you like. If it just unintentionally vanished into the land of unpaired socks, perhaps you will allow this through. If it later appears as a duplicate post. Sorry. I think this is the better version. Feel free to delete the first one.<br><br>Ben and JMG<br><br>I recall making a comment some time ago along the lines of human nature being responsible for each civilization tending to trash its habitat. JMG, your response to me was much the same as your response to Ben. I understand your concern that such thinking can be used as an excuse for inaction. This has not been the case in my life and Ben's subsequent comments suggests it has not been in his (harvesting potatoes and onions etc.). Nonetheless the concern is legitimate.<br><br>I think an exact analogy is found in statistics. We can have a great deal of certainty about how large numbers of thing will behave. We can often say that some types of behaviour are deterministic at the level of very large numbers. At the same time we can often not be able to say anything of certainty about how each specific thing in that group will behave. Say the USA lowers its speed limit by 5 mph. We can know just how many thousands of lives will be saved each year. Yet we can say absolutely nothing about how this might affect the life of a particular resident of the USA.<br><br>Similarly, we can say with some certainty how the next few decades and centuries will unfold for industrial civilization and for the environment. Our certainty about the grand sweep of how our civilization and environment will decline comes from a variety of types of analysis: morphological, systems, thermodynamic, biological, etc. They all tell much the same story. At the same time we cannot say with very much certainty how this unfolding will affect specific human lives at specific places. The smaller our sample, the less the certainty. The larger the sample, the greater the certainty.<br><br>To recognize that the trajectory of civilization as a whole is largely predetermined could be conceived as an excuse to do nothing. Hence your words of caution, JMG, in this regard. I suspect invoking human nature, thermodynamics, or anything else only deepens your suspicion/concern. <br><br>If someone (not me, nor you Ben, nor you JMG), were to use this as an excuse for personal inaction, they would be making a category error. More specifically, it would be an error in terms of levels of reality. What applies to large groups does not apply to the individual or small group.<br><br>Still, the individual does not have full freedom. The trajectory of our civilization and environment places very real bounds on our freedom to act and respond to our individual situations. Nonetheless, within those bounds, there is some freedom for individuals and small groups. There is very little freedom at the highest level of grouping because of the momentum of actions made generations ago. The effects of these actions must play themselves out. <br><br>Far from being an excuse for inaction, knowing the trajectory of our society and its environment provides incentive to act to mitigate the negative effects, at least for yourself and those you know and love. If you are attentive to the distant roar of rapids, you can move across the current (not against it) to avoid them even if statistically most people won't. Still, declaring that the trajectory is largely determined can be dangerous because confusing levels of reality is an easy mistake to make. Again, your caution, JMG, is well founded. <br><br>Though this is a subtle point, and a dangerous one, I think it is one worth exploring.<br><br><a href=#c6069834422326908474 title="comment permalink">8/17/14, 8:32 PM</a><br><br>

Even if asked partly in pointed jest.<br><br>Here at the homestead, I mostly work my garden by hand. <i>However</i>, I did utilize a Kubota tractor with a rototiller attachment to break ground for the garden plot. The tractor is owned by the farming couple I work for and from whom I'm renting my homestead. I borrowed it for an afternoon to till up a big chunk of the clay-ridden pony pasture within which I wanted to put my large garden plot.<br><br>I actually don't much care for tractors. I'm not a fan of engines in general. They lack elegance. But I will not deny the convenience of a tractor and a couple gallons of diesel. Up to that point, I had hand dug a couple small beds to get in some of my onion starts and . . . well, it's a long process when you're starting from sod. I'd done it in the past, so I knew what I was getting into. Still, I couldn't help but eye the hundreds of onion starts I had and panic a bit.<br><br>So when the tractor came available, I took advantage of it. I broke through the sod. After that, I went back to hand tools: I lined out each bed with bailing twine from next door and some old wooden stakes I found in the barn on the property, dug each bed with my digging fork, and worked in a complete organic fertilizer mix with my three tooth cultivator. I did compromise a bit with the tractor, but I feel okay about it. I'm now swimming in veggies--quite a bit more, I'm certain, than if I hadn't burned a gallon or two of diesel. And now I'm cooking a dinner of broccoli, romanesco, onion, carrot, squash, kale and chard (all out of the garden) along with some smoked salmon (traded for at the market with veggies and homemade yogurt) over quinoa (bought at the store--but I do currently have five foot tall quinoa plants out in the garden that I'm hoping to get grain from!) All in all, I suspect the gallon or two of diesel I burnt has ultimately led to yet more diesel unburnt.<br><br>Now, at work I do use a tractor regularly, though not constantly. It's part of the farm set up, and is what it is. When I have the opportunity to opt for hand labor over mechanical, I do. And the couple I work for, fantastic as they are, support that. In fact, it was Lance who pulled down an old scythe of his grandfater's, sharpened it up, and sent me out into the field to mow the fencelines with it instead of a weed whacker. This was after I had mentioned a couple times my draw toward the idea of using a scythe and my love of the passage in <i>Anna Karenina</i> of Lenin using a scythe to cut grain alongside the muzhiks on his farm.<br><br>As for the car, that's my greatest current failure. I drive my own car anywhere from 400 to 700 miles a month. (I also drive to markets for my other farm job, but that, too, is what it is.) I've certainly considered giving up my car. With my current situation, living in a rural area, the biggest impediment would be the resultant twice-a-week, 24 mile round trip bike ride along a curvy rural highway largely lacking in shoulders and traversed by logging trucks. It doesn't appeal to me. I could conceivably do it, though.<br><br>For the time being, I keep my car and work on cutting back on my driving. But, yes, this is a failure. It's interesting, though--my current car is a major capital investment. If something happens to it, I would have some tough decisions to make. I live relatively poor. I have managed to sock away a bit of money over the last couple years after having paid off all my debt. It's enough to buy a used car if I had to. But I would <i>despise</i> spending it on that when I could be spending it on hand tools, seed, a drip irrigation system, fencing to keep deer out of the garden, a solar oven, a solar batch water heater, or a number of other useful things. So, faced with that decision, what would I do? I honestly don't know. But it's a decision I'll face at some point, and my choice will speak to my true values, won't it?<br><br><a href=#c3357269769117666683 title="comment permalink">8/17/14, 8:44 PM</a><br><br>

I'm hoping and planning to do more.<br><br>My new homestead is ringed by blackberry thickets. I don't spray them, obviously. I just pick the berries from them. One of my roommates has stashed about seven gallons in the chest freezer.<br><br>Spraying blackberries not only is a sin, it's stupid. As you note, they'll just come back. But also, it's really not that hard to hack them down with a machete.<br><br>I've done this multiple times on both of the farms I work for. A sharp machete will cut through blackberry vines with little trouble. And once you clear the outer green vines, you get into what is usually the underlying thicket of previous years' dead and brown vines. Those are even easier to clear away as they tend to snap and shatter to pieces. It honestly doesn't even take all that long if you really go at it.<br><br>Now, I have yet to meet a soul who can go at a thicket of blackberries with a machete and come out the other side without a number of scratches, but that's just part of the experience. Those bloody scratches are a nice reminder of a task well-accomplished.<br><br>Lastly, I had an experience the other day I think you might enjoy hearing about. I was in the garden with some of the chickens milling about, hunting for snacks in the grass. I broke off a few large romanesco leaves and threw them to the chickens--they love those things. Then I turned my attention back to the garden only to, a moment later, here a distressed squeaking. Turning back to the chickens, I saw one running off with a writhing field mouse clutched firm in beak! It proceeded to peck at it until dead and then spent the next hour or so slowly pecking and eating away at it, running it off to a new secluded area whenever one of the other chickens came too near.<br><br>It was the first time I had seen that happen. After the initial surprise, my first thought was your many stories about how your chooks love eating field mice. I felt a bit sorry for the mouse, but I was also quite happy to see the pest control and aggressive foraging.

In the sense that we are all members of that civilization, we are all responsible. And in the sense that some of us draw down way more than others, some are more responsible than others. That said, the broad outlines of our lives, and how our individual lives would affect our environment and civilization were determined long before any of us were born. All you can really be held account for is how you act within the very narrow limits already determined for you. <br><br>People make comments suggesting that they “should” do something (more). “Should” suggests you have options. Its indicates an error in perception of reality. “I really should give up smoking but I love it too much.” No, you must give up smoking because you love life and all those who are in yours more. You don't want to hurt them so you don't hurt yourself. You aren't separate from them. They are you. So it is with all other moral acts. You don't do harm because you don't want to harm yourself. Self preservation - particularly the larger self (meaning lives you can actually affect) – is a far more effective basis for action. This sort of self interest is love. <br><br>Of course it is not really that easy. All life involves taking life. All creation involves destruction. What do you kill so you can live? What do you destroy so you can create a comfortable life? But you have a right to be here. And you have no choice but to participate in the civilization you are in. So you do what you can; being careful to avoid extremes either way. No matter what you do, you will not save the planet, nor can you do it any great harm. The earth will be here long after humans are gone. So just take care of yourself. Act in your self interest, that is to say the real self that includes everything about you that you really can affect. <br><br>Sorry for the sermon. I just hate to see people give themselves a hard time for things way out of their control. So remember kids, Peace, Love, and little blue elves!

I'm a few miles outside of Nehalem, along Highway 53. Consider it an open invitation. If you get serious about the idea, drop me an email at joel@ofthehands.com and we'll work out details.<br><br>I don't know that what I'm doing here is that incredible, though. Mostly, you'll find an old farmhouse and barn, a chicken coop and a flock of 19 birds, a giant garden in the side field, some laundry hang drying outside (if it's sunny) or inside by the wood stove (if it's cold and rainy.) A lot of home canned goods, some ferments, kombucha, homemade yogurt. Lots of books. A beautiful view of Onion Peak and the surrounding hills. Forested land across the road. Pasture and beef cattle next door. The North Fork of the Nehalem off in the distance. But it's sure nice, and I don't mind company. There are other small farms scattered around, too. I could take you up the road and show you the off-grid farm and homestead I originally came out here to work on. That's a pretty neat place. And the ocean's not far.<br><br>As for the Green Wizards site, yes! I haven't been writing on <a href=http://www.ofthehands.com/ rel=nofollow>my blog</a> of late--partly due to the so many things fighting for my attention, partly due to lack of inspiration--and I've had this background intention of moving some of that writing energy to the Green Wizards site. I would love to engage the community there and join in the conversation. I'm going to make that a priority. I don't know if it will happen in the quite immediate future, but fall's just around the corner and I'll have a heck of a lot more time before too long. Right now, the two farm jobs and garden and homestead of my own are keeping me hopping.<br><br>But soon, yes. I'm committing right here, right now. You can hold me to it. :)<br><br><a href=#c2382259289257966309 title="comment permalink">8/17/14, 9:36 PM</a><br><br>

Reference my poem that JMG graciously allowed me to post a blog entry or two back called 'Ancient Order' Neither does a young friend we used to ride with over on the coast. Its a temperate rainforest there, with underbrush so thick you can get lost within a few yards of paved roads. She knows you never ride alone and you better respect and be wary of the wild animals you can encounter there such as the bear, mountain lions and the occasionally super crabby Wapiti bull, (giant deer, also known in the USA as elk). It might be hard to believe something that big could move through that underbrush but small herds of them do all the time. Its even smart to be wary of coyote packs as my young friend and a companion found out trail riding when they were followed by a pack at dusk on a back road over a mountain. It seems some of the local yahoos, excuse me, hunters, were dumping the offal from their kills in the area. Charley said she was seeing a lot of glowing eyes in the gathering dark and they weren't deterred by a few rocks thrown their way! And then there was the time when Charley and a cousin were cutting cross country to a road on foot when the smell of blood hit her in the nose as she broke through a screen of brush to find a just killed deer in a gore splashed clearing. The scene screamed mountain lion kill and they backed out of there as quickly as they could, swung wider to find the road and beat feet down the middle of the road. Charley said she could feel that cat following, watching them until they made the junction!<br><br>A city slicker or a totally naive sort might think nature is warm and cuddly every day. It is, it just depends on who she cuddles that day over who she ignores at the moment. You darn betcha I'm prey! I know it and if I were riding in an area with a lot of predators now I'd be packing my holstered little thirty eight, more to make noise then to be foolish enough to try to kill something with it!

Natives never regarded living in/with nature as "hard" (and very few modern people currently regard nature as "safe") and natives didn't have problems with their children being eaten. They understood the environment and know how to live within it. They also did not have a lot of tooth problems, due to the lack of grains and sugar in their diets, and they had an amazing variety of natural remedies.

Quite an interesting quiz you've built. I haven't scored myself. I'm not sure I'll make the grade. Sometimes its best not to know!<br><br>I couldn't help noticing your psychological analysis of our indulgent host elsewhere on your site. Though it could not be said to be an overwhelmingly positive perspective, it is nonetheless flattering to him that you have devoted so much space to profile him. No publicity is bad publicity you know. <br><br>Your critique brings to mind an occasion when two of my relatives (a couple) send me a well crafted blast of wrath by email complete with a very well drawn caricature of myself. I had to admit it was brilliant satire/parody. It was also not a little savage. I couldn't help but feel flattered that I was so much in their thoughts; even if those thoughts were not entirely charitable. We get along fine now … though we don't visit much … possibly a major reason for our positive relationship.<br><br>Your efforts also bring to mind a critique of a critique of a certain giggling guru. The second author suggested the first author had to ask himself why it was, if he was still being bitten by fleas, that he was sleeping with the dog he was sleeping with. <br><br>I note that JMG has taken the time to respond to your, as well other people's, comments posted here. I think this is very generous of him even if he is acerbic from time to time. All of us are flawed. A good response to a self reflective acknowledgment of this fact is to extend a patient generosity to others. Specifically, you might choose to do so by removing your critique. Any such analysis usually says more about the author than t does about the object of analysis. Of course, you can do as you like. You've done no real harm. Its all good. <br><br>Finally, if you can tolerate even more unsolicited advice, it is good to remember that the ability to laugh at oneself is the foundation of a lifelong comedy.

Gotta something duality, I tell you.<br><br>Maybe you can make a nuclear power generator that's sufficiently safe and on the time scales that matter, but I agree with you - doing so makes it highly uneconomical.<br><br>If you have to ask me how the future would look, look to the Amish. Did you know that their population is actually growing? They're actually actively splitting off and making new settlements. They do it fairly quietly and keep to themselves, so unless you look it up on Wikipedia, you're not likely to know about it :P<br><br>If there's a group of people least likely to starve if most technology goes away, it'll be them.

As I started to learn non-electronic musical practices, I went to the piano as it was most easily accessible to me, but before I wrote my original comment I did consider that the piano, also being a relatively complex technology, will lose favour to more portable and easier to build instruments. Compost science, by the way, is something I’m also interested in and have dabbled with in my garden (gardening will be one of the legs of my own future stool).<br><br>@Nuku - That’s encouraging to read, it must be fantastic to know how to build musical instruments, especially something as complex as a harpsichord. I had a quick look for portable keyboard instruments, something like a clavichord also seems less complex than a modern piano.<br><br>@Cathy McGuire - thanks for the link to the Pipe Guy!

The hype is still going here in the UK, with examples such as this http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/fracking-uk-sustainable-energy-market although admittedly this was from a few months ago. I have some concerns that companies and investors will buy into fracking in the UK as having supposed potential to produce lots of gas &amp; make lots of money whilst improving our energy security https://uk.news.yahoo.com/fracking-boom-insulate-europe-against-cold-war-095237109.html#ZnzaUmt keep the lights on http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/get-fracking-mps-back-the-dash-for-uks-shale-gas-8676040.html whilst making gas cheaper for consumers and creating much needed jobs. All the major political parties in the UK are pro-fracking, so there is little likelihood of a change of government policy on fracking, even if the next general election in 2015 results in a change of Government. The 14th Licensing round has just opened for applications for licenses for areas in 60% of Britain for potential fracking http://www.insideenergyandenvironment.com/2014/07/uk-parliament-announces-the-14th-landward-licensing-round/ <br><br>The industry is still small in the UK and is facing stiff opposition wherever it goes. But the companies involved and their pals in the Government are trying every trick in the book to force this toxic unsustainable industry on the country including weasel-worded planning applications, bribes to local communities and heavy-handed policing against activists using direct action to slow down operations at fracking sites.<br><br>Campaigners are fighting on multiple fronts against fracking and other extreme fossil fuel extraction methods such as coal-bed methane and underground coal gasification which are being used or proposed in the UK. Our principal targets are local authorities which have the powers to grant or deny planning applications and investors, the more we can delay the industry and increase costs for even exploratory operations to less attractive the industry is going to be to investors. <br><br>The industry does seem to be on the back foot here in the UK with even the more right wing papers publishing critical articles about the effects on the environment, on house prices and on the risky nature of investments in fracking &amp; fossil-fuels generally. <br><br>So I hope the bubble bursts soon and hard and that it will stop this toxic industry from contaminating any more water supplies. I accept the knock-on longer-term effects on the economy will not be good and will make my position as a public sector employee in community health services more precarious. But I and my husband are pursuing our own personal divestment campaign by gradually switching how we live to sustainable home produced resources as much as possible as well as engaging with campaigning work to alert our local and spiritual communities to the dangers of extreme fossil-fuel extraction and the need to change how we live to use less energy in the first instance and change where that energy comes from in the second instance.<br><br><a href=#c9081783617517284705 title="comment permalink">8/25/14, 5:53 AM</a><br><br>
