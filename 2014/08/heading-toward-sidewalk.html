Talking about historical change is one thing when the changes under discussion are at some convenient remove in the past or the future. It’s quite another when the changes are already taking place. That’s one of the things that adds complexity to the project of this blog, because the decline and fall of modern industrial civilization isn’t something that might take place someday, if X or Y or Z happens or doesn’t happen; it’s under way now, all around us, and a good many of the tumults of our time are being driven by the unmentionable but inescapable fact that the process of decline is beginning to pick up speed. <br>
<br>
Those tumults are at least as relevant to this blog’s project as the comparable events in the latter years of dead civilizations, and so it’s going to be necessary now and then to pause the current sequence of posts, set aside considerations of the far future for a bit, and take a look at what’s happening here and now. This is going to be one of those weeks, because a signal I’ve been expecting for a couple of years now has finally showed up, and its appearance means that real trouble may be imminent. <br>
<br>
This has admittedly happened in a week when the sky is black with birds coming home to roost. I suspect that most of my readers have been paying at least some attention to the Ebola epidemic now spreading across West Africa. Over the last week, the World Health Organization has revealed that official statistics on the epidemic’s toll are significantly understated, the main nongovernmental organization fighting Ebola has admitted that the situation is out of anyone’s control, and a series of events neatly poised between absurdity and horror—a riot in one of Monrovia’s poorest slums directed at an emergency quarantine facility, in which looters made off with linens and bedding contaminated with the Ebola virus, and quarantined patients vanished into the crowd—may shortly plunge Liberia into scenes of a kind not witnessed since the heyday of the Black Death. The possibility that this outbreak may become a global pandemic, while still small, can no longer be dismissed out of hand. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, closer to home, what has become a routine event in today’s America—the casual killing of an unarmed African-American man by the police—has blown up in a decidedly nonroutine fashion, with imagery reminiscent of Cairo’s Tahrir Square being enacted night after night in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri. The culture of militarization and unaccountability that’s entrenched in urban police forces in the United States has been displayed in a highly unflattering light, as police officers dressed for all the world like storm troopers on the set of a bad science fiction movie did their best to act the part, tear-gassing and beating protesters, reporters, and random passersby in an orgy of jackbooted enthusiasm blatant enough that Tea Party Republicans have started to make worried speeches about just how closely this resembles the behavior of a police state. <br>
<br>
If the police keep it up, the Arab Spring of a few years back may just be paralleled by an American Autumn. Even if some lingering spark of common sense on the part of state and local authorities heads off that possibility, the next time a white police officer guns down an African-American man for no particular reason—and there will be a next time; such events, as noted above, are routine in the United States these days—the explosion that follows will be even more severe, and the risk that such an explosion may end up driving the emergence of a domestic insurgency is not small. I noted <a href=../../2012/08/the-end-of-gasoline-warfare.html>in a post a couple of years back</a> that the American way of war pretty much guarantees that any country conquered by our military will pup an insurgency in short order thereafter; there’s a great deal of irony in the thought that the importation of the same model of warfare into police practice in the US may have exactly the same effect here. <br>
<br>
It may come as a surprise to some of my readers that the sign I noted is neither of these things. No, it’s not the big volcano in Iceland that’s showing worrying signs of blowing its top, either. It’s an absurdly little thing—a minor book review in an otherwise undistinguished financial-advice blog—and it matters only because it’s a harbinger of something considerably more important. <br>
<br>
A glance at the past may be useful here. On September 9, 1929, no less a financial periodical than <i>Barron’s</i> took time off from its usual cheerleading of the stock market’s grand upward movement to denounce an investment analyst named Roger Babson in heated terms. Babson’s crime? Suggesting that the grand upward movement just mentioned was part of a classic speculative bubble, and the bubble’s inevitable bust would cause an economic depression. Babson had been saying this sort of thing all through the stock market boom of the late 1920s, and until that summer, the mainstream financial media simply ignored him, as they ignored everyone else whose sense of economic reality hadn’t gone out to lunch and forgotten to come back. <br>
<br>
For those who followed the media, in fact, the summer and fall of 1929 were notable mostly for the fact that a set of beliefs that most people took for granted—above all else, the claim that the stock market could keep on rising indefinitely—suddenly were being loudly defended all over the place, even though next to nobody was attacking them. The June issue of <i>The American Magazine</i> featured an interview with financier Bernard Baruch, insisting that “the economic condition of the world seems on the verge of a great forward movement.” In the July 8 issue of <i>Barron’s</i>, similarly, an article insisted that people who worried about how much debt was propping up the market didn’t understand the role of broker’s loans as a major new investment outlet for corporate money. <br>
<br>
As late as October 15, when the great crash was only days away, Professor Irving Fisher of Yale’s economics department made his famous announcement to the media: “Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.” That sort of puffery was business as usual, then as now. Assaulting the critics of the bubble in print, by name, was not. It was only when the market was sliding toward the abyss of the 1929 crash that financial columnists publicly trained their rhetorical guns on the handful of people who had been saying all along that the boom would inevitably bust. <br>
<br>
That’s a remarkably common feature of speculative bubbles, and could be traced in any number of historical examples, starting with the tulip bubble in the 17th century Netherlands and going on from there. Some of my readers may well have experienced the same thing for themselves in the not too distant past, during the last stages of the gargantuan real estate bubble that popped so messily in 2008. I certainly did, and a glance back at that experience will help clarify the implications of the signal I noticed in the week just past. <br>
<br>
Back when the real estate bubble was soaring to vertiginous and hopelessly unsustainable heights, I used to track its progress on a couple of news aggregator sites, especially Keith Brand’s lively HousingPanic blog. Now and then, as the bubble peaked and began losing air, I would sit down with a glass of scotch, a series of links to the latest absurd comments by real estate promoters, and my copy of John Kenneth Galbraith’s <i>The Great Crash 1929</i>—the source, by the way, of the anecdotes cited above—and enjoyed watching the rhetoric used to insist that the 2008 bubble wasn’t a bubble duplicate, in some cases word for word, the rhetoric used for the same purpose in 1929. <br>
<br>
All the anti-bubble blogs fielded a steady stream of hostile comments from real estate investors who apparently couldn’t handle the thought that anyone might question their guaranteed ticket to unearned wealth, and Brand’s in particular saw no shortage of bare-knuckle verbal brawls. It was only in the last few months before the bubble burst, though, that pro-bubble blogs started posting personal attacks on Brand and his fellow critics, denouncing them by name in heated and usually inaccurate terms. At the time, I noted the parallel with the <i>Barron’s<i> </i></i>attack on Roger Babson, and wondered if it meant the same thing; the events that followed showed pretty clearly that it did. <br>
<br>
That same point may just have arrived in the fracking bubble—unsurprisingly, since that has followed the standard trajectory of speculative booms in all other respects so far. For some time now, the media has been full of proclamations about America’s allegely limitless petroleum supply, which resemble nothing so much as the airy claims about stocks made by Bernard Baruch and Irving Fisher back in 1929. Week after week, bloggers and commentators have belabored the concept of peak oil, finding new and ingenious ways to insist that it must somehow be possible to extract infinite amounts of oil from a finite planet; oddly enough, though it’s rare for anyone to speak up for peak oil on these forums, the arguments leveled against it have been getting louder and more shrill as time passes. Until recently, though, I hadn’t encountered the personal attacks that announce the imminence of the bust. <br>
<br>
That was before this week. On August 11th, a financial-advice website hosted <a href=http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article46846.html>a fine example of the species</a>, and rather to my surprise—I’m hardly the most influential or widely read critic of the fracking bubble, after all—it was directed at me. <br>
<br>
Mind you, I have no objection to hostile reviews of my writing. A number of books by other people have come in for various kinds of rough treatment on this blog, and turnabout here as elsewhere is fair play. I do prefer reviewers, hostile or otherwise, to take the time to read a book of mine before they review it, but that’s not something any writer can count on; reviewers who clearly haven’t so much as opened the cover of the book on which they pass judgment have been the target of barbed remarks in literary circles since at least the 18th century. Still, a review of a book the reviewer hasn’t read is one thing, and a review of a book the author hasn’t written and the publisher hasn’t published is something else again. <br>
<br>
That’s basically the case here. The reviewer, a stock market blogger named Andew McKillop, set out to critique a newly re-edited version of my 2008 book <a href="http://www.newsociety.com/affil.mvc?Affil=ARCH&amp;Page=../Books/L/The-Long-Descent">The Long Descent</a>. That came as quite a surprise to me, as well as to New Society Publications, the publisher of the earlier book, since no such reissue exists. The Long Descent remains in print in its original edition, and my six other books on peak oil and the future of industrial society are, ahem, different books. <br>
<br>
My best guess is that McKillop spotted my new title <a href="http://www.newsociety.com/affil.mvc?Affil=ARCH&amp;Page=../Books/D/Decline-and-Fall">Decline and Fall: The End of Empire and the Future of Democracy in 21st Century America</a> in a bookshop window, and simply jumped to the conclusion that it must be a new release of the earlier book. I’m still not sure whether the result counts as a brilliant bit of surrealist performance art or a new low in what we still jokingly call journalistic ethics; in either case, it’s definitely broken new ground. Still, I hope that McKillop does better research for the people who count on him for stock advice. <br>
<br>
Given that starting point, the rest of the review is about what you would expect. I gather that McKillop read a couple of online reviews of The Long Descent and a couple more of Decline and Fall, skimmed over a few randomly chosen posts on this blog, tossed the results together all anyhow, and jumped to the conclusion that the resulting mess was what the book was about. The result is quite a lively little bricolage of misunderstandings, non sequiturs, and straightforward fabrications—I invite anyone who cares to make the attempt to point out the place in my writings, for example, where I contrast catabolic collapse with “anabolic collapse,” whatever on earth that latter might be. <br>
<br>
There’s a certain wry amusement to be had from going through the review and trying to figure out exactly how McKillop might have gotten this or that bit of misinformation wedged into his brain, but I’ll leave that as a party game for my readers. The point I’d like to make here is that the appearance of this attempted counterblast in a mainstream financial blog is a warning sign. It suggests that the fracking boom, like previous bubbles when they reached the shoot-the-messenger stage, may well be teetering on the brink of a really spectacular crash—and it’s not the only such sign, either. <br>
<br>
The same questions about debt that were asked about the stock market in 1929 and the housing market in 2008 are being asked now, with increasing urgency, about the immense volume of junk bonds that <a href=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-05-01/junk-bonds-fuel-the-shale-gas-boom>are currently propping up the shale boom</a>. Meanwhile gas and oil companies are <a href=http://thetyee.ca/News/2014/06/27/Shale-Gas-Drilling-Treadmill/ >having to drill ever more frantically and invest ever more money</a> to keep production rates from dropping like a rock Get past the vacuous handwaving about “Saudi America,” and it’s embarrassingly clear that the fracking boom is simply one more debt-fueled speculative orgy destined for one more messy bust. It’s disguised as an energy revolution in exactly the same way that the real estate bubble was disguised as a housing revolution, the tech-stock bubble as a technological revolution, and so on back through the annals of financial delusion as far as you care to go. <br>
<br>
Sooner or later—and much more likely sooner than later—the fracking bubble is going to pop. Just how and when that will happen is impossible to know in advance. Even making an intelligent guess at this point would require a detailed knowledge of which banks and investment firms have gotten furthest over their heads in shale leases and the like, which petroleum and natural gas firms have gone out furthest on a financial limb, and so on. That’s the kind of information that the companies in question like to hide from one another, not to mention the general public; it’s thus effectively inaccessible to archdruids, which means that we’ll just have to wait for the bankruptcies, the panic selling, and the wet thud of financiers hitting Wall Street sidewalks to find out which firms won the fiscal irresponsibility sweepstakes this time around. <br>
<br>
One way or another, the collapse of the fracking boom bids fair to deliver a body blow to the US economy, at a time when most sectors of that economy have yet to recover from the bruising they received at the hands of the real estate bubble and bust. Depending on how heavily and cluelessly foreign banks and investors have been sucked into the boom—again, hard to say without inside access to closely guarded financial information—the popping of the bubble could sucker-punch national economies elsewhere in the world as well. Either way, it’s going to be messy, and the consequences will likely include a second helping of the same unsavory stew of bailouts for the rich, austerity for the poor, bullying of weaker countries by their stronger neighbors, and the like, that was dished up with such reckless abandon in the aftermath of the 2008 real estate bust. Nor is any of this going to make it easier to deal with potential pandemics, simmering proto-insurgencies in the American heartland, or any of the other entertaining consequences of our headfirst collision with the sidewalks of reality. <br>
<br>
The consequences may go further than this. The one detail that sets the fracking bubble apart from the real estate bubble, the tech stock bubble, and their kin further back in economic history is that fracking wasn’t just sold to investors as a way to get rich quick; it was also sold to them, and to the wider public as well, as a way to evade the otherwise inexorable reality of peak oil. 2008, it bears remembering, was not just the year that the real estate bubble crashed, and dragged much of the global economy down with it; it was also the year when all those prophets of perpetual business as usual who insisted that petroleum would never break $60 a barrel or so got to eat crow, deep-fried in light sweet crude, when prices spiked upwards of $140 a barrel. All of a sudden, all those warnings about peak oil that experts had been issuing since the 1950s became a great deal harder to dismiss out of hand. <br>
<br>
The fracking bubble thus had mixed parentage; its father may have been the same merciless passion for fleecing the innocent that always sets the cold sick heart of Wall Street aflutter, but its mother was the uneasy dawn of recognition that by ignoring decades of warnings and recklessly burning through the Earth’s finite reserves of fossil fuels just as fast as they could be extracted, the industrial world has backed itself into a corner from which the only way out leads straight down. White’s Law, one of the core concepts of human ecology, points out that economic development is directly correlated with energy per capita; as depletion overtakes production and energy per capita begins to decline, the inevitable result is a long era of economic contraction, in which a galaxy of economic and cultural institutions predicated on continued growth will stop working, and those whose wealth and influence depend on those institutions will be left with few choices short of jumping out a Wall Street window. <br>
<br>
The last few years of meretricious handwaving about fracking as the salvation of our fossil-fueled society may thus mark something rather more significant than another round of the pervasive financial fraud that’s become the lifeblood of the US economy in these latter days. It’s one of the latest—and maybe, just maybe, one of the last—of the mental evasions that people in the industrial world have used in the futile but fateful attempt to pretend that pursuing limitless economic growth on a finite and fragile planet is anything other than a guaranteed recipe for disaster. When the fracking bubble goes to its inevitable fate, and most of a decade of babbling about limitless shale oil takes its proper place in the annals of human idiocy, it’s just possible that some significant number of people will realize that the universe is under no obligation to provide us will all the energy and other resources we want, just because we happen to want them. I wouldn’t bet the farm on that, but I think the possibility is there. <br>
<br>
One swallow does not a summer make, mind you, and one fumbled attempt at a hostile book review on one website doesn’t prove that the same stage in the speculative bubble cycle that saw frantic denunciations flung at Roger Babson and Keith Brand—the stage that comes immediately before the crash—has arrived this time around. I would encourage my readers to watch for similar denunciations aimed at more influential and respectable fracking-bubble critics such as Richard Heinberg or Kurt Cobb. Once those start showing up, hang onto your hat; it’s going to be a wild ride. <i><i><br></i></i></div>

In the meantime, I found this update on the chickens coming home to roost that you observed in the past week's news more than welcome. That written, when I read the title, I thought of all of the ruined personal belongings headed to the curb and then the dump this week and last because of Detroit's latest experience with climate weirding, the record one-day rainfall that flooded out much of the metro area and <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2014/08/detroits-flooding-made-national.html rel=nofollow>made national headlines</a>. The mayor of Warren, Detroit's largest suburb, claimed that the city's residents had lost more than one billion dollars (Dr. Evil impression optional) in ruined personal property because of the backed up sewage. I was lucky to have only experienced inconvenience, a tripling of my commute home to avoid the flooding and a delay of five days in my trash being picked up. The image of ruined investors and brokers jumping out of windows didn't even occur to me until the end of the essay. Oops!<br><br>As for the <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2014/08/ebola-outbreak-now-top-story.html rel=nofollow>Ebola outbreak becoming a top story</a>, I mentioned in a comment here that it looked concerning weeks ago. Honestly, Ebola scares me. I first read about it in "The Hot Zone," the very first chapter of which described the death of an Ebola patient on a plane back to the U.S. Stephen King described that story as "the scariest thing he'd ever read--and then it got worse." Fortunately, it's not an immediate threat to people in the developed world. That's small comfort to the people in west Africa, who are in immediate and growing danger.<br><br>"I would encourage my readers to watch for similar denunciations aimed at more influential and respectable fracking-bubble critics such as Richard Heinberg or Kurt Cobb.

Now I'm on the lookout for people denouncing James Howard Kunstler for his stand on Peak Oil. The last major criticism he got was for attacking WalMart, the purpose of which was as much to chase conservatives away from reading him as to defend WalMart. That reminds me; I have to listen to the Kunstlercast episode in which he interviews you.

I even made several (unsuccessful) attempts to cement it into the form of a novel or a screenplay, although now reality seems to be catching up with my attempted fictional narratives faster than I can revise them! But I've wondered about it a lot, and wargamed various scenarios in my head while attempting to fictionalize it. My sense is that a domestic insurgency would play out in one of two ways. In both scenarios you would be looking at a hodgepodge of different insurgent groups reflecting America's different ethnic and political divides, with the groups trying to be allies on paper even as many of them secretly plotted to undermine the others. The difference in the two scenarios would be determined by the way in which the insurgency began.<br><br>Americans of all political stripes love big, bold, dramatic gestures, shocks and awes and spectacular, symbolic events. If the domestic insurgents begin their campaign with acts of terrorism against elites - assassinating government officials or blowing up their vacation houses on Martha's Vineyard, for example - then things will likely get very bad very quickly. Remember the bloodthirsty reaction that the establishment had to 9/11. That's what happens when you penetrate the protective bubbles of their offices with hijacked planes full of their business associates. In that scenario I think you would see the rapid acceleration of police militarization, a very speedy introduction of further unconstitutional legislation and a fairly big redeployment of American troops from overseas back to the homeland. The military will do its best not to actually close any overseas bases (because they know that if they allow the facilities in places like Okinawa to be shut down they will never, ever be allowed to reopen), but they will bring quite a large number home.<br><br>On the other hand, if the domestic insurgency chooses to focus their efforts on rural flyover country and let the elites remain in their bubbles for as long as possible, it would be a much slower, lower-intensity affair. I think in that scenario many of our leaders would still do their best to maintain the empire and perhaps even continue some overseas military operations (imagine the Air Force bombing insurgents in Wyoming and Islamic militants in Somalia on the same day). The number of troops brought home from overseas would be much smaller, probably limited at first to military police, intelligence personnel and troops with other specialized training like IED detection and dismantling.<br><br><a href=#c8518460354867250361 title="comment permalink">8/20/14, 9:19 PM</a><br><br>

There's another section that I can't seem to find where he explains it more fully, but here's one part at any rate:<br><br>"They were on the defensive; and it was poor old England that they were defending. Their attitude implied that somebody or something was leaving her undefended, or finding her indefensible. The burden of that hearty chorus was that England was not so black as she was painted; it seemed clear that somewhere or other she was being painted pretty black. But there was something else that made me uncomfortable; it was not only the sense of being somewhat boisterously forgiven; it was also something involving questions of power as well as morality. Then it seemed to me that a new sensation turned me hot and cold; and I felt something I have never before felt[Pg 136] in a foreign land. Never had my father or my grandfather known that sensation; never during the great and complex and perhaps perilous expansion of our power and commerce in the last hundred years had an Englishman heard exactly that note in a human voice. England was being pitied. I, as an Englishman, was not only being pardoned but pitied...<br><br>But if English readers want the truth, I am sure this is the truth about their notion of the position of England. They are wondering, or those who are watching are wondering, whether the term of her success is come and she is going down the dark road after Prussia. Many are sorry if this is so; some are glad if it is so; but all are seriously considering the probability of its being so."<br><br>There was also this nugget of wisdom I believe you would appreciate: "The men who will not face this fact are men whose minds are not free. They are more crushed by Progress than any pietists by Providence. They are not allowed to question that whatever has recently happened was all for the best. Now Progress is Providence without God. That is, it is a theory that everything has always perpetually gone right by accident. It is a sort of atheistic optimism, based on an everlasting coincidence far more miraculous than a miracle. If there be no purpose, or if the purpose permits of human free will, then in either case it is almost insanely unlikely that there should be in history a period of steady and uninterrupted progress; or in other words a period in which poor bewildered humanity moves amid a chaos of complications, without making a single mistake... We have not yet seen the end of the whole industrial experiment; and there are already signs of it coming to a bad end."<br><br><a href=#c2893098127171752503 title="comment permalink">8/20/14, 10:59 PM</a><br><br>

It appears that the policeman was attacked and injured prior to shooting. The young man possibly panicked because he had committed a crime in a local market, moments earlier.

My one overwhelming impression was that it was an incoherent response, and as such very much in line with so much of what is happening around the world. <br><br>Incoherent responses seem to be very much the vogue - for instance, Ukraine, Iraq, Gaza... all over the place. Maybe it has something to do with being backed into indefensible corners, maybe because a rational response is just too taxing. He did remind me somewhat of the situation in Monrovia. The looting of the Ebola isolation unit was a chilling event, and for a number of reasons. The sheer medical facts of it are enough in their own right - the release of patients back to the community, and the taking of infected linen and other materials with their echoes of 'smallpox blankets'. But WHAT happened is only part of it - WHY it happened is almost as disturbing. The widespread instant communication provided by mobile phones and SMS combines potently with the heady mix of rumour, superstition and suspicion. In some senses, Ebola in West Africa serves as a microcosm of so many issues and the internet on the wider stage.<br><br>I may be stretching a point here, but I see echoes of various flavours of denialism in the west, fuelled by internet conspiracies and loss of faith in authority (in intellectual and political terms). To some in West Africa, the science surrounding ebola is seen as a 'colonial plot' much as many in the west see the science behind climate change as a 'liberal plot'. As has been said many times, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts. Get the facts wrong, and all you can offer is an incoherent response.<br><br>McKillop did a great job of misrepresenting the case he was arguing against, and irony of ironies, was very free with his accusations of rhetoric and sophistry. I could start to catalogue his logical fallacies, but strawman and ad hominem were as far as I got before losing interest in the project.<br><br>I hesitate to comment on Ferguson - from the media coverage over here it looks both complex and simple at once. I recall the recent riots we had here in the UK, where US commentators were seeing a politically-inspired uprising, whereas closer to the ground it was mostly consumerism-inspired criminality, once the initial protests provided a convenient cover for other kinds of opportunism. I suspect there's some element of that in Ferguson, too. Still, seeing all the stormtroopers on the streets, I can't help thinking that the best response to a pot boiling over is not to tighten the lid but to turn down the heat.<br><br>Interesting times indeed.<br><br><a href=#c8958032805777027480 title="comment permalink">8/21/14, 6:02 AM</a><br><br>

(In my case, I am barred from even putting my home-made selfwatering plant systems outside the door to my little basement, under the open sky: those pots, with their soil mix prepared under the guidance of the Mel Bartholemew's Square-Foot Garden book, have to sit indoors, in the window of the bedroom that I have converted into a compact book-lined library.)<br><br>It helps take the harsh edge off basement apartment living to live better in the imagination. Here is what I for my part imagine: (1) There is enough land to grow cabbages, tomatoes, and some root crops, and to keep a couple of bee-friendly Warre (as opposed to bee-oppressing Langstroth) hives. (2) Under the roof is a huge unheated room, for books and tools and lab bench, plus an unheated larder, plus an unheated alcove with composting toilet and solar-heated shower, plus a small parlour with Rumford fireplace, armchairs, and hammock. In a deep bed of wood ash in the Rumford fireplace sit a Dutch oven (for cooking hot meals), and a one-litre Pyrex lab beaker on iron trivet (for getting water for tea - either for myself alone or for up to two visitors). (3) The floors are brick, sloped to facilitate wet-mopping, with central drainage channel. (4) Much fuss is made of the Liturgy of the Hours (I **DO** in real life say it in Latin, these days, and I find this soothing and reassuring). (5) There is quite a determined push to do things in am Amish style, following the example of the "Plain Catholics" at http://plaincatholic.webs.com/. (Well, in real life, I **AM** making some progress in getting rid of factory food - these days, the crockpot is used for curried veggies-and-lentils, etc. And I **HAVE** in the last few days learned to make a fine breakfast through soaking oatmeal overnight, with raisins etc, in milk or store-bought kefir. And I **DO** make tea from fine loose leaves, with Pyrex beakers, irradiating the water in huge,solid, 1980s microwave oven, using only a modest amount of grid power. And I **DO** in real life manage to get Real Cheese, in the form of an organic cheddar, from Toronto's Kensington Market: once one has tasted Real Cheese, the factory stuff seems rebarbative, sinister, neo-Soviet. Additionally, I **AM** in real life blessed with a Persian bakery, about 600 metres from my apartment, which offers a kind of Real Bread - flatbreads, in Persian parlance "taftoons", sometimes so oven-hot at the time of purchase that one risks burning the fingertips. Next, I suppose, will have to come a more Amish vest, to supplant the worn-out and only moderately practical black vest that I wear, with machine-knitted necktie, as I type this stuff.) <br><br>I also have the impression, Brien, that you are connected with a Catholic institution, Wyoming Catholic College. Do contact me off-list if you want to talk about this. I for my part would like to see more Catholic education - though in my case, along the lines of rigorous maths and physics, in a kind of exact-sciences counterpoint to the liberal-arts approach of Wyoming CC. In my own curriculum, there would be lots of lab work, some basic telescope work, and even a degree of attention to practical (especially Morse-code) shortwave radio. In addition to exact science, there would be some degree of practical biology, with trials of mycorrhizal associations; with microscopy of local soils; with pH investigations of local soils in what I think was the Old Way, through titration as opposed to glitzy electronic pH metering; etc. Huge sinks, of course; heavy slate-topped lab tables; machine shop; tutorials on glass-bending, even perhaps on glass-blowing; tutorials on soldering; ... <br><br>Tom<br><br><a href=#c7259877246312587078 title="comment permalink">8/21/14, 7:40 AM</a><br><br>

I haven’t seen the thrust and enthusiasm behind it. It looks like it’s following more of a ragged decline than a sudden burst. My friend who works in the energy industry got laid off along with his entire office because most of the best Texas fields had gone under back in 2010, and the fields seem to get abandoned pretty quickly. It’s reminded me more of the cycles of boom and bust you see in the petroleum industry (I grew up in an oil town called Midland, Texas whose heartbeat was the rhythmic swell and the shrink of the population as drilling came and went. In popular opinion, what I usually hear is debates about whether it should be done at all and even supporters haven’t really attached the cornucopian rhetoric I’d expect from a bubble to it. I may just be looking from the wrong angle, or listening to the wrong voices.<br><br>The one thing I am seeing a classic bubble is solar. I’m constantly being bombarded with claims of solar power “replacing petroleum” and the rhetoric has been about getting rich by riding the next wave of the future. Probably the best example of the species was this seizure inducer: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlTA3rnpgzU) and they keep coming (http://news.sky.com/story/1299972/australia-critical-steam-solar-breakthrough). Recently even one of my coworkers quit to go get rich off solar. He was pretty right wing,so it isn’t just environmentalists and green liberals either. That collapse is going to devastate some of my friends who still believe they can power the future of their dreams on renewables without making major sacrifices. On the other hand, it’ll mean lots of cheap solar panels.<br><br><a href=#c6636490595617403523 title="comment permalink">8/21/14, 7:50 AM</a><br><br>

During the 1930s everything, including industry declined but it was hard to point the finger at oil as even a minor cause. The End of Empires moved to center-stage as the elite's key obsession and we can ask a few questions to John Michael Greer. Did the Roman Empire collapse because it ran out of oil? Did the Ottoman Empire disappear because it ran out of oil?” So… the period from 1914-1945 wasn’t marked by the decline and fall of a 400 year old global civilization? And apparently you’re theory of catabolic collapse necessitates oil being the cause of the end of any civilization anywhere in time… That was entertaining.<br><br><a href=#c1648367072670615470 title="comment permalink">8/21/14, 8:14 AM</a><br><br>

The ability of revenues to support the debt burde n that keeps money flowing, but not an excessive money supply (which causes inflation), requires inputs of "labor" which in our energy-resource rich economy such labor is performed by oil coal natural gas. When te supply of energy can no longer meet the illusory demands of the government and bank debt burdens, bankruptcies ensue. Eventually the shortage of energy reaches the Federal government. But it seems more likely that the rot will hit marginal communities whose demand for goods and services is supported by debt-financed governmt subsidies of various kinds - much of the government's function since WWII is to provide a dizzying array of subsidies here and there to prevent any kind of social decay. Just throwing raw energy at the problem will no longer be an option. <br><br>It is possible for formerly subsidized Communities to become somewhat more self-supporting through more ecologically sound practices such as local gardens and trade cooperatives, etc.<br><br>The hugest subsidies are paid for the military.

This has actually given me hope, because it tells me people are paying attention, that they care about justice and are unwilling to simply comply with the rise of the national security state and the destruction of our "democratic" republic. Here in Minneapolis, over the past few days, the military has been conducting "training exercises", flying helicopters low and at top speed over neighborhoods and through the canyons of skyscrapers downtown. The only problem is they never bothered to inform the public that this would be happening, they just did it, unannounced. Citizens here- including tea party Republicans- are outraged at what they see as an invasion of their community by an occupying army with attack helicopters (and yes, they are black!)that we the taxpayers paid for, and wondering aloud if they're preparing for some sort of insurrection. It looks all the world to us like a police state, accountable to nobody, is on the rise (and we had a taste of it during the Republican National convention in St. Paul back in 2008 when an army of robocops in military vehicles descended on our city).

NPR came out with an article concerning the advent of the post-Mycenaian dark age; it turns out that Mycenaian civilization was interlinked with seven other civilizations in the ancient Near East and Eastern Mediterrranean at the close of the Bronze Age (1177 BCE). It turns the initial cause according to this article was Climate Change - cooling of the ocean surfaces - that led to extended, extreme drought and the subsequent collapse of the eight interlinked, one might say globalized, cultures. And their descent appeared to take Dimitry Orlov's hypothesis as a model: first perceptible, then perceptible decline, the all of a sudden, everything at once. Then all the evils of sorting things out followed, ultimately with the arrival of a most dark dark age where even writing was lost.<br><br>The article also stated that the stressors of our globalized American civilization resembled most the causes of the collapse of the eight cultures.<br><br><a href=#c6850915709977608944 title="comment permalink">8/21/14, 10:18 AM</a><br><br>

If we all believe, If we all hold hands together and believe with all our hearts!" <br><br>Its kind of shocking how much a solipsistic needs others to concur with his or her miraculous mind-creations.

God forbid if something like famine hits US. It'll be like seventeenth century witch hunts. You, as a nail that sticks out, would be convenient "sacrifice to make offal rain happen to someone else" short term startegy to show that "those in power" are still trustworthy because they are doing something, hunting these god-damned witches and druid eco-terrorists that magically dissapeared all of our Paradise!<br><br> I apologize if this sound like rant, but I believe that you might be unaware how low can humans jump ... not fall, but literally jump.<br><br> As a side note, your writing of magic reminded me of Terry Pratchett's witches. It was ... Headology, I think. And if I follow that idea, lots of people are chanting mantras and prayers to their uncaring god of Progress.<br><br>Concerning. I am almost happy that I live in country that is falling into ruin already thanks to irresponsible stupidity of it's ruling class. We will be at the bottom when higher developed countries will have to face the hard limits. At least Polish farming wasn't changed into industry yet ... God bless the techo-progress slack !<br><br>Lastly I would like to ask you a question that I believe I hadn't read in your blog before.<br> Isn't there possibility of a rebound ?

Ferguson puts out a monthly newspaper, the Ferguson Times, which is distributed free to local residents and at local stores. We get a paper when my husband takes his mom grocery shopping there. Besides providing info on upcoming events in the area, it's a good source for how the town leadership portrays itself and the town. I'd put a link to it here except that it doesn't have a website. <br><br>The mayor of Ferguson, a young and energetic man of conventional views, writes a monthly column in the Times. He's been very proud of the town for spiffing up the business district and managing to attract a few nice restaurants to set up shop there. Recently he's taken to saying that the rest of North St. Louis County ought to take an example from Ferguson's playbook if it means to rouse itself out of the economic doldrums. A quote from his July 2014 column, in which he argues for Ferguson's annexing a stretch of unincorporated county to the north, exemplifies his and the leadership's attitudes before the recent troubles: "Over the past 20 years, Ferguson has made huge strides and huge achievements in its economic development efforts. We have successfully cleared many blighted areas, attracted new businesses, restored historic buildings, and built new ones. Unfortunately where Ferguson ends and St. Louis County takes over, so does much of those successes [sic]." There are lots of other subtexts going on here that I don't want to take the bandwidth to explain, but you can be sure that I and others in the area get them. I confess I've been harboring a bit of ill-will toward the Ferguson mayor and leadership as a result. It'll be interesting, to say the least, to see what he says in next month's issue. But I also feel kind of sorry for him and others who don't know what hit them and don't have the context to assimilate what has happened into their vision of happy little Ferguson.<br><br><a href=#c4347991136002970209 title="comment permalink">8/21/14, 11:46 AM</a><br><br>

I don't know what qualifies as the perfect storm that sinks the ship, but the 1914/2014 parallels continue. Ukraine/Russia, China &amp; its neighbors, ISIS, Ferguson, and countless other straws on the camels back. Meanwhile, American officials of either party can't seem to open their mouths without showing their ignorance and incompetence. Surely, China &amp; Russia are very mindful of our domestic and international weaknesses and are going to take the opportunity to push full steam ahead/strike while the iron is hot. Another financial crash will be enough to push an already relunctant and reeling Europe into the arms of Russia. If Europe goes into freefall, they're going to grab the hand that reaches out to them--they won't care if that hand is Russian. If Russian can offer some kind of floor to stop the fall, Europe will take it. Considering how many of the members of ISIS hold European passports, Russia is the only country that can possibly offer Europe any kind of security against homegrown ISIS terrorism--it certainly won't be the US. I just don't know if this is the perfect storm or not. Guess it just depends on how much power the powers that be still wield to postpone things for another day, as well as how the rising powers respond.

I subscribe to a popular investment newsletter, and last month it pointed out that the price of oil remains high despite record U.S. production of oil (from fracking} and a drop in oil consumption. The author commented that this apparent contradiction was possibly due to the increased use of available energy to get the oil out of the ground, with the obvious limit of using 100% of the energy from the fracked oil to remove the oil. So even a few establishment folks are starting to realize that this "new" oil source is a losing proposition. It is also funny to hear conservative commentator Joe Scarborough on the popular MSNBC show "Morning Joe" proclaim that in five years the U.S. will be an exporter of oil to the rest of the world.

I don't know how the oil and gas producers can be bailed out but to do so in order to keep he game going would seem to be money well spent by the government to keep appearances and supply up and prices down.<br><br>Maybe the Fed could start buying oil company junk bonds. Which brings up the ongoing end of large scale printing, ie. Fed balance sheet expansion. The taper and end is going to be temporary I think. The next minor financial panic will force the Fed to print again. Which should make clear to all who is really in charge, the asset inflation folks.

Furthermore, police all over the world have long had effective means of controlling noncompliant and belligerent suspects, other than pumping them full of lead, and police here in the US somehow manage to control noncompliant and belligerent white suspects perfectly well by those means; it's only when the suspect isn't white that emptying the magazine of a Glock into him becomes the first choice.

The tension there is palpable. <br><br>Hispanics are still being blamed for, well, largely for existing, particularly in large numbers on our borders. The fact that we exported convicted Hispanic criminals and gang leaders to the Central American countries in the 90's who are now warlords down there doesn't seem to factor in any one's mind. In this country, we think we can isolate ourselves from problems in the rest of the world.<br><br>When I lived in Seattle in the 90's, I used to think things between the races were *better*. I had a boyfriend who drove a Porsche (he was a nice man anyway) and he had a black friend. One day, I was riding in the car with both of them, and the black friend was driving. A police car - out of nowhere - pulled up RIGHT on the bumper of the car. Our black friend said, "watch this". He drove for the next 45 minutes, never breaking the law, but turning, changing lanes, going around a block, getting on &amp; off the freeway, etc. The police car never budged from, literally, three feet off the bumper. It was my first (and only) introduction to the world of racial profiling and subsequent intimidation. Our black friend found it funny. I asked him why and he responded, "because I'm used to it, and I've been able to control this guy for the past 45 minutes."<br><br>I heard many more similar stories from him over the next several months. He was a law student, for God's sake, who'd never been in trouble with the law. Racial profiling exists in this country.

We should just list "white officer" and "unarmed black teenager" as the only two factors we consider before judging the situation?

For all we know, the young man attacked the officer and tried to take his weapon (numerous witnesses have reported exactly that). <br><br>I know it's a minor point to the overall gist of your post here, but the media storm around this situation baffles me. The entire clip of a Glock, really? Michael Brown was hit with six shots--about 1/3 of the magazine capacity of a standard-issue 9mm Glock, meaning the officer stopped firing well before emptying the magazine. A 220 pound man juiced with adrenaline (or any other chemical, has that toxicology report come out yet?) might not drop until a sixth shot, compromises his central nervous system. The five that proceeded it could simply have been flesh wounds.<br><br>The emotions around the situation are valid--white officers here in the US have a long, sordid history of abuse against young black men. But that's all they are--emotions. I don't want to live in a society where young men are executed on the basis of blurry camera footage, true.

There is a saying in the India-Pakistan-Afghansitan region “trouble comes with the thaw.” Meaning that trouble always comes when the weather gets warm and the high-mountain passes clear. <br><br>It is chilling that we've had two standoffs – one at Bundy ranch where federal agents were trying to enforce the writ of law, and one in Ferguson where the local authorities were trying to enforce the writ of law. The first thing I noticed during both confrontations is how much everyone was sweating. Let us hope this winter comes quickly and cools things down a little. I do not think that this year will be when those low intensity insurgencies start. We now have a slightly clearer picture of how things are going to develop and which groups can become antagonists and for what reasons. If the white militia's are galvanized it will be by the federal, if one of the minority militia's are galvanized it will be by local. Look, I don't want to antagonize anyone here and restart a tribal debate so let us just call them rural militia and urban militia. <br><br>This winter I think there will be consolidation of whatever factions are going to come into play. I've seen Black Panthers and Sovereign Citizens more active. At this point we will see how things turn out. <br><br>One good piece of news I can give all of you. The Socratic method of debate works, just got to keep asking questions. People I talk to regularly are starting to listen, many are starting to back down from their positions. Just gotta keep pushing. <br><br><br>@ Everyone else<br><br>If there was ever a time to help rebuild the fourth estate now would be that time.

Various crises and segments of the population who can't ignore them aside, this would have the function of providing hope to those who are feeling the squeeze and enabling a few more years of ignorance for those who aren't. <br><br>Given what I've heard from Steven Kopits on how capital expenditures in ALL unconventional oil are already being cut back because they can't pay for themselves, it seems like the aftermath of the fracking bubble is going to hammer the entire fossil fuel sector pretty hard. If there's massive economic stress from another round of unemployment, exploded pension funds, and slashed wages and public services, the ability to pay the high prices to sustain even the present level of production is going to be compromised. If it's not possible for the next energy-fantasy to come from fossil fuels, where will it be? <br><br>Given the fantasy status already attached to solar and wind, is it possible that we could see money pumped in that direction to build the massive wind and solar "farms" that greens dream of? Such projects aren't going to dig out a society where neither the people nor the system have any hope of surviving on energy that comes through a straw, not a fire hose, but it's not like fracking was ever sustainable either. I lack a solid understanding of how a speculative binge gets started, but I do think there are going to be a lot of people with a lot of powerful reasons to cling to anything that promises a way out, and it seems to me that all the ideological clashes between Left and Right in America won't mean a thing if a new oil-saviour isn't an option and there's money to be gamed.<br><br><a href=#c290355833260330154 title="comment permalink">8/21/14, 7:48 PM</a><br><br>

It's from whites, and only from the clueless among them, that I hear claims that such things don't happen in the USA. <br><br>Bear, that's brilliant. I don't usually give out two gold stars in a session, but that metaphor earned one. <br><br>Chris, as a Vietnam vet I know likes to say, once is accident, twice is coincidence, three times is enemy action. Over and over again in recent years, police have gunned down unarmed African-American men, in situations where white suspects would have been handled by nonlethal means, and there's always a chorus of people who insist, oh, you shouldn't blame the officer, it might have been justified, and so on through a standard litany of excuses. The fact remains that the same behavior gets two different responses from police -- one lethal, one not -- depending on the skin color of the suspect. A failure to deal with that reality simply blinds you to one of the major forces shaping our future right now. <br><br>Cherokee, and that's a very good reason to make sure your wizardry is better than the next guy's!<br><br>Stream, I went back and reread his review, and I'm still scratching my head. Ten minutes of online research would have saved him from making a fool of himself. <br><br>Varun, perhaps not. A great deal depends, as you've suggested, on the weather; a great deal more, on whether outside forces are involved in the business in Ferguson, and what their plans are. We could simply start seeing long hot summers like those of the 1960s, with one city after another torn apart by riots, until the economic cost and international embarrassment becomes too great to ignore; we might see something considerably more troubling. It's definitely something to watch. <br><br>Cole, good question. Solar might be the next energy bubble, though the numbers from Europe are sufficiently depressing that that might not be viable. Wind has already shot its bolt -- everybody has a clear idea of what the actual returns are. My guess is nuclear: a big push to build lots of fission reactors, leading to spectacular corporate and governmental bankruptcies and a lot of half-completed reactor sites. If you recall WPPSS, you know the sort of thing to watch for. <br><br>Janet, camas is also very good eating, so it might be worth your while to learn how to grow it!<br><br><a href=#c8321647389835797872 title="comment permalink">8/21/14, 9:53 PM</a><br><br>

I live in Romania and Chevron has been fracking up and down the countryside, digging exploratory wells, causing daily earthquakes in some areas and beating protesters in others, all with the tacit permission of our clueless and spineless government. I will be very happy to see them go away, but can't help but wonder what happens come winter, with those very interesting events to the east of us. Unless something changes between Russia and the EU, I think we can expect less gas at higher prices and a lot of people shivering and unhappy that we didn't keep those fracking guys around. It is also a presidential election year here that is shaping up to be a monumental fiasco, for different but related reasons, so protests and unrest are pretty much a given at this point.<br><br>Alexandru, my opinion is that the dice are already cast and our position towards Russia is established, with or without another missile shield.

I'll have to work on the showmanship a bit. Hehe! Herbal lore seems to be an excellent vehicle for such things. Actually, I really do use the herbs here based on their historical uses and most of them do actually produce a positive effect. <br><br>I've been digging and moving clay all day, so I'm a bit tired now. However, I am looking forward to increasing the water storage systems here. More water equals more plant growth, the equation is not lost on me.<br><br>Water is the difference here. Incidentally, I'm starting to wonder just how cheaply you get electricity over in the US. My reasoning behind this thought is that the prevalence of drawing drinking water from deep wells requires such a mind boggling amount of energy. People have wells over here, they just can’t afford to use them. I just don't get it, unless the electricity is cheap so that you can ignore the cost of the pump to lift the water from a deep well.<br><br>Such things are always on my mind of late as I stand or fall on the reliability of the water systems here.<br><br>PS: I just had the warmest winter day since May!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c5528419267487926681 title="comment permalink">8/22/14, 4:31 AM</a><br><br>

It’s easier for me to follow your stuff on ecology and energy or on culture and religion than on economics, but I try. Every time you mention the fracking bubble, I look at the relatives in the family who are always chasing after crazy financial schemes and losing money on them, since they seem to be a good indicator but none of them have run off to buy any fracking stock (though I have heard buzz about solar panels), so I wasn’t sure where I should be looking. It sounds like the whole thing is inflating on the inside without catching the public this time around, then, (and if buzz on the street means anything, the public seems in general not too happy with fracking and what it’s doing to their towns) do you know if that sort of discrepancy between the general public and the stock market insiders is going to make things play out any differently than these things usually do? Houses, websites, and blue chip stocks were all fairly innocuous to the average middle class person.

Direct deals with some of the farmers might be a better idea, e.g. "could you swing by location X on your way in and drop off a 25- or 50-pound bag of wheat berries?" or to use a cargo bicycle, though that would likely increase my food requirements. A basket with wheels would require an even longer walking route due to somewhat lacking sidewalks most notably around the northeast corner of the University Bridge. I could walk on the road, though I do hear that is frowned on in America.<br><br>Hulless oats (from said farmer's market) are great, though really must be cut with a bit of rye, as the taste is too sharp otherwise. These can be ground when also feeding the sourdough. Otherwise, root veggies keep the best over the week (radish, turn-IPs, carrots, what I now know as kohlrabi, etc); wrapping them in brown paper bags and then that in plastic or Tupperware seems a good practice. Summer squash are also nice, as they do not require attacking with a huge knife, or hacksaw, and keep well.<br><br>Otherwise, the spammers are certainly pushing solar, per the mail server logs at work, along with the usual smattering of south beached whale diets, autos, medical things, vacation cruises, and various other HARPings.

Conversely, sometimes our "real" news outlets deliver better comedy! Is this largely a product of the news media becoming increasingly undermined by their advertisers who represent their income stream? Or would the increasing ridiculousness of the facade people have to put up to pretend everything is normal result in this sort of thing even without advertiser influence on the erosion of media standards?<br><br>One of my favorite exercises is to open the New York Times in one tab and the Onion in an adjacent one, and flip back and forth. I often find myself laughing at what I think is brilliant satire, only to find I'm on the NYT! The best part of the NYT is "Room for Debate", which is basically just the Onion's "American Voices". But it's much better: it features real people who are supposed to be "experts", and you can click on their links and there's a more verbose version of their alternately ridiculous or obvious statements.<br><br>I pick on the NYT because it's our "paper of record"; accidental satire from other news outlets is just as common, but usually of a lower quality.<br><br><a href=#c1367675559635834459 title="comment permalink">8/22/14, 9:05 AM</a><br><br>

First I got my copy of Odum's Fundamentals of Ecology from the local library's free rack. It's sad what get's cut, but it was nice to get a free copy.<br><br> Second, riots and the killing of minorities. A big chunk of riots and uprisings start with the shooting of some poor, innocent kid. But it happens often without starting riots. I view it like an avalanche, the trigger is a shooting but the cause is like the build up of snow on a steep angle. Riots tend to happen in unusually hot summers, in times of economic hardship or contraction, also in areas with substantial inequality, and lastly when the people in question are already busy nursing a grudge over something.<br><br> Lastly, Irving Fisher was a serious economist, after he lost his fortune and his credibility he took a fresh look at things. I think he did a pretty good job of it. But his precrash writings are more heavily cited then his debt deflation works. Bernanke refuted his work in his dissertation by not addressing his actual points. You know, griping about something without bothering to actually read it. I hear that's rather common.<br><br> Anyways, along the same lines, there is publication by Dirk J Bezemer titled "No One Saw This Coming": Understanding Financial Crisis Through Accounting Models (free download online) that looked through all the peer reviewed publications and found everyone who predicted the crisis with a methodology of some kind. It is very much in line with Fisher (very likely derives from in fact) Side note, most of the economists in academia that I know hadn't read it or heard of it last I checked in 2013.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br><a href=#c6626034790654019036 title="comment permalink">8/22/14, 9:57 AM</a><br><br>

You mentioned some of those news items in this week's blog post, though a number of others come to mind, for example: the massive loss of groundwater and the ongoing severe drought in California, or the water that had to be shut off for several days for half a million people in Toledo (Ohio) earlier this month.<br><br>At a family dinner last month, a crucial point was made clear to me through a discussion with my brother-in-law. Somehow we got into a discussion about peak oil and industrial collapse, which he knows is a subject continually on my mind. While he doesn't deny that fossil fuels are finite, he isn't completely convinced of the collapse worldview I have. Trying to conclude the discussion, he sighed, then argued, "Well, I guess I have more faith than you guys in people and the power of technology. I believe that when these crises happen and when times really get tough, it will finally force the right changes to be made, and collapse can be averted."<br><br>My sister and I both responded to his statement by saying, "But the problem is what we're talking about is not merely something that will occur in the future. Peak (conventional) oil is already a time in the past; it is not just some future crisis to deal with. It has affected and continues to affect us all to varying degrees and ways. We see no sign that society is responding appropriately with long-term thinking to the crises that have already occurred, so why would that change? We have already experienced the early stages of collapse; collapse is not just some future possibility."<br><br>I then exercised restraint and changed the subject, recognizing that differences of opinion on these matters are mythological in nature.<br><br>But the discussion did make me realize this: In order for people to argue that industrial collapse can be averted, they need to believe that it is something that could only occur in the future. But collapse is occurring now. There will never be a single point in time in which people will finally agree "this is the beginning." How can collapse be averted if it is already occurring??? Hence, denial often coincides with the belief that collapse is only a future possibility, not a present reality.<br><br><a href=#c8498255592708994036 title="comment permalink">8/22/14, 10:04 AM</a><br><br>

Why? Because hunting those large animals kept the young men of the clan and tribe occupied with something useful.<br><br>The solution? For a long while it was to get the young fellas a patch of land, a wife and some farm animals to keep their time and attention on something else useful, that is, farming and procreation. I know, that sounds patriarchal and oppressive and politically incorrect. But this is one view of events and maybe one with some validity. So don't shoot the messenger. <br><br>What has this got to do with anything? Hate to over-generalize, but it seems that there's a common thread here between the troubles of the Middle East and current troubles in America, that being large contingents of young men that are under-employed or unemployed and therefore unsuitable for marriage. Frustrated on multiple levels, nothing to do, nothing to lose and nothing to look forward to. And lots of time and energy for mayhem. <br><br>I know it's fashionable to scoff at history as bunk and boring and irrelevant. But I don't think it's overstretching facts to say that we've seen this recently and to say that it's been calamitous: German National Socialists that gave hungry and un-occupied young German men a uniform, a cause and something to do. And what did they do? They over-ran Europe and killed tens of millions. <br><br>It seems that various elites that have the most say in running things disregard longer term consequences and studiously disregard historical lessons especially when they conflict with shorter term interests. Violence and mayhem isn't an unavoidable outcome but hoping for the best isn't a viable strategy. <br><br>Neither is top-down funnelling of money ie income re-distribution social programs. It's an easy stop-gap but that's all it is because a young guy's self image and self esteem (yecch I hate that term but there I said it) comes from being useful with a wife and kids that look up to him as provider and protector. Take that role away from a large number of young men and you will have trouble. And, you know, I don't really care how retrograde that sounds.<br><br><a href=#c795647342490864880 title="comment permalink">8/22/14, 10:15 AM</a><br><br>

India won't just because they prefer to trade, the Chinese are playing a longer slower game so they won't for another few years (with luck a decade), and the Russians don't want to cross that line, yet. They will but they haven't. It's a slow build-up for them too. I have my own trip-wires that I'm checking from time-to-time.

I live in a sort of odd area--pockets of development, some of it very high end, mixed with small rural properties, some of them old and shabby. Lots of "horse property" which around here means 1-3 acres, usually expensive. We also have a couple of small, older trailer parks. I notice an increased number of people who travel by bike, gathering aluminum cans, using repurposed baby trailers to haul their belongings. We also have a food bank. Ten years ago I would have laughed at the idea of a food bank in this community. On the north side of Sacramento is Rio Linda, known to "Ditto Heads" as home of the dumb. My son informed me that he had met 2nd generation homeless there--living along the creeks and undeveloped land, in empty barns, etc. All of this in sight of the state capital. <br>BTW "Ditto Heads" are devoted fans of Rush Limbaugh, who got his start on the local talk radio station back in the early 80s.<br><br><br><a href=#c6575012552601477226 title="comment permalink">8/22/14, 1:57 PM</a><br><br>

I've suggested that that's what makes building big stone pyramids and the like such a useful habit for ancient societies -- the pyramids of Egypt weren't built by slaves, but by work teams of men who had nothing to do during the annual flooding of the Nile; there's even graffiti on building stones from this or that work team. On the other hand, yes, you can also harness that same energy to staff a private army of Brownshirts. <br><br>Ed-M, Bryan Ward-Perkins gutted that point of view in <i>The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization</i>, but I'm not surprised that it's still around. Thing is, if we had written records from straight through the Mycenean collapse, you could probably make an equivalent argument -- no, it wasn't a collapse, the Mycenean world was just taken over by the Dorians, and so on. It's only the lack of records that makes the difference seem so huge. <br><br>Bear, I have my doubts about that. The first stage of the operation, the one we're in now, wouldn't be to overthrow the US government -- it would be to stir up trouble, spread disaffection, push a loss of legitimacy, and trigger the occasional local crisis so that the strategy and tactics of US and local government forces could be sussed out in advance. Gradually, as the project matures, larger crises could be arranged, or ones that spring up manipulated, always probing for vulnerabilities -- especially at times when the US is already committed to overseas crises. When the final push comes might not be decided until the last minute. Check out Sun Tsu, if you're not familiar with him, and the strategy is pretty clear. <br><br>Queenie, wait until they start insisting that the fundamentals are sound.

The fact of peak oil had been impressed on me during my time in high school. I had evidence of the fact that renewable resources were being abused in front of me being raised in a lumber camp in a rural, mountainous county. A slice of log about eight feet in diameter being on display in front of the local forestry station was considered noteworthy because the 'old growth' that was left then was only four feet in diameter. What little they haul out now is closer to half that.<br><br>The problem in the 70's was that peak oil was such an uncomfortable subject that American society had an infantile reaction to the thought of making do with less. 'We,' being so full of ourselves, just couldn't wrap our minds around being mature in regard to our environment. Eisenhower was right, we didn't pay attention to our Military/Industrial complex and our current situation is the result.

Occasionally, I use 'Turtle Island', generally to be provocative ;-)<br><br>To put the boot on the other foot, whilst I was in Latin America, I was amazed at how interested everyone was in European affairs - everyone was talking about the EU.... it was only when I came across my first instance of 'EEUU' that I awarded myself the Grand Order of the Facepalm.<br><br><a href=#c6600796224710973849 title="comment permalink">8/23/14, 4:18 AM</a><br><br>

Some are surprised to learn that American English has evolved more slowly than British English. This, however, is typical of what happens to the language of a people who become separated from the language's core speakers--the language of the separated group becomes more conservative in its evolution. Icelandic is the premier example of this phenomenon, virtually unchanged even today from the language of the Vikings of a millennium ago.<br><br>Another example of the more conservative nature of American English is the persistence of word "gotten" as a past participle of "to get." And American pronunciations tend to be closer to those of the 17th century Jacobean era than are current British pronunciations, the British language having since that time gone through a second round of vowel shifting that the American language didn't participate in. (Note, for example, the different British and American pronunciations of words like "half." The first vowel shift, called the Great Vowel Shift, occurred in the 15th century, separating Middle English from Early Modern English.)<br><br>@Adrian--I just reserved a copy of <i>Braiding Sweetgrass</i> from our library. <br><br>I also dusted off my copy of Odum.

I don't do near as much to be an apprentice Green Wizard as I would like, but I maintain a couple large gardens, am learning to fix bikes, and and making gradual inroads learning to converse constructively with people about their experiences of decline. The trick is to draw out their own native terminology and narratives and to work with in them, rather than forcing another terminology and narrative into the conversation (even if we have access to such useful stories by way of Greer and the rest of this online discussion.) Mostly I wish I had some more stability in life so that my more ambitious Green Wizard projects could find a safe home (too many already have been lost to moves and abandoned by instability)<br><br>As for weed, porn, and video games I have in the past tried all three vices to deal with boredom and lack of direction, they are each of them effective in keeping ones energy dispersed (and therefore society safe) for a brief time; but they do not make for happiness. Video Games come closest because their is such a good simulation of achievement in those games and it can seem so real for so long. Over time the dose to maintain the numbing effects increases, fortunately for society but that time the 'young male' in question isn't very dangerous or capable by then.<br><br>Mr. Bear, I understand that my generation is not well, and even in my poverty and limited function I still find myself looking down on my peers for their addictions to the techniques you describe. But please, do not say such things! Every day as I try to live a tiny bit more sustainability I am mocked by Baby Consumers about how I am fated to do as they did and "not sell out, but buy in.". Should I get a job? Most jobs I can buy into are in the business of hurting my legacy. I earn some money gardening, enough to survive, and in my free time I study, so the life of the mind at least can continue to grow.<br><br>Roger is simplifying things too far I agree, but such is conversation. For example a wife and kids are low on my priorities because I cannot expect to give children a good life, and I am waiting patiently for a woman who is powerful and inspirational, I meet such women from time to time, but still they are rare. And Roger is right on one thing, if the young (those younger than I especially) are not given a constructive source of inspiration, they will become increasingly receptive to destructive sources of inspiration and will keep listening to music about fighting the society, and start enacting it too.<br><br>I petition the more aged ones who read this, do not treat young men like animals, because you do not want the result of that behavior. Animal drives are not just pleasure seeking, they also seek power, and achievement. <br><br>Treat them like men, and give them the power to do good things for love. This is the best thing in life. If you are not empowering pro-social behavior you are letting the seeds of anti-social or non-social behaviors germinate with out competition.<br><br><a href=#c923225486012762602 title="comment permalink">8/23/14, 8:50 AM</a><br><br>

They would like America to have a "strong Leader" like Putin who would do to Wall Street oligarchs what Putin did to Khodorkovsky, oppose gay rights and stand up for "family values" Putin's brutal effectiveness in crushing the jihadi insurgency in Chechnya without "pussy footing around" and letting human rights get in the way probably appeals too. <br><br>It's not just an American problem but a European one as well. There is deep concern among some liberal journalists in Britain that Russian propaganda is effectively creating a "conservative and reactionary international" across large parts of Europe by appealing to our cultural conservatives. Many Europeans are alienated from the EU the way Americans are from Washington. Whatever Washington's faults it's infinitely more democratic than the Brussels insitutions. There's a feeling that a corrupt elite of bankers corporatists and corrupt politicians are destroying democracy and livelihoods across Europe because of the disastrous way the Euro was set up and the Eurozone crisis handled. Add to that the culture war in parts of Eastern Europe against Western values such as gay rights and you have a combustible mix. <br><br>When the French president Hollande, who is hugely unpopular in France, introduced gay marriage there was a massive demonstration against it uniting Muslims and the National Front. RT filmed it and when the demonstrators spotted the RT reporters they started chanting La Russie avec nous! La Russie avec nous! Russia with us! Russia with us! <br><br>Russia is scoring points in the battle for Urkaine as well. It has retaliated against the EU sanctions by sanctioning EU food exports to Russia which is seriously hurting European farmers. The US-EU intervention in Ukraine is hurting Europe a lot more than it's hurting the US. The Polish government may aspire to help "liberate" Ukraine from the Russian bear but Polish farmers now can't sell their apples. Which is more important if you're a Polish farmer - the geopolitical ambitions of your politicians or whether you can pay the bills? <br><br>Putin and his merry band may not be nice people but they're quite capable of punishing Western hubris.<br><br><a href=#c381142786589366594 title="comment permalink">8/23/14, 10:47 AM</a><br><br>

I'm using the term Yankee to imply both of its pejorative senses, the pejorative that Southerners use towards Northerners, as well as the pejorative that people in other countries use towards Americans and the US. For wasn't the South the Yankees 1st conquest, where it developed its protoimperial model that it then exported around the world? It's a shame that people can't find any better use of the Southern experience than as a scapegoat for the nation's racism, because the South was/is: feudal, non-progressive, agrarian, non-industrial, had a stable class system/structure. In short, it was the only alternative to the Yankee industrial capitalist progressive juggernaut with enough power to launch a war against it and, even after the loss of the Civil War/Reconstruction, maintained a culture that remained decidedly distinct up until the late 20th century. As the US goes in to terminal decline, it's a shame that Yankees can't find any other use for the South except as racial scapegoat, since the South is the only alternative in the US to the progressive, City on the Hill myth, having lost a War, gone through Reconstruction, suffered poverty, and actually struggled to come to terms with its racial past. Really, is the New South of the late 20th century, whereby the South was remade in Yankee/capitalist fashion any better than the Old South it replaced? Is remaking Southern race relations in Yankee fashion, frosted in a layer of hypocrisy and dishonesty, an improvement? I would say that tradtional Southern race relations are Yankee race relations, without the hypocrisy and dishonesty--I've met far too many African-Americans who have told me they prefer the upfront racism of the South to Yankee knife in the back racism, and have said that white people outside the South are no different than white people in the South. At least the South doesn't try to cover up and pretend like it never had slavery, like the Yankee states do (most Yankee states did not abolish slavery until 20-30 years before the Civil War) The story and history of the South has a lot to teach the US about decline and living with the negative consequences of the past.<br>Regarding Putin and Russia, I see him as very much a mixed bag, I really admire his ability to run circles around the West and the US diplomatically, and I don't automatically associate him with Stalin and the Soviets, and I think to automatically assume that he will do to Europe what the Soviets did if given the chance/opportunity is an error of judgement. Certainly, the gloves MAY come off in the future, but Russia does seem to be undergoing a renaissance of sorts, and present-day Russia does seem to be different than Soviet Russia. I can understand how citizens of the former Warsaw Pact countries feel towards Russia, but I'm still not certain that Putin will recreate the Soviet experience. I'm not naive regarding Putin, but I'm also willing to say he's different than previous Russian leaders, as well.<br><br><a href=#c8583712166552824323 title="comment permalink">8/23/14, 1:21 PM</a><br><br>

Thank you all for continually broadening my perspective, and to JMG of course for setting and steering the conversation.<br><br>I live in Northern California "farm country", sounds like I am pretty close to Rita. We have solar panels that produce an amount of electricity almost equal to what we use over the course of the year, though we are grid-tied, so basically use the grid as our battery bank. The pricing system is tricky to figure out, with different rates based on how much you use (lower tiers of usage are cheaper than upper tiers), season, overall demand on the system/time of day… I begin to suspect that these are all fudge factors which allow the utility to charge as much as they think they can get away with. Twice in the past few years the people in my area have gotten mysterious rebate checks for periods up to six months in the past; I am guessing that the utility got caught overcharging and was threatened with a lawsuit/bad PR unless it returned some of the cookies to the jar. Anyway, based on what I could figure out from my cryptic yearly "true up" statement from the utility, it appears that the lower tiers of usage run around 13 cents per kWh, and the highest tier that we ever purchase from (in January, when our solar production is lowest) run around 23 cents. I think I recall from some earlier investigations into time-of-usage metering (an optional pricing scheme that consumers can sign up for to "reward" them for avoiding peak time usage) that the highest tiers can reach into the 40+ cents/kWh range. I don't know how these prices compare with other areas of the world, but I am quite sure that they are artificially low, since the true costs of electricity generation are no doubt still very externalized. In CA in particular, it's possible that some of the environmental costs of actually burning whatever fuel is used in the big plants are figured into the price tag, because of our relatively stronger environmental lobby, but surely the people in whatever regions are devastated to produce the fuels are not seeing the dividends of those taxes on the utilities.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c3812642956982774058 title="comment permalink">8/24/14, 8:25 AM</a><br><br>

But we are seeing the time when the farms are not easily available, and those jobs that are available don't fit the "productive purpose" part of the need. Yes, weed, games, porn all serve to dissipate that drive for purpose and numb the meaninglessness. So, I think, does joining the contemporary rat race in whatever capacity one can. My anguish is that we (as a society) cannot afford to waste that energy and drive. It's just as bad as wantonly burning fossil fuels. There are so many real needs in our changing world (which I salute Ray for finding the courage to address in his life, rather than numbing out with games or drugs or by putting on a necktie or a service-industry uniform and joining the consumer rush). The older generations, en masse, aren't going to address the changes we need to make to survive in a declining world if they can avoid them by any means. So those of us from those older generations who do have a clue (I include myself here, having just turned 40 and hearing the truth from JMG on a regular basis) need to find the way to offer opportunities to Ray, as he is asking for, and others in his position. We hear in this forum regularly from others in Ray's age group with his awareness. There must be many more "out there".

But in my life, I know a smart, lovely young 20-something, a former babysitter for my children, who is currently adrift, working two waitressing jobs and searching for meaning. I can't fix life for her- what a ridiculous, presumptuous thought- but I can hire her for a couple of afternoons to help me put up my bumper crop of peaches, and pay her to help me organize the garden curriculum at my kids' school for a few hours, and look for other ways to offer mentorship in what skills and opportunities I do have. And I can talk, and listen to her, about the future as we each see it. I can offer her some sense that it's not "just her", and as the opportunity presents itself, I can talk about how I am finding meaning in an environment of decline. This may not be much, and I hope my efforts won't be patronizing- given my relationship with the young woman, I think they would be OK- but it's the offering I can think to make, right now, to the generation whose prospects are so screwed and whose potential our society is swilling just like light sweet crude. I challenge everyone reading this who has anything at all they can offer to young people looking for meaning and opportunity to find a way to engage. Get past the discomfort of the generation gap, get over your preconceptions, and make an offering. If the first one doesn't "take", make another, and keep trying. It's the least we can do.<br><br><a href=#c663074583755418657 title="comment permalink">8/24/14, 8:26 AM</a><br><br>

Their main goal is to manipulate prices of commodities and gold lower and to prop up the bond, stock and real estate markets. This manipulation is done to try to maintain consumption by average folk and to contribute to the Keynesian wealth effect, whereby they believe that if consumers think they are wealthy then they will spend, which then stimulates the economy to "produce" more and people actually will be wealthier. And the economy will grow as well.<br><br>Unfortunately, for reasons we are all familiar with here, that strategy won't work. But if the Fed is pushing oil price artificially low, then what is there to stop oil shortages from happening? There is only a few weeks' worth of above ground supplies. The answer to this is in part their low interest rate Wall Street ponzi schemes that fuel the kinds of unprofitabe unsustainable booms like the tight "shale" oil. This is why I think this bubble may go on for a bit longer than many think, since the artificial oil production there is crucial to the Fed's strategy. I envision them stepping in and doing whatever it takes to keep the wells going.<br><br>Basically, the Fed tries to do everything it can to manipulate markets to make it easier to both consume and to "produce" stuff, which is having the disastrous result of draining the world of its resources without prices reflecting this shortage, which is what prices are supposed to do. The other way it maintains supply is of course through its overseas dealings with Saudi Arabia and other sympathetic petro states.<br><br>This is why I think that when the whole financial bubble pops and the dollar dies, it is going to be a much faster and much worse collapse than many people imagine. The reality that has been hidden for decades, i.e. that the US in particular and the world in general is running really low on oil, will be laid bare.<br><br><a href=#c1097238171316759008 title="comment permalink">8/24/14, 1:21 PM</a><br><br>

Sorry for the length).<br><br>1. The general failure of crops in Europe starting in 536, due to a decade-long spell of global cooling (likely cause by an volcanic eruptions in SE Asia). Confirmed by tree ring and pond sediment evidence, the entire northern hemisphere experienced the sharpest cooling episode that can be found in tree-rings (meaning ~2000 years). The effect on human populations was as profoundly tragic as Europe's Great Famine of 1315-1318. (Byzantium itself was less affected because of its still-extensive trade networks---grain crops in Byzantine-controlled Egypt would have been scarcely affected.)<br><br>2. Yes, the Gothic Wars (c 535-553). With an army of no more that 20,000 imperial troops and maybe equal numbers of German and Italian allies, Belisarius took vast stretches of North Africa, Spain and Italy, all while Byzantine resources were predominately devoted to the Sassinid wars in the east, or preoccupied with even more pressing domestic matters, such as:<br><br>3. The badly-named Plague of Justinian (starting 541): the first global outbreak of bubonic plague. Whole areas of the world (from China to Europe to India to Africa) were depopulated. For a variety of reasons, the effects were likely worse than that of the Black Death (circa 1347). Census records of Byzantium show its empire had a population of ~26 million in 540, and under 17 million in 600. The human devastation of this event and its historical consequences (which I won't go into) can hardly be overstated.<br><br>4. Invasion by Allemanni Franks (starting spring 553). From the north came an army of maybe 75,000 Germans, lead by brothers Leutharus and Buccelin (notice the bastardized Roman names). Compared to the disciplined Roman troops (who did plenty of damage on their own), these would have seemed like a mass of axe-wielding maniacs. Nominally called in by desperate Goth leaders to fight Romans, their only real war aim was loot and the personal aggrandizement of its leaders. They did fight Romans (and lost despite vastly superior numbers), but apparently saw little value in respecting the lives or property of anyone in Italy, ally or foe.<br><br>5. Invasion of the Lombards (starting 563). Meeting little resistance in depopulated Italy (see points 1-4), they marched south, not in a military invasion, but in one of Late Antiquity's final migration-of-peoples episodes. This was not some kind of occupation---their aim was not to change governments but to settle. If you think they were likely to value peaceful coexistence with the locals (at least at first, before their taxation infrastructure was developed), then you should review some of the history of the period. This invasion was significant, in part, because unlike previous German autarks who basically co-opted the existing (though decaying) Roman infrastructure (tax collectors, administrative divisions, bureaucrats), the Lombards either found this in such disarray as to be unusable, or maybe just had no more respect for ancient Roman power and preferred to use their own systems. In any case they eliminated the remnant Roman bureaucracy and established their own systems of administration, and finally buried the corpse of Roman law and custom within their domains (though Byzantium retained some Italian territories for centuries).<br><br><a href=#c5239968356542747841 title="comment permalink">8/24/14, 5:18 PM</a><br><br>

You can buy a light trailer from Harbor Freight, if you have them where you are. I don't have the address but you could search on facebook for a site where a couple built several for camping. (Also search for Vardo.) They're light enough for him to move them around without any mechanized help. I imagine it might be quite a workout but in theory anyway you could pull it with your bike if you wanted to move it.<br><br>Or if you feel really ambitious or flush a micro house on wheels? Around here I've seen an old camp trailer frame, in good shape, complete with axles and wheels for $500. It would behoove you to rent or buy a car or truck heavy enough to tow it just to move it or relocate to a different area. I know it sounds like a big investment but it would be better than just a sleeping bag on the cold ground. With a couple of heavy duty hinges you could build a porch that folds up against the front door for traveling but rests on the tongue when it's parked. The house itself could be built for storage of tools, small parts or anything else you want to take with you as well as provide a place to do some work out of the weather.<br><br><br>@ Ursachi, You might want to tell your friends to keep American politicians, lawyers, Corporate execs and Elves in the same group when dealing with them. Keep your hand on your wallet, especially when you shake hands with them and leaven their promises with a forty pound livestock salt block when negotiating with them. (Because they won't say what they mean!) Check your fingers too, make sure they're all still there! This is from someone with some American Indian ancestry, so I know whereof I speak!<br><br><br>Wadulisi<br><br><a href=#c490649617300805337 title="comment permalink">8/24/14, 8:16 PM</a><br><br>

The South particularly was focused both culturally and economically on Britain, and the academic and literary elites of the Eastern establishment were particularly focused on Britain, so as British English changed, for example, becoming non rhotic, these changes were reflected more in Southern and Northeastern dialects (hah-vahd, for example) while Midwestern English retained the rhotic sound (har-vard) So Midwestern is the older, more archaic form, less influenced by changes in pronunciation in Britain. Of course, 100 years of standardization of Midwestern by mass media, and the prestige that accent caries in the U.S. have gone a long way to reverse regional accents elsewhere. I've read that the northern Midwestern accent of Minnesota is the least changed of any accent over time.<br>@Janet<br>I read when the 2000 census came out that southern cities were the least segregated. They did this by comparing racial composition by zip code, determining how many people would have to move from one zip to another to balance out the segregation. The most segregated cities were in the Great Lakes area, I believe. Not sure if the same study was performed after the 2010 census, and if it showed changes. The point I was making was that the Southern experience and history has a lot to teach us in an age of decline and collapse, and it can be a window in our own country about the misguided effects of our own imperial blunders trying to remake the world in our image, but to do so requires setting aside the straw man, scapegoat South, and taking a nuanced, objective view.<br><br><a href=#c824703482055317403 title="comment permalink">8/24/14, 8:30 PM</a><br><br>

The hype is still going here in the UK, with examples such as this http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/fracking-uk-sustainable-energy-market although admittedly this was from a few months ago. I have some concerns that companies and investors will buy into fracking in the UK as having supposed potential to produce lots of gas &amp; make lots of money whilst improving our energy security https://uk.news.yahoo.com/fracking-boom-insulate-europe-against-cold-war-095237109.html#ZnzaUmt keep the lights on http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/get-fracking-mps-back-the-dash-for-uks-shale-gas-8676040.html whilst making gas cheaper for consumers and creating much needed jobs. All the major political parties in the UK are pro-fracking, so there is little likelihood of a change of government policy on fracking, even if the next general election in 2015 results in a change of Government. The 14th Licensing round has just opened for applications for licenses for areas in 60% of Britain for potential fracking http://www.insideenergyandenvironment.com/2014/07/uk-parliament-announces-the-14th-landward-licensing-round/<br><br>The industry is still small in the UK and is facing stiff opposition wherever it goes. But the companies involved and their pals in the Government are trying every trick in the book to force this toxic unsustainable industry on the country including weasel-worded planning applications, bribes to local communities and heavy-handed policing against activists using direct action to slow down operations at fracking sites.<br><br>Campaigners are fighting on multiple fronts against fracking and other extreme fossil fuel extraction methods such as coal-bed methane and underground coal gasification which are being used or proposed in the UK. Our principal targets are local authorities which have the powers to grant or deny planning applications and investors, the more we can delay the industry and increase costs for even exploratory operations to less attractive the industry is going to be to investors.<br><br>The industry does seem to be on the back foot here in the UK with even the more right wing papers publishing critical articles about the effects on the environment, on house prices and on the risky nature of investments in fracking &amp; fossil-fuels generally.<br><br>So I hope the bubble bursts soon and hard and that it will stop this toxic industry from contaminating any more water supplies. I accept the knock-on longer-term effects on the economy will not be good and will make my position as a public sector employee in community health services more precarious. But I and my husband are pursuing our own personal divestment campaign by gradually switching how we live to sustainable home produced resources as much as possible as well as engaging with campaigning work to alert our local and spiritual communities to the dangers of extreme fossil-fuel extraction and the need to change how we live to use less energy in the first instance and change where that energy comes from in the second instance.<br><br><a href=#c3911520436316029073 title="comment permalink">8/25/14, 1:11 PM</a><br><br>

Not so anymore!<br><br>It wasn't being woken up that has left me grumpy either.<br><br>It is hard to explain my grumpiness, but there are now apex predators here both during the day and now at night. A masked owl can be half a metre tall (20 inches)! They're big and before the past couple of weeks, I've never heard that call here before. The birds are listed as vulnerable too.<br><br>My grumpiness is just I can't go to the local council and say: "hey, things are on the up here, so frack off and leave me alone to get on with the job - it seems to be working". Putting together an ecological management plan would be massively expensive and probably unlikely to succeed. The rules about land management here are ideologically driven and are completely failing to fit the facts on the ground.<br><br>The rules basically say: do nothing. The reason for the do nothing approach is because it is cheap and forces the costs onto both the community and insurance companies. The result of doing nothing has happened before many times and it results in wildfires which change animal and bird populations as well losing habitat. Birds and animals only live in and on the older larger trees here. <br><br>Honestly, sometimes I feel that the local government people work in climate controlled offices, mostly live in town and cruise around in brand new vehicles all of which I'm paying for through the rates system. However, to challenge them is like an energy sink, that they're both well prepared and well resourced for.

It is uncomfortable that I am in a situation where ask help from people while rejecting their attempts to guide me back into the fold. I do receive much support from various parts of the community, my garden space from the Haas family is especially valued. My bitterness is squarely targeted at those who want me to get back on the Titanic.<br><br>@Nastarana &amp; Redneck Girl - Basic tool maintenance is something I have a fairly good grasp on, the next step is to get a sharpening kit I can keep safe in a bike vardo maybe :) . I am also going to try learning some more domestic skills this winter to be a more welcome house guest. Putting myself out there is the thing I find most difficult, it is amazing how isolating not having a cell can be, maybe I should make cards or the like. <br><br>As for winter sowing, I have a lot of windows I am thinking about turning into some mini green houses. I made an excellent one last year for a retired couple, they had me over for dinner a couple times for that. I have not done much green house work yet because that requires stabulity, which is the most difficult thing; there are farms I help some times where I work in their green houses to learn the skill even if I don't feel ready to care for a whole life phase of such little plants.<br><br>@RPC - Boomers are concerned about the job market, aren't we all, but the dispute I have run into is on a different point. I think it is wounded idealism I see, especially because the individuals I have been taking to are very far from threatened by me for a job, the issue is that I am not interested in competing for their jobs or their life styles. "Eventually you will want a family, wife and kids, and you will buy in, not sell out, buy in." - paraphrased from several different conversations.<br><br>@all- concerning the distractions: I think that we should also be careful not to judge too harshly. I prepared some of this reply at a millennial friends house. He smokes quite a bit, and is a skilled craft man whose job is relatively sustainable and he is obsessed about the childrens cartoon Avatar the last Air Bender.

An old RV or Bus isn't exactly up for that. True, a diesel engine will last almost forever if it's taken care of and they are generally really good on fuel mileage but they have a big carbon foot print. (I should know, I have driven school bus! From full size down to a van.) Besides a used RV or bus is extra time from what Ray is doing, I'm not sure if he would want to spend that much time in maintenance and money.

My education was focused along technical lines, the reading I've done since has been mostly work/professionally oriented. Which is a round-about way of saying I'm not well read. <br><br>Having said that, I have done SOME reading as time allowed. And I've had a long career that taught me things about people and the world. And one of those things is that human behavior is highly variable from one individual to the next and one society to the next. To my knowledge the sociological realm has never reduced the actions of individuals to equations the way that Dirac did with sub-atomic particles. Nor, for social groups the way that Einstein did with celestial bodies. Which is a very roundabout way of saying that you make a very good point. <br><br>I agree with both you and JMG: it's complicated. Human behavior resists being boxed and systemized. Circumstances and attitudes and societies change and what theory of behavior applies in one period in history to one group of people may not apply to other groups or other times. As exiledbear pointed out, there's a sizable contingent of young men happy to piddle away their lives in front of computer screens. No abyss of rage and despair for them. <br><br>Now, having said all THAT, I think that though the theory about society's needing to occupy young men's energies with work, wife and kids may not always apply, there's been events in history that suggest that a surplus of un-occupied young men became a menace. Could the anti-dote have been societal building projects as JMG suggests or something as simple as a patch of land and domestic bliss (which isn't necessarly so simple but does occupy a lot of effort)? In any case, first and foremost is the need to make a living. In the absence of a way to get the necessities of life, things can get nasty real quick. <br><br>But it's easy to over- interpret or mis-interpret. We see events and see causal connections whether they're actually there or not. So what caused the many headed throng to come thundering out of Asia on their shaggy horses in late antiquity? What caused the Vikings to go viking?<br><br><a href=#c2860269090501091081 title="comment permalink">8/26/14, 10:10 AM</a><br><br>

Maybe there's a tie in between the discussion about Ferguson and his upcoming post on ethnic shredding and reconfiguration in dark ages.

I have also served.<br><br>And I agree with you when you say, "... really improve things in Ferguson and the rest of the world is if people just grow up. What should happen is that the white people should stand up with the minorities and very loudly protest the injustices. That - only that would calm the minority populations down - unity in the pursuit of freedom and justice. That is the only mature reaction...." - wolfvanzandt -<br><br>Totally agree concerning unity in pursuit of freedom and justice!<br><br>So you and I have worked for freedom. Good for us, right?<br>And justice? Sure thing. Have you ever served on a jury, wolfvanz?<br>I get the feeling that you and I could work together on a jury to find justice. We might came at it from different angles, but we could find justice - even in this contentious case that JMG referenced in Ferguson, MO.<br><br>At least neither you nor I has uttered a prejudicial statement on the Ferguson case - at least not into the digital record here at the ADR this week. <br><br>JMG, now - maybe not so much. Based on what you've said here, JMG, you could NOT fairly serve on that jury. You have reached a verdict, based on your own life experiences - the cop is already guilty in the JMG digital courtroom (err, living room), - - signed, sealed, delivered - judge, jury, executioner??<br><br>Anyway - someone might now write in to defend JMG, but there's no need. This is not an attack. The man has stated his opinion and that is that. No problem. Just don't believe if you think to defend our host on this topic that you are necessarily impartial or accurate.<br><br>But the idea that your readers will defend you, JMG, takes us to the tribal nature of the internet, and thus to the tribal nature of life. You have 250,000 unique page views per month, but only elicit 250+/- comments every week? That's very interesting. From this raw data, you have only ONE commenter for every 250 readers. That's an amazing statistic, and it means your commenters are a rarified subset of a rarified subset indeed. Internet behavior would make a fascinating research topic.<br><br>And the tribal nature of life, you ask? All humans have the potential for tribalism, which potential can be exacerbated by social stress. Is Ferguson a canary in this coal mine? If so - what does this tell us?<br><br>Along with peak oil, and peak everything else - are we reaching, or have we already passed, "peak social trust."<br><br><a href=#c7911477466065635876 title="comment permalink">8/26/14, 8:15 PM</a><br><br>

The local government is all white, and the population they feed off of is black - and some poor whites and Hispanics. Enough of their population is effectively disenfranchised by criminal records and the like that change by voting is virtually impossible. Even if it were possible, it's all in who counts the votes that holds the power - and that's the current white power structure. They're not likely to allow meaningful change. Between 25% to 50% of the governmental income in these places comes from fines, fees, and court costs levied on the people who live there who can't afford a lawyer - the government chooses the people who are least likely to be able to put up any fight in court to hit with traffic tickets and other lucrative misdemeanor charges. The municipal court in Ferguson, for example, "heard" slightly over 12,000 cases in 108 hours of court time last year. That's a bit under 120 cases per hour, or roughly 30 seconds per case. If defendants are represented by counsel, that 30 seconds would go up to at least 5 minutes... or more, especially if a "not guilty" plea is entered, so that court is a sham. The same holds for a lot of the other municipalities in that area. The police forces are of course well armed and brutal, which keeps the population subjugated. So far, there's been no armed resistance of any sort beyond the rioting that's been seen over the past few weeks.<br><br>If the people there decide to start shooting back with effect, then that would be a game changer, but that hasn't been seen so far. It's really not the sort of thing to wish for, either, given the fact that urban St Louis and the wealthy close-in suburbs are within blocks of extremely poor black ghettos - look up "Delmar Divide" on Google, or look at the neighborhoods on the south of Delmar Boulevard as opposed to the neighborhoods on the north side - there are multimillion dollar homes within 100 yards of slums.<br><br><a href=#c1079359806265273048 title="comment permalink">8/27/14, 2:58 AM</a><br><br>

The deal is likely to face strong objections from Republicans on Capitol Hill and from poor countries around the world, but negotiators say it may be the only realistic path.</i><br><br>Not trying to get political, but this is possibly how it would look when/if someone is power tries to get some movement on dealing with climate change/peak oil, in a situation of much denial - it would seem to be political suicide, so it has to be in a lame-duck period... it's probably got a snowball's chance in Hell... but we may see similar sporatic attempts as the situation gets more clear and in our faces.<br><br>On another topic,Cherokee said: <i>The dirty little secret is that an escalation culture is only possible when you have more energy to expend on an issue than your opponent.</i> <br>And this is clearly true on an individual level also – corporations swinging elections, and even battles between individuals – if one has the power/energy to overwhelm the opposition, that is usually the first choice, even when there are other options… and thus, as energy for all of us declines, there might come a change in the way Americans are used to settling disputes.
