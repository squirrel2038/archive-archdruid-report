One of the factors that makes it difficult to think through the economic consequences of the end of the industrial age is that we’ve all grown up in a world where every form of economic activity has been channeled through certain familiar forms for so long that very few people remember that things could be any other way. Another of the factors that make the same effort of thinking difficult is that the conventional economic thought of our time has invested immense effort and oceans of verbiage into obscuring the fact that things could be any other way. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those are formidable obstacles. We’re going to have to confront them, though, because one of the core features of the decline and fall of civilizations is that most of the habits of everyday life that are standard practice when civilizations are at zenith get chucked promptly into the recycle bin as decline picks up speed. That’s true across the whole spectrum of cultural phenomena, and it’s especially true of economics, for a reason discussed in <a href=../../2014/10/dark-age-america-involuntary-simplicity.html>last week’s post</a>: the economic institutions and habits of a civilization in full flower are too complex for the same civilization to support once it’s gone to seed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The institutions and habits that contemporary industrial civilization uses to structure its economic life comprise that tangled realm of supposedly voluntary exchanges we call “the market.” Back when the United States was still contending with the Soviet Union for global hegemony, that almost always got rephrased as “the free market;” the adjective still gets some use among ideologues, but by and large it’s dropped out of use elsewhere. This is a good thing, at least from the perspective of honest speaking, because the “free” market is of course nothing of the kind. It’s unfree in at least two crucial senses: first, in that it’s compulsory; second, in that it’s expensive.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The law in its majestic equality,” Anatole France once noted drolly, “forbids rich and poor alike to urinate in public, sleep under bridges, or beg for bread.” In much the same sense, no one is actually forced to participate in the market economy in the modern industrial world. Those who want to abstain are perfectly free to go looking for some other way to keep themselves fed, clothed, housed, and supplied with the other necessities of life, and the fact that every option outside of the market has been hedged around with impenetrable legal prohibitions if it hasn’t simply been annihilated by legal fiat or brute force is just one of those minor details that make life so interesting. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Historically speaking, there are a vast number of ways to handle exchanges of goods and services between people. In modern industrial societies, on the other hand, outside of the occasional vestige of an older tradition here and there, there’s only one. Exchanging some form of labor for money, on whatever terms an employer chooses to offer, and then exchanging money for goods and services, on whatever terms the seller chooses to offer, is the only game in town. There’s nothing free about either exchange, other than the aforesaid freedom to starve in the gutter. The further up you go in the social hierarchy, to be sure, the less burdensome the conditions on the exchanges generally turn out to be—here as elsewhere, privilege has its advantages—but unless you happen to have inherited wealth or can find some other way to parasitize the market economy without having to sell your own labor, you’re going to participate if you like to eat. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Your participation in the market, furthermore, doesn’t come cheap. Every exchange you make, whether it’s selling your labor or buying goods and services with the proceeds, takes place within a system that has been subjected to the process of intermediation discussed in last week’s post. Thus, in most cases, you can’t simply sell your labor directly to individuals who want to buy it or its products; instead, you are expected to sell your labor to an employer, who then sells it or its product to others, gives you part of the proceeds, and pockets the rest. Plenty of other people are lined up for their share of the value of your labor: bankers, landlords, government officials, and the list goes on. When you go to exchange money for goods and services, the same principle applies; how much of the value of your labor you get to keep for your own purposes varies from case to case, but it’s always less than the whole sum, and sometimes a great deal less. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Karl Marx performed a valuable service to political economy by pointing out these facts and giving them the stress they deserve, in the teeth of savage opposition from the cheerleaders of the status quo who, then as now, dominated economic thought. His proposed solution to the pervasive problems of the (un)free market was another matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like most of his generation of European intellectuals, Marx was dazzled by the swamp-gas luminescence of Hegelian philosophy, and followed Hegel’s verbose and vaporous trail into a morass of circular reasoning and false prophecy from which few of his remaining followers have yet managed to extract themselves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s from Hegel that Marx got the enticing but mistaken notion that history consists of a sequence of stages that move in a predetermined direction toward some as-perfect-as-possible state: the same idea, please note, that Francis Fukuyama used to justify his risible vision of the first Bush administration as the glorious fulfillment of human history. (To borrow a bit of old-fashioned European political jargon, there are right-Hegelians and left-Hegelians; Fukuyama was an example of the former, Marx of the latter.) I’ll leave such claims and the theories founded on them to the true believers, alongside such equally plausible claims as the Singularity, the Rapture, and the lemonade oceans of Charles Fourier; what history itself shows is something rather different. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What history shows, as already noted, is that the complex systems that emerge during the heyday of a civilization are inevitably scrapped on the way back down. Market economies are among those complex systems. Not all civilizations have market economies—some develop other ways to handle the complicated process of allocating goods and services in a society with many different social classes and occupational specialties—but those that do set up market economies inevitably load them with as many intermediaries as the overall complexity of their economies can support. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s when decline sets in and maintaining the existing level of complexity becomes a problem that the trouble begins. Under some conditions, intermediation can benefit the productive economy, but in a complex economy, more and more of the intermediation over time amounts to finding ways to game the system, profiting off economic activity without actually providing any benefit to anyone else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A complex society at or after its zenith thus typically ends up with a huge burden of unproductive economic activity supported by an increasingly fragile foundation of productive activity. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All the intermediaries, the parasitic as well as the productive, expect to be maintained in the style to which they’re accustomed, and since they typically have more wealth and influence than the producers and consumers who support them, they can usually stop moves to block their access to the feed trough. Economic contraction, however, makes it hard to support business as usual on the shrinking supply of real wealth. The intermediaries thus end up competing with the actual producers and consumers of goods and services, and since the intermediaries typically have the support of governments and institutional forms, more often than not it’s the intermediaries who win that competition. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s not at all hard to see that process at work; all it takes is a stroll down the main street of the old red brick mill town where I live, or any of thousands of other towns and cities in today’s America. Here in Cumberland, there are empty storefronts all through downtown, and empty buildings well suited to any other kind of economic activity you care to name there and elsewhere in town. There are plenty of people who want to work, wage and benefit expectations are modest, and there are plenty of goods and services that people would buy if they had the chance. Yet the storefronts stay empty, the workers stay unemployed, the goods and services remain unavailable. Why? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The reason is intermediation. Start a business in this town, or anywhere else in America, and the intermediaries all come running to line up in front of you with their hands out. Local, state, and federal bureaucrats all want their cut; so do the bankers, the landlords, the construction firms, and so on down the long list of businesses that feed on other businesses, and can’t be dispensed with because this or that law or regulation requires them to be paid their share. The resulting burden is far too large for most businesses to meet. Thus businesses don’t get started, and those that do start up generally go under in short order. It’s the same problem faced by every parasite that becomes too successful: it kills the host on which its own survival depends. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the usual outcome when a heavily intermediated market economy slams face first into the hard realities of decline. Theoretically, it would be possible to respond to the resulting crisis by forcing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>disintermediation, and thus salvaging the market economy. Practically, that’s usually not an option, because the disintermediation requires dragging a great many influential economic and political sectors away from their accustomed feeding trough. Far more often than not, declining societies with heavily intermediated market economies respond to the crisis just described by trying to force the buyers and sellers of goods and services to participate in the market even at the cost of their own economic survival, so that some semblance of business as usual can proceed.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s why the late Roman Empire, for example, passed laws requiring that each male Roman citizen take up the same profession as his father, whether he could survive that way or not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s also why, as noted last week, so many American jurisdictions are cracking down on people who try to buy and sell food, medical care, and the like outside the corporate economy. In the Roman case, the attempt to keep the market economy fully intermediated ended up killing the market economy altogether, and in most of the post-Roman world—interestingly, this was as true across much of the Byzantine empire as it was in the barbarian west—the complex money-mediated market economy of the old Roman world went away, and centuries passed before anything of the kind reappeared. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What replaced it is what always replaces the complex economic systems of fallen civilizations: a system that systematically chucks the intermediaries out of economic activity and replaces them with personal commitments set up to block any attempt to game the system: that is to say, feudalism. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s enough confusion around that last word these days that a concrete example is probably needed here. I’ll borrow a minor character from a favorite book of my childhood, therefore, and introduce you to Higg son of Snell. His name could just as well be Michio, Chung-Wan, Devadatta, Hafiz, Diocles, Bel-Nasir-Apal, or Mentu-hetep, because the feudalisms that evolve in the wake of societal collapse are remarkably similar around the world and throughout time, but we’ll stick with Higg for now. On the off chance that the name hasn’t clued you in, Higg is a peasant—a free peasant, he’ll tell you with some pride, and <i>not</i> a mere serf; his father died a little while back of what people call “elf-stroke” in his time and we’ve shortened to “stroke” in ours, and he’s come in the best of his two woolen tunics to the court of the local baron to take part in the ceremony at the heart of the feudal system. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a verbal contract performed in the presence of witnesses: in this case, the baron, the village priest, a couple of elderly knights who serve the baron as advisers, and a gaggle of village elders who remember every detail of the local customary law with the verbal exactness common to learned people among the illiterate. Higg places his hands between the baron’s and repeats the traditional pledge of loyalty, coached as needed by the priest; the baron replies in equally formal words, and the two of them are bound for life in the relationship of liegeman to liege lord. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What this means in practice is anything but vague.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the baron’s man, Higg has the lifelong right to dwell in his father’s house and make use of the garden and pigpen; to farm a certain specified portion of the village farmland; to pasture one milch cow and its calf, one ox, and twelve sheep on the village commons; to gather, on fourteen specified saint’s days, as much wood as he can carry on his back in a single trip from the forest north of the village, but only limbwood and fallen wood; to catch two dozen adult rabbits from the warren on the near side of the stream, being strictly forbidden to catch any from the warren on the far side of the millpond; and, as a reward for a service his great-grandfather once performed for the baron’s great-grandfather during a boar hunt, to take anything that washes up on the weir across the stream between the first<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>sound of the matin bell and the last of the vespers bell on the day of St. Ethelfrith each year. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In exchange for these benefits, Higg is bound to an equally specific set of duties. He will labor in the baron’s fields, as well as his own and his neighbors, at seedtime and harvest; his son will help tend the baron’s cattle and sheep along with the rest of the village herd; he will give a tenth of his crop at harvest each year for the support of the village church; he will provide the baron with unpaid labor in the fields or on the great stone keep rising next to the old manorial hall for three weeks each year; if the baron goes to war, whether he’s staging a raid on the next barony over or answering the summons of that half-mythical being, the king, in the distant town of London, Higg will put on a leather jerkin and an old iron helmet, take a stout knife and the billhook he normally uses to harvest wood on those fourteen saint’s days, and follow the baron in the field for up to forty days. None of these benefits and duties are negotiable; all Higg’s paternal ancestors have held their land on these terms since time out of mind; each of his neighbors holds some equivalent set of feudal rights from the baron for some similar set of duties. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Higg has heard of markets. One is held annually every St. Audrey’s day at the king’s town of Norbury, twenty-seven miles away, but he’s never been there and may well never travel that far from home in his life. He also knows about money, and has even seen a silver penny once, but he will live out his entire life without ever buying or selling something for money, or engaging in any economic transaction governed by the law of supply and demand. Not until centuries later, when the feudal economy begins to break down and intermediaries once again begin to insert themselves between producer and consumer, will that change—and that’s precisely the point, because feudal economics is what emerges in a society that has learned about the dangers of intermediation the hard way and sets out to build an economy where that doesn’t happen. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are good reasons, in other words, why medieval European economic theory focused on the concept of the just price, which is not set by supply and demand, and why medieval European economic practice included a galaxy of carefully designed measures meant to prevent supply and demand from influencing prices, wages, or anything else. There are equally good reasons why lending money at interest was considered a sufficiently heinous sin in the Middle Ages that Dante, in <i>The Inferno</i>, put lenders at the bottom of the seventh circle of hell, below mass murderers, heretics, and fallen angels. The only sinners who go further down than lenders were the practitioners of fraud, in the eighth circle, and traitors, in the ninth: here again, this was a straightforward literary reflection of everyday reality in a society that depended on the sanctity of verbal contracts and the mutual personal obligations that structure feudal relationships. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
(It’s probably necessary at this point to note that yes, I’m quite aware that European feudalism had its downsides—that it was rigidly caste-bound, brutally violent, and generally unjust. So is the system under which you live, dear reader, and it’s worth noting that the average medieval peasant worked fewer hours and had more days off than you do. Medieval societies also valued stability or, as today’s economists like to call it, stagnation, rather than economic growth and technological progress; whether that’s a good thing or not probably ought to be left to be decided in the far future, when the long-term consequences of our system can be judged against the long-term consequences of Higg’s.)</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A fully developed feudal system takes several centuries to emerge. The first stirrings of one, however, begin to take shape as soon as people in a declining civilization start to realize that the economic system under which they live is stacked against them, and benefits, at their expense, whatever class of parasitic intermediaries their society happens to have spawned. That’s when people begin looking for ways to meet their own economic needs outside the existing system, and certain things reliably follow. The replacement of temporary economic transactions with enduring personal relationships is one of these; so is the primacy of farmland and other productive property to the economic system—this is why land and the like are still referred to legally as “real property,” as though all other forms of property are somehow unreal; in a feudal economy, that’s more or less the case.</div>
<br>
A third consequence of the shift of economic activity away from the institutions and forms of a failing civilization has already been mentioned: the abandonment of money as an abstract intermediary in economic activity. That’s a crucial element of the process, and it has even more crucial implications, but those are sweeping enough that the end of money will require a post of its own. We’ll discuss that next week.<br>

I love this topic! How our political, legal and economic institutions are a reflection of a particular set of affairs, in a particular state of a given society.<br><br>Just wondering if you've read 'the value of nothing' by Raj Patel? Granted most of what he covers has been covered in your blog. still though, he goes into real detail about the reforming of a market society to more simple economic arragements- whilst still preserving democracy. The example he uses is a really quite successful sounding experiment in democracy and simpler economic arrangements in the South of Mexico (I forget the province). Anyway, hopefully some societies around the world will manage the transition rather than reverting to plain feudalism.<br><br>You might be aware (or at least if you're in a British common law jurisdiction like New Zealand this is the case) that a small vestige of the feudal landholding system still lives on today. IN New Zealand and in other former British colonies all title to land is derived from the crown (in America is it just 'the people of the union or something?) an old feudal legacy of all title to land being granted by the king to the landlords and so on. Nowadays as a reflection of shifting social/economic circumstances property law reflects the desire to have land available to economic development. Here in New Zealand anyway, registration of title is everything, even in the case of fraud in a previous transfer of the land. Land law is entirely about abstract rights and security of title for economic development. you might as well think land were mere abstractions on a piece of paper, there for people to use with no reference to land being anything other than a plaything of humans.<br><br>Just a final thought, I wonder how much the advancement of the rights of indigenous persons will have on being able to break down the current economic and legal structures? again here in New Zealand (I think in Canada as well and in some other former British colonies) the common law doctrine of aboriginal title or customary law creates and instrument for indigenous persons to create and preserve community/ tribal based economic and legal relations, and at least up to a point, allows them to get round the intermediates. IN countries where indigenous populations are already setting up such simpler economic and legal arrangements i wonder if there might be some benefit to the non indigenous population? If they can in some way latch on to these indigenous community arrangements they might not have to completely start from scratch as the long descent gets underway. Anyway, just some of my musings.<br><br>Tom<br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c4683813263754737772 title="comment permalink">11/5/14, 4:39 PM</a><br><br>

Also they get a tax receipt for their donations, which equals money. <br><br>The donors preserve tremendous amounts of embodied energy which are contained in, for example, in an old American made cast iron enameled sink. <br><br>You can buy a new one of far lesser quality for 10 to 20 times as much at Home Depot, probably Chinese made junk, which sends the money out of town to Georgia. The Away Station at the lumberyard however keeps the money in the local economy where it circulates and re-circulates through the multiplier effect. If they don’t have it used, the hardware store right there, which is employee owned, also facilitates keeping money local. <br><br>Thus the debt-servicing mass retailer like Home Despot doesn’t get their cut.

FIRST will be a stratification of language into dialects for each social class. The rich will affect a high status accent and add words that display their birthright and their education. SECOND will be the different accents for different parts of the country, amplified into regional dialects and perhaps into separate languages such as Spanglish in the Southwest. Farming areas that now have many Spanish speakers may find they have an influence on future regional linguistic differences. THIRD would be the influence of home grown accents as a marker for a withdrawal from the culture at large. Would cults and conservative Christian groups try to bring back the language of the King James Bible to denote their reverence? Think of the Amish in the East holding on to a form of old German. FOURTH is the gradual evolution of language that eliminates complexity and simplifies endings, word agreements and pronunciations. Common spelling would be dropped in favor of local spelling that follows local pronunciations. Writing would no longer be taken for granted as most people would be illiterate. This may not take centuries to happen. Language commonality and easy communication across vast distances may cease.<br><br>Growing up, a boy might get a tutor if their parents are rich enough. Limited home schooling will become the norm for all classes depending on the family's wealth. Poor children would be expected to work all the time and not be interested in bookwork. The separation of education into boys learning and girls learning will be influence language evolution. Higher class boys will be trained to lead and manage estates. They will be trained in fighting with the restricted martial weapons and in the way of the sword as noblemen. We will see the establishment of a proto-samurai class. The girls will be only partially educated and married off to cement the relationships between the landed families. They might be trained to run a household, but never to run an estate. The differences between raising boys and girls will be stark and will follow forgotten traditions. Equal rights will be a distant memory along with a common education. Childhood will not exist.<br><br>A tiny middle class of craftsmen and knowledge workers will be sustained by apprentice systems that will develop isolated local terms. The use of unique words will be secreted and hidden from outsiders. Breaking into the guilds will be very difficult for the lower class, even if very talented. The knowledge workers of future popular entertainment, who are writing the current verse and song, will first attempt to satisfy their patrons and then perhaps chronicle the plight of the common folk singing out in the fields. The poor dirt slaves will be the bulk of society, living well beneath the salt. They will evolve their own dialects and language to reflect their dismal lives. They will be the untrained soldiers who fight for their landed masters and who die under the sword of the warrior class that supports the tyranny of the landholders. The warriors will cement the classes in place. They will understand different dialects and what the slobs at the bottom are saying. They will be the enforcers drawn from all walks of life and relying on their physical prowess to retain their positions. They will have their own language like the police of today. A mix of crude language, first used by the early emergence of the war bands will add to the warrior's tongue. The lower classes and the warriors will communicate in taboo swear words that lend power to their crude pronouncements. Lastly the clerics of the future will be whatever the coming religious wars boil it down to. Be it a devolved version of Christian or Muslim or secular. Whatever survives will determine how people are allowed to talk to their All Mighty.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c4642883895073556420 title="comment permalink">11/5/14, 6:45 PM</a><br><br>

Farmer's Markets, perhaps - but you still need to pay various insurances, state and local taxes and other overheads to participate even in those settings. I once knew a wealthy investor type, who told me that really successful investors don't look to invest in new schemes or innovations - they mostly find places where money is already flowing and figure out some way to dip into that flow. So much easier than creating something new, I suppose.<br><br>Unfortunately, it does rather look like the grown-ups are going to do everything possible to keep all this so-called money flowing through the system, long after the quaint old notions of supply and demand have ceased to operate. So we're going to be living in a zombie money economy for a while, it seems. Fortunately we have Japan - which seems to be set up for the role of canary-in-the-market-economy - to provide a leading indicator of the economic madness to come. <br><br>I have about 20 years of productive activity left in me, plus maybe another 10 years after that.

I worry for my kids though.

Individuals, families, and communities can make their own arrangements, though. <br><br>Greg, exactly. One of the things I've had to wrestle with in the process of writing my blog posts is that all of them unfold from a single structure of thought, but that structure isn't something that can be set out briefly -- it contradicts too many of the basic assumptions of our time, and so the explanation has to go a bit at a time. <br><br>DeAnander, every civilization in its latest and most complex phases goes in for as much intermediation as it can -- yes, late imperial China was a fine example. Gray markets are another universal in such times, and they become the only economy there is as things wind down. <br><br>David, good. Rand's "sovereign individual" has another and a more accurate name, which is "parasite" -- anyone who actually produces goods and services knows how much their work depends on everyone else. <br><br>Tony, it's absolutely standard in heavily intermediated societies for the people on the bottom of the pyramid to be forbidden to respond to supply and demand, so that they can't evade the demands of the intermediaries. What the medieval laws did was to block supply and demand straight up to the top of the social ladder. <br><br>Zach, don't worry about when the crash will come. It's already here. This is what collapse looks like in the real world -- not a sudden splat, but the ragged disintegration of business as usual, day by day, as the world changes into something else. <br><br>Patricia, nah, that's a common misconception.

As for what happens when people overshoot their carrying capacity, why, they die, of course. What did you think would happen to them? <br><br>Janet, every form of human politics and economics, to me, are depressing to contemplate, because human beings are, well, human beings, and can be counted on to exploit other human beings in the usual ways. I don't see feudalism as being noticeably worse than the alternatives. <br><br>Doom, now apply the same sort of analysis, with the same negative bias, to the evolution of language in industrial society. You'll find that you can portray things just as grimly there, too. <br><br>Ventriloquist, I see our bardic circle is warming up... ;-)<br><br>Pyrrhus, of course. Did you think that any human system of political economy would remain stable forever? <br><br>Eskewis, my paternal family's from Grays Harbor -- my great-great-grandfather homesteaded near Elma, and my father went to Weatherwax High School in Aberdeen -- so I know the area tolerably well. There are old and deep-rooted reasons why things have gotten as nasty there as they have, and that's not necessarily shared with the rest of the country or the world. The town in which I live today is just as poor, and a great deal more civil. Which is to say, don't assume the worst everywhere just because that's what you're seeing where you are. <br><br>Karen, I enjoy Tepper's fiction, even though she does seem to be convinced that Y chromosomes are the root of all evil. Still, I'd encourage you to remember that fiction is, after all, fiction, and attempts to impose utopian fiction on the real world tend to have predictably ghastly consequences. <br><br>Hapibeli, that would make a good chant! <br><br>Kylie, that's why I don't tend to recommend alternative currencies. If any of those ever get big enough to matter, they'll either be squashed by the legal system or coopted. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, exactly. It's all very well to talk about reforming the system, but that would require the people who profit from the system as it is, and generally have a lot of control over it, to relinquish their profits and hand over control to the reformers.

On the one hand we have the established brick and mortar merchants - who pay taxes and invest heavily in conforming to the various codes and official rules - and on the other we have the street peddlers - who offer the same wares, but cheaper, out of improvised tarps on either the street or the walkside. The bounty seems to be the huge opportunity for profit on the Christmas season.<br><br>This peddlers are not small fry. They are highly organized, and there was a riot this weekend, full with a convenience store ransacked and burned police cars. The major has claimed success since "all protocols were followed to the letter" and declared that "law is un-enforzable since the area is over-commercialized" (don't worry, it makes as little sense in Spanish as it does in English).<br><br>Now, the merchant association is suing the city hall so that a federal judge forces it to actually do their jobs.<br><br>What this makes me think is that there is no absolute division between the market model and the feudal model. While I cannot know for sure, I assume individual peddlers are bind by informal word agreements to their leaders, who work to secure cooperation or at least tolerance from authorities. They still work in the market economy, which they treat as some sort of "commons" whose access to they control in a feudal way.<br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c5151719025938520783 title="comment permalink">11/5/14, 10:38 PM</a><br><br>

That is, feudal society resists what you call intermediation by the same means as tribal society does. <br>Growth, which sadly includes the parasitic behavior of "feeding at the trough" can be resisted that way, but we should recognize that seeking to capture available energies (profit, in economic terms)is not a bad thing per se.<br><br>It can't be.

I know Norman-style feudalism does not spring whole cloth from the earth when the market economy goes *poof*, and I'd be curious what the early stages look like.

I’m wondering what you think about the following….<br><br>In the US, I can more easily imagine a shift away from our current heavily intermediated “free” market-based economy to some type of feudal-type economy in rural or exurban areas; perhaps in some of the more sparsely-populated suburban areas with access to natural resources (mainly water and farmable land) as well. I see a modest shift in attitude in my suburban small-town in upstate NY, where more and more people frequent farmers’ markets for food and craft items, buy (relatively) local craft beers and ciders, get milk deliveries from a local farmer and have some interest in growing their own food. I could see those changed attitudes and behaviors laying the foundation for a future feudal-type, more locally-based, economy. But what about urban areas? <br><br>At first, some may point to the “sharing economy” – as evidenced by AirBnB, Uber, Zip Cars and Citi Bikes in NYC – as evidence that urbanites can also move away from our current economic system to something less traditional. But aren’t those examples of businesses (or in the case of Citi Bikes, government programs) that are all heavily intermediated as well? I suspect that large urban economies can sustain themselves to some degree for a while as hubs of trade and commerce (and thus finance) while the more rural areas become less and less intermediated and more and more feudal. But at some point in decline (perhaps relatively quickly), I expect the urban areas will not be able to sustain large-scale populations – i.e., they won’t generate enough economic activity to sufficiently feed, clothe and shelter millions of people (with all the high-rise residential buildings, shelter may not be the problem, though in the Northeast, warm shelter during winter months may be a different story. You can’t just light a fire in the vacant apartment on the 24th floor of the high-rise in which you’ve been squatting). A heavy concentration of population, coupled with an absence of arable land, makes traditional feudal arrangements seem impossible in urban areas. I see a few things that could spring up, but none of them seem to be good options - e.g., disease might eradicate a large portion of the population; warlord/gang-type violence could do the same thing; some form of urban sweatshop-type industrial near-slavery could evolve, with workers giving up any semblance of autonomy just to survive; charismatic leaders could recruit urban populations as warriors/raiders of other areas; or, simply, widespread flight from cities to rural areas where a feudal system has already taken root (which could then overwhelm the relatively fragile economies in those areas).<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>Casey '14<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c6056565671019575036 title="comment permalink">11/6/14, 9:19 AM</a><br><br>

So who enforces them today? The whole intermediary system that is going to be swept away!<br><br>3) Even if we assume a Women's Country: what inevitably will happen with this country is that women will find other things more important than to have children. That means also fewer sons to defend the country, which would make this country a welcome prey for others whose women don't oppose to producing sons that can be spent in war.<br><br>4) Women could not defend this country simply because they have much less physical power for carrying weapons and gear over distance, not to mention the actual fighting.<br><br>5) Even if they tried and succeeded, they would suffer losses. The other side also, of course, but while Women's Country would loose women, the other side would just loose men. Since women and not men are the bottleneck in producing offspring, the other side could put up as many attacking men in the next generation while Women's Country would not have compensated the loss of the generation before.<br><br>4) and 5) are the reasons why war has always the domain of men.

It’s easy to picture the bustling markets of Ancient Rome, or the command economy of Ancient Egypt, and it’s easy to picture the mature feudal economies of medieval Europe or Japan. But when looking at a civilization in the process of decline, even in the few texts that focus on everyday life in crises of decline rather than on the warbands and invasions (such as Rutilius Namatianus’ “Voyage Home to Gaul), the focus is on what has been lost. On senate halls being overrun by wilderness, on roads that are impassable due to an infrastructure that can “no longer control forest with homestead or river with bridge” or on the Egyptian grains and Greek wines that no longer make their way to markets. You don’t see much about what people are doing when the markets and roadways no longer function but nothing has yet replaced them. What systems of exchange will emerge between the market economies of today and the feudal economies of tomorrow? I know that the shadows of those are already beginning to emerge on the fringes of society, but what does the transition look like for a typical modern American who can’t think of the future as anything but a more gadget-ridden version of the present rarely cooks a meal from scratch much less grows food, works at Walmart for 15000 a year plus food stamps or as a data entry clerk for 30000 a year minus student loans when the bottom falls out? Do they all just die? That seems too simplistic and well… apocalyptic. But at the same time, they’ve been thrust into a new world they don’t know how to navigate, so what’s next for them? My mental image is of the first seeds of feudalism being planted in shanty towns made up of the downwardly mobile and newly homeless being granted food and protection from police and raiders by street gangs in exchange for a tribute of able-bodied children and teens to carry guns. That still feels like too clean of a transition though.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c969494882901429372 title="comment permalink">11/6/14, 11:33 AM</a><br><br>

Members pay wholesale price for the food, plus a small mark-up to cover other coop costs, but we don't have to pay for anyone's salaries or lots of other costs that official businesses would have.

They can't legally sell it, so they give it to us, and we sell it for less than 10% the original cost. I regularly buy blocks of cheese for only .15, that otherwise would have landed in the dumpster.<br><br>--Any produce that is starting to go bad we sell at reduced cost. This reduces food waste, and we can get some pretty good deals for produce that is mostly good.<br><br>--Food that has started to grow moldy we put out for free. Those of us who don't mind cutting off the mold get free food, plus reduce food waste.<br><br>--Sometimes individuals bake items to sell at the coop, like bread or granola bars. Since we're outside the radar of business inspections, even though the baked goods are made in unlicensed kitchens, we get away with it.<br><br>While they're laws that forbid these kind of business practices, if one is careful enough to keep a low profile, sometimes one can get away with it.

But I really don't expect any change except what the GOPsters have been "threatening", ie, they'll try to push through draconian pieces of legislation that Obama will veto, they'll even gut Obamacare (the individual mandate they will leave in place, and give it some TEETH), but they won't get rid of it. And yes, they'll try to impeach the President as well. On that last bit, maybe they should ask Gingrich, Livingston and Hastert how well the previous attempt went over for them and their GOP majority house.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c4682635620706895968 title="comment permalink">11/6/14, 1:24 PM</a><br><br>

This is not a mirror image of patriarchy.<br><br>Bonobo's and humans are the only great ape with occult ovulation. That is, sexual activity is unlinked to only times of fertility. Females are more or less sexually available regardless of fertility status. In great contrast to the other apes which have clear signals for availability. Maybe as little as a couple weeks every few years. Plus some male sexual characteristics [gonad and penile size relative to body size] that put us squarely in the matrilinial camp versus the chimp or gorilla modes of mating and social organization. This is not trivial variation. <br><br>Obviously we have the capacity to be patriarchal as that is the norm for several thousand years. It seems to be tied to civilization itself. And may have to do with the institutionalized violence towards members of the group rather than the violence directed outward towards competing groups. In simpler societies there is solidarity within the group and the other groups are demonized. In a civilized society the hierarchical stratification allows for much more institutionalized in-group violence. <br><br>I am not arguing that simpler cultures are not violent. It does seem that egalitarian cultures are found in hunter gatherer cultures almost exclusively. In herding cultures it appears that whichever sex owns the animals is the dominant sex. The concept of property has arisen. <br><br>There are lingering cultures of more egalitarian and or matrilineal bent even now. Which certainly indicates that whatever human nature is, it isn't exclusively patriarchal by inclination. The biggest indicator to me that patriarchy as a social option is a kind of forced condition is the amount of policing and social conditioning it takes to keep it going. Reproductive rights of women are still being wrangled over in our congress. Jeez<br><br>It is funny to me that one of the reasons men think patriarchy is so swell is, like rock stars, it is about access to sex. At least for the alpha's and beta's. In matriarchy's it is far more common for there to be sex for everyone ad lib. I am not painting a sexual paradise, but something a lot closer to it than what we have now. <br><br>Isn't it telling that when the civilized conquer the tribal or H/G cultures they always say how lazy and overly sexual they are, justifying their taking of the land and destroying the culture?<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c8369066461256854288 title="comment permalink">11/6/14, 2:44 PM</a><br><br>

It's not, really. The "Men's Country" that your argument foretells is a fragile one, with many weaknesses.<br><br>But first of all, societies are not sentient organisms in and of themselves. The sort of logic you outline, though easy enough for most individual people to carry out, is beyond the capacity of people in the mass, or of any society.

For the women, this is an effective means means of gaining and keeping power subtly when the other side (= men) has the preponderance of physical strength.<br><br>In the world that's coming, child mortality will be very much higher, and adult mortality significantly higher, than at present. Individual deaths will be much less likely to be investigated, for deaths will be mere everyday happenings, arousing less suspicion than they do now. <br><br>Remember that many subtle means of dealing death lie firmly in the hands of those who cook, and brew, and preserve food, and gather food in the wild.<br><br>When oppression becomes too great, oppressors often tend to die off in larger numbers than formerly ... That tendency can show up, for instance, in a greater number of male babies who do not survive the early weeks of their life, or a greater number of warriors who do not respond well to treatment of wounds that would not have killed their great-grandfathers if treated in ways that seem the same to an outsider. <br><br>The subtle ways to deal with any imbalance or any oppression too great to bear, are endless.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c3029262430167871255 title="comment permalink">11/6/14, 5:02 PM</a><br><br>

The phenomenon of local governments busily whoring themselves and their localities to the nearest source of money, alas, is far from unusual. <br><br>Raymond, actually, "the law is unenforceable because the area is overcommercialized" makes perfect sense in English, so long as you remember that "overcommercialized" means "good at bribing the police"... ;-)<br><br>Spanish Fly, well, it's a work of fiction, after all! The idea is that the Greek Golden Dawn party becomes a template for anti-EU agitation throughout southern Europe, and that sparks insurgencies in several places; still, that's only one of many things that could happen. <br><br>Unirealist, thank you. I don't offer feudalism as a utopia; it's simply what tends to emerge once a civilization finishes crashing, because it has a very high degree of resilience, which more complex social forms generally lack. <br><br>Stunned, hmm! Interesting. I could be wrong, of course. <br><br>Rhisiart, that's the sort of community around the edges of the existing order that, under the right circumstances, becomes the seed from which a new and less complex order can sprout. Of course it can be crushed as well if the circumstances are wrong, but that's the risk you run. <br><br>Hadashi, funny!<br><br>Trog, I've had similar experiences, and they reinforce my enthusiasm for a TV-free life. <br><br>Sleisz Ádám, I think it depends on what you're used to. In much of the rural US, people are much happier having decisions made locally, even if they're made by corrupt local politicians, than they would be having decisions made by faceless bureaucrats a thousand miles away. <br><br>Raven, fascinating. I borrowed the name from Tolkien, actually. <br><br>Crowandsheep, interestingly enough, I'm rereading <i>The World as Will and Representation</i> right now. Yes, Schopenhauer used to insist that Hegel was a deliberate fraud, who set out to make himself look like a deep philosopher by deliberately stringing together incomprehensible statements so that everybody would think he was too profound for them to understand.

Mine is a good hour's drive from the nearest point where that's taking effect, thus the difference. <br><br>Phil, I tried to come up with some way to work in a boson joke with Higg son of Snell, but couldn't think of one!<br><br>Kyoto, Richard Heinberg's on the respectable end of the peak oil scene, and he and Post Carbon Institute need to be able to point to a coherent plan for getting through the approaching mess when people in power demand one -- even though I think they're aware that such a plan will never be adopted. One of the reasons I value my position on the lunatic fringe is that I don't have to divert energy into such exercises. (Besides, if I need to point to a plan, I can simply point to Richard's -- it's a good one.) <br><br>Cherokee, exactly. Local rule always involves some element of local responsibility, if only the fear that one of the locals will put an arrow or a bullet in your back the next time you go hunting. <br><br>Irishwildeye, I'm glad to hear it. The Irish people got screwed by that "bailout" scam -- if Ireland had gone ahead and done what Iceland did, you'd be out of recession by now, and I think a lot of people know it. As for the difference in working hours from the Middle Ages to now, I wonder if you could document how many hours a day, how many days a year peasants worked in Ireland under British rule, and compare it to current conditions -- that might be interesting to contemplate. <br><br>Karim, elected democracy and civil rights are not necessarily related to one another; in fact, elected democracies have routinely been guilty of extreme violations of human rights, just as nonelected governments have quite often granted extensive civil rights to their citizens. How leaders are chosen and what standards of conduct they obey are not necessarily related to one another!<br><br>Raven, thanks for the link. <br><br>Jonathan, yes, and that's also a good approach. The gift economy is a classic way of arranging the distribution of goods and services, after all. <br><br>William, that's a long and tangled tale. Talk to the local oldtimers sometime about how things unfolded as the lumber mills and fisheries shut down. <br><br>Bear, feudal systems pop up pretty consistently in the wake of a fallen civilization, so I suspect some variant of one is in our future, too. <br><br>Ben, thanks for the recommendation!<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c7284605092682543716 title="comment permalink">11/6/14, 5:25 PM</a><br><br>

I don't know how easy it is these days to find details about the medieval economic theory of the just price -- modern economists have gone out of their way to snub it, of course -- but it might be worth looking into. <br><br>Shane, preserving the common law tradition strikes me as a very good thing, too. Any thoughts about how to do it? <br><br>Bill, good -- yes, the sort of mature feudalism I outlined comes after some centuries of less organized and more haphazard arrangements, and I'll make time to talk about those as we proceed.<br><br>Hector, the impromptu local militia of peasants headed by a local landowner on a horse is what eventually turns into feudalism, rather than the other way around -- so you're onto something. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Kyoto, exactly. <br><br>Kendo, the large cities that are on the coasts are going to be underwater in the next couple of centuries. Those further inland will either be abandoned or, like Rome in the post-Roman dark ages, will be inhabited by a tiny fraction of their pre-decline population. A large city can only sustain itself if it can bring in very large amounts of resources from outside, and that capacity goes away in a dark age; there are also public health issues, which I'll be getting to as we proceed. Remember that the population at the bottom of the curve will be much smaller than it is now, and a disproportionate fraction of the dieoff will happen among the urban population. More on this later. <br><br>Claudia, I'm minded to agree. It's hard to say for sure, but my take is that something fundamental has shifted in gender relationships in North America, at least, and societies here in the future will not conform to the sort of stereotypes you get from the right these days. For that matter, the women of dark age Europe were not exactly a bunch of fainting wallflowers -- historical records and literature alike are full of women who were enthusiastic participants in the savagery of the time. <br><br>Shane, a lot of my readers use social media, a friend volunteered to set up a Facebook page for my novel, and since book sales put food on my table, it seemed reasonable to post a discussion of that here. Do I use social media? Bright gods, no -- I'd sooner dine daily on live tarantulas. Still, I'm not in the business of telling other people what to do. <br><br>Gunnar, no question, the market economy has no shortage of fatal flaws when confronted with the limits to growth -- I simply focused on one of them. The two you've named are also in there, of course. <br><br>Bob, exactly. It's easy to feel optimistic about the future if every other industrial nation on the planet has been bombed halfway back to the dark ages. <br><br>Daelach, of course you're right that some can try to migrate.

If the Democrats want to claim to be an alternative to the GOP, it would help if they acted like one...<br><br>Eric, you're missing the crucial point, which is that the bottom doesn't drop out; it just keeps leaking, and individuals fall out of it -- losing their jobs, their homes, etc. That's what makes the transition as gradual as it is; at any given point, there are some people who have already collapsed and are finding their feet in the new Third World economy of deindustrializing America, some who have just fallen and may or may not survive, and some who are insisting at the top of their lungs that it can't happen to them -- until it does. <br><br>Rita, for what it's worth, I don't think it's inevitable, either.

Of course there are variations in how egalitarian or hierarchically stratified human societies can be, and a galaxy of variables determines how that works out.

For example, the fossil-based energy it will take to perfect those technologies is more than is available, or society as we know it will collapse before we can do it.

But I saw the update on Archanglesk. I wonder if a paragraph or two on Commodore Perry's black ship expedition to open up Japan--the sudden shift from feudalism to modern industrial capitalism--would be of interest.<br><br>i see you are very busy (=popular, you deserve it), so if I don't have a specific question, I may urge you not to respond if I'm just giving information of general interest. I note lots of people take time to read through the comments here. You moderate them well.<br><br>One thing that is different about the current collapse "this time" is its universality. I admit that is a trifling point, if the average person in the past couldn't just pick up and move to a better location. OTOH, my great grandparents left Germany when they saw where it was headed, and there are lots of ex-pats sitting around in various countries making bets on how our respective domiciles are going to fare.<br><br>Japan is heading toward the drain, and will soon start circling it. With a food self-sufficiency ratio of 39%, which will be less when fossil fuel inputs decline, things are not going to be pretty here. Intermediation has advanced in Japan possibly even more than in America, because the people are very patient and conservative, and they go along with it.<br><br>Thirteen years ago, my husband and I moved to a deeply rural part of Japan and began organic gardening. In order to buy farmland in Japan, one has to have farmer qualifications, which can be either inherited or obtained by renting a specified land area and cultivating it for three years, documenting this effort.<br>(It was a laudable attempt to keep farmland from falling to rampant speculation during the bubble years. Of course, there were loopholes, and a lot of farmland got lost to development anyway.)<br><br>My husband managed to obtain these qualifications this year, and started looking for suitable farmland. Six months later, the only land we've been shown was places we could have bought without the qualifications: highly taxed residential land and waste land with no farming potential. We received no written documentation of our qualification, just oral assurance. We are told we would not be eligible for subsidies anyway, without which it would be economically impossible to farm full time. The agricultural association refuses to tell us about land coming up for sale. We've learned that the mostly elderly farmers who receive subsidies have to toe the line with the ag association, or they lose their subsidy. That means they must buy all their seed, chemicals and equipment at exorbitant prices from thea ag association. This has bankrupted many of them, and they keep taking out loans through the ag association to keep going. Many are so deeply in debt that they have disowned their children to prevent them from having to inherit the debt. So after they die, the ag association takes over the farm. We see lots and lots of fallow land reverting to forest, from which it is very hard to recover. If there is an individual or corporate owner, they cannot let it go fallow, or severe taxation is applied retroactively. I suspect the ag association expects to sell these lands when it can be done profitably to non-farming interests.<br><br>Meanwhile, the ag association invests its wealth in semi-legal or sometimes illegal ventures that are profitable--much like the mafia.<br><br>I won't go on, but the government is simply riddled with such examples. My husband is totally against going outside the system to get by. He'll be furious if I defy him and buy marginal waste land, but it would be better than having nothing at all.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c8939963185145345027 title="comment permalink">11/6/14, 8:01 PM</a><br><br>

A lot to be said for such a state of affairs, and it tends to "keep things real": maybe not better, but at least not a gigantic web of lies and villainy with a spider you can't see at the center. As Chesterton said, "there as more courage to the square mile in the Middle Ages" than there is now. I've been thinking about feudalism: some to work, some to fight, some to pray. Those that may do best are those who do all three, along with activities derivative therefrom, such as scholarly study, magic, skilled arts and trades, etc, which build on the topsoil. If a transition society could encourage all three, or develop a minority that was adept in all three, they might stand some chance of extracting derivative institutions like local democracy, cosmopolitan diversity in larger areas, technology, etc., all the "stuff" people like about the modern age. But I don't think that will be possible as long as modern people keep imagining that "those brutes back then" were inhuman freaks who lacked a shred of resemblance to the current species of homo sapiens. Did someone on this link note the recent study that showed that the average Victorian middle-upper class person had a higher IQ than their contemporaries? Dark Age peasants managed to learn and write and read Latin, salvage libraries, create hospitals and infirmaries, and basically re-create a collapsed world in appalling conditions.

I use the main floor of the house, but the basement and second floor are reserved for his storage. I'd like to put in a wood stove, but he judges the chimney to be to "iffy", even with a new liner.

In the meantime, may I encourage you to try my earlier SF novel <i>The Fires of Shalsha</i>? <br><br>Johnny, the native Hawai'ians know what they're talking about, as usual. It's the haoles that are clueless about Pele, again as usual. <br><br>YJV, thanks for the links -- and yes, that last is way up there on the idiocy scale. <br><br>Cake, we do seem to be moving into the endgame, don't we? It promises to be entertaining, in a Grand Guignol sort of way, from here on in. <br><br>Chris, thank you -- and the picnic disguise is great! Many thanks for the link. <br><br>Bill, there's basically no difference. Why do you think the term is still "land<i>lord</i>"?<br><br>Kyoto, that's why I specified live tarantulas -- I'm fond of eating arthropods generally, with crab and lobster near the top of the list, so would be willing to try a well-cooked tarantula. <br><br>Charles, okay, let's start with the basics. Just coming up with a non-fossil energy source won't cut it; we'd need an energy source that was at least as abundant and concentrated as fossil fuels, and preferably much more so, which could be used without wrecking the biosphere. We'd also need replacements for all the other nonrenewable resources we're drawing down so rapidly, and these replacements would also have to have no negative impacts on the biosphere. Finally, we'd need some economically viable way to make all our pollutants permanently harmless. Lacking any one of those steps, all you've got is a brief delay in our civilization's face-first collision with the limits to growth. <br><br>Now, do we have any reason to think that any of these things can be supplied? No, we don't. More than a century of increasingly frantic research into alternative energy sources has failed to turn up anything that can substitute for fossil fuels on an economically viable basis, and the other two issues aren't looking very good either. Nor do we have any reason to think that such a thing as "escape velocity" in the sense in which you're using the term exists at all. I would describe it as a faith-based claim, more like the reasoning behind the cargo cults than anything else. While one can't prove its impossibility, proving a negative is notoriously hard -- I also can't prove that there isn't a teapot of solid gold in orbit around Pluto, but that doesn't mean that belief in such a teapot is justified. <br><br>XDE, that's an interesting project! I wonder if the funding could be gotten to carve those lessons on a stone monolith somewhere. <br><br>Violet, Higg and the blacksmith would barter for the billhook, of course. Two suckling pigs and a barrel of ale later, Higg is the owner of a nice new billhook, which will still be in use in his grandson's time. <br><br>Patricia, none of this surprises me. That's one of the reasons that seaborne refugees from Japan have featured in several of my stories about the deindustrial future.<br><br>Matthew, of course intellect had a very large share in it. C.S. Lewis comments in <i>The Discarded Image</i> that medieval Europe was a profoundly bookish society, with deep respect for the written knowledge that had survived from the classical past, and from the days of the early monastery schools onward, logic was a fundamental part of every literate person's education.

In areas with constant rivalry, women's rights get kicked to the basement. Still, China, which I find extremely misogynistic, managed to have female rulers, one of whom remarked that it just was not a job for women. She found she needed to employ brutality, for which she is still notorious.<br>Japan, by contrast, was protected by treacherous seas, making the defense of its coast a simple deal until modern times. They had elements of a matriarchy as recently as a thousand years ago (and actually, they still do, if you look hard enough). One of those was the high priesthood at the highest shrine in the land, Ise, passing from mother to daughter. During the medieval warring period, however, women's position really declined (and Buddhism also brought in misogynistic baggage it had acquired on the continent), and women's priesthood was abolished about 400 years ago. Women's rights in Japan have taken a big step forward in the modern time of peace, but I'm still typically paid half what a man would be.<br><br>Here, let me get out my crystal ball (Sears &amp; Roebuck)...I see a time when women will really suffer because they cannot or will not be allowed to fight like men, and be called inferior again, as violent males vie for whatever resources still exist anywhere on planet Earth. That will eventually pass, though, and if you can get yourself and your daughters established on an island in the meantime, there may be brighter days. Wherever you happen to be, though, a determined woman has always been able to do what she wants to do--or else die trying, which is the fate of men, when you come to think of it.<br><br>On gay rights, outside of the Judaeo-Christian-Islamic dominated regions, the outlook is much brighter. In fact, in Medieval Japan, homosexual love was considered superior to heterosexual, largely because they had come to despise women so much as "impure."<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c5618470285952760634 title="comment permalink">11/6/14, 10:13 PM</a><br><br>

Further, it shouldn't surprise when "leftist presidents" keep tacking to the right – they're the ones in the agora day-by-day. FDR himself pointed to that point when he told a bunch of people wanting the progressive programs of the 1930s: "Good ideas – now go out and make me do them."<br><br><b>Second:</b> There are legal documents from pre-Norman England in which woman are referred to as "he." This is because, in the post-Roman collapse, the idea of using gender for pronouns got thrown by the wayside in the attempt to create a language the various Germanic peoples could communicate with. Along with this, of course, women came close to actual equality – without having to hide behind stealth activities, as some of our distaff commenters have fantasized about. The necessities of Feudal society (cooperation and all that) are enough to destroy all but the barest shadows of Patriarchal (i.e. Male rule to the oppression of the female) society, and the English language of 1000 both echoed and enforced that equality.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c6849930556799040437 title="comment permalink">11/6/14, 11:08 PM</a><br><br>

There was a perfect example of excessive intermediation (or excessive complexity as I like to call it) recently, when a 90 year old man in Texas along with 2 church ministers was arrested for feeding homeless people on the street. The local mayor criticised him for not leaving it to the local authority to deal with, no doubt because of the excessive regulations and procedures that must be followed by the local authority were not being met. Or perhaps the authorities think that he is hindering the real solution, i.e. people starving the death? There is another example of this in my home country, Scotland. A man has spent years in jail having been arrested for walking, naked. He is known as the ‘naked rambler’. An ex-military man, and no doubt psychologically damaged, who refuses to conform to society’s normal rules. The best solution would be if people and the authorities ignored him, but the law says otherwise. <br><br>Having read your articles for many years, I continue to ponder how the collapsing industrial empire will affect my, rather small country, compared to the US. I can see how such a large country as the US, can only continue to function in its current state thanks to oil. Virtually all food has to be transported over vast distances by truck to the customers. In the absence of oil, it will be impossible to maintain control as today. Adapting to a new normal is likely to be extremely disruptive and chaotic. But in a small country with a long history of civilisation such as mine, I can’t help but think it will be slightly different. Even Scotland’s ‘large’ capital city Edinburgh, is tiny compared to cities in the US. It existed without oil very successfully. I doubt the rural areas will become bandit lands like large parts of the US could. Old approaches to problems could well be re-invented. Local production of flour and paper, via watermills for example. Use of the existing canals for transporting goods, drawn by horse. New employment would be created as the farms surrounding the small towns and cities, de-mechanised and sought labour to replace machines. In essence a rural repopulation, counteracting the trend over the last 100 years of rural depopulation. I suspect political power will be devolved as well, mostly likely reluctantly. The recent failed attempt to get independence, was simply because the vote was too soon. As the economy continues to deteriorate, and crisis becomes the norm, rule by Edinburgh rather than distant London, will become an inevitable step. Power may well end up devolved more to local councils as well. Will this be sufficient to prevent the situation transforming (declining?) into some sort of neo-feudalism or even a new dark age? I’m not sure. It depends to how well society can adapt to its new circumstances. Some societies may cope better than others, depending on the types of values they have and there level of adaptability. Perhaps modern day Cuba a good proxy as to how a simplified Scotland could work, in terms of coping without technology and oil.

A handshake and a promise doesn't sound like much, but it is enough for me. Yes, and I would hold them to it too, in the most honest and brutal way that I could.<br><br>The thought popped back into my head this morning! I'd only just finished the chapter written by Galbraith in his book "The Age of Uncertainty" on "The rise and fall of money" and I admit that he spelled out the system and its history in such unambiguous terms that I freely admit that previous concerns about currency have now evaporated completely. Both you and he are correct, they will think of something is actually an adequate response to my former fears of a currency collapse in or a sell off of the US dollar.<br><br>Truly, I had little idea about the mechanisms of the money system before reading that, but oh boy is that one scary bit of text. The mechanism's are now all too clear to me...<br><br>Anyway, moving on. I'm first and foremost a pragmatic sort of a guy and I started thinking about a meme surrounding the economy that has seriously annoyed me of recent months. The answer finally bubbled to the surface this afternoon.<br><br>Historically, printing money has always led to inflation. It is hard to get around, but that is what generally happens. Few can dispute this too as it is grounded in history. A simple rule is involved: The greater the supply of money, the less stuff that money will be able to purchase.<br><br>Yet, time and time again I keep reading comments here saying, such and such reckons that we're all headed for a deflationary period. Whoopee for us!<br><br>Such claims have always annoyed me as they seem quite unusual an unexpected compared to historical events.<br><br>Yet, those same commenters can point to official inflation figures saying that inflation is low and all is good with the world of economics.<br><br>I always knew something was a bit off about those comments but never really had enough of a chance to think the subject through completely.<br><br>There are plenty of sharper tools in the toolbox than I, but I'm not heavily invested in the status quo so I have a bit of freedom that most don't enjoy.<br><br>Housing has always troubled me. It is my opinion that the hyper inflation that would usually rear its ugly head during an expansionary and prolonged period in the money supply (i.e. rolling the printing presses) is being expressed here in the housing market. I can't speak for other countries, but I've go a good feel for here.<br><br>People point to official inflation figures and cry, "but inflation is low". It is my gut feel that housing costs increases are often offset by reductions in the costs of many goods which are now manufactured offshore in really low cost environments or are just of a much lower quality than previous times. Both situations reduce costs for goods and thus the official inflation rate.<br><br>How else do you explain house prices for a two bedroom house in the inner north of Melbourne for well over AU$900,000. How else do you explain an increase of 15% for two years in a row in the housing market whilst inflation remains low?<br><br>Honestly, the thing that annoys me the most about the situation is that people that are in the housing market and looking for a quick buck, can be guaranteed to predict a deflationary outcome and cheer on the market, because it suits their worldview.<br><br>Older people that have enjoyed the benefits of that increase in their asset base due to rising house costs are just hoping for a deflationary event so that they can comfortably cruise through retirement.<br><br>But if you're locked out of the housing market and wondering how you are ever going to buy in at those prices, mate you'd be angry. And I mean really angry.<br><br>Now, I will say from memory, the house price bubble kicked off in earnest here at about the same time that our major trading partner - Japan - started quantitative easing way back in 2001. Coincidence? Hardly.<br><br>We've been had. It is that simple.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>From Mr very unhappy - Chris<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c3624219040809726743 title="comment permalink">11/7/14, 2:42 AM</a><br><br>

I respect the strong local community traditions of America as well as those of other countries. I sense that we would need more of this kind where I live.<br><br>A remark about the discussion on gender issues (though it may be interesting anyway): I think that the description of feudalism as a masculine world is not necessarily right. I agree that feudal politics is dominated by raw violence which is generally more fitting for males. Politics, on the other hand, plays a substantially smaller role in feudal life than we are used to. Most of the people is really only interested in the well-being of themselves, their family and local community regardless of the quarrels and wars of the lords or the "half-mythical" king. Such a life is mainly about adaptation to the environment and politics is mainly a part of that environment.<br><br>I think that true feminine nature can find fulfillment in those circumstances more easily than in our world of greed and pioneering. Of course, this is only advantageous for women with dominant feminine nature but perhaps it is still more common than the same quality in men.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c2086966144127617190 title="comment permalink">11/7/14, 4:51 AM</a><br><br>

The transport union and MORAVECO, a national company, went together to build a regular bus and attempted to buy the necessary people and permits. Failing at that, they bought the Transport Ministers personal secretary and built the buses without permits. The Transport Minister, who was also a General in the Junta, cut the Ribbon for the first buses to come off the line, the newspapers put the picture on the front page, and "...the long list of businesses that feed on other businesses, and can’t be dispensed with because this or that law or regulation requires them to be paid their share." and their Ministry kin, were neatly cut out.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c7677041398856062602 title="comment permalink">11/7/14, 6:14 AM</a><br><br>

Of course it's not really feudal, since there are no sworn allegiances an the "serfs" can come and go as they please.

I’ve spend decades looking for a non-market alternative. <br><br>While was in college I discovered that I could survive by hunting small game and foraging for wild foods with a lot less effort than was going to be required to finish college and grad school and get anything like a real job. I started hiking every weekend, and over holidays, and then combining holidays with weekends to create large blocks of time to experiment with living off the land. My experiment didn’t keep me much above subsistence and I also raided the occasional dumpster, thumbed a lot rides to get between public lands, and slept hidden on the flat roofs of strip malls when in towns. Your mention of the “…legal prohibitions…legal fiat or brute force” that keep people from finding other ways of meeting their needs reminds me of this experiment. During my experiment a series of hostile run-ins with police, sheriff’s deputies, rangers, and odd ball land owners, usually ranchers illegally on public lands, made it clear to me that the life of a modern hunter and gatherer was not going to be legal, safe, or easy. The areas where law enforcement, criminals, and angry agriculturalists were less of a problem were invariably remote, nearly inaccessible, picked over and polluted by a previous rounds of development, or left only pristine because the land was unsuitable for development and generally inhospitable to would be foragers and layabouts as well. <br><br>Decades later I find myself trying a more moderate approach, keeping my day job and living as simply as possible but, alas, this has also proven to be difficult. The intermediation that you discuss is very real; land use regulations, ostensibly environmental in nature, require me to overbuild and then limit how I can use the land to essentially commercial farming or development as a single family living area. Either way lots of unnecessary and environmentally damaging overbuilding are required by the codes. The state and municipal codes clearly get more restrictive over time such that right next door to my modest spread, of new growth woods and wet meadow, are hundreds of non-conforming uses. The list of things I cannot do on my own land, or for the most part on anyone else’s land, is too extensive to mention and I won’t even start to address the ridiculous the insurances that you are supposed to have but not quite legally required to have for all housing, roadways, and agricultural land uses. <br><br>On a positive note, I will put in a plug for Maine’s laws on liability for uninvited use of land. Basically, unless you intentionally or recklessly create a danger you don’t have any liability which means I don’t have to chase people off my property and, indeed, odd types come and go all the time. May they pass in peace.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c2568416658198535558 title="comment permalink">11/7/14, 6:42 AM</a><br><br>

And that sets the backdrop for the landscape of the future. And a history of late Rome won’t show that process because the people still writing at the time have yet to fall through the cracks. What will that look like for us though? Perhaps a good book on daily life in the shanty towns of the great depression, and a good study of life among the homeless and jobless in East Harlem might be a good starting point… But also, since the process is going on now, it’s not something that can be picked up in a book. I think instead of the aquarium my volunteer hours may be better spent a little closer to the real world where I can see this unfolding.<br><br>Another thought: I’m beginning to notice the conversation about gender roles in feudal systems. It reminds me a bit of the conversations in your “steampunk future” essays when people assumed that the return of the steam engine would lead to Victorian social hierarchies. There are plenty of examples of civilizations that have collapsed into a feudal economy or something resembling one without gender oppression being a part of the process. The one that floats to the top of my mind right now is the Massachusets culture that rose out of the collapse of the Hopewell civilization and ascribed most of their spiritual and political power to women (much to the frustration of the English), the Vikings had female warriors (and balanced a feudal economy with a democratic government), and the Welsh were matrilineal. The most dangerous thing about the myth of progress is the sense of complacency that comes with the belief that goals are achieved with the mere passage of time. The equal rights we’ve gained can be salvaged if we work for it like science or democracy or anything else worth keeping, but it may be an uphill battle much of the way.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c3736969459269737548 title="comment permalink">11/7/14, 6:47 AM</a><br><br>

Nonetheless, the Genesis story contained covert hints - such as Adam saying he would call the woman Eve (life) because she would be the mother of the living. Genesis attempts to make Life secondary, a servant to the actual servant. Genesis has the creation of woman a kind of afterthought. But here's how I see things:<br><br>In the beginning, before manifestation, and eternally at the root (innermost dimension) of reality is unity, The One, the Buddhistic Void of pure potential, out of which all things arise. The first distortion of one is two. (The Tao gives birth to One, the One becomes Two..) Upon this two the machine of the universe runs. It generates the energy, it causes your heart to beat, it is everywhere, the genders are just one of its many manifestations. <br><br>In the beginning was one, and it was a bacterium, and it reproduced by dividing its genome into two, and those are called mother and daughter cells. Why mother and daughter? Because reproducing is the function, the primary function, of the female, and it is Life itself. It is the primal function of all existence. To deny that one's reproductive ability is one's highest function is like denying that the thing you most need to do right now is take another breath. <br><br>In order to better serve life a second gender was created, a holder of DNA and the reason for the existence of this second gender was just that - to help life by creating reserves and diversity and more change and development. The reason the male gender exists is *because* of the female. The reason the male gender exists is contingent upon the prior existence of the female. Therefore the fundamental existential drive and desire and need of the male is toward the female. We can talk about testosterone and all that, but testosterone is just a mechanism. <br><br>Everyone serves life because life is the fundamental attribute. The female serves life directly and the male serves life indirectly. The female exists in her own right because she is Life itself. God ought therefore to be represented as a Mother and not a Father because that would be more accurate if God is the source of existence. <br>Everywhere we see the glorified male. The larger and more powerful male, with his glorious mane, his elaborate antlers, huge tusks, leading the pride or the herd, often keeping a harem. Surely the male birds, though, have taken male beauty to its highest development. We have a pair of Chinese red-golden pheasants. Try googling that one. She's really a pretty little thing, but compared to her husband she might as well be a sparrow. And what does he do all day but court her? Constantly watch her? Parade up and down, flicking his cape at her? Who is it that does not need to elaborate herself beyond her basic nature which is female and who is it that gets to enjoy male beauty?<br>In the social mammals,(lions, elephants) who is the family ? The family is the females, and their daughters and granddaughters, and it is to this family that males want desperately to be admitted, risk and waste themselves to be admitted. Yes, they throw their weight around and have their rewards, but it's all about the females who are IT. <br><br>Let's do a part three.<br><br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c6205890948926539174 title="comment permalink">11/7/14, 8:53 AM</a><br><br>

If the male, who has a brief contribution in time reproductively, wants to hang around, he must make himself useful. He does this in various ways in various species by serving the community, the basis of which is female. The female holds the life card, always.<br><br>It is all of a piece, this reality. The universe uses patterns over and over, like fractals. <br>As I see it, women have been bewitched by the reactionary but very clever ploy of the males these past millenia, thus the human world is out of balance psychologically. No wonder women have an anger - because in our deepest being we know things are askew, that our worth is denigrated, surely not least in our culture by a 3-personed God of whom all three are male! But I see modern feminist ideas fighting the problem while remaining bewitched. The wound is deep and no one is happy when women lose their natural power, one of which is to reign in the males. I hold women accountable for letting them run amok.<br><br>What women need to understand is that men really have no choice. We are the purpose of their existence, they are hardwired to serve us and even keep us happy. You can see these things if you look a little deeper into circumstances that may seem otherwise on the surface. To be sure, a boy will insult another one for things like lack of courage by calling him a girl. But it is not because a girl is a bad thing to be - indeed girls are often oblivious to the existence of boys while boys are never really so oblivious because the first order of business for the male is "Where is the female"? The reason for the insult is that the purpose of the existence of a boy is to perform, to DO as a male. To fail at that makes him seem more like a female because she is the default gender. The male gender might be described as "he who is not female." The difference is subtle, but profound, rippling down through deep time and the dimensions. This is why I say the wound is deep. Women's power is in the realm of the psyche, which again might seem "less" to one bewitched, but Kastrup in his book does a good job of showing that the fundament of reality is probably consciousness and not matter, which means that women's power is *stronger*, the strongest, not the weaker. Why did the laws change, and relations between the genders change and women gain the rights of adult humans? Because they complained!<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c8107830900339164153 title="comment permalink">11/7/14, 9:27 AM</a><br><br>

Apprenticeship is in many ways more similar to the feudal system than it is to the market. The deal was sealed over the building and inoculation of a biodynamic compost pile. The Farmer gets my labor on certain days plus whatever else is required to fulfill certain tasks I may be assigned, its not nearly as specific and stable as Higg's gig but we have to maintain more flexibility, times being as they are. I think the Farmer and I would both like to have a more stable and explicit system, but tending the trust and such needed to have stock in such things is a process not an event.<br><br>Also, in the last week I have been digging into Spengler in earnest. Been browsing Decline on and off for about a year now, but last week his style started to click deep down, now I can't get enough of it! I can see how deeply personal the work is for him, a sustained meditation on his own Faustian soul, which in turn has helped me reconnect with certain aspects of that geriatric soul as it lives on in me.<br><br>Feudalism replacing a sophisticated economy (a former teacher of my described sophisticated as meaning 'screwed up by a sophistry') is also a process not an event. The sophisticated economy has to wither away, which is a drawn out process. I figure that since there is such a diversity of kinds of parasite that as their “environment” breaks down the will face an intense game of Darwinian musical chairs. This is a bitter pill in practice, because entire geneses of parasite will go extinct with each phase of decline, and become part of the moving masses faced with an intensely personal journey of finding another niche or dying in short order. These displaced parasite refugees will suffer deeply and even those who are part of the host will find themselves stressed by these displaced people. The real kick is that the parasite burden on the host will stay intense after each displacement, the surviving kinds of parasites expanding after each crisis trying to find any sustenance they can to persist. Putting that more explicitly, I expect some economic activities to be freed from intermediation at each stage of decline, leading to other areas facing a fearsome intensification leading to the next stage of decline.<br><br>Meanwhile the long slow process of developing trust and eventually traditions strong enough to maintain a semblance of order proceeds along thriving in vacuums left by the market economy's retreat. I wonder about the many marriages (maybe literal) between war bands and agriculture, lots of horror show stuff, but also some sporadically sound and humane arrangements for seasoning. That's the tricky thing about talking of feudalism. It isn't good or bad inherently, feudal arrangements have surely covered some very good arrangements, some horrific tragedies, and a healthy share of the middle ground, kind of like many other ways of arranging society. The character of the people involved in that kind of society, or any kind of society, goes a long way to determining the character of the society itself.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c6993481433657444184 title="comment permalink">11/7/14, 10:18 AM</a><br><br>

It is not a given that a simple and poor society must oppress its women. Also, I find it odd the way people suddenly think that every single female will need to reproduce with all her might. Actually, nonreproducing adults add greatly to a family or society. They are so important among wolves that they keep non mating aunts and uncles around. Even though life may be tougher and death rates higher, people in general have had more trouble with excess population than an insufficient one. The raising of children is intensely draining of resources, and the grandparents can barely hold their own contribution-wise. It is the young and middle aged adults who are able to produce more than they consume.

Upper body strength isn't anything like as important for most soldiers in a firearm-based army as it was when swords, spears, and bows were the killing instruments du jour.

First we get warband formation, which is well under way; then, over the next century or so, the collapse of public order in larger and larger portions of what's now the United States, until all or most of it has reverted to chaos; then, as the chaos begins to settle down, charismatic local leaders emerge and assemble local militias to fend off the remaining raiders; their descendants or supplanters become the proto-barons, the militias the proto-knights, and the ordinary people they protect the proto-peasantry.

It may well be that people in the pre-industrial past worked fewer hours but estimates depend a lot on what gets counted either way and in any case it was often harder/unpleasant compared to what most people are currently called to in the privileged western societies. Try rice transplanting under the sun in a rice paddy fertilized with human excrement, which is what fed much of the pre-industrial world population. And if you think that modern police are arrogant remember that a samurai was actually legally entitled to execute on the spot a peasant for the slightest perceived disrespect, nor were his western counterparts actually nicer, chivalry mythology notwithstanding. For all the (increasing) failings of industrialized life most people in places like the West still enjoy standards of life in terms of nutrition, sanitation, healthcare, security etc. that could only be dreamed of in the past.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c8980770386260036676 title="comment permalink">11/8/14, 6:57 AM</a><br><br>

Both male and female, see e.g. monks and nuns. However, they represented a small minority, and I'm talking about the society in general. Not having children on a big scale is typical for late civilisations, that was the same with Rome, or with Greece before. Rome even tried to enforce more children by the marriage laws of Augustus, but it didn't help.<br><br>At the moment, however, anything that gets down the number of humans without too much suffering would be reasonable. 7 bio people cannot be fed once the oil gets scarce. So for the present, getting women world-wide interested in anything else than bearing children looks like a good idea. Women more than men because they are the limiting party in producing offspring. If one of two women renounces to children, that helps - if one of two men renounces, the other one could make up for it (biologically, I mean).<br><br>Concerning turning back time - no, quite the other way round. Just look at what happens with late civilisations, that's the point. It's just that I have a hard time believing that warlords not even adhering to human rights will somehow stick to gender equality. You know, conquering lands, slaying any resistance there doesn't really blend in with being nice exclusively to the women there. Rape and war have always gone together, even in modern times and with armies from countries where human rights are worth something.<br><br><br>@ JMG: No, the endurance factor is much less with women, especially with gear. The standards women have to pass for being recognised as fit are lower (already at school), but that doesn't help in the battlefield. On average, women have 55% of the muscle power and 67% of the endurance of men. The best 20% of the women are on a par with the worst 20% of the men.<br><br>See http://books.google.de/books?id=i42vPG_iXRgC&amp;pg=PA9-27&amp;hl=de#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false .<br><br>That blends well in with civil sport: the top-class female teams don't stand a chance even against a youth male team. E.g. the German national female team lost 0:3 against the U17 male team from VfB Stuttgart. The U16 male team of Eintracht Frankfurt defeated the female national team 2:0. The 3rd senior male team of Fortuna Seppenrade (Kreisliga - really far down) defeated the female team of 1st FC Cologne (national league) 3:0. So basically, the top female football teams perform worse that U16 male teams. That's why women play football separately; the game would be boring otherwise. There are no women in the "tour de France" bicycle races, either - because they wouldn't have a chance, anyway.<br><br>The reasons are hard-wired into the biochemistry of the body: women have less musclemass and more fat, less testosterone, less oxygen capacity. Of course, a trained and slim woman might outperform an overweight, untrained man, but that's choosing a skewed comparison basis. However, strength training for women is a good idea. While they will never reach the level of a male training the same way, it is still better than being untrained, and in reality, there are many untrained men.<br><br>The main reason why people have lost track of this is that we are a heavily mechanised society. When a man wants to transport e.g. 20 liters of water from A to B, he'll load it into the car and drive. Obviously, a woman can do it in exactly the same way. But with the mechanisation gone, things will change.<br><br>You are right, though, that personal defense with small firearms is a great equaliser. However, with the industrial base gone, our modern firearms will come to be a memory of the past, at least in the long run. Producing cartridges with ignition will not be sustainable, and the old-style powder guns which are likely to have a future are useless for personal defense because of the long time to reload, not to mention their weight.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c1836353552308980862 title="comment permalink">11/8/14, 7:03 AM</a><br><br>

History unfolds in a huge variety of environments, both outer and inner, and in some of them other forms of society are better adapted to survive over the long centuries. You seem (to me) to be reducing this complexity to a matter of comparative human birth rates and human death rates *alone*, and the ability of this or that society to gain a numerical advantage in those respects.

We purchased food at a very old facility in Chicago called South Water Market. I functioned with other women in our group as a buyer and truck driver at the market. This market was owned and run by old Chicago Italian and Greek families--none far from 'warlord' roots. Older men recalled running errands for Al Capone. Many of the dock workers there had moved from the South to find work, more than a few with prison records. <br><br>The very traditional men there treated me with deep respect. More so than many of the male world savers in our college educated group. Of course we were buying things, but the relationships in this old fashioned place were not founded on our buying power, but on our ability to fit in. Favors were huge. Parking spaces were the coin of the realm.<br> <br>Education and sophistication do not create refined conduct or mutual respect for other humans. One of the real gentlemen at South Water, always willing to help, was illiterate and rumored to have been jailed in Tennessee for killing someone. Poor people and pockets of people hidebound by culture can be as gentle, thoughtful and accepting of change as more 'privileged' souls.<br><br>Finally, feminists are not angry, we do not want to erase the differences between the sexes and we, for the most part, love men dearly. That we want education and financial security and respect should not surprise anyone. That predictions of having baby after baby until we die upset us should not surprise anyone either. And I guarantee that my friend the Tennessee convict could pop a pallet weighing thousands of pounds into our food truck in seconds; his strength exceeded that of any male friend or relative by more multiples than any of us could imagine. So musings by the males of male strength makes me smile since many are likely not that much stronger than me. My point is that our future needs all of us. I think, if we are to successfully engage in a non market world, our dealing have to be based on honor and integrity, not just brute force. 4410<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c8833589411777751092 title="comment permalink">11/8/14, 9:12 AM</a><br><br>

I don't know about the sole purpose of males is to serve females, that feels oppressive. One purpose of males from a evolutionary perspective is to introduce variation into the genome, whereas females are more specialized in genome conservation. I think it might generalize to memes also, in that when a civilization finds itself in a hole women might prefer to dig deeper and maintain the same behaviors that got that hole dug in the first place (because it seems safer and risk taking is at odds with home and hearth and child maintenance), whereas men might try to find a way out. But that is a gross over-generalization. <br><br>When I was working with the self fertilizing nematode C. elegans I noticed that the males are much more adventurous. They are usually produced at a rate of 1 in 200, but when conditions get harsh, more males are produced. They can help reduce inbreeding in this highly inbred organism. Also sperm can only do quick and dirty repair of DNA double strand breaks, or none at all, whereas eggs only do slow and accurate repair of such DNA lesions. So sperm have more mutations than at least young eggs.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c1515566721572571810 title="comment permalink">11/8/14, 9:46 AM</a><br><br>

That has already been a topic in this blog (actually, this week). As for the rest of your argument, it amounts to rephrasing "but it's different this time" - which the Archdruid has been refuting here over and over. It isn't any different this time. That's the whole point of looking at history to make guesses about the future.<br><br>On a general note, gender inequality doesn't necessarily imply treating women bad. A historic example are the Germanic tribes where men and women had different roles, but that didn't mean that women didn't have rights or nothing to say. The example is useful here because the Germanics were the warlords of the falling Rome.<br><br><br>@ Myosotis: The usual derailing of a discussion by misunderstanding descriptive statements (it will be..) as normative ones (it should be..). It doesn't matter who's thrilled or not. Just as it doesn't matter whether or not we're thrilled by peakoil.<br><br>Btw-, Spengler ("Decline of the West") wrote some quite interesting paragraphs concerning women and children. To sum it up, the stance that having children is somehow belittling women is typical for late civilisations and is part of the process of their fall. It was the same in late Greece and Rome, and as we can see, it isn't any different this time.<br><br>Especially because not all women renounce to having children. The upper and middle class is affected, but the underclass is not and thus multiplies until those who are capable of bearing the culture are not there anymore. That is what Spengler calls the "fellah phase" after the collaps, alluding to what was left of Egypt when the modern West colonised it.<br><br>The interesting thing is that in a materialistic viewpoint, the upper/middle classes' renouncing to children looks like a cause for the collapse; but with the concept of the culture soul already dying, it may as well be a consequence instead.

Therefore, allow me to refer you to a statement made by Pope John Paul II in which he said (I paraphrase) that for women there are two vocations, motherhood and consecrated life. For that remark he received a lot of criticism as you can imagine. I invite you to look carefully at what the statement does not say. It does not say women have a vocation to nurture, pamper, protect the vanity of, men. It says we must care for our children. Period.

I am familiar with the strength stats you mention. I find it intriguing the mentions that have been made here of women disguising themselves (or not) and going into battle. Obviously it has happened from time to time. I do wonder what those women looked like. There is a subset of women who are built stronger and with bigger upper bodies. Perhaps the strongest women elected themselves. I doubt if it was ever more than a handful here and there. <br><br>I'm not in any way against women pushing themselves to find their highest potential in any department. But it does bother me, or perhaps I should just say that I "note" that such discussions still seem to me worrisome if at root they are motivated by a desire to prove that women can be just as strong as men. No way, no how, aint' gonna happen. And it is so sad and unfair to use such a standard at all, no more fair than it would be to order a man to produce the holy blood or nurse his newborn.<br><br>Let us honor one another. Brute strength is an attribute, a very useful one, but not the only one.<br><br>Me anyway, rather than being jealous of mens' strength or denying their general tendency to tinker with the outside world, resulting in them doing most of the inventing, I exult and say what marvelous, intelligent, and useful servants we have! I know someone might read that as silly or insulting, but I do really mean that in a sincere and complimentary way. It's just the way things are, resulting from the structure of the universe.<br><br>One reason, however, that I might applaud a woman going into battle is that I am very partial to not forcing people into much of anything. Let the one who marches to a different drummer do so. Let the outliers be outliers without persecution.<br><br>I defended myself once. I was about 18, got off the bus in Los Angeles on a fine summer evening near dusk, and began walking carelessly homeward, not paying attention or walking near the street as I ought to have done but in front of the buildings which had an alley behind them. All of a sudden I felt myself jerked into the alley by a cloth over my mouth. I was not carrying a purse and I assume the motive was rape. I whirled, screamed, and kneed him in the groin.

Violence and skirmishes will be here and there, but most times and places will be relatively stable most of the time. Yes, rape often happens in times of battle, but again it is forgotten and not the norm. In my opinion rape is inexcusable, and if I had a son who had raped anyone or a brother or husband returning from war who had done so, I would remove my affections from them permanently. And I might indeed warn them of that before they depart. <br><br>I am not sure that a warlord and his society would have to oppress women. The native Americans varied, I believe, in their treatment of women, but at least some of them had women voting, and we could consider them as permanent war bands.<br><br>I guess, too, that it depends on what you consider oppressive. In the kind of survivalist societies you seem to be envisioning, there will of course be a division of labor according to gender. What is oppressive is laws that give all rights to a man in divorce, allow him to automatically keep the children, laws that mandate severe punishment for infidelity by a woman but not a man, laws that allow fathers to decide who their daughters will marry, or denying literacy to women.<br><br>On top of that, there is much psychological oppression by the Judeo-Christian-Islamic religious axis and this I believe is the crux of the problem in the west. Although, is it better in the east?<br>The presentation of God or the godhead as all male is horrifying in that on a philosophical level it denies that the female has true existence.

As a self confessed soil geek I always take note of the soils when they are breaking ground for a new building in that show. The observations are reasonably consistent in that they're not much better than the worst soils here and there are many instances where they're not even as good as that.<br><br>Sure, the climate is not as extreme, so there is plenty of green around - so they could recover within a few years with a bit of hard graft and sacrifice - but it all gets down to the soils as to whether a population can feed itself. And, what do you feed the population in the meantime?<br><br>I'd also have to point out that it is probably not a bad idea to consider the aspects surrounding closing the nutrient loss cycle and slowing the flow of water across your landscape. All the nutrients from your imported food are now currently flowing into your waterways and the ocean and this is probably a bad idea and a lost opportunity.<br><br>I've noted that floods seem to be an increasing problem in your country and this often a result of poor management of the watershed - i.e. deforestation and running sheep (a really bad idea - here too) in the high country.<br><br>Also it may be worth pointing out that cereal crops require a reasonably consistent climate and also rainfall at the appropriate times i.e. during the growing times and not during the harvest (which causes the crops to ferment). Extreme weather events seem to be just sort of getting well, more extreme.<br><br>Yesterday here it was 32'C in the shade at lunchtime, but by 6pm it had dropped to 12'C as a cool change hit. Such changes put strain on farm animals - and it can get more extreme than that here.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c9082886489169258269 title="comment permalink">11/8/14, 2:26 PM</a><br><br>

Some of my ancestry is tribal and in that tribe, the Tsalagi/Cherokee had two tribal councils. One was the men's council and the other was the women's council. The men's council allotted to the women the farmland each needed to feed her family. Might not sound fair until you know what the women's council handled. War. It was their husbands, sons and brothers that would go to war, they would risk the loss of the main hunters for their hearths so it was they who decided if a war was worth that risk. That custom almost balanced power evenly but to make sure it was even, one more custom was observed. If a woman had lost all of her masculine familial support due to war, she could petition the men's council to go, to revenge her family's honor. The men would consider the woman's capabilities and if she could keep up on the war trail she was allowed to make war as well. Cherokee Women don't sit down, shut up and let the men make all the decisions.<br><br>For that matter recall the Hopi mother in the Iraq War who died with a dry rifle beside her when her convoy was ambushed. Of course everyone focused on another driver, a cute blond girl who never fired a shot.<br><br>In fact I think you believe the propaganda many European nations formulated that women are incapable of making war. Most of the uprisings in French Polynesia were lead by WOMEN. The French weren't pleased as you can imagine. Neither were they pleased at one African People's resistance to their colonization. They reserved particular vitriol for the army of women who served their King in battle riding trained war Bulls as steeds.<br><br>There are recorded instances in Japan's history of women Samurai, carrying all three swords, just like the men. <br><br>Finally there's the family history of a g'g'grandmother who had enough of drunken beatings and hungry children. Saving a few pennies here and there she prepared for the pay day festivities by putting a new muslin sheet on the bed, getting a brand new broom, setting stout string and a heavy needle under the bed and having her and her children's clothes packed and set behind the front door.<br><br>Her husband came through the door and worked off his drunken temper beating her before he fell on the bed in a sodden stupor. She quickly sewed him up tightly in the NEW sheet, grabbed her broom and beat the holy Hades out of him.<br><br>War isn't JUST men beating their chests and declaring their abilities, its also planning, strategy and courage. Why do you think women have none of these things?<br><br><br><br>Wadulisi<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c2266682330469641349 title="comment permalink">11/8/14, 4:34 PM</a><br><br>

Patriarchy certainly has had a long run and spread widely, mostly by force of arms. But it's not always as successful as it seems; there are those who would argue, for example, that the civilisational predicament in which we now find ourselves is partly created and driven by patriarchal ideation (the identification of Nature as female and subsequent devaluation and even hostility towards "her")... and tottering towards collapse on an impoverished planet hardly seems like "success" to me.<br><br>One interesting side note is that one of the problems faced by early Anglo colonists on the E Coast of N America (a vengefully patriarchal bunch, for the most part) was that women and children would run away to join the indigenes. The so-called "savages" offered more of a life than the home team, and often those who had been "kidnapped by Indians" and then "rescued" (i.e. hunted down and returned to their "rightful owners") ran away again, persistently. This was seen at the time as proof of the diabolical power of the savage to corrupt the European mind; to me, a couple of centuries later, it seems pretty obvious that the colonist men were complete jerks and the "savages" were a lot more fun to live among. So much for the idea that "backwards" cultures can only be worse for women or kids...<br><br>So it is sometimes the case that the good ol' patriarchal culture loses some of its reproductive potential if the guys next door are offering a better deal. Same is true among baboon troops, as Sapolsky observed in the field: the Big Boss Baboon certainly does get away with beating everybody up and raping any female who doesn't run fast enough -- but the females sneak around behind his back to mate voluntarily with non-dominant baboons who are much nicer and often form lifelong friendships with females. So much for alpha-hood enforcing genetic monopoly :-) Also it turns out the alpha male baboon suffers from stress-related illnesses and may not live as long as the nice guys...<br><br>Of course, in the long run the indigenes lost that conflict :-( (and patriarchal human cultures may yet wipe out baboons as well, the nice along with the nasty). But then in the longer run, the colonial civilisation that decimated them is losing a larger game. Who knows whether N America may one day again see cultures similar to those First forest and plains Nations... and maybe women and kids from the warlord cultures will run away into the forest to join the savages :-)<br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c3799148904046697570 title="comment permalink">11/8/14, 4:39 PM</a><br><br>

And I think that not getting pregnant back to back is a big part of that. As a woman who has always had a strongish drive, I would have been destroyed by having to choose between my marriage and unwanted, excess pregnancy. Certainly in this I feel some anger at the Roman church. In my opinion this is perhaps the most common cause of human misery and ill health, and so easily rectified. To continue this stance in the face of the world population crisis is myopic and suicidally rigid. As to the pope's statement, I am confused.

As I've tried to point out here and elsewhere, the history of gender relations is far more complex than either left-wing or right-wing stereotypes suggest. <br><br>Bill, I hadn't heard about Stephen Gaskin's death. I read a number of his early books back in the day. <br><br>Cherokee, I'll have to go look up what's available on the history of money. What I'll be talking about is actually more specialized: what happens to monetary systems in dark ages, and, ahem, what happens to the people who try to rely on monetary systems in dark ages. <br><br>Phil, okay, given the absence of modern inputs, it's going to be tough but potentially doable. I hope the government has the common sense to encourage a return to crofting as things get tight. <br><br>Marcello, no question, we enjoy huge advantages as a result of the reckless consumption of half a billion years of fossil sunlight. The point I was trying to make is simply that idealizing the past isn't the only possible mistake -- it's also very common for people to use the past as a dumping ground for fantasies on the other end of the scale, which are just as inaccurate. <br><br>Daelach, I'm not sure if you're aware that flintlocks have had a major revival in the US and are readily available. I'm far from sure that percussion caps won't be an option -- this is early 19th century technology, after all, and the revolvers that were standard personal weapons in the old West were made using handpowered equipment. Thus the use of firearms for personal defense and, more important, the defense of communities is pretty much a given in the deindustrial era, and musket battles don't have much in common with a soccer game, you know. <br><br>Ed-M, oh, granted. The town where I live is too small to have a really entrenched urban political machine, so there's more flexibility here. <br><br>Varun, glad to hear it. <br><br>Marcello, peasants in the Middle Ages got about one day off in every three -- every significant saint's day was a holiday from work. So you're not quite doing as well as your medieval equivalent in that department!<br><br>Claudia, the label "angry feminists" doesn't imply that all feminists are angry; it implies a distinction between those who spend a lot of their time expressing anger from those who don't. If you haven't encountered those who do, be glad. <br><br>Marin, funny. I hope they don't slap you with a lawsuit for misdirecting them. <br><br>Tony, the political implications of firearms in the deindustrial dark age is a fascinating question. Will firearms prevent a feudal system from forming? Will they lead to some kind of modified feudalism? Will the standard sort of post-dark age feudalism evolve anyway? None of us know for sure, nor will we have the chance to find out -- but it's an interesting question.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c2645935794504138000 title="comment permalink">11/8/14, 8:39 PM</a><br><br>

I don't anticipate any such gap opening up in the future, not least because (a) the fossil fuel reserves that made the 19th century US so powerful are gone forever, and (b) firearms are a relatively simple technology and sufficiently advantageous in war that I don't imagine anyone will let it become a lost technology. Thus a future conflict between warlord societies and indigenes will likely take place on much more equal terms. <br><br>Shane, don't worry, I'm not going to chatter on about social media or start bringing in irrelevant ads and the like. I thought long and hard before posting links to my books alongside the blog, and that's about as far as I feel like taking things.

Speaking for myself, a Riddley Walker kind of future is probable, if not inevitable. But Aristotle defined rhetoric (more or less, and paraphrasing from memory), as finding the available means of persuasion in any given case. Preaching to the choir is one thing. Preaching to those among my friends and acquaintances who could use persuasion is another. They will be impervious to what appear to them to be "faith-based" arguments, that the past is a predictor of the future. Most people believe in a linear, not a circular, view of history. To break them of that habit, some strong empirical arguments would help, such as, as I suggested, to do what you envision will exhaust the available supply of conventional energy to make that happen, or X, Y, or Z will occur to make it impossible (e.g., a climate or biological or whatever catastrophe).

In the 17th and 18th century the firearms in America all came from Europe. So did all the gun powder. The typical European, transplanted farmer had no firearms and had little experience using firearms. In conflicts, the state armouries were found under stocked and the stored weapons in need of major repairs. Many colonel governments gave firearms to the friendly native tribes to use against hostile tribes attacking the frontier. Militias were suspect in training and enthusiasm. An armed pioneer fighting off the Indians on a log cabin farm was a Hollywood invention. The book Arming America tells about this time.<br><br>In a scary future with a drastic reduction in manufacturing capability we could see no power to run our giant milling machines and no way to use local mechanical power to convert them. The sources of steel and other materials would be lacking. Steel for cutting tools must be harder in order to cut the softer steel of the barrels. Finding adequate supplies of special steel may be difficult. Our American steel mills have been reduced in number and in capabilities. Files and drills must be a different steel and making them is a complex operation. We would lack machines, raw materials, tools, skilled workers and knowledge.<br><br>Gun powder is difficult to manufacture and must be done in an isolated location. The base materials may be difficult to find in nature. I had a friend whose father made gun powder in the sand dunes of northern Scotland, in winter, with wooden bowls and carts and froze his butt off with nothing to warm himself, but occasional cups of tepid tea. It was all done outside, in bunkers cut into the dunes. Duplicating that simple operation may not be possible, today. Primitive manufacture still takes expert information and transmitting it across generations in perilous times may be impossible. Remember there is no Internet in most envisioned futures. Written information is quickly disappearing and knowledge of simple tasks is not passed on.<br><br>A slowed, controlled descent may save some firearms manufacturing skills and practices with a concentrated effort. It would take an effort by knowledgeable people who can control the chain vertically from sources to sales.

A lot of positions in the corporate world were piled during on during the postwar boom years that weren't really necessary to the essential functioning of business. One may well ask why any business would do such a thing, and the answer would be that it was a mass program to buy off the American middle class. <br><br>We were able to do that in this country because in those heady years, we had pretty much no postwar rebuilding to do, unlike the rest of the industrialized world including the USSR. The world was our oyster, as it were. But when our domestic oil production entered terminal decline in the late eighties and we had to start competing in the newly globalized market more on its terms and less on our own terms, we had to be more practical. That meant, as one poignant chapter in Susan Faludi's book <i>Stiffed</i> illustrated as an example, that the McDonald-Douglas aerospace manufacturing company had to eliminate the positions of many "engineers" who had never even been to engineering school. Little did those down-sized white-collar workers appreciate that this was only a logical extension of the policy that began about a decade earlier of outsourcing our manufacturing jobs to cheap third-world labor.<br><br>In the stair-step pattern of catabolic collapse, of course, that was just the first round of readjustment by way of disintermediation following a significant decline in available energy. It made possible the continuation of business as usual, though the elites and their hangers-on benefited rather more from the readjustment than the actual producers of goods and services, as you noted in this post. If that past round of disintermediation brought out some pretty dysfunctional aspects of the national character, I shudder to imagine what will happen when a subsequent round of disintermediation means no more business as usual.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c4291873692946683407 title="comment permalink">11/9/14, 6:23 AM</a><br><br>

Susana operates Salamander Springs on a shoestring budget, she salvages a lot of her materials. She claims to get by on $10,000 a year, and models her operation on her time spent farming in Guatemala. It seemed like voluntary poverty to me. What also amazed me was how many other like minded families were also homesteading in the same holler. She mentions E F Schumacher in her handouts. You might ask JMG, who also lives in Appalachia, but I think that it is uniquely situated for monastic preservation for the coming dark ages. The unforgiving terrain should keep out the riff raff, and the dogged autonomy of the people/culture should be a buffer to allow disintermediation. (Most of the people in this holler were free to pursue what they wanted without outside interference/harassment). Only if we do get a fascist dictator with a egomaniacal bent do I see Appalachia being at risk, and even then, it'd be a hard area to subdue. If I remember correctly from reading it in high school, according to Night Comes to the Cumberlands, the original inhabitants of Appalachia were indentured servants fleeing their servitude- -that should tell you something about the nature of the terrain. :)<br>Regarding gender, I too, am sceptical about shrill claims that we must revert to an oppressive past once the dark ages commences. It's certainly possible that sexism, homophobia, and a repressive form of Judeo-Christian morality particularly concerning sex sees a resurgence, but it's not a given, and, even if it did, there's no reason to think it wouldn't be temporary. I think the shrill insistence says more about those insisting on its guaranteed return than anything. Certainly the diversity of experience regarding gender norms (I'm including the acceptance of the atypical/queer here as well) among not only humans, but social primates as well simply doesn't mean a guaranteed return to the norms of the recent Western past.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c2692395544324313103 title="comment permalink">11/9/14, 8:04 AM</a><br><br>

Switching to monocropping and cash cropping is recommended as a path to prosperity but often ends up leading instead to overcapitalisation, debt, and land loss.<br><br>The rise in the number of farmer suicides corresponds quite strongly with "liberalisation" policy shifts in Indian government and trade regulation. The region has been agricultural for several millennia. without being famous for its suicidal farmers until the last couple of decades. I really don't think we can blame the tragedy on the inherent awfulness of farming per se.<br><br>Ironically, or appropriately, many of these suicidal farmers have ended their lives by drinking the same pesticides they went into debt to purchase.

Can you offer an alternative link, please? What Chris says about the deification of permaculture theory is quite true, though, and that's always to be avoided. I gather Geof Lawton has been having another go in Jordan, to make it stay working this time. <br><br>I'm a pragmatist in my own growing work, always. What works, works. Try to improve it all the time. That's about the extent of my rule. Still do no-till and much-mulch, though. Works well in Britain's climate. I have slugs, but no particular slug problem. And that's after I had to rehome my Muscovy ducks, because the neighbours found them too messy.<br><br>Bill Pulliam, I sort of blame the sheep too. But in the end it comes down to human practices, really. If sheep are not used as a destructive monoculture, and if their numbers are kept restrained; and if you never so overstock that they destroy forest regrowth, then they can co-exist. <br><br>One important key, I suspect, apart from intelligent restraint by the human shepherds, together with a diversified food-getting way of life, not just pastoralism exclusively, is that all the wild species need to be present too, alongside the restrained pastoral practices. Let them live in the woods as welcome, respected neighbours (who also contribute their share to your food-budget, obviously). The big predators are an essential part of this, once you see the ecological necessity for them. And - as indicated above - the key to keeping small, vulnerable flocks of prey species in predator country is shepherd dogs. See Robert Denlinger's hands-on experiences stock-farming in Kentucky for an illustration of this: <br><br>http://www.denstarfarm.us/Index.htm<br><br>The Old World shepherd dogs have made a quiet but big hit in NAmerica since their methodical introduction by USDA-sponsored breeding and placing programmes started in the 1970s.

Of course what happens to monetary systems during a Dark Age is well after that time. Dante's inferno is probably as good a guide as any! I look forward to reading your forthcoming essay.<br><br>Yeah, deflation occurred after the Civil war as well as during the Great Depression.<br><br>However, I believe that you are correct and stagflation is the most likely outcome this time around. It is already happening anyway. The reason behind my thinking is because the printing presses are being spun quite hard this time around, whereas historically there was a modicum of restraint with central banks at least - at least the ones with a long history that didn't go under. Monetary policy can only go so far before it become ineffective and/or worsening the situation.<br><br>Interestingly too, for only a very short while the money supply traditionally used to be gold backed - which I have to agree with Galbraith is a bad thing for society. Gold backed means that money is redeemable in gold at a bank (good luck with that one!). It is unrealistic to suggest that money may be redeemable for gold, because how could the banks lend that gold from deposits? Little wonder there were runs and other shenanigans.<br><br>However, nowadays I would have to say that money is secured on real property, which appears at face value to be great because no one really knows what property is actually worth.<br><br>It should be remembered that loans are also secured against the estimated value of real property.<br><br>But in a globalised world if various Industrial economies spin their money printing presses, house and land prices go up in Australia as well as in other countries where those funds eventually end up.<br><br>Raising real property prices appears to me to be the one game left in town for the powers that be to grow the money supply. Goodness knows that it is being defended here with everything they have to throw at it. Take that away and we may just see behind the curtains and note that the reality is that the returns from business and investment aren't that great.<br><br>Scary stuff.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: There is a new blog entry <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Children of the corn</a>, where I discuss demons and gardening. Truly, it was a tough thing working those two usually unrelated topics together - coherently too. Plus some cool photos, more steps, a bit of shed and lots of fruit and flowers.

You have some interesting ideas, to be sure.<br><br>Re: this post, I currently live in the not-quite-rebuilt Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans. It's an er... interesting place. I would advise not to listen much to any of the occasional news articles that come out about it by these people who come in for a few hours, take a few pictures, and leave. I'm assuming (maybe too much) but from the tenor and scope of what you have written here that you are probably familiar with such terms and concepts as secondary succession and (of course) rural life. Things are very - strange out here now, and still evolving. <br><br>What you say about the State demanding people go to certain markets and channels to earn their living and such is very true - but (if you've read Heinlein) when I first got back here in 2010 I began to quickly realize the neighborhood had become a sort of Abandoned Area; where regulation, police presence, and people are almost nil. Something less than a ghost town, but not quite a neighborhood or city. People do what they want. It isn't post-money yet, but there's a certain level at which money has become very slightly less important and you can see how it could become so in time. People keep goats and chickens and there are a number of community gardens and fruit trees. Some people fish for food. There's a fair number of "squatters". Wild animals have been slowly creeping back in as well.<br><br>A lot of the newer houses that have been built are "green" - rainwater collecting, solar panels, etc. Rain and water are something we get plenty of down here, of course.<br><br>There's a hodgepodge of laws that make any of these things difficult, expensive, or illegal but people do some of them anyway, Putting them together would make some of these homes essentially small, self-sustaining farms. <br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c5381202176468548370 title="comment permalink">11/10/14, 6:20 AM</a><br><br>

However, something like an AK or a bolt lock rifle is not that hard to make and lasts for a long time. The point is that those societies can not compete with more egalitarian amd technological societies. <br><br>if you don't have firearms and you can't get them, eventually you, or your land at least, is likely to be assimilated by a neighbour who does have them.<br><br>Efficient armies consist of disciplined, group oriented men with good health, meaning good diet, and motivation. For this reason free peasants have often been considered prime requiting material. Feudal organization might field fifty such people against 500 fielded by a democratic society where everyone fights. And that's generous. <br><br>Then there are the roving gangs of murderers that Greer has mentioned. Such a group can realistically kill feudal elites and take their place, and the peasantry should accept the new arrangement pretty easily. Do that to a democracy and you need to kill half the men there, or maybe even every adult. <br><br>Also, the differences in population and technology are likely to grow over time. Authoritarian, inequal societies focus on extracting wealth and prevent the development and spread of new tehnologies. See Why Nations Fail for details on that. <br><br>Equal societies tend to improve tehnologies and make productive investments since it is the only way to enrich the majoity. Due to better diet, since people produce mostly for themselves and with better technology, democratic societies would have more population growth. Eventually, they might not settle for tribute, since they would need farmland for their people.<br><br>Lastly, feudal society could be easily destabilized. Simply providing them a steady stream of bullets and firearms could keep the rebels going.<br><br>There is likely to be a wide variety of social organizations, but some of those that can field large numbers of competent, well-armed soldiers might just go Rome on societies that consist of a few thugs robbing broken peasants.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c2632263017365697362 title="comment permalink">11/10/14, 7:40 AM</a><br><br>

A couple of interesting points that seem relevant to the discussion(s) occurring this week:<br><br>- An indigenous spiritual leader was there for part of the weekend, representing the main local tribe. Amazing man. I asked him how he avoided frustration given the ongoing struggles of his people &amp; the fact that the world continues to race for the edge of the cliff as fast as it can. He looked me dead in the eye and calmly (and strongly) said, "I and every other tribal holy man I know are all on the 300-year plan." Meaning they are focusing on preserving their people's cultural teachings and values for success during and after the long descent. The good news is that a number of tribes are experiencing cultural and spiritual revival today. God speed, I say.<br><br>I'm not going to wade into the whole gender thing other than to say that when someone is trying to write a specific prescription for the future, it has more to do with the internal state of the author than the actual likelihood of it coming to pass. Yes, many past cultures had relatively strict gender-based roles, but in many of them, women had a lot of power and widely varied roles. Just because we're going into a long descent does not mean we wake up a few decades from now in ISIS-like conditions. <br><br>I have more to add on birth control, but since that will involve me attempting links here for the first time (thanks, Chris), I will create a separate post.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c8025498302244161792 title="comment permalink">11/10/14, 9:26 AM</a><br><br>

Here in North America, round one of collapse is bearing down on us (and I'd venture to say round two is bearing down on Europe due to their close ties to the U.S.), however, I'd venture to say that for the BRICS countries that will be the powers that be of scarcity industrialism, collapse is not bearing down on them at all, that their power hasn't even peaked yet. They'll probably be witnessing the collapse of the West from afar, the same way the U.S. witnessed Europe's implosion from afar during the early 20th century. Just as the U.S. was ascendant as Europe imploded, so the BRICS are ascendant as the West collapses. They're in different places. While we in the West have to prepare for pending collapse, other countries have a lot more breathing room. Of course, limits to growth still apply, but BRICS countries could have another 50 yrs or so before decline/collapse sets in.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c261485385156353935 title="comment permalink">11/10/14, 10:03 AM</a><br><br>

Fossil trees are abundant in the peat hags, and I quote: "throughout many parts of the Highlands". Other evidence suggests rapid migrations of the northern tree line thought to be the result of climatic control (Sutherland). The explosion of Hekla in Iceland looks as though it also had something to do with the southward shift of pine about 4000 years ago (Caithness).<br><br>I think it can be concluded that climate in Scotland has been unstable in the Holocene due to the extreme oceanic position, and that tree cover at higher elevation especially in the wetter west and further north, altered accordingly. <br><br>I am looking just now at a book of conference proceedings from 1993 (I attended) <i>Scotland since pre-history</i>, Ed TC Smout.<br><br>best<br>Phil<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c6135640523979178643 title="comment permalink">11/10/14, 2:30 PM</a><br><br>

Of course, I also know young married and cohabiting couples; usually both partners work and a female relative provides childcare. <br><br>I can only speculate as the the reason for changes I have noticed. Increasing intrusiveness of social service agencies may be one. It only takes one run in with CPS to cure any young women with a grain of sense of I Just Want Someone To Love Me syndrome.

That said, what's concerning to me, from the standpoint of women's rights, is that much of the appeal of warbands to young men is the hyper-masculine image that they project. What is it that lures young middle-class men to leave their comfortable lives in the West and fight for ISIS? Or what draws Dutch biker gangs to Iraq to fight for the Kurds on a volunteer basis? It is the violence itself that appeals to such men-- the supposed ideals, whether radical Islam or radical ethnic revanchism or something else-- are often as not just a pretext for the violence. An ISIS fighter holding up a Kurdish woman's severed head and posting a picture of it on Facebook, or a Gulf Cartel criminal kidnapping a doctor in Mexico and tweeting her murder in real-time from her own phone after she criticized his gang on Twitter... these things seem very manly and cool to a certain segment of the world's population-- especially compared to the alternative of being a serf to the senile "genial duffers" of the world, who are clearly on the way out anyway. And when we talk about warbands running the show in a few generations (or even sooner), well, those guys <i>are</i> the warbands. <i>Those</i> are the kind of men who will be deciding whether women get to keep their rights or not. I <i>hope</i> that the warbands that ultimately prevail will be more like the Kurds and less like ISIS or Boko Haram or the Zeta Cartel, but it's not a forgone conclusion that this will be the case. I confess I'm not optimistic about the future in this regard though.<br><br>When an empire is in its early, healthy days the creative minority can redirect men who are disposed to hyper-masculine passions toward productive ends (productive from the standpoint of empire-building, that is, e.g. conquest of new lands). Later on, the dominant minority can still keep them in check with force. An empire in the terminal stages of decline though gradually loses the ability to keep the warbands from forming and going on the rampage, like a sickly old person's immune system gradually losing the ability to fight off infections. Eventually the warbands win and the cycle starts again.<br><br>So, perhaps it's true that gender relations have shifted fundamentally in North America, but that won't mean a whole lot when some "genial duffer" a few years down the road gets the bright idea to hire some South American cartel-linked "security consultants" to settle a disputed national election or to quell a popular uprising. When the "Hour of the Knife" comes and the old order is swept away, the rights and concessions that have been won from that old order at great effort might not stand.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c9060332597533244311 title="comment permalink">11/10/14, 3:48 PM</a><br><br>

It starts on the front page below the fold. Since most of you are not going to do that, I'm going to take the liberty of posting an extended summary. <br><br>Last year, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta ordered that all ground combat jobs be open to women, with the loophole that each service has until 1/1/16 to prove that women can't perform a particular job. "If members of our military can meet the qualifications for a job, then they should have the right to serve, regardless of creed, color, gender or sexual orientation," Panetta said.<br><br>Most of the article is about the Marine Corp's response to the DOD directive. The Corps has set up a unit of volunteers (105 women, 295 men)from the enlisted ranks to settle the question of whether women can fight alongside men in ground combat. It's called the Ground Combat Element Integrated Task Force. They are training together and then will be observed by researchers during a series of live-fire attacks. High tech sensors are being used during training and later on tests to assess how troops of different sizes and sexes perform together in combat.<br><br>"[The unit includes] some of the first female graduates of the Corps' ground-combat schools . . . [as well as] men and women who were working as clerks, cargo loaders or in other support jobs." The top artilleryman in the howitzer class was an artillerywoman, and women were the best performers in Corps schools for tank, amphibious-assault vehicle and light-armored reconnaissance crews." Readers of this blog will note that these are highly mechanized crews. <br><br>"Four of nine women in the tank school failed out, however, largely because of difficulties lifting the heavy shells in to the main gun. And just 40% of the women in the recent infantry school class graduated, compared with 95% of the men."<br><br>" 'We want to collect the data and do the research before we open the positions," said Capt. Maureen Krebs, a Marine Corps spokeswoman, " because we don't want to set female Marines up for failure.' " " 'We're not going to lower standards, period,' said Lt. Col. Mike Sandarov, who developed the Marine' approach to the gender-integration order."<br><br>(to be continued in my next post)<br><br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c2926022743847341983 title="comment permalink">11/10/14, 4:04 PM</a><br><br>

The combat experiences of women in Iraq and Afghanistan--like those of openly gay troops--have mostly sidelined that objection. "This isn't about women in combat," Lt. Col. Samarov said. "We consider that a settled issue."<br><br>"Female Marines have previously tried to complete the training required of infantry officers.

Paul Johnson, a scientist . . . designed an experiment he said would take the bias out of the decision about women in ground combat jobs.

We don't know what it'll take to build functioning fusion reactors -- nobody's managed the trick yet -- and nobody knows what would be needed to construct an infrastructure to harvest it on the Moon, get it back to Earth, and then fuse it in these reactors we don't know how to build yet. <br><br>Thus debating the helium-3 business is a little like discussing the health effects of unicorn horns, when nobody has one to test or knows if unicorns actually exist; the partisans of unicorn-based health care can make whatever claims they want, and the only answer is "you don't know that." Based on what we know about fusion power and space travel, the whole thing will be stunningly uneconomical -- but of course the helium-3 brigade can insist that unspecified technological advances that haven't been made yet will solve that problem too, and so on rabbiting on endlessly into the night. That's why such claims are popular -- they can't be disproved, and so allow true believers in the myth of progress to cling to the fantasy. <br><br>Doom, among the many problems with the book <i>Arming America</i> is the far from minor fact that firearms were made in the colonies from a very early time -- the claim that all firearms used in the colonies and early US were imports is quite simply false. Have you heard of the Kentucky long rifle? <a href=http://frontierfolk.org/ky-lr.htm rel=nofollow>Here's a page of good info</a> about these classical, handmade American firearms, which are still being made and used today, by the way. <br><br>Marin, good question. It depends on how big of a corporation is involved -- many corporations have taken to using harassment lawsuits as an ordinary business tactic. <br><br>Marcello, oh, granted -- it's difficult to compare the two. The point I wanted to make is simply that the comparison doesn't automatically privilege the current way of doing things. <br><br>Mister R., good. Yes, that's part of what's been driving the collapse in labor force participation rates for the last few decades, and yes, it's likely to get much uglier as we proceed. <br><br>WDW, I'll consider it, but three hours of rah-rah for the Great God Progress sounds rather like an ordeal to me. <br><br>Bruno, yes, it is that bad here. In some areas it's worse. <br><br>Crow Hill, I think the believers in progress have, er, progressed from living in La-La Land to living on La-La Planet. As for paradigm shifts, it's not usually a matter of theories being readjusted, but of theories being thrown out and new ones having to be invented from scratch. Thomas Kuhn's <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i> is worth reading on this subject. <br><br>Jyankowski, thank you. <br><br>Jonathan, or you could take a look at the women of ancient Sparta and see how well they fit the current stereotype of women as "naturally" peacable, kind, non-hierarchical, etc. <br><br>Marcello, exactly. A lot of 18th and 19th century designs are still in use today, and not just by reenactment groups; there are plenty of gunsmiths who know how to make and maintain them, and there are many readily available formulations for gunpowder.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c1484210951497237316 title="comment permalink">11/10/14, 9:30 PM</a><br><br>

There are gunsmiths in most rural towns of any size, and handbuilt guns of various kinds feature in local popular culture -- not long ago one of the Masonic lodges raffled off a stunning Kentucky long rifle with Masonic symbols carved into the stock, to raise money for charity. It had been handbuilt by a gunsmith and donated for the purpose, and yes, I bought a ticket (though I didn't win the gun). <br><br>Karl, excellent! Thanks for the links. <br><br>Moe, I discussed that a while back. The short version is that the military we have now is so dependent on wildly extravagant and fragile technosystems that military defeat is one of the more likely ways US hegemony could come crashing down. My recent novel <a href=http://www.karnacbooks.com/product/twilights-last-gleaming/34386/ rel=nofollow>Twilight's Last Gleaming</a> is about that. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, oh, no doubt.

We can look for instance at British history: almost all the good or reasonably productive cultivated land (arable) has not been cultivated by crofters for almost 200 years in either Scotland or England. Surplus crofters from Highland and other very marginal farming areas in western Scotland arriving in cities or crossing the Atlantic were only part of an overall displacement of surplus farm labour from rural to urban. I have figures for England where by 1850 only 22% of the population was employed in agriculture. When in the latter half of 19thC the return on earlier 18thC and 19thC investment in British farming (for the growing largely urban market) became uncompetitive in the face of new imports, much of British farming again shed people.<br><br>However, considering the present day, there was talk a few years ago of "wind-crofting" in Scotland, which might not be as daft as it sounds, but it is hard to see it reaching any scale. It might just be like having a 'stripper oil well' on your property producing half a barrel a day. And for a community, wind-farming might be as durable as having a small coal mine.

I use a flintlock rifle for hunting, and there is no part on it that I cannot make myself or hire a blacksmith to make for me. The same cannot be said about modern firearms, which are produced by factories and require ultra precision machinery and tiny parts that a blacksmith cannot make.<br><br>I expect modern firearms to be used extensively at first, but then after the ammo and spare parts run out, most people will resort to simple, old fashioned black powder weapons that do not require a factory to make or repair. In fact, I would expect flintlocks, and in particular the Kentucky Rifle, to be the main hunting firearm after 2100 or 2150 (I'm being generous here timewise, I think, since most modern firearms can go through a box of ammo pretty fast compared to a flintlock.)<br><br>At the rifle range, I can fire off about 20 rounds from my Kentucky Rifle in 4 hours, whereas if I were using a bolt action rifle, I could easily go through several hundred or even more than a thousand rounds in the same time period.

The typical warband material is young frustrated male with little prospects and even less hope. They are out to grab back what they think they are entitled for and to make those who denied that to them pay dearly. Having a girl in the unit means males have to restrain themselves (unless said female probes to be extra-degenerate, e.g. welcome as "one of the boys")<br><br>Military forces that are fighting in a defense roll do not have this issues, and women can be highly effective in a modern setting (from the same article, see YPG female fighters). As others have pointed out, by losing fertile age females you do lose the potential to bounce back demographically, but this matters little if you are facing a war of extermination. Sometimes short term benefits do pay out, and doubling your potential force is too big an upside to be left out without further thought.<br><br>@Patricia,<br>Yes, it will worse for the individual female fighters. They will draw disproportionate hostility from the enemy, for the reasons best explained in the article.

Whenever someone says that "most animals" do something therefore we are the same, you know they are talking out their posteriors. Other than the basic biochemistry, there is pretty much nothing that "most animals" do. "Most animals" are insects, I believe, and they generally don't have a whole lot of protective behavior about anyone but themselves and their own very young offspring, if even that much. Like many people, you proably meant "mammals" when you said "animals." OK, most mammals are rodents. In most rodents there is zero parental care or mate guarding provided by the male. But in reality, there is nothing that "most mammals" can be claimed to do when it comes to social structures, and there are example of just about every sort of social structure you can reasonably imagine.

Not only that. The economic theory theory also adapts to tell everyone that less is more. So Keynesians make everyone believe that if the state "invests" some sum of money in the economy then a multiplier effect will double that money. Even if that were true (studies show it is baloney), then the state has to first collect the money somewhere else. If there is a multiplying at work so must be a shrinking due to the sum "stolen" previously to finance the other "wise" effort. However, since the tax collector and the subsidy "shell-outer" must both eat too, some money will be set aside to feed these two (hundred ...). hence whatever the state does shrinks the economy. The bigger state gets, the more shrinks the economy. f you can't see it (yet) it's because state uses money loaned from somewhere else to fill the gaps.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c4577564735070406911 title="comment permalink">11/12/14, 8:34 AM</a><br><br>

On one hand, men are a threat to women who will rape and dominate them. On the other hand, males are hardwired to protect women so will endanger themselves and other men on their side of a battle by protecting women comrades rather than all equally. I would argue that few male animals are "hardwired" to protect females. In animals that have harems, the males are protecting their own sexual access from other males, not protecting the lives or safely of the females and their offspring. Among deer, for example, Bambi to the contrary, the male doesn't usually stay around after breeding season. Among wild horses, the stallion may stay to the back of a fleeing herd to distract predators, but the mares lead the herd. Among many mammals the male is a hazard to a female and her young--male bears and some cats will kill the young and females must fight to protect their offspring. <br><br>On the topic of birth control I would note that abortion by D and C is very low tech--tools for it are found in Greek and Roman times.

In complex societies, a lot of economic activity is impersonal exchange governed by written law. In simple societies there is little of that. As JMG wrote, most economic activity is an expression of longstanding personal relationships. Some societies have a mix.<br><br>Some commenters seem to be looking forward to getting rid of intermediaries. I'd like to point out that economies that are based more on personal relationships than on formal rules which apply to everybody have drawbacks. <br><br>One is that the treatment you get from other economic actors may depend as much on what your relatives have done, including people who died before you were born, as on what you do. This can favor or hurt you. As in the story about Higg, the lord may give you a customary privilege because of a service your grandfather performed. It's equally likely that the miller will hate you and always give you short measure because one of your male relatives got one of his female relatives pregnant and then couldn't come up with the bride price. <br><br>You will be dealing with the same people, plus their sons and daughters, for your entire life, and can never get away from them. Unfortunately, ordinary life contains many occasions for causing offense and accumulating resentment. <br><br>Some essential economic activity can't be done independently by a single household because it requires sharing of equipment and labor. Everyone knows when their neighbors have a rite of passage (wedding, birth, funeral) and there will be customs about who gets invited to those rites, what they are expected to bring, and how they are supposed to behave as guests. <br><br>These days, if your neighbor borrows your lawnmower, keeps it for six weeks, and returns it in bad condition, you won't lend him any other tools and might give him a frosty greeting when you run into him. If his son has an accident using the mower, he'll sue your insurance company to cover his medical bills. Eventually one of you will move away and in the meantime the bad relationship can be compartmentalized from the rest of your life.<br><br>If the two of you have to help each other with thatching and harvesting every year, and your daughters have to be invited to each other's lying-in regardless of whether they like each other, there's going to be at least one elderly female relative on each side who is keeping score of all the bad behavior in the other family. Unless the culture of this village includes periodic ceremonies for reconciliation and forgiveness of debts, decades of accumulated petty grudges between neighbors can take a lethal turn, either in the form of blood feuds or in witchcraft accusations followed by a lynching. <br><br>There is a book called Witches and Neighbours, by Robin Briggs, that shows how this dynamic played out in French and English villages in the early modern period.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c1737061089106776079 title="comment permalink">11/12/14, 4:26 PM</a><br><br>

Doesn't seem like this supposed wiring is doing its job all that well.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c6065243228544806689 title="comment permalink">11/12/14, 4:48 PM</a><br><br>

But that's another story)<br><br>One of the signature characteristics of the Shepherd Dog family is the wheel tail: curling into anything from a corkscrew, through a watchspring shape, to just a slight forward bend. <br><br>Much more important, though, is the selective breeding that brought out their tendency to be particularly devoted and protective to their own clan members, which - as they imprint on the creatures around them in their first sixteen weeks of life - can include particular, individual humans, and - interestingly enough - particular, individual lambs, goats or whatever, with whom they're growing up in step. They're incredibly good at being able to recognise individual familiar creatures. <br><br>I reckon the other thing the shepherd-breeders did, perhaps without putting it quite like this to themselves, was to select for a balanced blend of doting, maternal lovingness - in both sexes - and a committed, redoubtable courage in defending their own. Good Shepherd Dogs, like good Mastiffs/Bulldogs, just will not back down in the face of threat, danger, or battering. <br><br>Had a few like that myself! The key is to win their love, by loving them demonstratively, which they love! I even won over a particularly feisty adult rescue Anatolian like that. They then will die rather than hurt you, and will include you on their 'kindred to be defended to the death' list. <br><br>And yes, the Macedonian Sarplaninas are part of the kindred.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c866897037890574585 title="comment permalink">11/13/14, 1:43 AM</a><br><br>

You do not imagine how corrupted the whole thing is becoming.<br><br>You were talking about the many ways science has "whored itself", and colleagues just sent me this week two perfect examples to illustrate this.<br><br>First, as you know, to survive professionally we're supposed to publish as much as possible, and quite often quantity trumps quality: "publish or perish" as we say. The result is an exponential growth of scientific papers, of which most do not contain any significative result, and most of them present results which are just plain wrong, or at least not reproducible, which is especially worrying in biology and medecine. Even meta-studies have been published showing that amongst publications in medecine, more than two third present results that happen to be non-reproducible.<br><br>Science publishing is becoming a strange business, with a market increasing in size to satisfy all these scientists who struggle to publish whatever tiny results they can to advance their career. To satisfy these demands, each year predatory publishers create new scientific journals, often on a pay-to-publish model, with quality criteria going lower and lower, but very efficient to suck out the money from the labs. If you pay enough, your paper will be published, whatever the quality is. I receive quite a lot of spam from editors suggesting that I should publish in their journals, or even become an (unpaid) prestigious editor for them. Since the Sokal affair (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair), a game amongst scientists, especially young physicists and mathematicians, is to ridiculise this process by submitting rubbish papers, full of non-sense, sometimes generated by computer algorithms, just to see if the paper will succeed to pass the reviewers, the editors, and finally get published. We just reached a new low recently, as two scientists got a paper published in "International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology" which just contains the same profanity repeated on several pages:<br><br>https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/11/21/journal-accepts-profanity-laden-joke-paper<br>http://www.vox.com/2014/11/21/7259207/scientific-paper-scam<br><br>The second example is about ranking. Now, for managers in universities and research centers, the alpha and omega in science is to obtain a good ranking for your institution in various international rankings, like the (in)famous "Shanghai ranking". University managers, sometimes even governments are now hiring "science stars", merging universities, reorganising whole sectors of research just to optimize their ranking. I personally know the case of a university hiring a very old Nobel price, not doing any significant research since decades, just to improve its ranking... (the number of Nobel prices in your university improves your university ranking).<br><br>For a scientific institution/university, ranking is mostly based on the amount of publications in scientific journals where the authors indicate that they belong to that given institution. Recently, an obscure Saudi Arabia university managed to reach a very good ranking in mathematics, just by asking hundreds of the best mathematicians of the world to pretend, when they publish a paper, to be affiliated to that Saudi Arabia university, for some money of course:<br><br>http://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/10/31/to-some-a-citation-is-worth-3-per-year/<br><br>We live in interesting times...<br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-end-of-market-economy.html#c1962276919357371322 title="comment permalink">12/4/14, 11:45 PM</a><br><br>
