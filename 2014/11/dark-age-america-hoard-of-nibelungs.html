<div class=MsoNormal>
Of all the differences that separate the feudal economy sketched out in last week’s post from the market economy most of us inhabit today, the one that tends to throw people for a loop most effectively is the near-total absence of money in everyday medieval life. Money is so central to current notions of economics that getting by without it is all but unthinkable these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The fact—and of course it is a fact—that the vast majority of human societies, complex civilizations among them, have gotten by just fine without money of any kind barely registers in our collective imagination. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One source of this curious blindness, I’ve come to think, is the way that the logic of money is presented to students in school. Those of my readers who sat through an Economics 101 class will no doubt recall the sort of narrative that inevitably pops up in textbooks when this point is raised. You have, let’s say, a pig farmer who has bad teeth, but the only dentist in the village is Jewish, so the pig farmer can’t simply swap pork chops and bacon for dental work. Barter might be an option, but according to the usual textbook narrative, that would end up requiring some sort of complicated multiparty deal whereby the pig farmer gives pork to the carpenter, who builds a garage for the auto repairman, who fixes the hairdresser’s car, and eventually things get back around to the dentist. Once money enters the picture, by contrast, the pig farmer sells bacon and pork chops to all and sundry, uses the proceeds to pay the dentist, and everyone’s happy. Right?</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Well, maybe. Let’s stop right there for a moment, and take a look at the presuppositions hardwired into this little story. First of all, the narrative assumes that <b>participants have a single rigidly defined economic role</b>: the pig farmer can only raise pigs, the dentist can only fix teeth, and so on. Furthermore, it assumes that <b>participants can’t anticipate needs and adapt to them</b>: even though he knows the only dentist in town is Jewish, the pig farmer can’t do the logical thing and start raising lambs for Passover on the side, or what have you. Finally, the narrative assumes that <b>participants can only interact economically through market exchanges</b>: there are no other options for meeting needs for goods and services, no other way to arrange exchanges between people other than market transactions driven by the law of supply and demand. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even in modern industrial societies, these three presuppositions are rarely true. I happen to know several pig farmers, for example, and none of them are so hyperspecialized that their contributions to economic exchanges are limited to pork products; garden truck, fresh eggs, venison, moonshine, and a good many other things could come into the equation as well. For that matter, outside the bizarre feedlot landscape of industrial agriculture, mixed farms raising a variety of crops and livestock are far more resilient than single-crop farms, and thus considerably more common in societies that haven’t shoved every economic activity into the procrustean bed of the money economy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As for the second point raised above, the law of supply and demand works just as effectively in a barter economy as in a money economy, and successful participants are always on the lookout for a good or service that’s in short supply relative to potential demand, and so can be bartered with advantage. It’s no accident that traditional village economies tend to be exquisitely adapted to produce exactly that mix of goods and services the inhabitants of the village need and want. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finally, of course, there are many ways of handling the production and distribution of goods and services without engaging in market exchanges. The household economy, in which members of each household produce goods and services that they themselves consume, is the foundation of economic activity in most human societies, and still accounted for the majority of economic value produced in the United States until not much more than a century ago. The gift economy, in which members of a community give their excess production to other members of the same community in the expectation that the gift will be reciprocated, is immensely common; so is the feudal economy delineated in last week’s post, with its systematic exclusion of market forces from the economic sphere. There are others, plenty of them, and none of them require money at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus the logic behind money pretty clearly isn’t what the textbook story claims it is. That doesn’t mean that there’s no logic to it at all; what it means is that nobody wants to talk about what it is that money is actually meant to do. Fortunately, we’ve discussed the relevant issues in last week’s post, so I can sum up the matter here in a single sentence: the point of money is that it makes intermediation easy.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Intermediation, for those of my readers who weren’t paying attention last week, is the process by which other people insert themselves between the producer and the consumer of any good or service, and take a cut of the proceeds of the transaction. That’s very easy to do in a money economy, because—as we all know from personal experience—the intermediaries can simply charge fees for whatever service they claim to provide, and then cash in those fees for whatever goods and services they happen to want. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Imagine, by way of contrast, the predicament of an intermediary who wanted to insert himself into, and take a cut out of, a money-free transaction between the pig farmer and the dentist. We’ll suppose that the arrangement the two of them have worked out is that the pig farmer raises enough lambs each year that all the Jewish families in town can have a proper Passover seder, the dentist takes care of the dental needs of the pig farmer and his family, and the other families in the Jewish community work things out with the dentist in exchange for their lambs—a type of arrangement, half barter and half gift economy, that’s tolerably common in close-knit communities. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Intermediation works by taking a cut from each transaction. The cut may be described as a tax, a fee, an interest payment, a service charge, or what have you, but it amounts to the same thing: whenever money changes hands, part of it gets siphoned off for the benefit of the intermediaries involved in the transaction. The same thing can be done in some money-free transactions, but not all. Our intermediary might be able to demand a certain amount of meat from each Passover lamb, or require the pig farmer to raise one lamb for the intermediary per six lambs raised for the local Jewish families, though this assumes that he either likes lamb chops or can swap the lamb to someone else for something he wants. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What on earth, though, is he going to do to take a cut from the dentist’s side of the transaction?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There wouldn’t be much point in demanding one tooth out of every six the dentist extracts, for example, and requiring the dentist to fill one of the intermediary’s teeth for every twenty other teeth he fills would be awkward at best—what if the intermediary doesn’t happen to need any teeth filled this year? What’s more, once intermediation is reduced to such crassly physical terms, it’s hard to pretend that it’s anything but a parasitic relationship that benefits the intermediary at everyone else’s expense. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What makes intermediation seem to make sense in a money economy is that <i>money is the primary intermediation</i>. Money is a system of arbitrary tokens used to facilitate exchange, but it’s also a good deal more than that. It’s the framework of laws, institutions, and power relationships that creates the tokens, defines their official value, and mandates that they be used for certain classes of economic exchange. Once the use of money is required for any purpose, the people who control the framework—whether those people are government officials, bankers, or what have you—get to decide the terms on which everyone else gets access to money, which amounts to effective control over everyone else. That is to say, they become the primary intermediaries, and every other intermediation depends on them and the money system they control.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is why, to cite only one example, British colonial administrators in Africa imposed a house tax on the native population, even though the cost of administering and collecting the tax was more than the revenue the tax brought in. By requiring the tax to be paid in money rather than in kind, the colonial government forced the natives to participate in the money economy, on terms that were of course set by the colonial administration and British business interests. The money economy is the basis on which nearly all other forms of intermediation rest, and forcing the native peoples to work for money instead of allowing them to meet their economic needs in some less easily exploited fashion was an essential part of the mechanism that pumped wealth out of the colonies for Britain’s benefit. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Watch the way that the money economy has insinuated itself into every dimension of modern life in an industrial society and you’ve got a ringside seat from which to observe the metastasis of intermediation in recent decades. Where money goes, intermediation follows:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>that’s one of the unmentionable realities of political economy, the science that Adam Smith actually founded, but was gutted, stuffed, and mounted on the wall—turned, that is, into the contemporary pseudoscience of economics—once it became painfully clear just what kind of trouble got stirred up when people got to talking about the implications of the links between political power and economic wealth. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s another side to the metastasis just mentioned, though, and it has to do with the habits of thought that the money economy both requires and reinforces. At the heart of the entire system of money is the concept of abstract value, the idea that goods and services share a common, objective attribute called “value” that can be gauged according to the one-dimensional measurement of price. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s an astonishingly complex concept, and so needs unpacking here. Philosophers generally recognize a crucial distinction between facts and values; there are various ways of distinguishing them, but the one that matters for our present purposes is that facts are collective and values are individual. Consider the statement “it rained here last night.” Given agreed-upon definitions of “here” and “last night,” that’s a factual statement; all those who stood outside last night in the town where I live and looked up at the sky got raindrops on their faces. In the strict sense of the word, facts are objective—that is, they deal with the properties of objects of perception, such as raindrops and nights. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Values, by contrast, are subjective—that is, they deal with the properties of perceiving subjects, such as people who look up at the sky and notice wetness on their faces. One person is annoyed by the rain, another is pleased, another is completely indifferent to it, and these value judgments are irreducibly personal; it’s not that the rain is annoying, pleasant, or indifferent, it’s the individuals who are affected in these ways. Nor are these personal valuations easy to sort out along a linear scale without drastic distortion. The human experience of value is a richly multidimensional thing; even in a language as poorly furnished with descriptive terms for emotion as English is, there are countless shades of meaning available for talking about positive valuations, and at least as many more for negative ones. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
From that vast universe of human experience, the concept of abstract value extracts a single variable—“how much will you give for it?”—and reduces the answer to a numerical scale denominated in dollars and cents or the local equivalent. Like any other act of reductive abstraction, it has its uses, but the benefits of any such act always have to be measured against the blind spots generated by reductive modes of thinking, and the consequences of that induced blindness must either be guarded against or paid in full. The latter is far and away the more common of the two, and it’s certainly the option that modern industrial society has enthusiastically chosen. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who want to see the blindness just mentioned in full spate need only turn to any of the popular cornucopian economic theorists of our time. The fond and fatuous insistence that resource depletion can’t possibly be a problem, because investing additional capital will inevitably turn up new supplies—precisely the same logic, by the way, that appears in the legendary utterance “I can’t be overdrawn, I still have checks left!”—unfolds precisely from the flattening out of qualitative value into quantitative price just discussed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The habit of reducing every kind of value to bare price is profitable in a money economy, since it facilitates ignoring every variable that might get in the way of making money off<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>transactions; unfortunately it misses a minor but crucial fact, which is that the laws of physics and ecology trump the laws of economics, and can neither be bribed nor bought. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The contemporary fixation on abstract value isn’t limited to economists and those who believe them, nor is its potential for catastrophic consequences. I’m thinking here specifically of those people who have grasped the fact that industrial civilization is picking up speed on the downslope of its decline, but whose main response to it consists of trying to find some way to stash away as much abstract value as possible now, so that it will be available to them in some prospective postcollapse society. Far more often than not, gold plays a central role in that strategy, though there are a variety of less popular vehicles that play starring roles the same sort of plan. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course it was probably inevitable in a consumer society like ours that even the downfall of industrial civilization would be turned promptly into yet another reason to go shopping. Still, there’s another difficulty here, and that’s that the same strategy has been tried before, many times, in the last years of other civilizations. There’s an ample body of historical evidence that can be used to see just how well it works. The short form? Don’t go there. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It so happens, for example, that in there among the sagas and songs of early medieval Europe are a handful that deal with historical events in the years right after the fall of Rome: the <i>Nibelungenlied, Beowulf</i>, the oldest strata of Norse saga, and some others. Now of course all these started out as oral traditions, and finally found their way into written form centuries after the events they chronicle, when their compilers had no way to check their facts; they also include plenty of folktale and myth, as oral traditions generally do. Still, they describe events and social customs that have been confirmed by surviving records and archeological evidence, and offer one of the best glimpses we’ve got into the lived experience of descent into a dark age.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Precious metals played an important part in the political economy of that age—no surprises there, as the Roman world had a precious-metal currency, and since banks had not been invented yet, portable objects of gold and silver were the most common way that the Roman world’s well-off classes stashed their personal wealth. As the western empire foundered in the fifth century CE and its market economy came apart, hoarding precious metals became standard practice, and rural villas, the doomsteads of the day, popped up all over. When archeologists excavate those villas, they routinely find evidence that they were looted and burnt when the empire fell, and tolerably often the archeologists or a hobbyist with a metal detector has located the buried stash of precious metals somewhere nearby, an expressive reminder of just how much benefit that store of abstract wealth actually provided to its owner. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the same story you get from all the old legends: when treasure turns up, a lot of people are about to die. The <i>Volsunga saga</i> and the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, for example, are versions of the same story, based on dim memories of events in the Rhine valley in the century or so after Rome’s fall. The primary plot engine of those events is a hoard of the usual late Roman kind,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>which passes from hand to hand by way of murder, torture, treachery, vengeance, and the extermination of entire dynasties. For that matter, when Beowulf dies after slaying his dragon, and his people discover that the dragon was guarding a treasure, do they rejoice? Not at all; they take it for granted that the kings and warriors of every neighboring kingdom are going to come and slaughter them to get it—and in fact that’s what happens. That’s business as usual in a dark age society. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The problem with stockpiling gold on the brink of a dark age is thus simply another dimension, if a more extreme one, of the broader problem with intermediation. It bears remembering that gold is not wealth; it’s simply a durable form of money, and thus, like every other form of money, an arbitrary token embodying a claim to real wealth—that is, goods and services—that other people produce. If the goods and services aren’t available, a basement safe full of gold coins won’t change that fact, and if the people who have the goods and services need them more than they want gold, the same is true. Even if the goods and services are to be had, if everyone with gold is bidding for the same diminished supply, that gold isn’t going to buy anything close to what it does today. What’s more, tokens of abstract value have another disadvantage in a society where the rule of law has broken down: they attract violence the way a dead rat draws flies.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The fetish for stockpiling gold has always struck me, in fact, as the best possible proof that most of the people who think they are preparing for total social collapse haven’t actually thought the matter through, and considered the conditions that will obtain after the rubble stops bouncing. Let’s say industrial civilization comes apart, quickly or slowly, and you have gold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In that case, either you spend it to purchase goods and services after the collapse, or you don’t. If you do, everyone in your vicinity will soon know that you have gold, the rule of law no longer discourages people from killing you and taking it in the best
<i>Nibelungenlied</i> fashion, and sooner or later you’ll run out of ammo. If you don’t, what good will the gold do you? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The era when <i>Nibelungenlied</i> conditions apply—when, for example, armed gangs move from one doomstead to another, annihilating the people holed up there, living for a while on what they find, and then moving on to the next, or when local governments round up the families of those believed to have gold and torture them to death, starting with the children, until someone breaks—is a common stage of dark ages. It’s a self-terminating one, since sooner or later the available supply of precious metals or other carriers of abstract wealth are spread thin across the available supply of warlords. This can take anything up to a century or two before we reach the stage commemorated in the Anglo-Saxon poem “The Seafarer:”
<i>Nearon n<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>ú</span> cyningas ne c<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">á</span>seras, ne goldgiefan swylce i<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>ú</span> w<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">á</span>eron</i>
(No more are there kings or caesars or gold-givers as once there were). </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br>
That’s when things begin settling down and the sort of feudal arrangement sketched out in last week’s post begins to emerge, when money and the market play little role in most people’s lives and labor and land become the foundation of a new, impoverished, but relatively stable society where the rule of law again becomes a reality. None of us living today will see that period arrive, but it’s good to know where the process is headed. We’ll discuss the practical implications of that knowledge in a future post. </div>

It removes the need for a social relationship between the two actors. The rich social relationships that interweave normal material circulation among human beings has been stripped away by money. To me one of the great open questions of our unraveling empire (or civilization) is whether we'll have the leisure to reinvent some semblance of those relationships (as between your dentist and farmer) or whether money's facade of sociality collapses too fast and we have to face things as atomized, disoriented individuals. In which case - warlords and rapine.<br><br><a href=#c5808683892518592100 title="comment permalink">11/12/14, 4:37 PM</a><br><br>

I lasted about 3 days. My immediate impression was that the paper was simply an exercise is dumbing down. Like, lets take this widely complicated situation of an economy with many many factors and arbitrary shove everything into these tiny boxes of 'rational economic actors' or perfectly linear supply and demand graphs resulting in perfect equilibrium. I'm sure you're well familiar with all this of course. tbh, I vaguely thought of it as like walking into a bible study class full of fundamentalist Christians (or a paranormal phenomena 'skeptics' seminar...)<br><br>Interesting points you make too about gold staches (or staches in general in the decline of civilizations). Its unfortunately a fairly common response I hear by people when talking about the downfall of industrial civilization. 'hauling myself up in the woods somewhere'- "untill the mobs with flaming torches show up on your doorstep" I then point out. usually i just get a shrug in response, or a Copernican response about technology saving us etc etc etc...<br><br>Even in more prosperous economic times with less threat from barbarian hordes gold does not save dieing empires. Witness the collapse of the Spanish empire for example (granted though the raids on their gold supply by Caribbean pirates and the British). All the large influx of gold to Spain did was raise prices around Europe, due to expanded money supply for the same amount of good- aka inflation.<br><br>Anyways, just my musings. cheers for the post.

They are clearly written and concise. Thank you for the wonderful exposition on the circumstance of our decline as the oil is burned off in a final spate of happy motoring. I am reminded of Ulysses Grant posted to Fort Vancouver in the Oregon Territory, before the Civil War, as a Junior Officer and recent graduate of West Point. This was after the Mexican War. In order to supplement his paltry salary he farmed potatoes in his off hours because in his first winter, food was dear. He planned on exchanging the potatoes for other food stuffs or goods. Manufactured goods were expensive and rare due to the long sea journey from the East Coast. That coming harvest he was confronted with a bounty of potatoes from his tillage and all from the other beginning farmers who also planted potatoes. And so Grant plowed his now surplus spuds back into the earth and sought relocation to the East in earnest. It was a mix of barter economy occurring spontaneously to met immediate needs or when the potato crop was ready for harvest. The framework of the market economy, with money cementing economic relationships, was not fully in place. People went back to what they could do with nature's materials and a shovel. In the future, we may all become potato farmers again.<br><br><a href=#c3041765886771752293 title="comment permalink">11/12/14, 4:49 PM</a><br><br>

He hits all your points, and makes the testable assertion that _no_ anthropological evidence exists for any society anywhere in the world where money arose according to the "Econ 101" timeline, which you (JMG) present and then disprove. According to Graeber, the type of numerical barter system taught in Econ 101 only arises in places where money <b><i>used</i></b> to exist and then was taken away by societal collapse; places such as Dark Age Britain and so forth. Societies which <b><i>never</i></b> had money do not tend to equate physical goods with abstract numbers. <br><br>So how then did money ever arise in the first place? A very interesting question, which Graeber answers. SPOILER: Money was invented solely to pay taxes and tributes. So, to those neo-conservatives who think society can run with zero taxes: you'll have to get rid of money itself, first!<br><br>Graeber notes that selling cows and buying chickens in exchange for abstract money is essentially the same thing as denaturing both animals and all their particular uses and distinctive features. He goes on to note that this is essentially doing violence to people and to the things traded, and links the advent of money to increasing violence.<br><br>Although you've written a very useful and readable recap of Graeber's book, I would encourage everyone to read the full book. It's written in a clever and personable style, a fair bit like JMG's writing style, and he presents numerous other philosophical problems with the concept of money, and explores various other systems for settling debts which humans have employed throughout history and throughout the globe. One is left with the impression that our current system of electronic totems representing paper bills with a nominal connection to gold is very, very unimaginative indeed. <br><br>Also, separate topic, I note the following article in Quartz online magazine hits quite a few of JMG's points about economic collapse, complexity, and intermediation: <a href=http://qz.com/293849/how-baby-boomers-ruined-parenting-forever/ rel=nofollow>The decline and fall of helicopter parenting</a>.<br><br>Quote: "A 'helicopter parent' micromanages every aspect of his child’s routine and behavior... The rise of the helicopter was the product of two social shifts. The first was the comparatively booming economy of the 1990s, with low unemployment and higher disposable income. The second was the public perception of increased child endangerment... Despite media campaigns ...children are safer from crime than in prior decades. What they are not safe from are the diminishing prospects of their parents."<br><br><a href=#c2532413088172369843 title="comment permalink">11/12/14, 5:43 PM</a><br><br>

He described how the wealthy from the terminal (pun intended) Roman Empire had buried gold coins in hopes that they would recover their value some day and then compared it to people who held rental properties but boarded them up instead of renting them, holding them off the market until rents increased again. Bardi did mention that the "some day" eventually returned for the value of gold--about a thousand years too late. He didn't expand on how those hoards of gold would bring hordes of bandits, causing more misfortune than good fortune for the would-be survivalists of the Fifth Century C.E.<br><br>On the subject of pointing out the counterproductive nature of gold and the nature of money as shared belief instead of something objectively real, I wonder how many angry comments you're going to read (and probably not pass through moderation because of swearing) from goldbugs who believe that money is real and that gold is the most dependable and natural form of real money.

Making lots of it suggests that we are successful; hoarding it gives the sense that we are somehow safe; spending it ostentatiously displays that we are better than others, etc. Of course you can do get the same ego boost from having the most pigs or storing away the most grain, but money seems to lend itself to new levels of status differentiation. <br><br>I think that some of these factors are wrapped into why a certain type of prepper favors storing gold. It seems fairly clear that the best strategy for preparing for difficult times is to invest in skills, community relationships and reliable shelter on a small patch of productive land, while also trying to not stand out too much from the (generally struggling) crowd. Hoarding gold (or for that matter buying and equipping an elaborate farmstead in the country) seems to be an indication that you want to hang on to your industrial age stored wealth and perhaps that you want to demonstrate how much smarter you were than those fiat sheep who didn't see the big investment picture.

Many of these farmers have been foumg slowly broke over the last thirty years , ravaged by the proliferation of intermediation in global commodity markets ( the price they receive from the corporations has stagnated since the early nineties ) , ravaged by drought and many of their offspring have moved to the cities . I feel these people to be largely propagandised and institutionalised , and they may not be psycho spiritually fitted to prevail in a neo feudal setup . Depression , obesity and suicide is already rampant among them .<br><br>Despite this , there are horse breakers , specialist butchers , organic gardeners , bakers , brewers builders and plumbers , livestock husbanders etc. i often muse that the psychology of those present will be what determines the future shape of the community , and like in wartime it may be surprising who rises to the challenge and who doesnt . Not all the escaping urban green elite are guaranteed to thrive , either .As you have hammered home in many a post , the ability to identify currents and cleavages in the local individual and collective psyche , combined with an innate sense of spiritual purpose and psychological balance will be the key to thriving here . Far from being a new age " inclusive and collaborative i love you all " mindset ; this may entail decision making such as recognising someone who is targeting you or about to target you to relieve you of your possessions and getting in first to shoot them in the leg with a show of force to indicate you are not to be trifled with , sending a message to many others in the process . This in addition to cultivating the ability to connnect , befriend and nurture a network . <br><br>Whatis common to both yours and kunstlers peak oil novels is that the characters that thrive seem to have a degree of ruthlessness balanced with compassion and good intuition and psychological awareness in their characters ; they are keen observers . <br><br>I agree that having a large hoard without the intuition or skills to make it work for you makes you a prime target . Learning how to butcher a sheep would be a much better currency . Of course there are many variables and externals to be accounted for and we have a long bumpy road to travel before we get to that point . A local insurgency against a corrupt local government would not be too far fetched if they used Land Tax to drain the populace dry on the way down. .<br>At present in Victoria , Australia , i have noticed a lot of aerial helicopter traffic surrveilling the back blocks , and the power grids are attempting to install smart meters on most properties , which will monitor and transmit how many people are on the premises , what type of appliances they use in what rooms etc , as well as the ability to disconnect individual appliances on the promises under the guise of " load shedding " . A number of us have avoided this by locking meter boxes and utilising common law to prevent trespass , and have had to withstand all manner of legal threats and agressive tactics . So this is the stage we are at as the old system is very much still active .<br><br><a href=#c5318070665361124041 title="comment permalink">11/12/14, 8:00 PM</a><br><br>

Gold was evil for most who found it, whether because of lawless robbers or because of the legal order that edged out the lawless robbers by making it clear who was capable of owning what. (Imagine what would befall you today if you found a genuine $500M bearer bond and didn't bury it at once!) <br><br>This makes all kinds of sense if we keep in mind David Graeber's observation (probably not original) that coinage was mostly invented as an instrument to mobilise troops. Gold and silver coins could be paid to soldiers from all over, wherever their campaigns took them; taxes payable in coins forced populations to provide soldiers with services, as in your British colonial example. So not only is gold currency a means to facilitate intermediation, but it is specifically tied to violence and the stable, organised capacity to inflict violence.<br><br>Of course you still have lots of gold around when the rubble stops bouncing. The Dark Age solution? Melt the gold into useless art objects and let it collect and sit in the hands of an organisation everyone everywhere agrees is necessary, where it can again play an economic role (via prestige) in legally sanctioned and less chaotically violent ways.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c7825253779945344562 title="comment permalink">11/12/14, 8:06 PM</a><br><br>

I've been synthesizing a lot of the material, so to speak, hope it can be useful. So this is Part I of II. <br><br>I've been a reader now about eighteen months.  As a reader I have gone through two transitions thus far. The first is like an AA meeting: "I acknowledge the reality of peak oil, and accept my personal responsibility to adapt to the change."<br><br>The second I suppose is in process for me. It's a recognition of the total futility of any effort for victory for the side of ecology, conservation, or Gaia, on this civilization's terms. I'll start with an example.  The change over from Carter to Reagan.  A lot of the folks in the peak oil community know what those names mean contextually.  For the initiated, they resound like incantations.<br><br>But those two individuals meant little really to the processes they represent.  We imagine presidents as figureheads of power, but they really don't have the kind of power we attribute to them. That is, even very powerful people don't have really much power over what's happening. JMG you've examined this in some of the older blog entries.  How empire becomes a self-perpetuating metastatic process that traps the empire, where the grounds that made it possible actively contribute to its dissolution.  The empire has a prisoner's dilemma – that if we don't do it, they will.  Another angle is the way Keynesian economics becomes a trap - as the populace is never willing to suffer the hard times of debt repayment after the big influx of new money. (Strange, I've read Keynes was a sometime-compatriot of Aleister Crowley?) They (we, the people) just want more new talismans of "wanting more." And not at all maliciously. Heck, people want to have babies. (In fact, a great many in mainstream political economy have come to the conclusion that the problem now is just a demand-creation problem: put more money in the economy, and it will be there signal a need to dig up more of that fracking oil and gas. Heck, it worked before!) <br><br>Further, Jevon's paradox (damn all these paradoxes) can be generalized.  If I decide no longer to participate; if I decide to grow my own food as much as possible; not to drive; not to pay taxes; not to put money in banks - or simply to withdraw somewhat from “the market economy” - for the practical reason that it is unsustainable, destructive; for the spiritual reason that “every man for himself” is totally averse to the continuation of the species - my actions simply let the price of oil (or ng or coal) go cheaper and thus allow others to take my place in that market.  It is true I am gaining skills and knowledge that can hopefully be passed through the gap in historical epochs, or soften the descent, in the process of collapsing now and avoiding the rush. But practically speaking... yeah, right. <br><br>No matter how hard global warming makes things in the short term, people will still use fossil fuels to deal with its effects. And it would be much, much harder without using the fossil fuels – and how can we do that to the pregnant mother, and the little granny, and the millions in the third world? Contracting energy consumption is contracting life. Not to mention that there are people with power who will continue to scramble to suck more power out of the earth, and the people without power will be powerless to stop them.<br><br>It's the same kind of paradox for the USAs choice in the Carter to Reagan transition: if we didn't use the Middle East oil for our military and economic empire, doubling down on our bet, moving from US Peak Oil to World Peak Oil (largely under our dominion and for our benefit), USSR, or some other, would have.  We would not have ever been able to trust them that they wouldn't take advantage of that opportunity. And how would we have been to able to compel them to stop? The genie was already out of the bottle.<br><br><a href=#c2007975347449290783 title="comment permalink">11/12/14, 8:37 PM</a><br><br>

Seven billion souls and climbing out to count for something. In the major religions, it is the most fundamental value of all. And some of those souls have achieved genius, excellence.  As Goethe described in his Faust, what humans desire is meaningful experiences, not just power.  Now I grant being wealthy and powerful is not the only way to meaningful experiences - and other ways are perhaps even better.  But it's hard to deny its, well, POWER as a means, and the way these energy sources facilitate meaningful experiences. And it has been achieved, at least by a few, during the industrial age, and in truly spectacular fashion.  It can be seen among the splendid athletes, performers, writers, musicians and artists of our time.  There is epic human greatness in our time, the full flowering of epic amounts of energy put to conscious direction. I'll give one example (which can be viewed on another example of costly but marvelous artworks of industrial civilization – the Youtube): his name is Danny McAskill. He does simply astounding mountain bike tricks. It's impossible to describe, has to be seen. That's not likely possible without industrial civilization. It still might drift by in the current of time, as we will be unable to remember it as we do now. Not the less splendid for being brief, though. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj6ho1-G6tw)<br><br>And further on to the paradox that withdrawal is not resistance, but something else - those who reject this cultural form can not even truly challenge the hegemony, which appears less of a strictly American thing and more like the manifestation of the colossus of the energy of the dead. If we stepped away how would we resist some other in their pursuit? With what tools would we fight? Hammers and sickles? Ak-47's?  And the path of Gandhi, peaceful resistance, is challenging because it required EVEN MORE bravery, self-sacrifice, willingness to die en masse, than Americans can muster in our materially stultified consciousness. And it's a seriously large question whether those in power would really even care.<br><br>We have again the challenge of brainwashing, which is formidable.  For some incomprehensible reason, peak oil - which is actually more certain than anthroprogenic global warming - can almost completely be ignored in any politicians' agenda - maybe addressed here and there in coded language, never directly except in a brief dismissal.  How can this be possible without some mind-bogglingly huge blind spot built into how our civilization thinks? How can something so obvious be missed?<br><br>It's impossible to beat the demon that we're up against - we just have to wait for it die.  But that's the weak spot of this culture: it can't really deal with long time periods.  During the reign of Christian theology the world was the universe and it was only 6000 years old! (Curiously about as old as record keeping...) and the whole spiritual conception in the West is built on that foundation - even if we do know otherwise now, it's still somewhere down in the subconscious. It comes out in the catchy, new agey, almost-spiritual phrase, “You Only Live Once!” <br><br>I think that's this civilization's big blind spot. It can't deal with a look to the long future, because it diminishes us right now. I think that's wrong because we do live on in the long memory. It ought to be known by future generations that some few persisted in what is certainly a hopeless battle.<br><br>That's about all we can do now.  It seems pretty little right now. It's actually a lot - the stuff of legends.<br><br><a href=#c4322868590084314408 title="comment permalink">11/12/14, 8:37 PM</a><br><br>

Given the mess the neoclassical economists have made, that's very nearly the highest praise I can imagine giving Galbraith -- well, other than the fact that he was a brilliant thinker and a truly gifted writer, and every reader of this blog who hasn't already done so should run right out and pick up a copy of <i>The Great Crash 1929</i> just for starters. <br><br>Thomas, yes, you're the first, though not the only! I'm embarrassed to say I haven't read Graeber yet, though clearly I need to. Thanks also for the links!<br><br>Pinku-sensei, oh, I expect the gold bugs to show up in force. I remember what kind of a ruckus got stirred up a while back when I pointed out that the price curve of gold over the last fifteen years shows a classic bubble-and-bust pattern. <br><br>Pyrrhus, the countries in question would be crazy to do so, as it would lock them into long-term deflation as it did with the US economy in the late 19th century. It's not "fiat money" in the abstract that faces a crash, but the US dollar and a handful of specific currencies dependent on it -- at least that's my take. <br><br>Kaitain, excellent! Yes, and that earns you tonight's gold star. Tolkien knew European dark age literature better than anyone else in his generation -- the guy could write extempore in Gothic, for heaven's sake -- and so it was only natural that he put that detail into <i>The Hobbit</i>. <br><br>Anothershamus, there were a lot of details I could have put in if I were writing a book rather than a weekly blog post, and that's one of them: relevant, certainly, but not to the specific point I'm making here. (BTW, you don't have to put your post through three times; I got all three.) <br><br>Deborah, the answer is simple: skills. If all you have is stuff, there will be plenty of people who want to take it from you, and your well-being will not be of interest to them. If you have skills, by contrast, there will be plenty of people who want you to be able to practice your skills for their benefit, and your well-being does play a part in that. In the most lawless societies of the past -- the pirate colonies of the Caribbean come to mind -- physicians, shipwrights, blacksmiths, and other skilled tradespeople lived charmed lives; casual murder among the pirates themselves was commonplace, but nobody hassled a craftsman, because his skills kept everyone alive and able to pursue their trade. <br><br>Tim, I'll consider that. <br><br>Greg, exactly -- it's not the cities that are the source of the problem. I should probably do a post on that sometime soon. The very short form is that those cities that aren't too big to survive can very often defend themselves, because they have the resource and the work force to maintain a local militia. It's in the rural areas that brigandage becomes universal, and things quickly degenerate to dark age conditions. Very often in a dark age, surviving towns and cities are islands of relative peace and security, with the agricultural hinterlands close to the city under some degree of protection, while further out you get raw anarchy and roving warbands. More on this soon!<br><br>Dave, thanks for the recommendation -- I'll put it on the to-read list. <br><br>Anonymous, it's not just a matter of insufficient skills, though that doesn't help. As the money economy becomes more and more dysfunctional, it stops being able to organize and motivate economic activity at all -- there's plenty of work to be done and plenty of people willing to do it for a living wage, but the economy is so riddled with parasites that hiring the people to do the work can't be done at a profit, so it doesn't get done.<br><br><a href=#c7942254655889760763 title="comment permalink">11/12/14, 9:21 PM</a><br><br>

I believe JMG has mentioned that he dabbled in D&amp;D so pardon my self indulgent meditation here. I wonder how much the rest of American society has been "contaminated" by the D&amp;D view of medieval economies - secondhand through us.<br><br>Tolkien was a rigorous scholar of many things, especially languages, but he doesn't appear to be a cultural economist. The Shire, for example, functions like a mercantile economy - I think I remember the clinking of coins in the Prancing Pony - and one would presume it trades peaceably with neighboring city-states. But it was never an Empire of the sort where a money system would have arisen on its own. (Perhaps its money system is a leftover from the days of Numenor.) The hobbits have cosmopolitan tastes in consumables, yet it's never clear which nations they are trading _with_. For example, Rohan is a nomadic moneyless economy in a state of tribal primitivism, where money would seem never to have arisen in the past.  Meanwhile Gondor appears to be strictly feudal, which would imply a money system arose there and then fell. The Elves would seem to be too noble to bother using money for anything. Although fallen from the First Age, the Elves still seem to pursue life only for the purposes of artistic or martial achievement; not monetary wealth. Somehow all these disparate economies live right next to each other.<br><br>Then those of us in my generation took that less-than-rigorous melange of social economics from Tolkien and other fantasy writers, and bastardized it still further with D&amp;D. Every D&amp;D character starts out "scrambling for coppers" and then accumulates gold; when apparently in a more "realistic" D&amp;D campaign, the characters would need to craft personalized interactions for each and every supply item they wish to purchase.  Whereas their coins of precious metal would be unusable, un-trade-able. At some level all the D&amp;D players I've met know intellectually that real medieval peasants didn't even have a pair of coppers to rub together. Yet somehow we just assume they participated in some kind of market/barter economy anyway.<br><br>Also at some level we know that our player characters... whom we usually think of as "heroes" and defenders of life, liberty and civilization... probably fit better in the role of Viking raiders (indiscriminately slaying anybody who has the misfortune of sitting near any rumored horde of treasure).  It makes me want to write up a moneyless D&amp;D campaign where all player characters are viewed by NPCs only as thuggish invaders who can't earn their living the natural way... With neighbourly exchanges of debt.<br><br>And then of course our contaminated view of medieval cultural economy is bastardized further in the minds of anyone younger, who grew up playing the video game successors of D&amp;D. In a computer game you don't even bother lugging coins around, let alone creating personalized economic interactions, you just have a numerical total "Gold" in one corner of your screen, and you need only click "Buy".  An abstraction of an abstraction.<br><br><a href=#c3561377903653281444 title="comment permalink">11/12/14, 9:49 PM</a><br><br>

Certainly those who tried that strategy in previous eras of decline and fall ended up in shallow graves far more often than not. <br><br>Candace, yes, exactly -- the challenge of living in two worlds is the major problem we face as individuals right now. That's one of the things my proposed strategy of "collapse now and avoid the rush" is meant to help resolve. <br><br>Wadulisi, most civilizations got by just fine with taxation in kind, so if that does come back in, it'll have lots of precedent. <br><br>Wiseman, with gold, it's not just warbands you have to worry about. Your next door neighbor, your local police department, an organized gang who hacked the records of the company that sold you those Krugerrands and is going from one address to another, kicking down the door in the middle of the night, offing everyone there, finding the gold and going onto the next house...if you're known to have gold, any of those, and many others as well, will be thinking about whether a bullet through your brain is the best investment strategy for them just now. If your wife is pretty enough to get even a small fraction of the same sort of hostile attention aimed at you, you're a very lucky man. <br><br>Brian, there are plenty of other things to barter that don't attract the same kind of hostile intentions. Better still, learn how to brew good beer, and everyone you know will be your friend for life. <br><br>Kutamun, the right balance between ruthlessness and compassion is a common feature of people who thrive in troubled times. For that matter, it's worth pursuing even in less difficult ages. <br><br>Carl, the more of your life you can get outside of the money economy altogether -- the more things you can do for yourself, swap with friends, or simply do without -- the less you have to worry about when the economy turns south. That's the key to being comfortable here and now!<br><br>Stuart, that's very likely -- "fairy gold," when it was real and not dried leaves under a glamour, was very often somebody's buried hoard from previous generations (as of course was dragon-gold). If you have it, somebody or other is going to want to cut your throat to get it -- best to leave it in the ground. <br><br>Jim, instead of trying to form a community, with all the problems that entails, why not settle in one that already exists -- say, a small city or large town with some social institutions more or less intact, in an area with a lot of small farms? That's what I did, and I recommend it as an option. <br><br>Chris, excellent. The one quibble I have is that I don't think you're considering the full implications of what you've suggested: "It's a recognition of the total futility of any effort for victory for the side of ecology, conservation, or Gaia, on this civilization's terms." The last four words -- <i>on this civilization's terms</i> -- are to my mind the crucial ones, because even now, in the belly of the beast, those terms are not universally applicable. They don't define the whole universe of possibility available to us -- and as this civilization crumbles, the number and magnitude of the spaces outside this civilization's reach will multiply steadily. Thus it's not simply a matter of waiting for this civilization to die -- it's possible to identify spaces (physical, cognitive, and other) where it's already lost its grip, and leveraging your ability to shape those spaces in order to begin building the future amid the disintegrating carcass of the present. <br><br>There, I've just given away the central strategy of this blog.

I liked this one a lot. A couple of disorganized thoughts (because I am too busy with work lately to organize them properly) on money.<br><br> Economists give money three functions: a store of value, a unit of account, and a means of exchange. And, unlike large swaths of modern neoclassical economics, this framework is not irrelevant, useless, or counterproductive, but merely derivative. As far as I can tell money is two things.<br><br> One, a way to store work; pretty much any economic activity requires work, collecting, harvesting, shaping, baking, carving, oxidizing, reducing, warehousing, wholesaling, retailing, transporting, etc, etc... All of those activities share three common elements. They work on a material of some kind, they require energy (from hydrocarbons or carbohydrates), and they take time. This is work in the economic sense and the physical sense. Work gets things made or done. When one works one gets money. When one spends money then things (things made through work) get acquired or work gets done. So the three things economists think about money all derive from this. A store of value comes from the way of storing work; doing something now gets one tokens that can get things done later. A unit of account measures the amount of work done and the complicated social value of that work. The means of exchange is a market system of valuing work for work. Although, as JMG pointed out, other systems exist for this function.<br><br> Two, a way to pay taxes. Living in a stable social arrangement has overhead costs and those costs have to be paid or one doesn't get a stable social arrangement. Whatever pays those dues is money. In a market economy the taxes are paid in money. In a feudal system those dues are paid in reciprocal agreements, working so many day on the lords fields or whatever. Alternative currencies, Bitcoin, colonial scripts, or whatever are only really valid if they can pay taxes. Paying taxes is what makes them valid. To be clear, the 'system' legitimises them through taxes. Money systems that fail this test are shut down by the system. Whether those overhead costs are just and in line with the needs of the society not relevant. The overhead costs have to be paid and any system that circumvents those dues is not legitimate. (although what is legit changes. As with most things timing is delicate and tricky)<br><br>Part one, continued...<br><br><a href=#c2322174244814725838 title="comment permalink">11/12/14, 10:43 PM</a><br><br>

Really shiny, but still just a metal. It's fancy and it doesn't rust or corrode so it keeps well. But the only thing that gold really does is look good. It's fancy, and fancy is only a marketable commodity in stable societies of sufficient complexity. Gold doesn't 'do' anything of innate worth, it's just pretty and rare. And that combination has been valuable in complex societies often enough to give the impression that it has innate value. But the gap between this complex society and the next is large enough that hoarding it won't do one any good. Profiting off the market is about timing and the timeframes on gold are so long that everyone that one could have a meaningful connection to will be pushing up daisies before before there is a profit. And let's be clear, a profit in this sense is purely about gaming the system, getting something for nothing because you were smart enough to see it coming.<br><br> Lastly, capital. In our system capital refers to money or equipment, land or facilities, things that cost money in the pursuit of making money. What I find interesting about this is that 'capital' comes from 'heading off' or 'heading up' some project. Not from actual heads... Because pretty much all the money that I've ever seen, bills and coins, domestic and foreign, contemporary and ancient, has heads on it. The portraits of founders and luminaries, of tyrants and cultural icons, of heads is on all money, pretty much everywhere, pretty much always. My take away from this is that money is a social phenomena. The people and the framework, the legitimacy and the buy in make it valid.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br><a href=#c1371867165875241835 title="comment permalink">11/12/14, 11:14 PM</a><br><br>

In the worst case scenario, that stash is buried and forgotten, deliberately. For decline, other skill sets urgently need development. As you rightly point out, the less you need to trade the better, but when you do need to trade there are a few goods that stand out, both because of barter qualities and because of the degree of intermediation currently present. One such skill that I have now spent years developing is brewing and alcohol manufacture.. now there is a barter good! Ranks up with other goods such as tools, honey and vegetable oil in the 'moneyness' aspect, but has advantages now because of how many have their fingers in that pie. Many farmers will trade some free grain for a homebrew return on investment, and stronger spirits such as herb wines and spirits both keep and are happily received in trade. Plus potatos are among the easier home grown crops in my experience and are a wonderful feedstock. The exorbitant taxes on these goods where I find myself at present mean that developing trade networks now is super easy: one can give a very good deal (and comparable or superior product) compared to purchased alcohol while still capturing a large surplus in trade or currying a hell of a lot of favour (try supplying a farmer's wedding with draft and shnapps as a gift ;)). Your message to prepare these skills is spot on IMHO, and I would only stress that people should hasten to develop their networks now while it is easier than it would be 'after the fact'. Networks are pure capital for leveraging skills.<br><br><a href=#c6482026711495608945 title="comment permalink">11/13/14, 2:10 AM</a><br><br>

I asked him what he thought <br>was a good investment today in anticipation of economic collapse or the collapse of industrial civilization.<br><br>His response was that an investment in "durable goods" is the right way to go. <br><br>By "durable goods" he presumably meant items such as clothing, tools, cutlery, receptacles for food storage, food items that can be stored for a long time, etc. <br><br>What he didn't include was gold, silver, money, stocks, bonds or miscellaneous luxury items.<br><br>A collapse of the economy means the elimination of a whole lot of intermediation and the collapse of the money economy itself. Of course this won't happen overnight but that is the likely trajectory.<br><br>The subject of land and property did not come up in McPherson's facebook thread, but I have concluded that the value of land and property is dependent to some extent on the safety, harmony and social cohesion of the community residing on that land. <br><br>So whenever advice is requested about "what to do" these days in anticipation of economic, political and social decay, my inclination is to point people in the direction of agrarian communities with an adequate, clean fresh water supply, an active and diverse range<br>of farming products and a healthy relationship to the greater community in their vicinity. Such communities are relatively resilient with respect to shocks caused by economic and political calamities in the greater community or nation. <br><br>Also, such communities are less<br>dependent on money because intermediation is less of a factor in the daily operation of such communities than in those which depend so heavily on imported essential resources to survive.<br><br>This leads to the subject of ecovillages, something you might end up discussing at some point.<br><br>Not very many people live in ecovillages, nor can it be expected that ecovillages will become more common in the near future. They serve as an example of responsible, socially cohesive, resilient and relatively sustainable communities that pay close attention to ecological<br>factors. They serve as methodological examples for other communities to follow.<br><br>Frankly I don't know anything better to suggest to young people than that they acquire skills that would be useful in such communities, and that they learn about communities that are moving in the general direction of ecovillages. <br><br>Many so-called "transition towns" don't really qualify. Their residents still depend heavily on automobiles, industrial agriculture and a variety of electrical appliances connected to the electrical grid. I know because I live in one.<br><br>Most of the people go to Transition Towns meetings in automobiles.

You've mentioned in the previous post how the free peasant of your narrative would not have travelled much beyond his village during the course of his life. Andy Brown mentioned in the comments above that *relationships* are key investments in this future economy. All this requires significantly more stability (ie, less mobility) in terms of the make-up of the communities. A gift economy pre-supposes, for example, that the people receiving the gifts from you today will remain in the community to reciprocate in the future. Relationship investment takes p[lace over time and rather precludes the high mobility that the last several generations have enjoyed (in the US, in any event).<br><br>And as always, thanks for the post.

The former provides a means for some form of collective defense and shared goods and services as well as having enough people to field a night watch and raise an alarm. The latter, well - easy pickings, right?<br><br>The legal structure of individually owned titles to land, and the psychological attachments we have to the idea that private ownership = security, are going to present a huge barrier to forming the kinds of social arrangements we need in the future. At least in England and Europe there are still a lot of places that embody the old structures, albeit more or less compromised by the new developments and shopping malls, etc. In the New World, we are more screwed. It's hard not to look at American history as one long real estate development scheme; coming of age during the industrial era we organized without regard to fundamentals of localized life support and community, and there is going to be a steep price to pay for this. <br><br>As long as we have the current legal structure, apart from the relatively few places in America where there is some semblance to the old medieval structure, e.g., a small town surrounded by farms, the closest approximations we can probably achieve in the short run are land trusts, religious "compounds" and family "compounds." Or an "intentional community," if that can be sustained. <br><br>Btw, the novel, Lorna Doone, in addition to being one of the trippiest novels I have ever read, provides some information and insight into rural brigandage in 17th century England. While perhaps not the "war bands" that came into their own for a time following the collapse of the Western Roman empire, rural brigandage appears to be a fact of life well beyond the end of the medieval era. It seems to really disappear only once people are into the industrial age. <br><br>JMG, this week's essay and last week's are just fantastic.

The firm sold me a black English goatskin, with very little fuss, for 12.00 CAD a few days ago. <br><br>This morning's ADR remark regarding Perfect Leather I herewith make without having any commercial tie to the firm, beyond being a happy one-time customer. <br><br>My hope in the short term is to use the purchased goatskin to rebind my heavily used, disintegrating copy of a reference book, Kennedy's <i>Latin Primer</i>. <br><br>One does additionally dream, perhaps in vain, of binding a Google Books PDF printout for that 1858 monument to philology, G.J. Adler's <i>A Practical Grammar of the Latin Language; with Perpetual Exercises in Speaking and Writing</i>. <br><br>I suppose one attraction of bookbinding, as a skill to be possibly acquired, is that if one can bind books in a situation of comparative social calm, one may be able to extend the binder's skill into areas useful during social chaos.

We thought we should develop a novel one, to be marketed as 'Civilization'. Our envisaged game, unlike its competitors, would address civilization in depth. Nothing whatever, of course, would happen. The players would take interminable cyberwalks between impeccably pruned hedgerows in rolling green English cyber countryside, or else would doff their virtual tweeds and sip cyber-Darjeeling or cybersherry in oak-panelled rooms. Players could lose points for such solecisms as picking up the wrong cyberfork. (I gather forks work like this, that they give you a teeny-weeny outer one for the opening filet-of-sole and an approximately equal teeny-weeny inner one for the concluding crepes. Isabella Beeton, born 1836, departed this life 1865, remarked that whereas the beasts of the wild eat, people dine. In playing 'Civilization', it might be handy to consult her <i>Book of Household Management: Comprising Information for the Mistress, Housekeeper, Cook, Kitchen-Maid, Butler, Footman, Coachman, Valet, Upper and Under House-Maids, Ladys-Maid, Maid-of-All-Work, Laundry-Maid, Nurse and Nurse-Maid, Monthly, Wet, and Sick Nurses, etc. etc.: Also, Sanitary, Medical, and Legal Memoranda; With a History of the Origin, Properties, and Uses of All Things Connected with Home Life and Comfort</i>.)

I couldn't articulate my thoughts at the time (so thank you for doing so) but I knew that a much better investment would center, as you say, on values over things. For example, wouldn't we all rather live in a society that was cooperative, generous and compassionate- where everyone looked out for each other- than one that was greedy, fearful and back-stabbing (like the one we currently have?)

Now I am in my sixties, and what I have tried to save in my own sphere is vanishing from want of care. My children laugh at me and call me a hoarder of wire and buckets and old canning jars. Just the other day my husband took a whole barrel full of washed and ready canning jars to the dump because they were in the way. Sad how glass crashes. I am tired. Perhaps that is a blessing, as the torment of desire for beauty, for congeniality, for a hospitable and well-favored community, is giving way to acceptance of what is. Acceptance of what is is always such a sad end.<br><br><a href=#c8401342235558953887 title="comment permalink">11/13/14, 9:41 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_2b5690" id=c8627137076916076171></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/00354231084028659509 rel=nofollow>Renaissance Man</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I looked at some old economics textbooks, at the section on money, and read the 14 to 18 things (it varies by textbook) money is supposed to be for; I can prove in about 5 seconds that all but 2 are false, viz., a fungible medium of exchange and a tool for relatively easy valuation. That's it.<br>The former is best used in the exchange of, say, English wool for Flemish tapestries, or Egyptian cotton for Venetian glassware,, i.e. remote trade beyond the local circle of barter &amp; mutual obligation. It makes it much easier, but still not necessary. The intermediation charges for such trade were, originally, the risk and cost of transportation of goods from one place to another, which are, I think, quite legitimate. <br>Moreover, the basic system of barter for goods and services breaks down as the population grows beyond a very small village and as skills become specialized &amp; difficult to gain. Both money and intermediation become very useful. You might need a service, but it may be outside your village &amp; circle of barter &amp; obligation. What then? Time and effort required making such arrangements becomes a sufficient burden that a buyer becomes willing to pay an intermediary for time invested and knowledge gained to find and make arrangements with a seller.<br>The latter functions only if everyone is using the same standard to denote the value everywhere. Gold and silver are useful and we know that dark-age Saxons and Norse used money (chunks of silver by weight) for trade in their cities and towns, and coinage never completely disappeared. Why else would roving bands be seeking it out? Beyond a point, of course, the marginal returns of monetized intermediation become parasitic drains. We are currently past that point by a hop, skip, &amp; a gold-medal-winning leap. Buckminster Fuller, in the preface to Critical Path, suggested an international currency denoted in ergs of energy would balance pay across the world since a machinist in Tijuana uses the same amount of energy to produce a widget as one in San Diego. Since the U.S. in 1971 removed the international gold standard &amp; created an artificial value imbalance, hence the export of manufacturing to "cheap" foreign lands.<br>I must note that last week, even as you described Higg and his obligations &amp; rights, I saw intermediation at work. One of those obligations was labour in the Baron's fields, which is, of course, a form of intermediation: Higg must give up some of his time to the Baron, so the Baron is effectively taking a cut out of Higg's ability to produce food or other goods. One could argue that the Baron is charging for a service, i.e. providing protection to and direction for the village, but that becomes exactly the parasitic drain that eventually prompted western society to set about replacing aristocracies with elected governments and to attempt free markets.<br>(Also, minor point, the dentist you describe is not a good example: too skilled. Better to have used a smith or a woodworker. Suppose we wish to produce a dentist or doctor for the village or town, something beyond the simple yanking out of rotten teeth, which is relatively unskilled and easy enough to do, as Caravaggio illustrated so wonderfully. If people wish to have decent dental care, they need to produce enough to support a dental school for training, plus skilled labour for tools and materials, and, of course, the dentist who will do little else but see to teeth. Perhaps the local Baron keeps one on staff and covers the cost for the town, but such people are rarely that generous.)<br>I expect to see my putative wealth in my mandatory retirement savings evaporate, but I'm OK with that: my stash of "gold" is a collection of tools, books, and a plan to improve or gain skills in metal-working, wood-work, leather-work (harness-making), glass-work, and horse training &amp; husbandry.<br><br><a href=#c8627137076916076171 title="comment permalink">11/13/14, 9:55 AM</a><br><br>

We are not going to miss glass jars until they start becoming scarce, and then will we <i>ever</i> miss them. Eventually people find themselves bartering glass jars for things as expensive, in today's money-governed market, as eggs and cabbages. <br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br><br>PS: Remarks which might help others: <br><br>(1) I find it useful to standardize on what relatively little factory food I buy, getting always two basic factory foods (among a few others), and always in jars of the same kind - "Ragu" brand spaghetti sauce, and Dollarama pimento-stuffed olives. Over the years, these give one a big stock of jars in two standardized sizes, making one's mass of jars look rather attractive. Jars prove useful for keeping electronic components sorted. I find it additionally useful, and time-efficient, to keep track of jar contents by attaching a label to the lid, with a permanent magnet. (One can buy lots of such magnets, rather cheaply, from Active Surplus in Toronto.) Also helpful for labelling is half of a standard-sized business card blank. Those blanks can be bought in a box of 500 or so from a printing house. <br><br>(2) Having for years removed jar labels with groans and sweat, applying isopropyl from the local pharmacy, I have now learned that things go a little better with peanut butter. Somehow the fats or oils in peanut butter dissolve label glues better than pharmaceutical isopropyl does. <br><br>PPS: Willow, do please show this post to your dumb husband, and tell him, firmly, to get a better grip on himself. We don't in this present economy throw out savings bonds and promissory notes: why, then, should we throw out glass jars?<br><br><a href=#c1951213798119065170 title="comment permalink">11/13/14, 10:28 AM</a><br><br>

Money is best because money is always in demand, the other options are hit and miss.<br><br>2. Gold is intrinsically valuable. It's always been valued by humans and its physical properties as a material in the physical world have always been sought after. Additionally, gold and silver are GOOD at being money, because they meet the criteria for money much better than the other available options. Again, because of their very physical properties. Bamboo is bad at being railroad ties, and paper is bad at being money.<br><br>3. You're certainly right in that holding metal is no absolute guarantee; anyone can catch a stray bullet.

It's a technology that doesn't require a university education to understand and utilize. It doesn't demand any further expenditure of scarce energy.

It makes me think about all those soldiers our military machine keeps cranking out who know how to handle a gun and understand small unit infantry tactics. Very useful skills when Law and Order begin to degrade. 3) My research into the origin of money suggested an addition use of money in terms of trade. A dominant trade partner issues a peculiar gold coin (with a unique stamp) for trade items, and only accepts those gold coins in return for purchasing items. Thus it binds the smaller economies to the 800 pound gorilla, since a trader would want to "redeem" his gold tokens. Otherwise a trader might take his goods to the neighbor the 800 pound gorilla is in competition with. Its essentially the system the USA is using to bind economies and states to the "mother" economy, since most countries want to "redeem" their dollars they keep accumulating. But of course you knew that!<br><br><a href=#c3635423197983381419 title="comment permalink">11/13/14, 2:41 PM</a><br><br>

Let me begin with an assumed axiom that there has to be surplus of necessities for saving/hoarding 'abstract tokens' to make sense at all. I am agnostic on this. I for a very long time have taken to heart the very real possibility (probability) that we shall live in a world where there is little and diminishing societal surplus; in such a world (and in almost all variants that I can forsee, as well as at present) one indeed wants to be in minimally intermediated control, so far as it is possible, of the physical necessities of life. If they are short, no money will buy them. The capacity to e.g. grow food and retain skills relevant to the local community is thus paramount over all forms of monetary 'saving'. Minimize the need for trade, first by expanding the household and family economy, then by providing for the local economy, etc. I am young (early 30s), but this has been my goal for almost 15 years. In the dim case, this is all that is left. What are the steps that lead to a bullish for gold case in my head? 1) The current (IMF$) monetary system underpinning international trade will not persist because there are not enough real resources for debt (read 'savings') to be repaid in currently perceived value; somebody will defect. 2) That after this failure, there will not be immediate total catastrophe, but that the credibility of debt as a savings mechanism will be critically impaired, leading to 3) Debt (thus currency) revalued downwards against all physical goods. 4) Storage of surplus (if existing) and belief in future surplus will need a focal point aprés USD that will be 5) decided by surplus producers of necessary goods, e.g. food, energy.., for a number of reasons gold is on the short list. 6) This would result in a step revaluation of gold, even against other physical goods if used as a storage asset for trade. Thus the bullish case for me is not total collapse but a regression to smaller trade with gold considered a first tier barter asset (never again a currency) that floats against whatever currencies exist. Not one ounce more needs be dug up to fulfill this. Worth a small allocation as far as I can reckon. Perhaps I'm wrong, but then not much is lost and I have fine organic ale to comfort myself.<br><br><a href=#c8706390960938507807 title="comment permalink">11/13/14, 3:32 PM</a><br><br>

But those are tales best left out of this blog!<br><br>With the talk of war bands and Bogatyr asking me about Ninja families I'm thinking that Geiger's castles would be a good idea in the hills and mountains around the valleys. I know for a fact that quite a bit of that terrain is as rugged as the mountains of Japan that gave birth to the Ninja Clans. The area around Shasta Lake would be prime for such defenses as well as the coastal mountain ranges on the west and the Cascades east of the Sacramento Valley and up the Pacific Crest. Since what isn't steep and covered with rotten shale or with volcanic boulders it would be best to offer guide services through the mountains, up the Siskyous and into the valley over the old Interstate 5 route. It's drier than Japan but human beings are adaptable and instead of rice paddies tucked here and there nut trees like oak or hazel nuts could provide some flour along with the occasional irrigated small field of wheat or oats. Combining farming, hunting and foraging life would be acceptable there. I can see small houses with a stable and walled yards could provide some defense from raiders. The castles would be spaced along the route for mutual defense and as rest stops for travelers and caravans.<br><br>For travelers it would be relatively easy going in the valleys but a hard pull in the mountains baring nasty weather.<br><br>As I recall some time back Glen said those mountains would be a huge headache much like Afghanistan for anyone trying to fight an insurgency!<br><br><br>Wadulisi<br><br><a href=#c6036435729074408165 title="comment permalink">11/13/14, 4:10 PM</a><br><br>

It makes so much sense already and I suspect meditation on it will reveal more treasure of the best kind.<br><br>Also, thank you for your response to me a few weeks back: "It's when we wake up to the fact that life is a process of ripening toward death, that death is not the opposite of life but its fulfillment, that actual maturity finally arrives." That yielded many fruits when I meditated on it. It strikes me as relevant to Ervino's comment as well.<br><br>Regarding community, I don't think living in a large metro area is a barrier to developing community, if one works at it. In fact, anyone can develop community at any time, wherever one lives. We all have neighbors - get to know them. We have gotten to know some of ours (who have also gotten to know each other) and we have all gained from that. The ties vary in closeness quite a bit but this doesn't seem to matter much. Just knowing each other well enough to share excess, borrow tools, and so forth makes this place richer, in all the right ways, for all of us.<br><br>Here's a story about social ties in a large metro area (St. Louis). Yesterday our new wood stove was installed. Since my husband and I are both retired we were at home during the installation and had opportunity to converse with the two men who installed the stove. As often happens in such conversational situations, the men asked us where we'd worked, and we told them. Both men live in exurbia, over an hour's drive from our inner-suburb community. Yet it turned out that one of the best friends of one of the men knew my husband from a factory they both worked at in another inner suburb! This isn't an isolated case; more often than not, when we meet someone for the first time, we find out that we know at least one person in common with the person we meet. In fact, I'd only been in St. Louis for four years when I met Mike, yet we knew at least 6 people in common. Dense social ties like these will help to cushion some aspects of decline; making them strikes me as one of the better ways to use my time.<br><br><a href=#c1480962405529959 title="comment permalink">11/13/14, 4:16 PM</a><br><br>

I'll check it out. <br><br>Dammerung, obviously I disagree. Your first point merely states that if you have the kind of economy that needs money, why, yes, you probably need money to run it. Most kinds of economy don't, because they don't foster the kind of hyperspecialization and mediation that requires it. Your second point is quite simply nonsense -- there is no such thing as "intrinsic value;" all value is imputed to objects by human beings as a part of cultural habits, and as I noted in my post, the concept of abstract ("intrinsic") value is a very poor way to talk about the complex human experience of valuing things. <br><br>Your third point assumes that there will be somewhere you can go, by ship or otherwise, to get away from what's coming: a common supposition, but to my mind, a mistaken one. Finally, money is a technology, but it's one that has serious problems, and in previous dark ages, it's a technology that's been discarded for very good reasons, and there are equally good reasons (as already noted) why I expect it to be discarded this time around, too. When that happens, history suggests that being too attached to shiny metals can get you very thoroughly dead in a hurry, while those who don't have such an attachment are at less risk of that unwelcome experience. <br><br>Bob, thank you.

The economic crisis that gripped the world in 2008 was primarily driven by a drastic mismatch between money and wealth. When the price of a rundown suburban house zoomed from $75,000 to $575,000, for example, the change marked a distortion in the yardstick rather than any actual increase in the wealth being measured. That distortion caused every economic decision based on it – for example, a buyer’s willingness to go over his head into debt to buy the house, or a bank’s willingness to lend money on the basis of imaginary equity – to suffer similar distortions. Now that the yardsticks have snapped back to something like their proper length, the results of the distortion have to be cleared out of the economy if the amount of money in the system is once again to reflect the actual amount of wealth."<br><br><a href=#c2635423410082572851 title="comment permalink">11/13/14, 9:11 PM</a><br><br>

As I noted to Dammerung above, it's far from likely that you'll be able to go somewhere away from the impending mess; most people in the US, certainly, are going to have to adapt in place, and gold isn't an advantage for that, for reasons I've already noted.

Thus it's not simply a matter of waiting for this civilization to die -- it's possible to identify spaces (physical, cognitive, and other) where it's already lost its grip, and leveraging your ability to shape those spaces in order to begin building the future amid the disintegrating carcass of the present.”<br><br>I’ve never thought about things in quite those terms before. That really does give a different shape to everything we’ve discussing here. That’s an extremely challenging approach to take to the world, especially as monolithic as our society can seem at times. I know you’ve been talking about this the whole time in various ways, but it leaves me wondering… where are those spaces, and what power can we have to shape them in any meaningful way? It kind of ties into Ervino’s question… I don’t care all that much about technological progress, or metastasizing into outer space. The ecotechnic future you outlined is fine with me. But if that’s going to come about at all, it’s millennia in the future, it’s a distant fantasy… It doesn’t belong to us, and the ancestors of the people who are going to shape that future life far away, come from different cultures, speak different languages. You’ve outlined how we can survive and find meaning even in the hardest of times, and that’s enough. Are we meant to survive, keep our heads down, cut our waste, and brace ourselves for a hard life and a young death, work on finding meaning in life as it is, free our minds and work on our spirituality? Or is there some deeper calling? But you’ve talked about being cultural conservers, gathering the gifts of our culture that they might be of use for the people on the other side. The gap between us and them seems just too far for that to be a meaningful goal. Those people will find their own way, build their own legacies… We won’t be participating in their economies, and we won’t be the ones creating them either.

That’s probably more of an academic question than anything, since well money wasn’t all that important at the time. But I'm a little curious about that role, was it used among the mercantile class and nobility? Was it something mostly confined to urban centers? And why would it arise at all if there was still a functioning feudal economy that hadn't started to undergo intermediation yet?

In a post <a href=http://www.themonthebard.org/immortality/ rel=nofollow>taking</a> the Archdruid's side against Nebris, Themon the Bard laments that "the idea of the sanctity of individual life[...] is all around us, like fleas or a bad smell." The post-libertarian blogger <a href=http://powerofnarrative.blogspot.com/ rel=nofollow>Arthur Silber</a> takes exactly the opposite view, that our society <i>doesn't</i> value individual life or at least individual autonomy. Obviously, at least one of them is at least partly wrong.<br><br>And to Jerrica, I submit that this confusion over abstractions may lie at the heart of Ervino Cus' wondering "why bother?" If, as JMG often seems to be saying, the problem with our civilization is its over-valuation of abstract thought, and if (as it seems to me) all thought is to some degree abstract, it's an easy if mistaken leap of logic to conclude that <i>thought itself</i> is the problem. ("He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man." -- Samuel Johnson)<br><br>But, of course, joining a rape gang isn't truly making a beast of oneself; it's just letting Masculine Ego (TM Nebris) run riot unrestrained by intellect. Abandoning intellect and Masculine Ego both, you get Walt Whitman thinking he could turn and live with animals, or all those anarcho-primitivists that JMG depicts as fleeing the Collapse only to wander into the woods and stupidly starve to death.<br><br>Keeping Intellect and Masculine Ego, you get civilization as we know it in general and Faustian civilization in particular. Keeping Intellect while abandoning or at least curbing Masculine Ego... what do you get from that? Is it even possible? Nebris seems to think so, and so did Jesus, Hillel, Buddha, Aleister Crowley, and all those other illuminated souls who together form the embodiment of the Teacher.<br><br><i>Your third point assumes that there will be somewhere you can go, by ship or otherwise, to get away from what's coming: a common supposition, but to my mind, a mistaken one.</i><br><br>To mine as well. And, in fact, I submit that this is why so many people think the Collapse will be an extinction-level event. Previously, the level of global devastation ahead was the <i>cause</i> of civilizations falling, not the <i>result</i> of it. Faustian civilization now has the ability to create natural disasters; it's just not as deliberate as the conspiracy theorists believe.<br><br>Having said that, I think we can and probably will get through this. Human population is likely to hit a Toba-level bottleneck; whether we come out the other side this time remains to be seen.<br><br><a href=#c3600777155441948982 title="comment permalink">11/14/14, 8:39 AM</a><br><br>

The ongoing conversation I’ve been having with a friend about our culture’s fetishization of the future yielded up this quote from Wendell Berry, which I think has a lot to contribute to the discussion going on here about the place we, living today have in bridging the gap to future generations. There are some nuggets here worth meditating on. I think it helps provide the beginnings of an answer to my earlier question as well:<br><br>“The higher aims of 'technological progress' are money and ease. And this exalted greed for money and ease is disguised and justified by an obscure, cultish faith in 'the future.' We do as we do, we say, 'for the sake of the future' or 'to make a better future for our children.' How we can hope to make a good future by doing badly in the pres...ent, we do not say. We cannot think about the future, of course, for the future does not exist: the existence of the future is an article of faith. We can be assured only that, if there is to be a future, the good of it is already implicit in the good things of the present. We do not need to plan or devise a 'world of the future'; if we take care of the world of the present, the future will have received full justice from us. A good future is implicit in the soils, forests, grasslands, marshes, deserts, mountains, rivers, lakes, and oceans that we have now, and in the good things of human culture that we have now; the only valid 'futurology' available to us is to take care of those things. We have no need to contrive and dabble at 'the future of the human race'; we have the same pressing need that we have always had—to love, care for, and teach our children.”<br><br><a href=#c5627497879210301495 title="comment permalink">11/14/14, 8:52 AM</a><br><br>

He makes the point that money serves as a claim on goods and services. As such, it is based on trust: you trust the entity giving you money for your goods and services and the entity issuing the money that you will in turn be able to exchange the money for goods and services. This brings to mind a quote from Pope Benedict XVI: "If the market is governed solely by the principle of the equivalence in value of exchanged goods, <br>it cannot produce the social cohesion that it requires in order to function."

Most of us just self treat and therefore go undiagnosed, but if you really talk to Americans about their thought process and/or learning process you will see that most people go about it in different ways. Most of the time these processes are totally fine, sometimes they are even better than what we typically teach. The term "disorder" is apt because the process itself is not judged on its effectiveness, but on how well it conforms to the order that we have constructed.<br>If it differs too greatly, then we use special education to either change the student's process or change the teaching methods. Also when getting your education licence, you also have to learn about "cultural sensitivity", which ends up covering a lot of the same ground. Some examples have to do with eye contact, touching, tone and volume of voice, concept of time, gender roles, etc. For example, you are not supposed to look autistic children in the eye, same goes for Arab students, you're supposed to flexible with deadlines for kids with ADHD, same with American Indian kids. Understand, I'm not suggesting there is a perfect one to one ration of what we call disorders and different cultures, but there are definate aspects that one can find similarities in treatment if not cause.<br>If you throw in some natural selection into the mix, you can see how it could come to be that personal traits could become a cultural norm. For example Bob Farmer, has OCD. It is not so harmful a way of thinking that he cannot run his farm and have a large family, so he does. The kids now have a genetic predisposition to this way of thinking, and have been raised in such a way as to think of this as "normal". If the Farmer children are in turn successful and each settle more land, then their farming methods and way of thinking will spread to their own farms. Eventually they will look to have their own families and will find spouses who are at least accepting of their traits. As they look for spouses, farm hands and trading partners they will look for people who have similar mindset or at least can cope with their traits. Thus, a feedback loop is created and perpetuated. Eventually their behavior and way of thinking is known as customs, and religion; genetics are never considered. <br>Why do you suppose that we are willing to accept that physical characteristics can occur in this manner, but not mental characteristics?<br><br><a href=#c8901449225367212299 title="comment permalink">11/14/14, 10:24 AM</a><br><br>

For all the guff the late 1800's gets about inequalities and the boom/bust economy, in reality the 50 years between the Civil War and WWI saw, when averaged out, the greatest growth in per-capita living standard in US history----the 50 years leading up to 2014 isn't even close. Now we don't actually have good numbers on unemployment and GDP (the federal government didn't start collecting such data until 1930 under Hoover), but we have clear data on international trade, gross production of food and raw materials, and wages and prices (this last can be reconstructed with high accuracy just by looking at period newspapers). <br><br>The thing is, deflation is not bad for an economy; it is bad for a debt-based economy. Deflation is marginally beneficial to wage-earners and savers, and marginally bad for producers, though the historical experience says that production and investment will continue nevertheless (except in periods of chaotic deflation such as 1929-33 or 1873-75). However deflation is very bad if debt loads are very high. And that is the problem: in our current system money=debt, and therefore monetary deflation is suicide. If money were an asset, deflation would simply be a condition, beneficial to some (mostly wage-earneres and savers) and harmful to others (debtors and producers).<br><br>I am continually shocked that the meme deflation=PURE EVIL is so widespread. In a mainstream newspaper article, say on the situation in Japan, the word "deflation" is almost never used unless accompanied by the word "destructive" or by a small editorialization on why it is bad. Consider that the past year of price-inflation in Japan has resulted in an 11% reduction in purchasing power of the citizenry.....an this is regarded, on whole, as an unabashed positive by most main-stream observers...the REAL problem, they'll say, is Japan's lingering "deflation mentality".<br><br>On a more human level, in spite of all the turmoil, consider the change in circumstances of a common person in 1865 (who would have lived in the countryside, at least a day's travel to a population center) and a common person in 1914, who would have lived in a city, with running water, trolleys, and, in most urban areas, electricity. Communication was instantaneous in 1914 compared to 1865, life-expectancies were decades longer (in the Civil War, the germ theory of disease wasn't accepted yet!). Life in 1914 would be almost unrecognizable to the 1860's person.<br><br>In comparison, the lives of people in 1965 compared to today are only incrementally different. We have the Internet (our one big difference) and better TV's, but also less disposable income, and longer working hours per household.<br><br><a href=#c912199859681419282 title="comment permalink">11/14/14, 11:15 AM</a><br><br>

A castle could be built by a local community and be defended by a modest garrison of even just few tens of knights and men at arms.<br>Star forts by contrast were usually pretty expensive affairs reserved for cities or strategic positions. Garrisons numbering in the thousands with several tens of heavy guns were required for a determined defense. They required the backing of centralized state, or at least the efforts of a reasonably wealthy city state. <br>One could always throw up a breastwork with some abatis, palisades and such around a village, that should fend off the occasional raiders. If somebody shows up with artillery and a sizable body of infantry it is game over however. Possibly something like a Martello Tower could offer reasonable resistance against smoothbore artillery yet still be defended by relatively few men. Even 1850s style rifled artillery will chew up such structures however.<br>Context also matters, the Japanese developed musketry but did not get around to make decent artillery until the 19th century, so castles remained viable even after the introduction of firearms.<br><br><a href=#c3367036896033500972 title="comment permalink">11/14/14, 12:45 PM</a><br><br>

To wit, production of surplus tradable goods went almost to zero in W. Europe, but not elsewhere. Still, people in W. Europe wanted stuff, so they paid for it with whatever "tokens" of value they still possessed (elsewhere gold, for use as money, was in demand and would certainly be accepted regardless of what funny head was on it). Of course there was always *some* trade, including overseas shipping, even in the depth of the Dark Ages. Thus Europe got some "consumer goods," and in return sent its coinage elsewhere. But it didn't have much to sell, so there was no way for coinage to return. It doesn't take long for the money to be drained out like this, and replaced by mostly perishable "consumer" goods (fine clothing, grain, weapons, pots, etc) which themselves ultimately vanish or wear out over time.<br><br>Anyway, this process easily explains a drainage of precious metals, which is indeed observed in the historical record. If you want a source for my claims here, you could read the fantastic book "The Great Wave: Price Revolutions and the Rhythm of History".<br><br>However, I agree that this doesn't explain why other kinds of tokens (like iron bars a la Sparta) didn't take their place----for that you certainly do have to look at social systems.<br><br>As an aside, ancient Rome actually did have banks, though they seem not to have invented scrip money. Still, they loaned at interest, and practiced fractional reserve lending. The first record of a liquidity crisis comes from the reign of Tiberius, when, to wrest Rome's finances from financiers, he withdrew state funds from the day's financial institutions (similar to what Andrew Jackson did in 1836 with the Deposit and Distribution Act). The result was a scramble to liquidate real assets (farmland, ships, etc), which caused a crash in commodity prices---an actual depression! The crisis abated when Tiberius himself supplied liquidity from imperial coffers, bailing out the bankers. Read about it: financial crisis of 33AD.<br><br><a href=#c2129550412380078167 title="comment permalink">11/14/14, 1:38 PM</a><br><br>

This is especially true for at the low levels, where the connections required for laundering money through "the system" are not available.

Gold is solid, heavy, earthy, like our bodies; but shines and gives joy to those who behold it, like the sun.<br><br> But in Imperial terms, gold facilitates trade, and that makes the whole imperial wealth pump do its pumping. . That's the real key about money - although I'm delighted by the recognition of money as the primary intermediary and I love how you've approached the subject in connection with the last two blog entries.  The facilitation of international trade, as well as intermediation, are what makes money averse to a sustainable human ecology.  It facilitates trade between cities or states or nations, and the development of unsustainable over-production or over-consumption bubbles.  It facilitates incredible exploitation of resources, including whole communities of people and it is founded upon incessant warfare - hardly something conducive to the long-lasting seres of human ecology.<br><br>Now there's something about Light, the source of all life, as well as the presence of Death in all time periods, and mankind's struggle against death; and then gold's facilitation of trade - as well as facilitation of intermediation, including philosophers! - and the flowering of limitless desires in a limited world...  Gold for silks, spices, teas, artworks, slaves, women, the leisure to conduct the barbarism of reflection... what have you...<br><br>Then there's a whole 'nother level of metaphysics when we came to find a new source of light deep under the ground - and it doesn't just look like light, it acts like light too... and it's black as empty space, not solid (though durable), and not imprintable with any names - and as apparently plentiful (at first, when bad habits were being trained) as the black African slaves whom it helped to "free" worldwide ... er, that is, help to raise to wage slave status, along with nearly all of the whites.<br><br>Gold's rarity and sunlight appearance fits well the imperial hierarchy.  The concept of a king's closer participation in the divine persisted into feudal times - and may have even supported the rise out of the darkest times, as Charlemagne and Arthur and others indicate. Then, in the big break from the feudal age into the modern age - the French Revolution - in the crowning achievement of rationalism (ahem), all were let loose to be as Kings and Queens... and one of the first things that happened was a huge bank grab by the Rothschilds after the English beat Napoleon at Waterloo – not in the form of gold, which isn't rational, but in the form of war bonds.  Essentially, Rothschild was simultaneously buying up people's war bonds on the cheap while people expected the English to lose, and relaying messages about the status of the conflict. An old example of insider trading – probably not possible with gold.<br><br>I think gold is a token of the first flowering of consciousness.  These are very primal, very deep-rooted habits of thought going on subconsciously.  I think only something like a worldwide calamity and the kind of memory it would imprint on the collective subconscious would be able to break the attraction of gold, of ideas of empire building, and the limitlessness of desires to transcend death.<br><br>It's a whole 'nother matter again to find a way to get people to worship compost. :)  In terms of longevity, durability of human cultures, a much superior object of worship than either gold or oil.<br><br><br><a href=#c5768522428735647417 title="comment permalink">11/14/14, 8:36 PM</a><br><br>

That was also the case in Europe before the modern period -- gold had a massive metaphysical dimension. Brides didn't wear white back then, either!<br><br>DASK, thanks for the clarification. <br><br>Trog, that's true -- I was simply recalling, with some pleasure, the fate of the last TV I ever owned. It was a portable, thus easy to haul out onto the fire escape and drop straight into the dumpster. <br><br>Salus Populi, I have indeed read James -- glad to hear from someone else who has. Of course values are primary and provide the frame within which facts take their meaning; to my mind, though, the distinction still matters, since drawing the distinction can make it easier for people who disagree on values to come to agreement over facts as facts. <br><br>Russell, oh, granted, not being there is the best defense. Still, not everyone will have that option. <br><br>Richard, er, one ounce of gold is currently worth less than $1200. Even if it doubles or triples in price -- and it's purely an act of faith that it'll do even that much -- that won't get you one acre, much less forty. I hope you have a plan B!<br><br>Kyoto, of course it's necessary to participate to some extent in the money economy now -- the system is set up to make a refusal to participate all but impossible. What I'm suggesting is that downshifting that involvement as much as you can, and meeting as many of your own needs as possible via non-money exchanges or your own labor, is a way to start extracting yourself from a system that's rigged to rip you off. <br><br>Donalfagan, that's basically already happening in the US -- a lot of municipalities are trying to balance their budgets by having the police seize property and impose random fines on those who don't have the political clout to stir up trouble. Expect more of that as we proceed. <br><br>DaShui, that doesn't surprise me at all. <br><br>Wolfgang, interesting. That was done well into the Middle Ages in Europe; there was very little money, but people kept track of certain exchanges in terms of a notional currency, and when an imbalance built up, it could be settled by an exchange in kind that was valued at the right amount according to just price theory. <br><br>Matthew, fascinating. Can you point me to a source for that, while I break out my old volume of Bran Mak Morn stories&gt;? ;-)<br><br>Wolfgang, thanks for the details!<br><br><a href=#c209886440712577368 title="comment permalink">11/14/14, 9:24 PM</a><br><br>

As for shillings, there were very few of them actually in circulation -- as I noted to Wolfgang Brinck above, when people in the Middle Ages did in-kind exchanges, the notional value in currency according to just price theory was used as a convenient measure of value, even though it was very rare for currency to change hands. <br><br>Neo, the thought of Aleister Crowley as a model for curbing one's ego ("masculine" or otherwise) makes my head spin. <br><br>Eric, that's an excellent quote -- well, almost anything from Berry is worth a few sessions of meditation at least. <br><br>RPC, nicely summarized. Thanks for the link!<br><br>Mettrodome, mostly because a lot of people want to use the idea of inheritance of mental characteristics in a pejorative sense, in the service of our culture's pervasive fantasies of ethnic superiority. Whatever your physical inheritance might be, you can usually improve your strength, stamina, dexterity, etc. by appropriate training and practice, to the extent that the original physical endowment is less important than what you do with it. The same is emphatically true with one's mental endowment -- what you're born with is far less important than how you develop it. <br><br>Bob, I saw that. Yes, it's a very helpful measure of decline. We might call it the "Only One Wrench" measurement...<br><br>Andropos, sure, when leveled out -- that's because it was an economic moonscape of soaring bubbles and catastrophic crashes, which saw the longest single depression in American history. Now of course you're right that deflation is no more inherently evil than inflation -- it simply distributes the pain differently -- but it's by no means Utopian, either, not least because wages tend to fall faster than prices. Marx had some useful comments on deflationary economics, which might be worth considering in this context. <br><br>The point that I was making, though, is that many of the countries who might be interested in imposing a new currency regime have their own national, corporate, and private debts to service, and going on a gold standard (with the resulting deflation) would make that all but impossible, pitching them into economic crisis. That's why I said they'd be crazy to launch a gold-backed currency; in their current economic situation, they need the printing press to maintain social stability, though not as much as the US does. <br><br>Bogatyr, thanks for the link. <br><br>Marcello, thanks for the correction. Here in the US, star forts were reworked in various ways to handle infantry assaults and the like, and they were also done very cheaply -- the fort here in Cumberland, for example, combined earthworks and timber palisades; <a href="http://www.route40.net/page.asp?n=10594" rel=nofollow>here's a couple of images</a>. My guess is that something like that might be the early form, with new patterns emerging over time as deindustrial warfare evolves. <br><br>Atilio, good. Krishnamurti's usually spot on. <br><br>Brian, thanks for the details!<br><br><a href=#c4653492464060535151 title="comment permalink">11/14/14, 9:52 PM</a><br><br>

That's why people are still going to universities in the US today, even though they'll never recover financially from the economic burden of paying inflated tuition prices and interest. In the same way, warlords seize gold because everything they've ever learned says that gold is really, really valuable -- it's only in retrospect that the idea that treasure really ought to be left in the ground, or on the bottom of the Rhine, sinks in. <br><br>Val, you're right that a dark age isn't actually that much worse than a decaying imperial civilization. One way or another, the arts take a beating -- though there can be exceptions. If you don't fancy a monastic lifestyle, you may want to make sure to add some practical crafts to your skill set. <br><br>Rita not from India, I've seen the same thing repeatedly -- I once had a libertarian insist to me that Attila the Hun was a socialist, for example. It's a sign of just how little of a historical sense survives the pressures of dogmatic ideology. <br><br>James, thanks for the tip! I'll put it on the to-read list. <br><br>Onething, glad to be of help. I used to work in nursing homes, and have had the experience of taking someone's vital signs as those dropped to zero, so I can empathize both with you and with your coworker. <br><br>John, thanks for the data! That makes perfect sense. <br><br>Chris, I wonder what'll happen in the deindustrial future, when the accessible gold mines are played out and what veins of ore remain are so far beneath the surface and/or so poor in quality that, lacking fossil fuels and the technology that depends on them, it no longer makes any economic sense to mine and smelt them.

Yes, I realise that he concludes that over the long term mankind is on a road to progress, but his insight into the violent nature of ancient life is worth considering.<br><br>So how would gold ownership have changed the odds of violent death? Certainly gold ownership offered no guarantees in ancient times; and it is well worth bearing in mind that only recently when both the Libyan and Ukrainian governments were overthrown, that one of the first acts of the new regimes was to remove the former central banks' gold from the vanquished countries to a new home with the vanquishers.<br><br>But for most gold owners of more modest means, I imagine that having a highly tradeable wealth asset would have offered a very real survival advantage.<br><br>That note about <a href=http://ubercraftorg.ipage.com/goldtrail/goldtrail-2001-01.html#56 rel=nofollow>The Gold of Troy</a> was certainly thought-provoking.

This week's post, however, hits so close to home that I think I'll chime in! <br><br>We've lived a very primitive life for the last 3 years, mostly to see first-hand and personally what we could live without full-time, and what technologies we really want to have back in our domestic arsenal. (In a nutshell, electric light, more fans, a small fridge, and a way to charge our batteries at home - 250 watts of PV solar should be ample).<br><br>The part of my comment that's germane to this week's post, though, is that, in the process of adopting the 12 watt life we've lead since spring '12, we've arguably joined a different social class than our middle class friends, ESPECIALLY MENTALLY, even the ones who claim to be dedicated to "sustainability." In general, they believe that they can keep their current lifestyle as long as they substitute "green" technologies for "brown" ones, and we don't. We field a lot of questions along the lines of "how does having propane service fit your ethic?" Well, because we understand that using high quality energy directly, and sparingly, in your 480 s.f. cottage built of recycled components is a more adaptive response to the future than installing a 5kW solar array on the roof of your 2000 s.f. SIP "green" house. The latter approach is hoarding richly imperialist tidbits for the future, and the prior is adapting to the emerging realities of human ecology. One requires guns and deadbolts and the other doesn't. <br><br>Having books to loan out and organic gardening knowledge to share doesn't usually incite violence in times of decline. Having gold and ammunition does. Gold and guns are a lot easier to steal than fruit trees and compost. Both approaches initiate positive feedback loops, but one sure seems a lot more positive than the other to me! ;)<br><br>But rest assured that most of your friends will not understand!

Yes, I think among the best metaphors we can use to shape our consciousness and our actions in this world come from the natural world - not what we make, but what is already actually there. That gives me much hope! Such deep meaning and significance in what is simply a "Given."<br><br>@Eric S. said: "It kind of ties into Ervino’s question… I don’t care all that much about technological progress, or metastasizing into outer space. The ecotechnic future you outlined is fine with me. But if that’s going to come about at all, it’s millennia in the future, it’s a distant fantasy… It doesn’t belong to us, and the ancestors of the people who are going to shape that future life far away, come from different cultures, speak different languages.... Those people will find their own way, build their own legacies… We won’t be participating in their economies, and we won’t be the ones creating them either. Why think about them at all if they’re so distant and we have so little power to touch them?"<br>No matter what, even if we do nothing - enjoy the spectacle (it will be enjoyable or despicable or both, which depends on our perspective) we still must choose. So why not choose to help make the ground of the future sere of human ecology, the future way of human being in the Earth? The one that steps lightly with technology, is grounded in deep understanding of nature's modes of being, metamorphosis, and cycles? I would hazard to guess that at least *something* - just one part per million of what we're doing now - will make it through the gap - and if nothing will, then was it such a big loss to take a shot? I'm reminded of the Wayne Gretzky quote...<br>I really appreciate Ervino's comment too... sometimes hope opens up behind colossal despair. (There was that scene in Tolkein's trilogy when Frodo was in Shelob's lair (the most ancient darkness).. a darkest moment in the story: he was aided by a very ancient light. I think we have to seek and carry that light.)<br><br>JMG - Regarding the exhausted gold mines of the deindustrial future: We might suspect that on the economic terms of the deindustrial future, these massive piles of gold will have passed the mark of diminishing returns and diminishing marginal utility several thousand-fold. You're on to something there: gold may very well then appear to be a mark of the callous disregard for the Earth, a symbol of imperial hubris, a symbol of the stark raving mad fear of death, and of a childish, tempestuous and destructive age of ignorant men.<br><br>Thus we may contemplate the future ecotechnic world as both deinsdustrial and significantly progressive.<br><br><a href=#c9204588916889167706 title="comment permalink">11/15/14, 5:32 PM</a><br><br>

They'd have to travel the road to get anywhere fast and might have no idea about the back trails that could be used to trap them. HE can just as easily be used against them! Or even home made black powder grenades made of baked clay with sharp stone chips or shards of glass baked in or inside with the powder!<br><br>As far as 18" of dirt between you and what they can throw at you, short of HE those feed sacks are about that thick or better with the plastering added. Try hefting some of those feed sacks some time! Walls built out of them to housing specifications are really stout! There is an example in the book on earthbag building by Kifmeyer and Hunter where a car hit a wall about 6 to 7 feet tall going 35 mph and it just knocked the plaster off the wall at the impact point! The front end of the car was done! It couldn't be driven away. With the cheap barbed wire between the layers the walls flex a lot but don't come down. I wouldn't be worried about the walls coming down in all but a really big quake, the roof would be more of a concern! <br><br>I would conclude by saying that if you 'have stuff' and someone is determined to take it, its counter productive to blow it up trying to take it. An all out assault is more likely!<br><br>Love your cat picture btw, I have a very large, flesh and blood one much like it, behind me snoozing away!<br><br><br>Wadulisi<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c297066304035870233 title="comment permalink">11/15/14, 9:37 PM</a><br><br>

Your comment a number of weeks ago about death not being the opposite of life, also stitched its way into the patchwork of my thoughts. One of the ways in which I have been contemplating and cultivating peace in my own demise is by choosing an annual plant in my garden and following it from seed to seed. I began with a showy poppy, because they are just as pleasing to me after they have gone to seed as they are in bloom. Other plants soon followed; cilantro in its later all-weathered stages is a new favourite. The kind of comfort that can be drawn from this exercise (for me) is profound. The cultish quest for eternal youth need not take up a lot of time, thought, and resources; I need not extend my time of blooming by artifice. There is equally interesting, and dare I say beautiful, stages now and in the offing. Perhaps any helplessness that I experience at the fate of industrial civilisation can be eased in the wrinkles, folds, and rotting of longer living plant life. I have been wandering slowly back through some of Emerson's Essays lately; he has a more fanciful way of talking about limits and human sorts of predicaments.<br><br>"The uneasiness which the thought of our helplessness in the chain of causes occasions us, results from looking too much at one condition of nature, namely, Motion. But the drag is never taken from the wheel. Wherever the impulse exceeds, the Rest or Identity insinuates its compensation. All over the wide fields of earth grows the prunella or self-heal. After every foolish day we sleep off the fumes and furies of its hours; and though we are always engaged with particulars, and often enslaved [187] to them, we bring with us to every experiment the innate universal laws. These, while they exist in the mind as ideas, stand around us in nature forever embodied, a present sanity to expose and cure the insanity of men. Our servitude to particulars betrays us into a hundred foolish expectations. We anticipate a new era from the invention of a locomotive, or a balloon; the new engine brings with it the old checks. They say that by electromagnetism your salad shall be grown from the seed whilst your fowl is roasting for dinner; it is a symbol of our modern aims and endeavors, of our condensation and acceleration of objects; — but nothing is gained; nature cannot be cheated; man's life is but seventy salads long, grow they swift or grow they slow. In these checks and impossibilities however we find our advantage, not less than in the impulses. Let the victory fall where it will, we are on that side. And the knowledge that we traverse the whole scale of being, from the centre to the poles of nature, and have some stake in every possibility, lends that sublime lustre to death, which philosophy and religion have too outwardly and literally striven to express in the popular doctrine of the immortality of the soul. The reality is more excellent than the report. Here is no ruin, no discontinuity, no spent ball. The divine circulations never rest nor linger. "<br><br>I am delighted by the idea of measuring a life in salads! For anyone interesting in the idea of gifts and giving, Emerson also has an essay on Gifts that is worth reading. Any idea what was happening in Concord at this time that could be transplanted to the Pacific Northwest in the 21st century?!<br><br><a href=#c1511163360143483941 title="comment permalink">11/16/14, 9:43 AM</a><br><br>

In it he argues that gold, precious stones and other such materials are prized from an aesthetic standpoint because they have the power to transport the mind into a realm of transcendent beauty. At bottom they are valued for what may fairly be called metaphysical reasons, much as suggested by Rita in her comments on the case of Indian culture. <br><br>I postulate that in the capitalist mindset, this transcendental power becomes mixed up (and I mean "mixed up" in terms of logic as well as any other sense) with the notion of "intrinsic value." Hence the need to stack tons of bullion in a dark vault where no one ever sees it. <br><br>But really this is crazy. Gold belongs on gilded paintings, statues, jewelry, and other objects that make optimal use of its beauty for the benefit of all that see it. Hoarding it in a dark place is a form of dingbatness. <br><br>Much the same applies even to dragon hoards and other troves. If the Rhine Maidens guarded "a very large store of value, equivalent to billions of Euros," how exciting would that story be? A trove discovered is *not* the equivalent of lots of turnips and potatoes and other forms of life support; it's the key to another realm. <br><br>For such reasons as these, goddesses wear gold, and not just in the Indian pantheon. <br><br>********<br><br>I will sing of stately Aphrodite, gold crowned and beautiful, <br>whose dominion is the walled cities of all sea-set Cyprus. <br>There the moist breath of the western wind <br>wafted her over the waves of the loud-moaning sea in soft foam, <br>and there the gold-filleted Hours welcomed her joyously. <br>They clothed her with heavenly garments: <br>on her head they put a fine, well-wrought crown of gold, <br>and in her pierced ears they hung ornaments of orichale and precious gold, <br>and adorned her with golden necklaces <br>over her soft neck and snow white breasts, <br>jewels which the gold-filleted Hours wear themselves <br>whenever they go to their father's house <br>to join the lovely dances of the gods. <br><br>*******<br><br>...Homeric Hymn VI, Hugh G.

If you put some amount of your wealth (savings? is there such a thing?) into precious metals (which are not all equal on many levels) it makes a big difference how much of it. I am no expert so my perception may be way off the mark. I am not very knowledgeable about historical finances, and I have a slightly different relation to some materials than many. I've heard the 10% rule of thumb a few times by now. I assume this refers to savings. For many people it will be pretty hard to say before hand what part of their wealth is real savings. Is it what is left over after all bills and debt plus 1 (or 3?) month of living expenses are paid? What about likely or known future costs (new roof, college, etc.)? Maybe the "if you have to ask..." rule applies here. In my perspective there are various motivations for diversifying your wealth into various things (skills, relationships, bank money, paper money currencies, bitcoinish stuff, precious metals, consumables, durables, gifts that keep on giving, and more skills). Gold has a bit of a special role, but I'd say is still somewhat similar to other precious metals. From my perspective it is a patently bad hedge against long term depreciation in a long descent scenario - even apart of many of the physical security issues discussed here. If population declines but warlords don't manage to loose track of their gold fast enough there will be more precious metals per head than before. However it strikes me that gold and (more or less) organized violence really do make a very good pair for practical reasons. If this section of the population increases it may be good for the price but you have to sit down and think hard if you want to be in a (not free) market with these people. Transactions with them as average customer may bring us back to Beowulf and the Nibelungs...<br>Is it good as a hedge against market volatility? Not so sure about that but I'd say it makes a lot more sense there. The most likely use case I can imagine at the moment is related to this I'd say...<br><br><a href=#c3279937926201253015 title="comment permalink">11/16/14, 3:16 PM</a><br><br>

Your paper money currencies may or may not be worthless where you are trying to go - but (historically) the likelihood that gold will be accepted (especially by military or logistics people who want to travel light) is relatively high. And this is where gold generally outshines the other precious metals. You will probably be dealing with some shady character in very far from optimal conditions. You don't want to spend half an hour explaining to some nervous border guard how palladium really is almost as good (and even more rare) as platinum is, even though the density is closer to silver and it also does not shine quite as bright. So for me gold really only starts to get useful when it increases my chances for long distance transportation. The distance may help to insulate you from some of the mentioned side effects of gold use. Next question is how much gold (and in what form)? Not more than I can keep reasonably safe physically (bite sized). At least one piece and ideally one or two much smaller pieces for each "insured" person. You offer the big, you raise with one small (claiming it is all you have) and swallowed the other small piece for later. Ideally you have a jewelers balance, the gold in shapes equivalent to local coinage of which you know the density. On the other hand I'd be afraid that such a degree of preparation may arouse suspicion and attention (very, very bad). In total I guesstimate somewhere around 2-3 times of a current (high cost end) ticket to your current far away destination of choice may have a chance to get you rolling. Not necessarily there, but hopefully you, or some of the less capable loved ones, out of the worst of places. I see very little good substitutes to gold in such a "run away from ragged step" situations. It is still very far from a safe bet but it gives you something to work with.<br><br>The other use would be as generic bribe, bounty, or ransom. Basically the typical business you'll be doing with the military guys coming your way. For anything else gold is the close to the end of the list for me. Other precious and practically useful metals not so much. But in my view you may as well cast them into useful tools, and have some books on how to use and reproduce those tools.<br><br><a href=#c1541902386249596930 title="comment permalink">11/16/14, 3:16 PM</a><br><br>

As a well off dentist in the South I am not looking forward to Niebelungen conditions but I have made no last redoubt preparations. The concept of "long" descent strikes me as generational not imminent. Thus peak everything produces a fitful plateau with gradual steps down rather than a smoking world trade center pile. Collapse in my mind is 1)no money out of the ATM for more than 2 weeks, 2)no electricity for more than a week (or Baghdad intermittent) 3) unruly crowds doing damage 4) Unemployment above 25%. I could come up with a few more conditions but I count on normalcy bias constantly returning us to close approximations of what we had for at least the next 30 years. That doesn't mean the middle class doesn't get savaged--it is and it will continue but we have a LOT of waste to squeeze out of the system first.<br> I hope we will be using money for a while. I have that. I don't have 40 acres and a mule. My great grandparents had a farm in Alex City and were self sufficient during the Depression but were POOR! That's why my grandad went to dental school. I would have to watch a You tube video to go from live chicken to dinner. <br> To get to my point, it is probably a simplification to say that money arises to support intermediation. It has certainly developed that way but I think it does solve the complexity of exchange problem rather better than barter, gift, or feudalism. Money as a unit of account markedly eases complex transactions and I cannot envisage our current world going to any other option for several decades. Black swans are always possible...<br> We dentists like gold and silver. Not just for their 'moneyness' but their utility. My own gold fixation would be in support of honest money. I don't like irresponsible leadership and we have had decades of that. In short, if you can emit whatever money you need to pay everybody off, if you have your own Aladdin's lamp of monetary largesse, the government has unlimited power. They define what a dollar is and what it will buy. Holding gold could be like a None of the Above vote option on the ballot. There are 8,500 T of gold in Ft. Knox but if every American had ONE one ounce gold coin that is 9,300 T of gold. China, India, and Russia encourage their citizens to hold gold. <br> Our underground economy may be larger than I think but it seems small now. What would you say, 20%? I couldn't even guess. It will get bigger though. <br> My thought is that gold and silver are merely an alternative currency (like Ukraine and Argentina use dollars), an insurance policy against a monetary system reset. That is coming in my opinion. If a majority of people had just a little gold and silver they would see who really has their interests at heart when leadership starts letting us know what the next monetary system will be.<br><br><a href=#c4829391054065498645 title="comment permalink">11/16/14, 4:02 PM</a><br><br>

Either the iWatch or the Google Glass are just more complex ways of accessing the same information as was already available for most of their consumer base. Thy just add another layer of intermediation between the consumer and that information. The same process has happened in Information Technology for companies, where having a big piece of software to manage all the business processes is not enough, we need to add more layers to visualize the data, such as Business Intelligence, reporting...<br> Whereas in the beginnings of IT, companies were implementing selfmade robust pieces of minimalist software for accounting on a millionth of the size of current software...<br> And the Google/Apple cult following is a good reminder that people place value according to irrational factors, even when they pretend very hard not to do just that. The seeking of a "safe haven" store of value in Gold is pretty much a manifestation of the same thing.<br> We live in strange times when having passions or special interests is seen as either a medical disorder or a marketable brand (cf Geek culture and all the business around it) whereas it is perfectly fit economically or socially to be "cult followers" of the Silicon Valley tech companies.<br> And the phrase "Cult" comes from a Reuters opinion piece, no less. I wonder when those big IT companies will start being called Leprechauns or Korrigans...<br><br><a href=#c150902038324845234 title="comment permalink">11/16/14, 10:13 PM</a><br><br>

I asked why *one* shouldn't do it if the situation goes totally FUBAR. For myself, if I become definitely convinced that the techno/scientific civilization is gone forever and don't see the even remote chance that something similar will rise in a reasonable future, I will probabily draw myself a warm bath and become acquainted with a razor blade.<br><br>@Redneck Girl.<br>Self-examination/philosophical speculation, IMO, goes only so far. Our species have reached the point in wich we have the instruments to examine/modify some deep levels of the Universe. But this capacity is strictly linked to our high level of technological infrastructure. Gone the infrastructure, gone the chance to gain more "operative" knowledge. And back to the idle speculations and indimonstrable superstitions of the so called "human sciences"... :-(<br><br>@Neo Tuxedo<br>Thanks: yes, this was what I meant. Again: I'm not a native english spaeker, so it is difficult for me to avoid a centain degree of involountary confusion in my "dissertations"... :-)<br><br>@onething<br>I'm an agnostic, but with a strong chip on my shoulder against the illogicity and hypocrisy of *all* the actual "mainstream" religions and their clerical structure. About the "here &amp; now": please SHOW me that there is something other "after/more". I repeat, SHOW, demonstate it in a tangible and RATIONAL (no sacred books/scrolls, please...) way that there ia a "soul" or some other form of autocoscience that survive the death of the body. Otherwise, whitout concrete and replicable proof, all are moot speculations. About the "pillaging" thing, again, as I wrote above, that is not necessarily what *I* plan do, but I don't see any reason, in a future wihtout hope, for which someboby should not do it. Last but not least, the pursuit of operative knowledge about how the universe function is, IMO, the only valid reason to live. The others (reproduction, etc.) are not *reasons*, but "mechanical" functions of our body/DNA.<br><br><br>@Jerrica<br>With all the due respect, the "man vs woman" thing you seems to insist on has NOTHING to do with the central point of my opinion. You seems fixated on it because I used the word "raping". I can care less if one is a man or a woman, black or white, fat o thin, etc, so your impression that I was speaking as a "male brute" par excellence is biased. You seems to fail to elaborate a little more the real central concept I esxressed in my original post. What I was speaking of are not "tech toys", but central means FOR ALL THE SPECIES to explore and understand the Universe. A future whitout them is NO future at all, and for sure NOT worth living in, and/or living for, IMO. <br><br>@ Crow Hill<br>"The plant may not have the same form of consciousness"<br>That exactly my point. Excuse my "arrogance", but I know something of the biological cycles of living beings, and I well know that after the death of our body our material shells will revert to its components and fuel the renewal of the natural cycles, etc.. But, until someone don't DEMONSTATE me that we have some form of "soul" that conserve the self-consciusness after death, the only objective that gives, IMO, meaning to individual life is the developement (even in a remote future) of the operative knowledge that technology &amp; science gives us, and that, in that future could give our species the means to AVOID the decadence of our bodies, the ones to augmentat our phisycal and mental capabilities and the intersellar space to expand into. Again, whitout this, all I see are, in Henry Thoreau words " (...) lives of quiet desperation and go(ing) to the grave with the song still in them."<br><br>Sorry if I lost some reply to my original comment, but I have limited time, and repling to all in English is very time-consuming...<br><br>Cheers<br>Ervino<br><br><a href=#c8937823835598021326 title="comment permalink">11/17/14, 3:27 AM</a><br><br>

He reflects the interests of the owners at whose will he serves. His subordinates carry out his orders or transmit them to minions below. This is the organisation. Its purpose, like that of all business firms large and small, is to make money by making things - to do well by doing good. It does best when it serves the public best. This is accomplished through the market, to which the corporation is wholly subordinate. What the consumer most wants, the market, in prices and sales, best rewards.<br><br>Since the corporation is wholly in the service of the consumer, it cannot be in the service of itself;being subject to the power of the public, it cannot have any significant power of its own. Generations of students have learned their economics from Paul A Samuelson, an early Nobel Laureate in economics, the pre-eminent teacher of his time...<br><br><br><br>This is the myth. But Professor Samuelson is a sensible as well as distinguished man. So, like other economists, he reverts to the reality when he leaves the classroom. He recognises that corporations greatly influence their markets - the prices they charge, the costs they pay - that in the real world, to use his words, they are "price-administering oligopolists . Thus they manage prices to which the not-so sovereign consumer responds. And the corporation also shapes the tastes of consumers to its products. No one can fail to be aware of this power. The advertising that does it dominates our vision and pre-empts our ears.<br><br>The modern corporation also exercises power in and by way of government. That too is agreed. Its payments to politicians and public officials are believed by no one except the recipients to be acts of philanthropy or affection. And less mentioned but more important is the naturally advantageous relationship between the modern corporation and the public bureaucracy...<br><br>The myth that holds that the great corporation is the puppet of the market, the powerless servant of the consumer, is, in fact, one of the devices by which its power is perpetuated. Colonialism, we saw, was possible only because the myth of higher moral purpose regularly concealed the reality of lower economic interest. Similarly here. Were it part of our everyday education and comment that the corporation is an instrument for the exercise of power, that it belongs to the process by which we are governed, there would then be debate on how that power is used and how it might be made subordinate to the public will and need. This debate is avoided by propagating the myth that the power does not exist. It is especially useful that the young be so instructed. By pretending ha power is not present, we greatly reduce the need to worry about it exercise.<br><br>But not completely, for we do not eliminate entirely the associated unease. We sense that our lives are shaped and that government is guided by the modern corporation. The myth disguises but it does not reassure..."<br><br>From The Age of Uncertainty by John Kenneth Galbraith 1977.<br><br>Thus are our masters unclothed! Many thanks for indulging me in providing the quote. Scary stuff and it concurs with your thoughts and observations.<br><br>It is an eloquent demolition job and it is a pleasure to be in the presence of the great thinkers! <br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: There is a new blog entry up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Every single drop</a> where you can see what the extinct (hope so) volcano would look like here if it had erupted last week.

Back in July 2011 the British Conservative middle-class D. Telegraph's imaginative Ambrose Evans Pritchard was seeing a <i>de facto</i> return to a world 'gold standard', and quoted the following: <i>Mr Bernanke himself was grilled by Congress this week on the role of gold. Why do people buy gold? "As protection against of what we call tail risks: really, really bad outcomes," he replied.</i> <br><br>But not just that it seems. On a train to London early 90s post-Soviet era there was a bunch of mid 30s to early 40s comfortable but alert looking persons - male and female - apparently from one of the newly emergent countries in what had been south USSR. (Their Big Man had a compartment near the front of the train.) Attired smart-casual their only outstanding characteristic was a very noticeable amount of heavy solid-gold bling.

Warlords might come looking for my great-great-great-great-grandkids' gold stashes in 200 years, but for now gold can serve some useful purposes. True, if hyperinflation hits a la Weimer 1923, even your gold would be of little value in the chaos. In the summer of 1923 families might sell their heirloom silver for a week's worth of bread, while $100 US dollars could buy a whole row of rental units in downtown Berlin.<br><br>But if those families had held onto their silver, it would once again be worth real money in 1924 after the monetary reset of Nov 1923 (and the transition to the Rentenmark, an asset-based currency, backed mostly by real estate). So there it is: in a few centuries gold/silver may indeed be a serious liability, but in the next few decades, it will likely be much more valuable than the stocks or bonds you'd otherwise buy with your spare money. <br><br>Whether gold's value is merely an agreed-upon fantasy or not, in whatever monetary system the authorities strap us with in the near future (next 2-4 decades), gold will be worth at least something.<br><br>Still, I don't disagree with JMG, either. Building real skills and relationships may be even more valuable, and leaves the world better off as well: your skills benefit other human beings, whereas your savings (if in the form of nonproductive assets like gold) mostly just benefits you.<br><br><a href=#c8079649238526909781 title="comment permalink">11/17/14, 8:25 AM</a><br><br>

Of course they try to justify it: they are being stewards of the land, they are permaculturists, they have worked hard for it, etc. But almost never do you see a landlord who gets paid at the same rate as his tenants for the work that he does for them. And almost never do you see a landlord who is willing to share his land and the stewardship of it without asking for more money than the external authorities demand. Not that there are not very nice landlords--I happen to have one. But he can't help being a parasite--he was raised with money and his training was not in anything that provides real value to anyone in the present economy.

And besides, violence is so old school. I mean, really, why beat people, why spill blood when you don't have to? No, seriously. <br><br>For the time being we have financial markets. Rigging these markets is one way to steal. How do they do it? In plain view mostly. Such as by means of artificially suppressed interest rates. <br><br>Wall Street does fabulously well by borrowing money for free. And, just so we're clear, this is the Fed deliberately taking money from your pocket and giving it to their banker friends. <br><br>And so, by their manipulations, the Fed forces people up the "risk curve". <br><br>You know what THAT means don't you? Sure you do, it means that, because deposits pay no interest, you go and invest money where Wall Street earns fat commissions and trading fees. Very good for Wall Street. And you get burned again.<br><br>Never mind, the "legal" way is the best way, don't you think? Legalized, non-violent theft has many advantages. Not least to the thief. The law PROTECTS the thief, but beyond that, thievery is re-defined to make it socially acceptable (for instance as "intermediation"), it is institutionalized, nobody gets beaten or stabbed, people are resigned to their losses, civil order is maintained. Many, many advantages.<br><br>Today's barons, that is the thieves, are very clever setting things up this way. And it could go on for some time. No bottom to people's willingness to suspend disbelief especially when it comes to money. <br><br>You seen a glimpse of what's to come. For now it's pretty mild stuff, they say "don't fight the Fed". Oh, don't be afraid, the folks at the Fed aren't going to send goons to beat your brains out but, through their machinations, they will empty your bank account. <br><br>No, just go along, just do what you're told. There's no choice, you see, all the professionals say so and if everyone says so it must be true. <br><br>So just what happens to your vanished retirement money? Well, it doesn't just "vanish". It never does. No, it just changes hands. Some banker has it and is living well. <br><br>And this is the way it should be. Theoreticians say so. There's studies proving it. Central bank intervention was necessary, markets are risky, so what can be done? <br><br>But if you invest in the "long run", you may regain what you lost. Makes sense doesn't it?<br><br><a href=#c5483120640500105157 title="comment permalink">11/17/14, 9:59 AM</a><br><br>

It seems that particular kind of activity is occurring in the Mt. Lassen area as well. For everyone else Lassen is the name of a small volcano south of Mt. Shasta. When I was a child my family would go up to Lassen Natl. Park occasionally for sledding after the snow had melted just about every where else. During its last eruption in 1914 it threw out a boulder the size of a small camp trailer, a few miles from the peak. It is over due for an eruption. Since Shasta's been dormant for a long time I wonder if an active Lassen might nudge Shasta into increased activity. We do live in interesting times!<br><br>For anyone who would like to play tourist I would recommend the inter-mountain area of California. Sadly there is no railroad through the area so a bicycle tour would be the best low carbon way of travel. It is one of the most starkly beautiful areas you can see in the continental United States. The lush hay fields of the Fall River Valley are a startling contrast to the delicate volcanic pastel hills at dawn. Not to mention the fantastic fly fishing in the icy mountain lakes or the Fall River!<br><br><br>Wadulisi<br><br><br><br><a href=#c1345385284748525707 title="comment permalink">11/17/14, 3:51 PM</a><br><br>

Many people trying to sell houses are being compelled to purchase what is called "indemnity insurance" to cover the risk that some necessary document (for instance, a proof that your window replacement has been carried out according to regulations) may not come to hand in a timely manner. The lawyers acting for the buyer's lender (so many layers!) seem to be driving this, but the indemnity insurance providers are often the same organisation as the mortgage lender. It seems to be coming a "must have" for the deal to do through. An lawyer who specialises in conveyancing talked about a conference he attended as a speaker, where he asked the assembled lawyers (a few hundred of them, I think) how many had actually handled a case where the insurance was claimed - not a single one raised their hand. So everyone is forced to pay out £200-300 for, effectively, nothing.<br><br>One interesting example of de-automation also comes to mind. When I was growing up in the UK most of the car washing seemed to be done by the car owners on a Sunday morning, the main alternative being a drive through machine at the local petrol station. All of this seems to have been abandoned, in favour of "hand car washes" staffed largely by migrants from Eastern Europe. I see American movies featuring 'team' car washes but, it seems to me, this is totally novel in the UK. Interestingly, it is hardly ever a source of comment.<br><br>Looking forward to the next post!<br><br><a href=#c6981314276815594166 title="comment permalink">11/18/14, 5:01 AM</a><br><br>

These were peoples who traded with Rome (some of them, anyway) and occasionally found refuge within their <i>limes</i>, but by and large they were living beyond the Roman frontier, and for whom the collapse of Roman power represented an opportunity, not the "end" of anything, since Roman infrastructure was not something their tribal economies depended on for everyday survival.<br><br>And one probably ought not to read too much into the role of treasure in the oral histories of these people, either. Cyclical raiding -- often the raiding of cattle -- but also the raiding of prestige goods and treasure, figured prominently in the tribal societies of Iron Age Europe. It doesn't have to do with the collapse of civilization. The raid-feast-pledge-raid cycle goes all the way back to the Bronze Age.<br><br><a href=#c8202261060535211653 title="comment permalink">11/18/14, 9:46 PM</a><br><br>
