<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week’s discussion of facts and values was not as much of a diversion from the main theme of the current sequence of posts here on
<i>The Archdruid Report</i> as it may have seemed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Every human society likes to think that its core cultural and intellectual projects, whatever those happen to be, are the be-all and end-all of human existence. As each society rounds out its trajectory through time with the normal process of decline and fall, in turn, its intellectuals face the dismaying experience of watching those projects fail, and betray the hopes so fondly confided to them. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s important not to underestimate the shattering force of this experience. The plays of Euripides offer cogent testimony of the despair felt by ancient Greek thinkers as their grand project of reducing the world to rational order dissolved in a chaos of competing ideologies and brutal warfare. Fast forward most of a millennium, and Augustine’s <i>The City of God</i> anatomized the comparable despair of Roman intellectuals at the failure of their dream of a civilized world at peace under the rule of law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Skip another millennium and a bit, and the collapse of the imagined unity of Christendom into a welter of contending sects and warring nationalities had a similar impact on cultural productions of all kinds as the Middle Ages gave way to the era of the Reformation. No doubt when people a millennium or so from now assess the legacies of the twenty-first century, they’ll have no trouble tracing a similar tone of despair in our arts and literature, driven by the failure of science and technology to live up to the messianic fantasies of perpetual progress that have been loaded onto them since Francis Bacon’s time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve already discussed, in previous essays here, some of the reasons why such projects so reliably fail. To begin with, of course, the grand designs of intellectuals in a mature society normally presuppose access to the kind and scale of resources that such a society supplies to its more privileged inmates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When the resource needs of an intellectual project can no longer be met, it doesn’t matter how useful it would be if it could be pursued further, much less how closely aligned it might happen to be to somebody’s notion of the meaning and purpose of human existence. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Furthermore, as a society begins its one-way trip down the steep and slippery chute labeled “Decline and Fall,” and its ability to find and distribute resources starts to falter, its priorities necessarily shift. Triage becomes the order of the day, and projects that might ordinarily get funding end up<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>out of luck so that more immediate needs can get as much of the available resource base as possible. A society’s core intellectual projects tend to face this fate a good deal sooner than other, more pragmatic concerns; when the barbarians are at the gates, one might say, funds that might otherwise be used to pay for schools of philosophy tend to get spent hiring soldiers instead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Modern science, the core intellectual project of the contemporary industrial world, and technological complexification, its core cultural project, are as subject to these same two vulnerabilities as were the corresponding projects of other civilizations. Yes, I’m aware that this is a controversial claim, but I’d argue that it follows necessarily from the nature of both projects. Scientific research, like most things in life, is subject to the law of diminishing returns; what this means in practice is that the more research has been done in any field, the greater an investment is needed on average to make the next round of discoveries. Consider the difference between the absurdly cheap hardware that was used in the late 19th century to detect the electron and the fantastically expensive facility that had to be built to detect the Higgs boson; that’s the sort of shift in the cost-benefit ratio of research that I have in mind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A civilization with ample resources and a thriving economy can afford to ignore the rising cost of research, and gamble that new discoveries will be valuable enough to cover the costs. A civilization facing resource shortages and economic contraction can’t. If the cost of new discoveries in particle physics continues to rise along the same curve that gave us the Higgs boson’s multibillion-Euro price tag, for example, the next round of experiments, or the one after that, could easily rise to the point that in an era of resource depletion, economic turmoil, and environmental payback, no consortium of nations on the planet will be able to spare the resources for the project. Even if the resources could theoretically be spared, furthermore, there will be many other projects begging for them, and it’s far from certain that another round of research into particle physics would be the best available option. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The project of technological complexification is even more vulnerable to the same effect. Though true believers in progress like to think of new technologies as replacements for older ones, it’s actually more common for new technologies to be layered over existing ones. Consider, as one example out of many, the US transportation grid, in which airlanes, freeways, railroads, local roads, and navigable waterways are all still in use, reflecting most of the history of transport on this continent from colonial times to the present. The more recent the transport mode, by and large, the more expensive it is to maintain and operate, and the exotic new transportation schemes floated in recent years are no exception to that rule. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now factor in economic contraction and resource shortages. The most complex and expensive parts of the technostructure tend also to be the most prestigious and politically influential, and so the logical strategy of a phased withdrawal from unaffordable complexity—for example, shutting down airports and using the proceeds to make good some of the impact of decades of malign neglect on the nation’s rail network—is rarely if ever a politically viable option. As contraction accelerates, the available resources come to be distributed by way of a political free-for-all in which rational strategies for the future play no significant role. In such a setting, will new technological projects be able to get the kind of ample funding they’ve gotten in the past? Let’s be charitable and simply say that this isn’t likely. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus the end of the age of fossil-fueled extravagance means the coming of a period in which science and technology will have a very hard row to hoe, with each existing or proposed project having to compete for a slice of a shrinking pie of resources against many other equally urgent needs. That in itself would be a huge challenge. What makes it much worse is that many scientists, technologists, and their supporters in the lay community are currently behaving in ways that all but guarantee that when the resources are divided up, science and technology will draw the short sticks. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It has to be remembered that science and technology are social enterprises. They don’t happen by themselves in some sort of abstract space insulated from the grubby realities of human collective life. Laboratories, institutes, and university departments are social constructs, funded and supported by the wider society. That funding and support doesn’t happen by accident; it exists because the wider society believes that the labors of scientists and engineers will further its own collective goals and projects. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Historically speaking, it’s only in exceptional circumstances that something like scientific research gets as large a cut of a society’s total budget as they do today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>As recently as a century ago, the sciences received only a tiny fraction of the support they currently get; a modest number of university positions with limited resources provided most of what institutional backing the sciences got, and technological progress was largely a matter of individual inventors pursuing projects on their own nickel in their off hours—consider the Wright brothers, who carried out the research that led to the first successful airplane in between waiting on customers in their bicycle shop, and without benefit of research grants. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The transformation of scientific research and technological progress from the part-time activity of an enthusiastic fringe culture to its present role as a massively funded institutional process took place over the course of the twentieth century. Plenty of things drove that transformation, but among the critical factors were the successful efforts of scientists, engineers, and the patrons and publicists of science and technology to make a case for science and technology as forces for good in society, producing benefits that would someday be extended to all. In the boomtimes that followed the Second World War, it was arguably easier to make that case than it had ever been before, but it took a great deal of work—not merely propaganda, but actual changes in the way that scientists and engineers interacted with the public and met their concerns—to overcome the public wariness toward science and technology that made the mad scientist such a stock figure in the popular media of the time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
These days, the economic largesse that made it possible for the latest products of industry to reach most American households is increasingly a fading memory, and that’s made life a good deal more difficult for those who argue for science and technology as forces for good. Still, there’s another factor, which is the increasing failure of institutional science and technology to make that case in any way that matters. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here’s a homely example. I have a friend who suffered from severe asthma. She was on four different asthma medications, each accompanied by its own bevy of nasty side effects, which more or less kept the asthma under control without curing it. After many years of this, she happened to learn that another health problem she had was associated with a dietary allergy, cut the offending food out of her diet, and was startled and delighted to find that her asthma cleared up as well. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
After a year with no asthma symptoms, she went to her physician, who expressed surprise that she hadn’t had to come in for asthma treatment in the meantime. She explained what had happened. The doctor admitted that the role of that allergy as a cause of severe asthma was well known. When she asked the doctor why she hadn’t been told this, so she could make an informed decision, the only response she got was, and I quote, “We prefer to medicate for that condition.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

Since today’s mainstream medical industry makes so much of its scientific basis, the growing public unease with medicine splashes over onto science in general. For that matter, whenever some technology seems to be harming people, it’s a safe bet that somebody in a lab coat with a prestigious title will appear on the media insisting that everything’s all right; some of the time, the person in the lab coat is right, but it’s happened often enough that everything was <i>not</i> all right that the trust once reposed in scientific experts is getting noticeably threadbare these days. </div>

I’ve discussed in previous posts here the way that <a href=../../2014/06/the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html>the vagaries of scientific opinion concerning climate change</a> have been erased from our collective memory by one side in the current climate debate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s probably necessary for me to reiterate here that I find the arguments for disastrous anthropogenic climate change far stronger than the arguments against it, and have discussed the likely consequences of our civilization’s maltreatment of the atmosphere repeatedly on this blog and in my books; the fact remains that in my teen years, in the 1970s and 1980s, scientific opinion was still sharply divided on the subject of future climates, and a significant number of experts believed that the descent into a new ice age was likely. </div>

The authors were by no means nonentities. Nigel Calder was a highly respected science writer and media personality. E.C. Pielou is still one of the most respected Canadian ecologists, and the book of hers shown here, <i>After the Ice Age</i>, is a brilliant ecological study that deserves close attention from anyone interested in how ecosystems respond to sudden climatic warming. Windsor Chorlton, the author of
<i>Ice Ages</i>, occupied a less exalted station in the food chain of science writers, but all the volumes in the <i>Planet Earth</i>
series were written in consultation with acknowledged experts and summarized the state of the art in the earth sciences at the time of publication. </div>

My younger readers may not remember Robert Silverbergand Poul Anderson; those who do will know that both of them were serious SF writers who paid close attention to the scientific thought of their time, and wrote about futures defined by an ice age at the time when this was still a legitimate scientific extrapolation</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<a href=../../img/andersonwinter-0a304c-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=200 src=../../img/andersonwinter-0a304c-119x200-g95.jpg srcset="../../img/andersonwinter-0a304c-238x400-g92.jpg 2x" width=119></a>These books exist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I still own copies of most of them, and any of my readers who takes the time to find one will discover, in each nonfiction volume, a thoughtfully developed argument suggesting that the earth would soon descend into a new ice age, and in each of the novels, a lively story set in a future shaped by the new ice age in question. Those arguments turned out to be wrong, no question; they were made by qualified experts, at a time </div>
when the evidence concerning climate change was a good deal more equivocal than it’s become since that time, and the more complete evidence that was gathered later settled the matter; but the arguments and the books existed, many people alive today know that they existed, and when scientists associated with climate activism insist that they didn’t, the result is a body blow to public trust in science. <br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s far from the only example of the same kind. Many of my readers will remember the days when all cholesterol was bad and polyunsaturated fats were good for you. Most of my readers will recall drugs that were introduced to the market with loud assurances of safety and efficacy, and then withdrawn in a hurry when those assurances turned out to be dead wrong. Those readers who are old enough may even remember when continental drift was being denounced as the last word in pseudoscience, a bit of history that a number of science writers these days claim never happened. Support for science depends on trust in scientists, and that’s become increasingly hard to maintain at a time when it’s unpleasantly easy to point to straightforward falsifications of the kind just outlined. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On top of all this, there’s the impact of the atheist movement on public debates concerning science. I hasten to say that I know quite a few atheists, and the great majority of them are decent, compassionate people who have no trouble accepting the fact that their beliefs aren’t shared by everyone around them. Unfortunately, the atheists who have managed to seize the public limelight too rarely merit description in those terms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most of my readers will be wearily familiar with the sneering bullies who so often claim to speak for atheism these days; I can promise you that as the head of a small religious organization in a minority faith, I get to hear from them far too often for my taste. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, there’s a certain wry amusement in the way that the resulting disputes are playing out in contemporary culture. Even diehard atheists have begun to notice that whenever Richard Dawkins opens his mouth, a dozen people decide to give religion a second chance. Still, the dubious behavior of the “angry atheist” crowd affects the subject of this post at least as powerfully as it does the field of popular religion. A great many of today’s atheists claim the support of scientific materialism for their beliefs, and no small number of the most prominent figures in the atheist movement hold down day jobs as scientists or science educators. In the popular mind, as a result, these people, their beliefs, and their behavior are quite generally conflated with science as a whole. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Theimplications of all these factors are best explored by way of a simple thought experiment. Let’s say, dear reader, that you’re an ordinary American citizen. Over the last month, you’ve heard one scientific expert insist that the latest fashionable heart drug is safe and effective, while three of your drinking buddies have told you in detail about the ghastly side effects it gave them. You’ve heard another scientific expert denounce acupuncture as crackpot pseudoscience, while your Uncle Henry, who messed up his back in Iraq, got more relief from three visits to an acupuncturist than he got from six years of conventional treatment. You’ve heard still another scientific expert claim yet again that no qualified scientist ever said back in the 1970s that the world was headed for a new ice age, and you read the same books I did when you were in high school and know that the expert is either misinformed or lying. Finally, you’ve been on the receiving end of yet another diatribe by yet another atheist of the sneering-bully type mentioned earlier, who vilified your personal religious beliefs in terms that would probably count as hate speech in most other contexts, and used an assortment of claims about science to justify his views and excuse his behavior. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Given all this, will you vote for a candidate who says that you have to accept a cut in your standard of living in order to keep research laboratories and university science departments fully funded? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No, I didn’t think so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In miniature, that’s the crisis faced by science as we move into the endgame of industrial civilization, just as comparable crises challenged Greek philosophy, Roman jurisprudence, and medieval theology in the endgames of their own societies. When a society assigns one of its core intellectual or cultural projects to a community of specialists, those specialists need to think, hard, about the way that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>their words and actions will come across to those outside that community. That’s important enough when the society is still in a phase of expansion; when it tips over its historic peak and begins the long road down, it becomes an absolute necessity—but it’s a necessity that, very often, the specialists in question never get around to recognizing until it’s far too late. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Thus it’s unlikely that science as a living tradition will be able to survive in its current institutional framework as the Long Descent picks up speed around us. It’s by no means certain that it will survive at all. The abstract conviction that science is humanity’s best hope for the future, even if it were more broadly held than it is, offers little protection against the consequences of popular revulsion driven by the corruptions, falsifications, and abusive behaviors sketched out above. What Oswald Spengler called the Second Religiosity, the resurgence of religion in the declining years of a culture, could have taken many forms in the historical trajectory of industrial society; at this point I think it’s all too likely to contain a very large dollop of hostility toward science and complex technology. How the scientific method and the core scientific discoveries of the last few centuries might be preserved in the face of that hostility will be discussed in a future post. </div>

The trouble today of course in in saying the word 'science' people hardly understand what you mean anymore. or to put it another way, 'science' men/women in white lab coats, holding test tubes, rationality, progress reason, overthrow of religion!!!, instead of repeating experiments and testing hypothesis. You have already discussed all this widely on your blog of course. Personally I have enjoyed science at many points in my life and still now. If only the anti religion and progress stuff could be discarded! It would make life so much easier who just want to enjoy the wonders of science without subscribing to the religion of scientism. fortunately your blog and books such as the science delusion by Rupert Sheldrake help a lot.<br><br>Its possible too I reckon science might survive the coming purge because yes although there is much public hostility to science, anti science fundamentalist religion has just as bad a reputation. I remember for example reading a autobiography of a British comedian called David Mitchell. Mitchell is self identified as quite a firm rationalist yet in his book he states quite firmly he'd have quite happily gone along with the local religion "if I'd grown up in an unquestioning religious community as people have for most history. A bit of ritual and ceremony would have been nice, and to not have to face all the difficult questions of the world on my own..." he then goes on to attack angry atheism, although stating he gets just as cross with 'god bothers' but no crosser.<br><br>Anyway just some of my musings. cheers for the post!<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c3249625700079811621 title="comment permalink">11/26/14, 7:42 PM</a><br><br>

I had never heard of Fishbein and did some research. I was both shocked and appalled, but not really all that surprised. He was a thoroughly nasty piece of work. It wasn’t just that he spearheaded the campaign to destroy the “lodge trade” in the medical profession and to discredit “alternative” medicine.

The first organic soil methods - finding and breeding bacteria and fungi that grow and improve the soil. Actually that's the only one I mean to bring up but it can be generalized beyond organic gardening, onto soil remediation, food processing and health improvement. People are increasingly aware of the good effects of floral balance in the digestive system, and the adverse effects of antibiotics (save us from decline and fall? No. Worth preserving? Sure. It falls under the general rubric of balance in nature, which I think is a good mnemonic.) Another is using fungi to clean up soils. Another example I saw was some chefs making cheese from rice that were fermented using a particular combination of bacterial strains. <br><br>The scientific method is very applicable here. Instead of viewing all fungus and bacteria as the enemy, we can use controlled experiments etc etc to learn to cultivate them..<br><br>I wonder about the future "village bacteriologist" - she will help you find the bacteria you need.

The Incan cities that impress us all were built without the use of writing.

The latest movie Interstellar will be a prominent example in the future on the twilight days of our civilisation when we still tried to bargain ourselves out of our responsibilities.

Ross Nichols, one of the most influential Druid writers of the 20th century, used to say that ritual was poetry in the world of acts.

I expect cargo cult ideologies to play a huge role in the years immediately ahead. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, exactly -- I have several denunciations of continental drift in my book collection, and all of them rely on the fallacy of "if the cause isn't known, the effect didn't happen." It's frankly eerie watching rationalists deny their own past, e.g., by insisting that the rejection of continental drift didn't happen. "Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia..." <br><br>Kaitain, good for you.

In the meantime, keep writing! That's one art that can always find a home, no matter what the phase of the historical cycle. <br><br>Bob, that level of control already exists in most industrial countries; viewpoints that threaten the existing order are marginalized into fringe venues such as the internet, where they have no significant effect on society as a whole. The processes I'm discussing are those that happen when societies can no longer obtain the resources to allow the elites to keep pursuing business as usual. <br><br>Nathan, that's a good point! Still, I think the collapse of respect for scientific authority has its own driving forces, alongside those driving the collapse of respect for authority in general. More on the latter in an upcoming post. <br><br>RPC, good! Though I tend to think of it as a "Bonfire of the Inanities." <br><br>Bob, a classic story. I hear such things all the time. I wonder how big of a kickback your doctor was getting from the methtrexate salesman. <br><br>Chris, the thing is, all that is beside the point. Scientists are doing quite a few useful things now, as well as a lot of useless or actively harmful things; none of it changes the fact that science as an institutional reality is facing a shattering loss of cultural legitimacy, in which the useful, the useless, and the harmful may all be caught up together and chucked. It's that latter process I want to discuss.<br><br>YJV, no argument there.

Therefore, greater organization of resources and workers is required to make further progress in most cases. And institutional science is subject to all the foibles and failings of any human organization. As resource availability declines, it will necessarily be the case that institutional science (and institutional anything) will decline.<br><br>I do think that sustaining scientific practice at any level into the indefinite future depends not so much on the cultural legitimacy of institutional science but rather on the fundamental religious and philosophical outlook of whatever society exists in the future. Historically speaking, most religious and philosophical systems have not been favorable to the practice of science. Despite the naysayings of the militant atheists, I think a strong case can be made that medieval Christianity laid the necessary foundation for the development of modern science. Whether that foundation continues into the future remains to be seen.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c360299443002198152 title="comment permalink">11/26/14, 11:55 PM</a><br><br>

I love math and science, but in school itself has been painful for me. I hated school pretty much from the first moment - I remember wanting to be anywhere else in elementary school, of course in middle school, and then in high school (I eventually dropped out, though since I have gotten a degree).<br><br>If people are hoping that science and learning will be kept alive by schools, I want to remind them of how much school sucks. <br><br>Part of the hostility to science stems from people unable to live science as a method of understanding. They are told that evolution happens in a classroom, not on a hike or at a zoo or botanical park where the actual living things exist (or even looking at fossils, which are actually easy enough to get in a classroom). They are told that the earth is old and the continents move in a classroom, not looking at the rock formations that prove these things. Often when they ARE given direct experience, it is in high school labs that never seem to work quite right, partnered with people they don't neccessarily like and working under a strict time constraint. They never make the leap from classroom to real world. It holds no reality for them.<br><br>To say that Saturn exists, has rings, and has moons, is trivial. To look at Saturn and see the rings and moons really is a different experience. It's also very easy - yet how many people have actually seen Saturn through a telescope? Probably less than half the people in the educated world, much less the world as a whole. Yet that seemingly trivial act can be the difference between meaningful science and the anti-science attitude that is very prevalent today.<br><br>As for medicine... The science behind the best medicine is very clear. But much of medicine operates on very weak science. Vaccines are very well understood, and work; mental illness is mostly very poorly understood, and drugs for it are hit and miss at best. Doctors act like there is no difference. No wonder people become skeptical.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c397609862604679970 title="comment permalink">11/26/14, 11:55 PM</a><br><br>

I just suspect that the next two thousand years or so will have some significant differences to the last two thousand years or so - and almost all your examples come in that time frame.<br>2. Completely agree about the collapse of institutional science, for the reason you give. The one thing that I suspect will enable scientific method to continue is if it can be placed within a more explicitly religious context, and therefore carried forward by the monks of the future. That's why I spent so long talking about the holiness of science, and where it fits in a broader understanding, in my book.

This does not mean that common Joes do not have opinions on science and those socially awkward or inapproachable scientists, or that their opinions do not correlate with the popular perception displays. <br><br>Public funding for most of proper science is declining because of little known policy changes for some two decades already, as there is much less of genuine drive for stiring scientific curiosity of the wide public. But science will remain a valuable toy for the elites for quite a little more - so much that funding of new particle accelerators, space missions will have higher priority than feeding the public. Many other social institutions will turn to hubris before Science will defintely follow as well.

Science is much better if you see it as just one of a number of dishes set on the table before you.

Vast swaths of America are full of people who despise the idea of evolution and who have always had great hostility towards science. Faith in the infallible word of The Bible rules such places, and it will likely rule much of post-decline America.

Sometimes a portion of a landscape needs to be transformed or a structure needs to be built in order to carry out observations. Similarly, sometimes systematic observations need to be made prior to a process of manipulation or experimentation.<br><br>Manipulative science is that which involves tools used to manipulate objects (including other tools), transform landscapes, build structures, harvest foodstuffs and other natural resources, extract non-organic substances or fossil fuels from the earth, etc.<br><br>Observational science involves studying the world as it exists prior to being manipulated or transformed by people. It also might involve studying people.<br><br>Observational science includes tools but those tools are used to enhance the process of observation rather than to change the natural world in some way.

Someone familiar with the philosophy of science might be able to formulate these ideas more clearly.<br><br>Some of the sciences are clearly both observational and manipulative, such as physics, chemistry and genetics. <br><br>Some observational sciences require considerable manipulation, and some manipulative sciences rely greatly on various observational sciences.<br><br>It's easy to understand the basic division into observation and manipulation when you realize that our relationship with the world involves sensing it on the one hand (related to observational science), and physically interacting with it on the other (related to manipulative science).<br><br>Anyway, the attitude taken by a declining civilization towards the manipulative sciences is likely to be somewhat different than the attitude towards the observational sciences.<br><br>The manipulative sciences are more "practical" and many are likely to be retained as long as the financial and technological resources are available.<br><br>The observational sciences on the other hand are going to fall more quickly by the wayside.<br><br>We might expect astronomy to be curtailed severely.

And I think that one of the problems is not the science part (for example, methotrexate is a generic drug, no kickbacks, and has decades of successful use). It's the ritual aspect of the "practice of medicine" being ignored that really rubs people.<br><br>After reading JMG for a few years, I realized recently that a visit to the physician is supposed to be a ritual. Here's how a visit to the doctor went in the "good old days":<br><br>You made an appointment/set an auspicious date for your ritual. You go to the office/temple/church and wait in the waiting room/antechamber (it's quiet, with other supplicants, and sparely decorated). A nurse/adept/deacon takes you to a room filled with medical equipment/ritual objects, inquires your reason for coming/verifies your preparedness for the ritual, and tells you to wait for the doctor/preist. There is a period of silent introspection. The doctor/priest enters the room wearing his white coat/vestments. You tell him your medical problems/make your complete confession. The doctor/priest hands you a johnny/supplicants robe, and leaves you to change clothing. You have another period of introspection and preparation. The doctor/priest returns and uses the stethoscope etc/holy objects to perform the examination/rite of healing. He leaves you again to change into your street clothes/prepare to leave the holy space. You are escorted to the consolation room/inner sanctum and seated across a desk fro the doctor/priest. The room is decorated with symbols of his authority/diplomas, body-part models/esoteric objects, and gifts from thankful prior supplicants. He gives you diagnosis, medical advice and a prescription/your penance and instructions on correct living. He then pronounces your imminent healing/tells you you are now right with the world. You then exit the inner sanctum the way you came in, returning from the more sacred to less sacred spaces.<br><br>I haven't had that sort of experience with a physician in years. Most doctors visits are more like going to a Catholic mass and the priest saying "you know, I'm busy today, so I pre-transubstantiated the host for you guys. Just pick it up in the back along with a gift certificate for my coffee shop in the rectory."<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c7857094285179232116 title="comment permalink">11/27/14, 6:51 AM</a><br><br>

I have been sporadically going to HackLab here in Toronto. The day before yesterday I made my first acquaintance with HackLab's new premisses, and found my high <i>a priori</i> expectations exceeded. There is now a photographic darkroom, and a "fabric hacking" corner; at last there is a metals-capable workshop with soundproofing, and fume hood, and enough room for drill press and other bulky tools; at last there is a biggish classroom; at last there is comfortable provision for the collection of technical books; and since the landlord allows some degree of access to the roof, it might in future prove possible to build on the existing ham-radio interest of several HackLab people. <br><br>Community fundraising for the HackLab move, to Queen Street West out of the cramped old premisses on Baldwin Street in Kensington Market, was in aggregate dollar terms something like two or three times more successful than had been anticipated. <br><br>It occurs to me that one thing someone might some day try is a tabulation of major cities, showing how many makerspaces exist in each. This would help one rank cities in Jane Jacobs terms, i.e, in terms of their propensity for cultivating innovation - or as I for my part would like to phrase it, in terms of their propensity for cultivating applied science. Some raw data can be had from <a href=http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_ALL_hackerspaces rel=nofollow>http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_ALL_hackerspaces</a>. (But sorry, haven't got the time myself to do the tabulation: if I embark on it, I have to take time away from studies in vector-calculus-purged-of-Leibniz-notation, etc.) It would be interesting to have makerspace counts comparing Tallinn against Stockholm, Toronto against the Boston conurbation, Stockholm against the Boston conurbation, and so on. Will the Boston conurbation, with M.I.T. and Hah-vud near the left bank of the Charles River, perhaps prove in such a tabulation to be a world leader in makerspace life? <br><br>Although our own HackLab here in the Toronto area is rooted in applied science, I did over the last few months pick up some nice tips for pure maths, from one of the members. We managed to talk at a whiteboard for a few good sessions, he in essence throwing out ideas for things-to-construct (relating to, e.g., the natural basis for the dual of a vector space with given basis) and I, as a dim person nearly 40 years his senior, playing the diligent note-scribbling pupil. Some hackerspaces somewhere in the world might likewise provide a venue for discussing the high problems of theoretical physics (legitimacy of the Bohr interpretation of quantum mechanics, etc). <br><br><br>Hastily,<br><br><br>Tom<br><br>Toomas dot Karmo at gmail dot com<br><br><a href=http://www.metascientia.com/ rel=nofollow>http://www.metascientia.com/</a> <br><br>VA3KMZ <br><br>PS: Toronto Hacklab has a Web presence at <a href=https://hacklab.to/ rel=nofollow>https://hacklab.to/</a>.

It's strange how people want to say that if you are critical of science you are critical of all aspects of science and suddenly you are being armed with some imaginary superstitious belief.<br><br>Personally I've found it useful to treat science as another potential way of learning about the truth, but not the truth itself. I don't know if there is a more reliable way but I use personal experience and how it lines up with what people are saying, regardless of their basic beliefs (those I think tend to fall under value judgments as you were describing last week and are for a different kind of consideration). <br><br>I had a similar story to your asthma example with seasonal allergies. I have had them terribly for about 30 years now, until last year when I started to really worry about how I was going to be able to deal with this if I couldn't just medicate the symptoms away every day, so I started looking into things that might contribute to it (I've done this somewhat in the past but never dug very deeply because I didn't have initial success), came across people who mentioned gluten can contribute to it, and I tried cutting it out. So far it's been a year without a pill and where I used to experience 7 or 8 months of attacks, I've only had maybe 5 or 6 days of them this year - definitely tolerable!<br><br>I feel I owe this very much to you btw and so I've wanted to thank you for this for a while now. I've been somewhat systematically trying to solve various things in my life in the collapse now approach (using the resources of the internet etc to solve what will be my problems in the future). I'm far from a Green Wizard, but I've really got a lot out of what I have done so far and certainly this is my greatest personal success after having been plagued by this issue for as long as I've lived here.<br><br>Back to my point though, I've been amazed at how people will tell me flat out that science has proved that gluten intolerance is not real and so I am somehow vaguely lumped into a creationist anti-vaccination camp, as if I should just blindly accept some study over my own experience which fully varified something that was coming from an "unreputable" source (ie. average people who discovered something through their own experiments).<br><br>Just because science doesn't know the absolute answer to everything doesn't make it useless either. I hope, like you, that the scientific method survives into the future.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c6651621076370209938 title="comment permalink">11/27/14, 8:01 AM</a><br><br>

If the fresh-person launching on a science career were to have a one semester course on the philosophy of science, they might be surprised that science is built more or less on a belief system called materialism. Materialism is a belief system because it is based on a number of precepts which have to be accepted without proof because there is no proof. The core belief of materialism is that all natural phenomena can be explained in terms of material forces alone. A somewhat weaker version of this precept adopted by some scientists is that science must restrict itself to phenomena that can be explained in terms of material forces alone. The weak materialist would acknowledge that there are some phenomena which cannot be explained by resorting to material causes. Yes, you may have had a premonition of some disaster but that is not a suitable subject for science (the weak materialist stance) vs. The fact that your premonition was confirmed is a matter of coincidence. Your premonition had no causal relationship with the future event. (the strong materialist stance)<br>In any case the professional atheists' main form of argumentation is that of asserting their unprovable premises over and over again, saying that such and such cannot be because it contradicts the basic premises of materialism. That is, rather than accepting counter-examples as proof of the weakness of their position, they try to shout down counter examples. <br>Another philosophical point little examined by professional scientists is the role of theory. Whatever scientific theory is currently in vogue is generally presented as fact to the general public. But theory building is not a process of observing and describing nature as it is but rather a game of coming up with intellectual models that can explain the phenomenal world in terms of some underlying clockwork mechanism. The proposed clockwork is the scientific theory. Everyone that has seen enough science knows that theories are overturned on a regular basis, or as someone pointed out, they die when all their adherents are dead. Of course there are phenomena that don't have any good theories to explain them. Such phenomena are either ignored or a weak theory is accepted as a place-holder until a better one can be found. Meanwhile all theories, no matter how weak must be defended against religious fundamentalist challenges because any weakness will be used against the prestige of science. This is of course a ridiculous situation because theories are provisional and they are set up as legitimate challengers against received truth handed down to the faithful by a deity. And so it goes. An unfair fight because the fundamentalists come up with the rules of engagement and the materialists engage in defending undefendable positions hoping to win by trading on the prestige of their profession.<br>But none of this has anything to do with the impending decline of science. A simple lack of funding is sufficient to make science decline. I have proposed the impending decline and defenders of the status quo have responded that people used to do science on smaller budgets. But it seems that all the small-budget fundamental science has already been done. Still, plenty of citizen science left to be done, like keeping track of the weather and studying trends and tracking where food can be found and rediscovering what makes plants grow and animals prosper.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c6116524106630463868 title="comment permalink">11/27/14, 8:47 AM</a><br><br>

Reading your weekly posts has allowed me to realize that it's been a long time since I sincerely believed in the bright future promised by science and tech. This realization was also crystalized for me in a discussion/argument that I had with my sister who is a PhD plant pathologist and whose husband with the same academic credentials has received a comfortable living researching pesticides and herbicides for some of the mega ag corps. We were discussing neonics (systemic pesticides) and colony collapse disorder (CCD) in honey bees. She kept using phrases such as "there is not enough evidence," "data is insufficient," "multifactorial cause," "further inquiry is needed," and such and finally in exasperation with me sneered, "Well, you must believe in the precautionary principle." <br>Upon much reflection since that conversation, I think it's another nail in the coffin of science and tech that the precautionary principle has been cast aside in favor of the profit motive and support of the corporate bottom line. "Advancements" and the latest new discoveries have been foisted on the world with little thought and research into long term or larger systemic effects on planetary life and the environment we inhabit.

As life continues along its now fairly obvious trajectory of decline I begin to realize what a huge shift of consciousness will be required to adjust to the new age with even a modicum of ---. Until very recently I did not realize the degree to which I always felt that I was somehow exempt from the process even though all the evidence including the defunding of several projects that forced me to move across the country a couple times gave evidence to the contrary. It occurs to me that even though I do view my work at the periphery of academia (in extending academic knowledge out into the community) as valuable to the communities in which I live this work is in fact still quite expensive and a kind of intermediation since I do not create much of the knowledge I share nor am I a practitioner in the field. So, of course, ultimately as funds for everything dry up so will mine and I am very unlikely to be exempt from the process that is slowly remaking the higher education system into something very different from the environment in which I received my training. I doubt that triage will be directed at saving the system at all more likely it will focus on saving money and the jobs of the highest paid amongst us, system be dammed. The administrators sell education in the same way that advertisers sell iPads and salad shooters and anything that can support itself of their job is fine nothing else is given much consideration at all regardless of merit. God save us all it is going to be a very different world indeed. <br><br>The diminishing returns on investment in research are also very clear in the social sciences, where I work, and much of the thought that goes into the actual practice of what we preach is based on late 19th or early 20th century research or, alternately, on conceptions of human nature that are scientifically questionable and largely disproven within academic circles. Common principles of U.S. law are based on all sorts of dubious insights into human nature that have no scientific basis whatsoever but have proven convenient or are none the less intuitive and thus acceptable when assigning liability or blame.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c7687748154159851613 title="comment permalink">11/27/14, 10:18 AM</a><br><br>

It occurred to me that much of Oswalds values are a function of him being an intellectual in Germany during the long drama which resulted in the rise of the Nazi movement; the feeling of powerlessness of the instincts for truth before the instincts of blood must have been thick in the air for sensitive types of his day.

One is commercial motive. If a research outcome leads to a fat market, it may be touted as magic from a science lab. If it points up the ill effects of marketing something with a big cash flow, it's apt to be termed "junk science." Next to sex, soothing assurances from some actor in a lab coat still seems to be a good come on for advertising. And the pervasiveness of money has led to corrupting the submission and review processes of some noted research journals.<br><br>A second is the price tag of a research program, which you note. To keep a lab going, reports need to show that more research must be done. This tends to keep programs going down blind alleys when other routes might be more enlightening. <br><br>Third, in some fields the whole publish-or-perish dictum needs to go. It stimulates too much trivial research work. I recognize the value of experiments for validating other researcher's findings, but not to demonstrate the 147th twist on old concepts. <br><br>Last, the scientific method works when all involved share motives, not just the method. This extends beyond just hidden financial interest. Researchers rarely discuss their deeply held beliefs that guide their epistemological thinking, and their concepts of value for the outcomes of research.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c6292927292690800789 title="comment permalink">11/27/14, 1:58 PM</a><br><br>

If some religious people consider that latter statement as hate speech, that is their problem. My point, though, is that almost agreeing with Richard Dawkins on God, in my humble view, is in no way contradictory to your predictions about the future of science (not as a method, but its place in contemporary culture), about the religion of progress as described in your blogs, about the long descent of the industrial civilization, and indeed, not even in conflict with the philosophy in your beautiful book Mystery Teachings from the Living Earth.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c4559617260386125848 title="comment permalink">11/27/14, 2:24 PM</a><br><br>

More on this in a future post!<br><br>Tortoise, actually, most literate religions have been fairly cool with the practice of science; Islam, the current bete noir of the scientific-rationalist scene, played a huge role in fostering astronomy, physics, and agronomy in the post-Roman world, for example, and Taoism had an even larger role in the long and distinguished history of Chinese science. The challenge in the present case is that the behavior of many scientists these days is doing much to encourage antiscience attitudes among religious people of all stripes. <br><br>Adam, excellent. A future series of posts here will be talking about the end of the education industry in the US and what we might do to replace it, and the points you've made are highly relevant. <br><br>Sam, questions about astrology certainly ought to go to my other blog! As for your second question, no argument there; I hope you're working to foster such arrangements in your faith. I'm certainly working on it in mine. <br><br>Ed, on the off chance I understand what you've written -- were you possibly stoned while writing it? You left out a lot of letters -- the rediscovery of the potentials of the human body and mind is indeed one of the major themes that will have to be explored going onward from the mess we're in. I'll do a post on that at some point. <br><br>Das Monde, at a time when the elites are in the process of committing collective suicide, popular opinion becomes a very powerful force.<br><br>Marcello, I'll be discussing down the road a bit the reasons why I think the scientific method is worth preserving. Mind you, you're doubtless right about the likely role of scientists as scapegoats, and so there's another good reason to extract the method from its institutional and ideological context. <br><br>Les, thank you! I should have mentioned Langley's flop. More generally, the Aerodrome makes a good example of the problems with what Thomas Kuhn called "normal science," or more precisely with its beloved son, normal engineering. <br><br>Jason, you're a lucky man -- or maybe it's just that you don't live in the US, where we have the world's most expensive and least effective health care. <br><br>Gloucon, the religious landscape here in the US is much more complex than such stereotypes suggest. There are some remarkable shifts happening, which probably deserve a post of their own down the road a bit. <br><br>Hypnos, when scientists try to talk science with the general public, it's frankly embarrassing how often they avoid discussing the lively internal debates in whatever field is under discussion, and present the current consensus as though it's established fact. To my mind, that's the real lesson of the imminent ice age of the 1970s -- there's a fatal mismatch between the realities of science, which involve constant debate and revision, and the public face too many scientists like to take when talking to people other than their colleagues.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c8151789971674867540 title="comment permalink">11/27/14, 3:44 PM</a><br><br>

I'll place an order for one!<br><br>Shawn, glad to hear that the sunday assemblies are catching on. As for your left-right analysis, that's interesting -- I've seen more anti-vaccination types on the right than on the left. Most people I know on the left who distrust modern medicine are less fixated on vaccines and more into pursuing their own medical care via herbs, homeopathy, etc. <br><br>Marc, that's a useful division, and in my experience, at least, it also marks the border between those sciences that are fairly cool about, say, druids, and those that are militantly hostile to anything other than hardcore scientific atheism. Thus there are more options for preserving observational sciences...<br><br>Don, I'm going on the diatribes I field regularly from climate change activists. If you're not fielding the same sort of thing, be glad. <br><br>M, in the US, something like half the population has no access to mainstream medical care already, because they don't have the money to pay for it. Thus we're already there. <br><br>Will, I think that's very possible, though your wandering engineer may have to be careful about scientist-hunting fanatics who insist that anybody who knows how to use a crescent wrench must be dabbling in petrochemicals and other forms of evil lore!<br><br>Karim, that's an excellent example -- the research being done at this point may not be very useful, but you're quite right that the skills needed to fit people with eyeglasses that improve their vision are extremely practical, and capable of being done on a low-tech basis. As things become more challenging, you might consider taking in an apprentice or two and teaching them how to shape lenses and fit frames!<br><br>Donalfagan, thanks for that! An excellent example of one way that science is cutting its own throat. <br><br>Gabriela, as I pointed out in earlier posts in this sequence, the power of the current elites depends wholly on its ability to maintain the loyalty and obedience of those further down the social ladder. As things become more difficult, more and more of the people lower down, who do the actual work of maintaining the elite in their positions of power, have strong incentives to put their own interests ahead of those of the elite. Historically, that's how elites end up dangling from lampposts, and I see many good reasons to think the same thing will happen this time around, too. <br><br>Roz, that depends on who decides to preserve things, and what they decide to preserve.

Many sciences, particularly in environmental science, have lost enough funding that they've been mostly relegated to hobbyists. I remember when I was studying ecology, entomology, marine biology, etc. in college seeing that entire array of topics being treated like the red headed stepchild of the sciences and using facilities that hadn't changed all that much since the 60s. These days if you're interested in one of those topics you'll find yourself in the world of enthusiastic amateurs. <br><br>There's also a pretty wide variety in archetypes with the sciences. There's the arrogant prophets of progress, the mad scientists, the greedy corporate research team, and the angry atheist on one side but the Jacques Cousteau, Jane Goodall, Louis Agassiz archetype of the field researcher still holds strong. It's fallen out of the actual science world, true, but that's made it more the realm of regular people. I could see the image of the sterilized metal laboratory and the white lab coat become a symbol of the worst of what science can do, yes, but I have a hard time seeing the same happen to the field researcher in khaki's with a binocular around the neck, or the zoologist with a compound microscope and a few fish tanks in a dusty old garage.<br><br>And then there's the very basic grade school level scientific knowledge that everyone is at least aware of. I don't expect us to forget what the earth looks like from space, or how tiny it is in relation to the rest of the cosmos, or lose our knowledge of DNA, or the geologic history of the earth... The functions of the organs in the body, the way viruses and bacteria work, gravity and the laws of motion, thermodynamics, the structure of the atom, etc... . I expect we'll hold onto things like that as tightly as people in the Middle Ages held to Aristotle.<br><br>I see rather than a full on revolt, a wide spread of trends: active, productive practice in sciences that are useful in a collapsing world and are practiced widely by hobbyists, a fossilization of some basic 3rd grade versions of scientific consensus, a revival and maibstream acceptance of some fringe sciences, an appropriation of terminology from<br>more specialized concepts to fit ideas closer to human experience but have very little to to with the original context (such as the popular "quantum mysticism" you see so often) and a revolt against the sciences most linked to the high technology of today (especially medicine, engineering, and agriculture).<br><br>Which sciences will be affected by which trend depends on what the next religiosity entails. Christian fundamentalism uses, simplifies, and rejects different sciences than Islam, which would make different use of modern science than Buddhism, Polytheism and so on. I do expect in any case that it'll depend on the cost and the usefulness of a science which does give a lot of the hobby/amateur sciences really good odds.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c5403739913324497822 title="comment permalink">11/27/14, 5:25 PM</a><br><br>

In my experience, that's the thing that most people resent. <br><br>Andy, I did several history of science classes while getting my BA in history of ideas, and came to exactly the same realization. It's a useful counter to the torrent of propaganda that stands in for serious history of science these days. <br><br>Patricia, glad to hear it.

The industrial world had that in 1800; it doesn't have anything like it today. <br><br>Cathy, thank you for this! Le Guin has been a source of inspiration for me since I was a child -- yes, I can tell you exactly where I was and what I was doing when I stumbled across the Earthsea Trilogy. My first SF novel, <i>The Fires of Shalsha</i>, was partly inspired by reflections on her <i>The Dispossessed</i>.

How do I communicate on national travel? I don't; one of the pleasures of travel is that I don't have to be at anybody's beck and call. A Chinese poem in translation comes to mind: <br><br>"I asked the boy beneath the pines.<br>He said, 'The master's gone alone<br>Herb-picking somewhere on the mount,<br>Cloud-hidden, whereabouts unknown." <br><br>Bob, that's probably the case.

If only 12% of fundamental experiments can be replicated, we're in even worse trouble than I thought. I'll read up on this, and may well do a post on it.

So many of my friends trust anything their doctors say (and believe any pop-culture news article about medical "discoveries") with a level of reverence that borders on the religious. When I tell them "that advice didn't work for me" they tend to brand me as a mad heretic and skip straight to ad-hominem attacks rather than consider the possibility that different people with different bodies might get different results from trying a similar method. <br><br>I'm quite convinced that all the health advice we have been given for 50+ years regarding dietary fats, sugars and starches, cholesterol, heart disease, and even exercise ("calories in = calories out") is going to be turned upon its head within the next five to eight years or so. Take 1/10th of a second to Google and you will already find a profusion of articles saying that dietary fats are being exonerated from the demonic status they were relegated to for the past 50 years. Then as Jason H. points out, the science about cholesterol is a lot more nuanced than we've been told. So the next obvious question is, if dietary fat doesn't cause heart disease, what does? Well, something that doctors have been telling us is safe and healthy to eat for the past 50 years. Follow this chain to its conclusion and most of the health advice we've been given for 50 years unravels like a cheap sweater.<br><br>These medical developments are a big part of the notes I have for my book about "Scientific Arrogance" which I mentioned on your other blog.<br><br>You asked Justin about data on the replicability of core experiments in other branches of science. Well the example that leapt to mind was another medical one. Check out this TED talk, and apparently this guy has written a fairly respected book on the subject:<br><br><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ben_goldacre_what_doctors_don_t_know_about_the_drugs_they_prescribe?language=en" rel=nofollow>What Doctors Don't Know About the Drugs They Prescribe</a><br><br>I am totally in agreement with you that the main conduit that will link scientific blindness and arrogance, to rejection of science wholesale by the common population, is the medical industry. No doubt we have achieved a bunch of high-tech miracle cures for horrific yet relatively rare diseases. Meanwhile, an awful lot of people are finding out that they can take better day-to-day care of themselves with traditional remedies and some careful thought, than the exotic, expensive meds that increasingly expensive doctors prescribe for common conditions. The cost of health "care" in the US has been skyrocketing far faster than inflation for decades, yet its day-to-day utility becomes less and less.

Yeah, we're avoiding the medications like the plague for exactly those reasons and focusing rather on diet.<br><br>I may have mentioned this before, but when I was younger, people used to literally drop dead. Seriously, it used to happen to elderly relatives of mine. Like they'd be having a cup of tea or reading the paper and then they'd suddenly keel over, it wasn’t uncommon at all.<br><br>From my perspective, the jury is out on whether it is such a good thing to revive elderly members of the population from terminal illnesses like pneumonia - which used to be quite fatal for the very young and the very old. I get medicating the young to bring them back to health - that makes perfect sense.<br><br>However, I have now known too many people who revive their elderly relatives only to have them recover and spend their final year or two sitting in a nursing home on anti-depression medication along with a host of other medications and requiring 24 / 7 care. From my observations, the individuals can hardly be described as pursuing an active and healthy existence. And they never leave those places, except in a coffin.<br><br>As usual, the easy road, is actually the hard road dressed up in drag.<br><br>And before anyone asks, I've actually been faced with the decision about whether to remove life support for a terminally ill person who had no chance of recovery.<br><br>PS: The quince trees put on a good show of flowers this year, but they're still too young to set fruit. Shame really.<br><br>On the other hand the strawberries have gone feral this year and there are now more strawberries than I know what to do with and they should keep producing until mid-January.<br><br>The parrots have been into the Asian pear trees, which is a bit of a nuisance...<br><br>PPS: Brisbane which is the capital of Queensland was hit by a super cell yesterday: <a href=http://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/brisbane-storm-supercell-damage-bill-could-reach-150-million-campbell-newman-says/191639 rel=nofollow>Brisbane storm super cell</a>.

Russians have a device called Vitafon which is using soundwaves for stimulating acupuncture points. Applicator is about two inches in diameter and user does not have to visit professional acupuncturist. The big obstacle for acupuncture (even in the China in the past) is that needle has to be used at precise point and sticking needle can cause numerous side effects. With big applicator everybody can stimulate appropriate points safely by himself. Depending on health problem soundwaves of different frequency is used. Soundwaves are generated using some kind of amplifier that is powered by electricity. I guess that for the future it would be useful to develop Vitafon that will not depend on electricity. Some kind of mechanical spring loaded device should be developed for sound wave generation, something like old turntables and mechanical clocks.<br><br>And yes, I also was a victim of modern medicine. When gastroenterologist prescribed me drug called Cisap, incredible heart arrhythmias started. Good thing is that I immediately understood what was causing it and discontinued the therapy. Couple of years later I red about high toxicity of Cisap in the newspapers. No need to say that I also stopped going to the gastroenterologist.

People have to get their information from "authorities," and it was hard to find an authoritative Japanese voice that wasn't part of the racket. As a diabetic, he can get away with using insulin, as long as he keeps quiet about it. The "track" is a standard high-carb, low-calorie diet and medicines that force insulin secretion, wearing out the pancreas, after which it is dialysis, amputations and an early grave. (This kind of thing is happening everywhere, but the Japanese are particularly good sheep. The dialysis centers are full of people in their 40s and 50s.)<br>A dear friend of ours was less fortunate, and this relates back poignantly to your article on hoarding two weeks ago. We will REALLY miss him. He was one of the few folks we could talk to openly about collapse. His response to this awareness, though, was moving to a sparsely populated rural area, hoarding treasures and making lots of enemies. We warned him--everybody warned him. Sure enough, he was found dead at an unmanned train station, and the locks are missing from his door. They didn't even wait for the rioting to start!<br>With the police not interested in investigating this, we wonder how far Japan actually is on the way to its collapse. Here they all hide their misery and pretend everything is jolly fine. On the surface, it looks identical to the peak bubble year of 1989.<br>Another pitfall of collapse-awareness, which I believe you have warned about in the past, is getting desperate and teaming up with people with great-sounding solutions.

So much so that <i>Manusmriti</i>, the now much reviled ancient Hindu law book, sets strict standards for the priestly class.<br><br>A priest shall necessarily beg for his daily food and other necessities.<br>If he finds that he has ended up with more food, clothing or any other possession than he needs for the day, he must give the excess away immediately. This and other similar injunctions severely limit the material comforts a priest can enjoy. Violators are chastised by warnings of stints in hell (with special places and very specific tortures), nasty lives in next births and banishment from society.<br><br>There is a Hindu coming-of-age ceremony for boys named <i>Upanayana</i>. The day after the rituals are done, the boy must go to the doors of each of their neighbors everyday, and literally beg for food with plate in hand. The woman of the house shall give food on the plate with utmost respect, and he must eat only that food on that day. This will be continued for a minimum of seven days, with the boy going to a different neighbors' each day. This practice is continued till today, though with diminished importance. Elders say that this is a remnant of the old practice of begging for subsistence. I did go begging, and I will say that even when it is purely symbolic, the experience is humbling.<br><br>For me, this illustrates the relationship between the creative minority and the general majority. The minority is duty bound to supply the intellectual wealth for the majority's benefit, in return for the alms offered to them.<br><br>This could be a useful item in the cultural toolkit of future sustainable societies.<br><br>BTW, I noticed someone had remarked a couple of weeks back about how in India, gold was worshiped as <i>Lakshmi</i>, the goddess of wealth. You know what else is also worshiped as <i>Lakshmi</i>?<br><br>Cow dung.<br><br>Strange as it may seem, it makes perfect sense. Cow dung manure is one of the best and cheapest organic manure in India for centuries.

The heat source in the Earth's core is said to be decaying radioactive elements. Hydrocarbons tend to get buried on continental crust, where a certain amount of pressure facilitates their conversion to fossil fuels. Most of the crust getting recycled back into the mantle (after a span of about 200 million years)is oceanic crust. There seem to be big differences between oceanic and continental crust, with the latter being thick, but less dense, and the former being thin and heavy, mostly basaltic (the material of the mantle). There is little or no exchange of materials between the core and mantle.<br>Whatever continental crustal materials collect on the ocean floor tend to get carried down a ways under the continents and then belched back up along with steam via Mt. Shasta-type volcanoes.<br>On the continents, I've read two competing schools of thought. One is that they are growing in size, having started out some 4 or so billion years ago (I may be off) as an island, now divided between Western Australia and South Africa, around which stromatolites (the oldest known fossils) quickly formed. If you look at the geology of California, new strips of land kept getting added over the eons.<br>The other view holds that the continents stayed about the same size overall, but went bashing around, shattering and recombining in various ways.<br>I could go on and on. This just fascinates the living daylights out of me. Gosh this was a fun age to live in! But absolutely get out and see these things with your own eyes if you can pester an expert into showing you around. The good news is the Earth will still be here and continue these geological processes no matter how badly we screw it up.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c621835739211999861 title="comment permalink">11/28/14, 7:43 AM</a><br><br>

But for this minority, there were very good reasons to predict global cooling. By that time scientists were able to reconstruct past climates based primarily on ice cores and also to describe the main drivers of climate, the orbital influences (Milankovich cycles). There are other influences on the climate including the atmospheric component. Over the past two million years or so the earth has been in a glacial period known as the Pleistocene. Warm interglacials, lasting about 10,000 years alternate with glacial periods lasting about 100,000 years. It was also known that extraordinary events, such as massive volcanic activity that occurred about 230 million years ago and a large comet that hit about 65 million years ago are capable of overriding the orbital influences. We are now about 10,000 years into a warm interglacial which peaked 5000-6000 years ago. We should be approaching the end of the warm interglacial. Even in the 1970s and 1980s the majority of climate scientists believed that the atmospheric component due to the burning of fossil fuels, was overriding the orbital influences, even though there was still a sizable minority that believed that the earth was cooling. Today only about 3% of climate scientists believe we are headed into a cooling period. We will find out who was right.<br><br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c2168667207854795116 title="comment permalink">11/28/14, 9:02 AM</a><br><br>

But what I'm seeing more markedly is a schism in the sciences, with many of the sciences that are challenging the status quo getting rejected as pseudoscience. (As is happening with ecology and many of the systems sciences and Organic agriculture). I could see many of the sciences that are being embraced by various counter-culture movements picking up the ideals and belief systems of those counter cultures and getting rejected by the mainstream science world, getting combined with all manner of what's currently considered pseudoscience alongside it, and then becoming the intellectual foundation of the next civilization on down the line. There's enough science that is falling through the cracks right now to have a chance of surviving in another form. But we'll see. Even with a total rejection of science, I just can't imagine things like the basic shape of the earth, solar system, and galaxy getting rejected after we've spent a half a century looking at the earth from space.

After an MS diagnosis a couple of years ago, I quickly learned –from other regular folk--that high doses of Vitamin D were thought to be as effective or better than the disease-modifying drugs (which are all immune system suppressors), at reducing the number and severity of relapses. Between D and a diet with no gluten and more vegetables, I have yet to experience any relapse since diagnosis. My neurologist, paid handsomely by Novartis to promote their answer to MS, first said I was crazy, and now says nothing except “call me if things change.”<br><br>An old friend, a PhD microbiologist now working for a marketing company writing drug instructions for doctors (like the one mentioned earlier: “side effects-DEATH”), frequently accuses me of failing to accord scientists their proper due—to which I invariably respond with something about scientists being so easily bought and paid for that it’s hard to trust any of them. This hits uncomfortably close, I think, so we end our conversation, vowing to never go there again, but inevitably, a few months later, we arrive once again in the same unproductive place (usually with the help of too much wine). Sadly (but good for my friend, I guess), her sort of “science”—that is, working for drug companies—will survive a bit longer during Decline than science dependent on public funding. (Though I suspect the intermediary--the marketing company--for whom she works at present will not.)<br><br>Her arguments in support of authoritative science have everything to do with the depth and breadth of a scientist’s training and education, and the value she places on peer reviewed, double blinded etc whatever they are called studies, to the apparent exclusion of all else (given her personal investment in this system I am not surprised). In her world, anecdotal evidence is no evidence at all. <br><br>While she is right to not necessarily bet the farm on anecdotal evidence without further ado, she dismisses, I think, the coolest things about science—the importance of curiosity, of considering a question, running down some theories, and being open to alternative explanations. I think humans with some of these qualities will survive into the future; for this reason I don’t mourn the loss of science—in some form or another it will endure. For now, however, I will continue to equate what passes for modern science with all the other “industrials” I have come to despise—farming, education, medicine, etc. And we will continue to lubricate our friendship with wine. <br><br>Kathleen<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c2267584912577856468 title="comment permalink">11/28/14, 1:15 PM</a><br><br>

(Starve the body, and it assumes that there's a famine on and hoards every spare calorie it can get in the form of body fat.) Thanks for the link! I've heard references to studies that apparently show that some of the core experiments in physics can't be replicated, either, but I've yet to see the data; if you or anyone knows of a source for that, I'd be grateful. <br><br>Matt, many thanks for the link! I understand that a brown bear has now taken up residence in the Chernobyl exclusion zone; I hope it finds a mate. <br><br>Cherokee, I've been involved in the same choice, and I've also worked in nursing homes and seen what happens when medical technology is used to force someone back to more-or-less life when their body wanted to die. It's not a pretty sight. <br><br>Ivan, you can get the same effect by pressing on the points with a fingertip, and rubbing either light and fast (to stimulate the meridian) or slow and deep (to calm it). That's what's miscalled <br>"acupressure" -- and it works very well in practice. <br><br>Patricia, good gods. I'm sorry to hear that the Japanese medical system is descending to the same depths as ours. <br><br>Kutamun, it's an interesting data point that military writings from the late Roman Empire are full of what, for the time, was exotic military technology, an assortment of V-weapons meant to turn the tide against the barbarians. You'll notice that by and large, it didn't work. I suspect the current mania for high-tech military vaporware will be just as effective in its turn. <br><br>Doug, thanks for the links! What this implies, of course, is that modern pharmaceutical medicine is crackpot pseudoscience, and we ought to go back to tried and true health care modalities such as homeopathy and acupuncture. ;-)<br><br>Ramaraj, I think it would be a great thing to make Ivy League college students beg door to door on their summer breaks, so your traditions definitely have something going for them. As for cow dung, makes perfect sense to me -- I've argued elsewhere that compost heaps ought to be regarded as altars, on which offerings are made to the Earth Mother. <br><br>Bill, that's certainly a possibility, but it also happens tolerably often that useful mental tools of that sort can be kept going as living traditions straight through the dark age -- consider classical logic, which remained in common use in dark age Europe among those few who were literate, and spread from them to society as a whole once conditions got better. <br><br>Eric, oil isn't the only commodity that's dropping like a rock right now, so I doubt we've hit bottom yet. The global economy seems to be souring in general, and as the impact of that downturn hits the financial sector, I'd expect fireworks. <br><br>Stunned, as I noted, there was no consensus about climate in the 1970s, and concern about anthropogenic global warming goes all the way back to the late 19th century. One of my favorite science fiction authors, Edgar Pangborn, set three novels and a lot of short stories in a future world ravaged by global warming, and this was back in the 1960s. It's the claim that no qualified experts had predicted an imminent ice age that I wanted to challenge. <br><br>W.H., granted. I read extensively in climate literature in the late 1970s, and thought the arguments in favor of an imminent ice age were fairly convincing. That they turned out to be wrong -- well, that's the way real science works, of course. <br><br>John, that might indeed be a good start. It might be necessary to ditch the word "science" altogether for a while.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c7970970079723577480 title="comment permalink">11/28/14, 1:33 PM</a><br><br>

By Crow and Sheep's standards, which are arguably no less idiotic than many of those used by, e.g., the World Bank, high culture is secure. <br><br>Eric, that's an excellent point. I wonder how easy it might be to pick up the sciences that are being thrown under the bus right now, patch up their cuts and bruises, hand them bottles of beer, and offer them Druid robes in place of their lab coats?

For what it's worth, my guess is that silent, invisible, untraceable efforts like yours will be the ones that matter, because they can't be coopted by the flacks of the existing order. <br><br>Kathleen, there are people with whom I avoid the same sort of conversation, just as I avoid talking about Darwin with certain of the Christians I know. It's really quite similar, all things considered. <br><br>Varun, yes, I've seen the same thing. One thing I've noticed, though, is that most of the people who are preaching the cult of progress most devoutly aren't actually in a position to have to deal with its interactions with the real world. Elon Musk, for example, doesn't get down into the belly of a machine with a crescent wrench to fix things; he works on the level of airy abstractions, where it's easy to ignore mere physical reality. Thus my guess is that when the religion of progress cracks, the result will have more in common with a cargo cult than with any sort of mad-scientist effort to wreck the world.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c1748100427426180706 title="comment permalink">11/28/14, 1:49 PM</a><br><br>

I see biological life as highest technology. Biosphere as highest culture, civilization as regression from perfect balance of nature. Evolution as only way to progress through control of mind body complex in balance with nature. When sci-tech is gone due to resource loss we will be back to very basic external tech and forced to go inward as say tibetan monks, zen masters, yogis but for masses if we are not to be reduced to primitive hunter gatherer past. If sci-tech must at best be frozen in time at waterwheel level, etc. and culture will slowly return to oral village traditions and simple religions past prime then synchretism by cultural decline for new ideology for next culture must mix all global religions plus science and prove workable. Skepticism from science ideology will demand proof of results from religion. Science itself is at a dead end,too expensive to test further particles. The last frontier is mind body control. Yogis who do tricks with heart, breathing stopping. Tai chi masters controlling energy into sticks they fight with. Millions learn these disciplines now around world but would go from sport level to energy level during next spiritual awakening phase. Some few would acheive higher mastery showing rigorous proof of 'miraculous' behaviour. This would inspire more to hard work, acheive spiritual-physical evolution for a low percentage of population. This would be everyday practical usage, not esoteric hidden knowledge. Danger is of course individual development. Most not ready but if society demands end to materialism as death nears through ecological catastrophe then radical survival solution is a patent need. Necessity mother of invention. Agriculture wasnecessary due to overpopulation. Logically humanity will have to take radical steps to survive. Pure primitivism as end game when resoures are gone is unlikely due to zero tech esoteric sciences and human desperation picking up where yogis of old left off to control self and environment. Bacteria survive in all environments through extreme adaptation. Why not humans if necessary. Toynbee talks of a challenge and a breaking point which is too big a challenge. One wonders how far we can push the envelope to avoid extinction in a hostile ecology we produced through civilization.

Might be a worthwhile project."<br><br>Considering that many of the sciences that are falling through the cracks just now are foundational to Druidry I'd say it's already happening. I haven't gotten around to AODA yet (I'm saving that for after I've finished my Ovate work with OBOD) but my experience has been that to get the most out of the studies you have to pull out the microscope and butterfly net, get outside, get dirty and do some field work.<br><br>I think a lot of the process is almost happening on its own though... Think about the way propaganda from industrial agriculture is chasing so many scientists out to the fringe where they're brushing up against holistic healers and gaia worshippers. Or the way the dominance of Dawkinsian "Selfish Gene" evolutionary theory is doing the same thing to proponents of ecosystem and population-centered evolution. Or the way big name scientists coming out in favor of industrial agriculture and spouting the evils of organic food has chased other scientists to the fringe. I could see the same thing happening to climate science and peak oil. If mainstream science chases the scientists who are actually trying to do something about our predicament away from their place in the dominant minority, well... they might find a place in the internal proletariat. They'd mingle with some strange ideas, but I'm not sure that'd be a bad thing.<br><br>The one scientific achievement I don't want to see lost is the discovery of evolution and the understanding of our earth's history we've gained through the fossil record. If we can pass it on, it would be one of the greatest gifts our civilization has to offer, and if it's lost it's lost forever. Those fossils have been dug up and studied and can't be discovered again... which means without them the history of this planet can never again be known. If they could be preserved across enough cycles of civilization, a longitudinal study of evolution stretched out over the course of the lifespan of our species (which, according to most projections is also the amount of time it'll take for earth's biodiversity to recover) would tell us volumes. It'd be a shame if the concept itself and the accumulated knowledge of the past to inform it was lost (or if the foundation of the next religiosity was something like today's evangelicalism and it was actively suppressed.) It's a lot sadder to imagine a world where nobody knows about dinosaurs or the amazing process that transformed them into today's birds and crocodiles than to imagine a world where we never returned to the moon which... well... just not as interesting to me... but then... I suppose that's just my values showing isn't it?<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c2919621000631415354 title="comment permalink">11/28/14, 2:49 PM</a><br><br>

Judging from the fact that it is thoroughly rude to bring up actual macro reasons why increasingly more folks won't have nice things <a href=http://thefederalist.com/2014/11/26/everything-you-need-to-know-about-winning-a-thanksgiving-argument/ rel=nofollow>at a Thanksgiving dinner</a>, the levels of reality are deftly in control.

Not the least, nowadays the universities control the public communication with PR departments. They either do the communication, or advice the scientists how to water down the message "expertly". Surely, a scientist could be proactive and (depending on the field) he won't be stopped probably. But this is not the 60s when public appearance was not demanding. (Being Neil deGrasse Tyson is a full time job, and even he ain't Attenborough or Sagan.) Public talk is just not a high priority even for extrovert scientists. Besides, scientists, lecturers have increasingly lower status <a href=http://www.salon.com/2014/09/21/professors_on_food_stamps_the_shocking_true_story_of_academia_in_2014/ rel=nofollow>even within universities</a>. The administration is bloating at the expense of positions, libraries - yet scientists have to waste more time on paperwork. So the science decline is definitely led by non-scientific dynamics. In particular, appreciation of science depends hugely on public education - do we need to say much here? Catabolic tear of education and science is under way for 2-3 decades already.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c9113136312051178036 title="comment permalink">11/28/14, 4:34 PM</a><br><br>

Doctors cannot prescribe it, but all patients use it. It is available over the counter, but cannot be bought nor sold. The drug is medically proven to have a positive effect on every disorder of the mind or body in every clinical trial, but it has not been studied and is not understood. It is a measuring stick to gauge the effectiveness of all other drugs in scientific study, often outperforming them in experiments, but there is no theoretical model to explain its effectiveness as the foundation for its use as an objective measure. It has no known side effects, has proven effective for all diseases and disorders and usually comes in the form of a little white pill.<br><br>Question: What is the name of this drug?<br><br>The answer, obviously, is placebo. And in clinical terms, yes, a placebo is just another drug. Any drug in definitional terms is a physical substance that affects a change in biology. We do not define drugs on the effect or mechanism of that changed intended, that is the description.<br><br>To put a point on it, one big problem medical science has is the way it sets up its experiments by using biological samples disconnected from the living organism, but the blindspot is as big as the placebo, there is a belief that all physical disease and symptoms are purely affected in the realm of physical reality.<br><br>cheers,<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c2467821895001702676 title="comment permalink">11/29/14, 8:51 AM</a><br><br>

The fact of the matter is that we were well on our way into the next ice age starting @ 5,000 years ago when agriculture and cattle raising stopped it (see: W. Ruddiman's Plows, Plagues and Petroleum). Principal cause of earth's climate system was discovered through application of the scientific method by Milutin Milankovitch in solving his "cosmic problem". This he did while incarcerated at the outbreak of WWI; after all what else do dictators do with Serbian intellectuals? <br>Decades of silence followed Milankovitch's 1938 publication of his "Solar insolation" theory caused by variations in earth's orbit around the Sun. Mostly due to rejection by the scientific community for "lack of proof" just as A. Wegener's continental drift theory. Then came the eureka moment experienced by paleontologist cum nuclear physicist C. Emiliani (Emiliani C ,1957,Temperature and age analysis of deepsea cores. Science 125:383–385) as a graduate student under W.F. Libby and "father of the atomic bomb" Enrico Fermi at U. Chicago on the application of Oxygen isotopes in extracting past ocean temperatures from fossil plankton shells. Emiliani had reproduced Milankovitch's calculated climate curve through oxygen isotope analysis of an 800,000-year long deep-sea core sample. He was also keenly aware of the now aging U. of Belgrade professor's work when he was studying paleontology and then working in Florence, also, not coincidently, home of Enrico Fermi's alma mater. Milankovitch's theory is now well accepted and applied in long-term climate studies, both past and future, except by the IPCC. <br>The effects of AGW, on the other hand, did not become sufficiently pervasive or discernable until the 1970's and then only publicized and presented to our congress in 1988 by James Hansen. The rest of this ugly story is an ever accelerating path of destruction as mankind's destiny is to drown in his own feces, whether he be religious or atheist. <br>In a nutshell we "paleoclimatologist scientists" definitely expected to go into another ice age before the 1980's, but now have a lot more facts as to where we are headed. <br>Enjoy it while you can!

The public dreams of the lone Einstein discovering new theories about how the universe works. The reality is a massive collaborative effort in which the contributions of any individual are pretty small and the whole enterprise usually ends up filling in some gaps in our previous understanding without making fundamental changes in scientific theories. JMG identifies many of the main problems with the sociology of science: diminishing returns, degeneration into increasingly less useful complexity, and bad marketing. I see the main problem in the fact that we continue to market scientific research as a path to new discoveries equivalent to Newton or Maxwell or Watson and Crick. But thoughtful scientists know good and well that there are not gaps in our understanding of the fundamental components of our corner of the galaxy that are big enough to allow another discovery like classical mechanics or electromagnetism or basic molecular biology. We are up against problems of complexity. We need to understand human nutrition, neuroscience, climate systems and ecosystems. And these systems seem not to yield to simple comprehensive understanding. When this fact gets out to the public, there will be a massive restructuring of how science is marketed and funded. Maybe decline will set in first. But even without the decline of industrial civilization, the image of the 20th century scientist is already well into its descent onto the ash heap of history.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c2863718259508807639 title="comment permalink">11/29/14, 6:45 PM</a><br><br>

Each such entity builds up a set of disciples, practices, and theories (pretty much in that order) that all sustain one another in a positive feedback loop. This loop expands the scope of a paradigm until it encounters anomalies, and something akin to blisters and calluses form at its surface; new paradigms tend to arise from the resulting inflammation, and sometimes outperform their progenitors. Quantum mechanics and general relativity are interesting in that each regards the other as an anomaly, and neither is half as efficient as Newtonian mechanics in generating predictions about most directly-observable phenomena, which has problematized the existence of this type of entity for physicists in general (none can fully deny the existence of paradigms they aren't devoted to).<br><br>I should also mention that computer scientists learn something about planes of existence, and even those scientists who call think "computer science" is a misnomer and such people practice a craft instead, are forced to acknowledge that the tools so crafted are not material in nature, and that much practical science depends on the power of said tools.<br><br>Also, this doesn't mesh wiht my own experience. Empirically, atheism seems a lot more prevalent among the people I socialize with than among the people I've encountered in my professional life. More personally, anthropology was far more of a challenge to my faith than geology or physics, because the latter make claims about a more-distinct set of phenomena.<br><br>Mr. Greer,<br>As someone who is struggling to start a career in science, I'm eager to read your next post, and hoping you include some practical advice for people in circumstances similar to my own. I'm not sure I'm representative, but at least I'm a sample of the readers who might benefit most directly from your perspective:<br><br>I thankfully have only taken out the sort of student loans that aren't heritable, so if I ultimately fail to pay them off they die with me, but they're still of the sort that bankruptcy can touch. I think of my PhD in materials science as an asset I've invested a lot in, but I'm aware that the sunk cost fallacy can give the illusion of value, and that massive personal debt poured into questionable investments is often a late-emerging feature of Ponzi schemes.<br> <br>I struggle to balance immediate benefits against long-term viability (which mercifully mostly aligns with my conscience) as I look for work; ultimately, I'm inclined to look for an institution that has the best chance of surviving for the length of my career, out of those that specifically hire people with my level of education.<br><br>I should also say that a sense of being trapped is common to a lot of people I talk to. I think that if my work were to offered some genuine liberation, I'd be a lot more confident in finding support for it (and yes, I also feel ready to face the opposition it would draw).<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c2899432180950764381 title="comment permalink">11/29/14, 7:57 PM</a><br><br>

We have learned very recently a lot more about the origins (and potentially better prevention) of much of the chronic age-related disease that afflicts mostly ‘western’ industrial nations, and increasingly so-called ‘emerging’ societies elsewhere. In particular, most of the common cancers affecting us from middle-age, and similarly much arterial disease, are heavily related to lifestyle. Much cancer (cells with altered DNA) would not express as disease until a lot later in life or not at all.<br><br>It is worth noting that cancer rates vary dramatically worldwide and that many of our common cancers are not common where people live differently. This concerns major differences in food patterns as well as the usual suspects, tobacco and alcohol. The ‘Western’ diet is bad news for both arterial disease (and related morbidities such as Type 2 diabetes and raised blood pressure), and for cancers, particularly colorectal, prostate and breast. <br><br>The good news is that traditional – ‘traditional’ means a good while ago in our Western countries - low-cost patterns of local food appear a great deal safer (whole food mostly plant-based). <br><br>Study of dietary patterns and their associations with disease have been particularly difficult for science, but it is valuable to know that there is no evidence that fruit and vegetables are bad for us! (This I guess is almost unique: in almost every collection of dietary studies there is usually at least one that shows a contrary indication.)<br><br>‘Natural Hygiene’ I believe it is called in the USA, ‘Nature Cure’ in UK, got a lot of this right. Cure of course is not as effective as prevention over decades. I am not a fan of ‘health farms’ but Pritikin have a good website and a look at their published results as well as their recipes and approach, is not a bad place to start. I personally think highly of the science of Christian Roberts studying Pritikin clients, and have all his publications. <br><br>Such an approach is not for everyone and there will always be ‘outliers’ even among adoptees, but it is not a bad way to live, especially if you can do a lot of it from your garden. I am just one ‘anecdote’ but I was rescued from serious chronic illness (heavily diseased heart arteries) and facing in those days what was fairly dangerous surgery, by adopting this approach 25 years ago next month, before I had heard of ‘Pritikin’ or any other similar studies.

I'm actually quite fond of the viola, and of classical music for strings generally. <br><br>Eric, yes, that's your value judgment, but it's not "just" your value judgment -- there's nothing compared to which it can be called "just" or "merely" or "nothing but." Your value judgments, taken together, amount to the thing that used to be called "character;" they define who you are and how you relate to the world of objective facts, and you have every right to act on your values and try to keep knowledge of the fossil record from being lost. <br><br>William, I wonder. Certainly genomic and genetic engineering firms are gobbling up pretty hefty amounts of investment money, which suggests that a fair amount of complexity goes into their work as well. I'll be talking next week about the way that cost and utility relate to one another, which may help clarify this. <br><br>Das Monde, whether or not it's rude to mention hungry people at Thanksgiving dinner depends vastly on where you are and, above all else, where you fall on the social ladder. It's mostly the overprivileged who bristle when that's mentioned; the poorer people I know acknowledge the fact, and generally do things like help fund and staff the Thanksgiving dinners local churches put on for the poor. <br><br>Yanocoches, and clay feet become awkward when you have to wade through rising waters...<br><br>Snoqualman, it's actually quite likely that once the current greenhouse gas spike has been absorbed by the biosphere, the ordinary pressure of the Milankovich cycle will drop us down into a new ice age. Ice ages usually come in bursts ten million years or so in length, and the present one has only been ongoing for two million years or so, so we have millions of years of repeated glaciations ahead of us -- or of whoever expands into our abandoned niches if our species messes up badly enough. <br><br>Cherokee, no argument. I'm glad I had the experience, and even happier that I got out. <br><br>Anselmo, nicely summarized. <br><br>Marcello, no argument there. If the internet wasn't around, I'd have to hope that enough people were interested in this sort of thing to cover the costs of a magazine. <br><br>Heather, it was a series of posts to a Druid organization many years ago, so I don't have anything handy. I'd encourage you to do things the traditional way and make it up as you go along, revising your practices on the basis of your experience.

I've simply learned to track the cycles in American popular spirituality, and on that basis predict that the next great wave of evangelical Christianity will be aligned with liberal causes rather than conservative ones. Liberal and conservative waves in Christianity alternate regularly in American popular culture; the fundamentalists had the upper hand from 1890 into the 1930s and then again from 1975 to now; check what was going on before 1900 or between the Second World War and the 1970s, and you'll find that the Social Gospel and a variety of left-leaning themes were far more influential. I'm already seeing the next American Christianity take shape among the young and dissatisfied, and it's quite the lively scene. <br><br>Justin, nicely phrased. I've also read that there's some reason to think the placebo effect is actually growing stronger over time, which has medical researchers floundering even more...<br><br>Bob, it's even worse than that -- have you looked at what other commodities have been doing of late? <a href=http://www.bbc.com/news/business/market_data/commodities/143908/three_month.stm rel=nofollow>Here's a good summary</a>; the short form is that most commodities are plunging in value. That being the case, petrocentric explanations need not apply; what's happening is that the wheels are coming off the global economy, and it's by no means unlikely that we may see a really messy economic crisis over the next few months and years. <br><br>Thomas, now go back to the post and tell me where what I said disagreed with what you said.

The image is at least as important as a cause of the suicide of science as anything else. More on this in an upcoming post!<br><br>August, yes, I heard that.

It's a zombie science, being kept alive by taxpayers. It "progressed" itself to a dead end. After Immanuel Kant, the whole project of metaphysics came to an end. One could take the point of view, that on some very profound level(western)philosophy failed. It failed to deliver the goods. I can't think of any serious philosopher who thinks that we can somehow resurrect metaphysics as a viable science. <br><br>So whats going on with western philosophy these days, is in some ways pretty pathetic. Some analytically oriented guys are trying to clean up some concepts and words, but it ammounts to very little in practice. We still have all the formal customs in place; I've attended a couple of philosophy seminars over the past two years, and while we still adhere to the practices (and scientific scrutinity) of yesteryears, the things that we students and researchers discuss about, are largely irrelevant to almost everything that goes on outside the university. ( I think I've heard peak oil being mentioned only once and it was by a fellow student)<br><br>In fact the last philosophy seminar that I attended a week a go, there was one very young woman talking about the possibility that the human race could become immortal through technology. I thought to myself, "oh boy, the church of the myth of progress is in full swing". I briefly thought of mentioning to her your discussion with James Howard Kunstler, about the myth of progress that I listened on youtube. But I decided against it. -I was already in so much trouble after my presentation on Albert Camus thinking; He thought that there was something very nihilistic and delusional about modernity.Camus thought that modernity was always trying to escape the (natural)limits of human life. -That presentation didn't go down all that well, I have to admit. <br><br>Anyways, I hope that what I just wrote is at least somewhat comprehensible.

All you have to do is look at the decline rate in production from fracked wells, and the soaring indebtedness of fracking companies, to realize just how much smoke and mirrors are going into the illusion of a US energy boom: a bluff that OPEC has apparently decided to call.

So have I. If you've been reading the comments on this thread, you'll have heard from several other people who've had similar experiences. I grant readily that many people in the current medical industry are decent, compassionate, etc.; the fact remains that blind trust in the good faith, good intentions, and competence of an MD has put far too many people six feet under. <br><br>Juha, your English is a lot better than my Finnish, so I'm not going to complain! I won't argue about the current stagnation of philosophy; to my mind, there's still a lot of richness there, but as Spengler suggested, we've passed the point at which really original philosophic work can be done. What's needed now is winnowing and synthesis, the sort of thing that gave rise to Neoplatonism and Neoconfucianism in comparable stages of other civilizations. Attention to the less popular insights of Camus sounds like a good place to start -- where in his works would you suggest I read about his analysis of modernity?<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c6943459520974837329 title="comment permalink">12/1/14, 3:34 PM</a><br><br>

The whole thing was a hoax intended to show just how vacuous and nonsensical post-modernism and deconstructionism have become. The journal took the bait hook, line and sinker and fell for what should have been an obvious parody to anyone with a functioning brain and some knowledge of science and philosophy. <br><br>The fact that the academic establishment actually takes people like Martin Heidegger, Jacques Derrida and their various imitators seriously speaks volumes about how brain dead and intellectually lacking the social sciences departments in most universities have become. Instead of philosophical and intellectual rigor, we have what amounts to an ongoing self-parody in the social sciences and humanities, thanks to the influence of post-modernism, deconstructionism, cultural Marxism, “critical race theory” and other forms of pseudo-intellectual nonsense that have become oh-so-fashionable with the academic left.

At least they clearly evaded any explanation that they had medication for. I ended up seeing a neurologist who spent a small fortune on imaging studies but could not answer why I was having the symptoms I was having. After a year and a half of chasing ghosts in the machine I ended up with a diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer that all the experts said I should deal with quickly as it was clearly beyond surgical intervention. In the 6 month build up to this I had been directed by luck to investigate nutritional issues with cancer. Interesting questions raised in “Cancer as a Metabolic Disease” by Thomas N Seyfried. Seyfried raises serious questions about nutrition and cancer. Some of the other reading raised big questions about gluten also. <br><br>In the end this led me down the path of serious reading on nutrition. The real eye opener was “Good Calories Bad Calories” by Gary Taubes. This is a look at nutrition research for the last 150 years. It makes it clear that nutrition advice put forward by medical authorities like the US government are not based on good science. Cholesterol was used as a target not because there was clear science to implicate but because they knew how to measure it. <br><br>My last recommendation would be “Primal Body, Primal Mind” by Nora T Gedgaudas CNS CNT. This is a well-documented look at the whole picture with more information and resources that you could follow up on. But raises clear questions about the need and even whether it is a good idea to lower Cholesterol.<br>Bottom line I have radically changed my eating habits. I went gluten and sugar free at the same time I started chemotherapy and started to feel better within a week. Chemo for prostate cancer in my case was hormone deprivation therapy and if you don’t mind a total loss of interest in sex hasn’t been too bad. I am now done and feel great however it will be a couple of years before there is certainty of the outcome.

That is, in my view, the available information does not support definitive knowledge so the conclusions that are drawn from the available knowledge are driven by what people believe. <br>What both these areas of science have in common are that they relate to systems with a degree of complexity that is currently beyond humanity's ability to comprehend, much less model accurately. There's a very good chance it always will be. Much the same can be said of society and real economies as well, which explains why social engineering and economic management always fail so comprehensively.<br><br>The association of science with atheism is also a case of hijacking by faith. It seems to me that if a person is pushed by science towards a particular religeous viewpoint that viewpoint should be agnosticism not atheism. Even if everything was known about everything, and it could definitively be shown that a deity was not required to explain the existence or operation of the universe and everything in it, that would still not be sufficient to disprove the existence of a deity. Atheism must, therefore, be a faith position. <br><br>In all these situations people are taking advantage of what I call the 'cult of expertise'. This has arisen partly from the massive expansion of available information and partly from the increasing trend of specialisation in society. The impossibility of an individual having an adequate grasp of all the things that affect their life means that they have to devolve responsibility for knowing some things to others, the specialists. This devolution has now gone so far that many people know almost nothing about anything outside of their immediate experience. In this climate of ignorance almost anyone claiming to be an expert has a chance of being believed and actual expertise often plays second fiddle to the perception of expertise.<br><br>Sorry if that went on a bit. <br><br>Thank you for your posts.

There is still richness in western philosophy, but I suppose one has to do some cherry picking. I can't say that I have a very deep understanding of Spengler, but things I've read made a lot of sense to me.<br><br>I read Camus when I was young. I doubt I understood his novels all that well, but I loved them non the less. There was something in his thinking that resonated deeply within me. He seemed to be talking about limits, while the world around me seemed interested about endless and limitless things.<br><br> It just so happened that I became unemployed the year before and I decided to go back to university, to continue my philosophy studies while this option is still open. I decided to re-read Camus works and see if I could make more sense out of them. (Being a student also seems to be an excellent way of getting used to a lower standard of living. Well, I've always had a fairly low standard of living compared to the rest of my countrymen, but it has never bothered me. I never owned a car or drivers lisence either).<br><br>Camus died when he was 46 years old, so he could never finnish his project, but Ronald Srigley went through Camus notes and journals and was able to create an idea of what Camus was thinking.<br> Anyway Camus was wondering what gave the modern human this sense of meaninglessness in life. Camus thinks that modernity always pushes ”meaning” to the future. There's always a brighter future ahead and the present then becomes somehow less. Also modernity seems to engage in excess in everything it does. The notion that life has limits, is shun and avoided. So there is something nihilistic about modernity, it won't accept that life is limited. Modernity looks like a fanatical attempt to achieve immortality. Camus started viewing Paris as the cave from Plato's philosophy. Everyone is dazzled by the spectacle, instead of actually being aware of the life around them. Personally I think that this spectacle has only gotten worse since. <br><br>What would I recommend though? I personally really liked his novels, like The Fall and The Plague. Ronald Srigleys book on Camus seems well worth the read.<br><br>And to somehow tie this with your blogpost- Camus observed that scientific facts, are often facts that we care little about in the end. He mentions Galilei, who rejected his own scientific discovery, the very moment it became a matter of life and death. The fact that earth revolves around the sun, isn't really an idea worth dying for. Maybe it's not even an idea worth living for.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c5619494508087344147 title="comment permalink">12/2/14, 1:34 PM</a><br><br>

Regardless of whether it should be salvaged, it's not sustainable, and can't be maintained in its current intermediated, corrupt form. If young people are having second thoughts about a career in modern medicine, that's not necessarily a BAD thing. <br>I'm subjected to TV at work and other odd times, and note with amusement that commercials for tort lawyers regarding problems with certain drugs reliably lag behind ads for the same drug. Somehow, I don't think any of this intermediation benefits the consumer. Better to avoid the drug in the first place, thereby avoiding the tort lawyer later.<br>Related to that, I wanted to add my bad mainstream medicine story to the pot. Less than a year ago, I had my first migraine, with auration. I'd never experienced anything like it, but thought it could be a TIA (stroke-like), so went to an outpatient clinic. Because of the risk of TIA, was referred to the E.R. They did an MRI at the hospital. I was referred to a neurologist by my internist. The neurologist insisted I needed an carotid ultrasound, which I resisted, citing the negative MRI. He insisted I needed the ultrasound, and I relented instead of denying in a fit. I just now finished paying off the $600 I had to charge on a credit card to cover my part of the bill for an MRI I didn't want (I was certain it was a migraine and not a TIA before the ultrasound). Not to mention that I got nickel and dimed by what seemed like every single person I saw as well as people and institutions off premise. And I HAVE INSURANCE. It really burned me on modern medicine. Considering my own attitude about life and death, if I had a terminal or even less than terminal condition, I would prefer death to bankruptcy via the medical system. It's not worth it to me.<br>Regarding nursing homes, my grandfather stays in one because of my mother. I honestly don't think he is that bad off that we couldn't keep him at home with some minor home care, but my mother would not consider having him live with her. She's showing signs of dementia, and, being in denial, my guess is she doesn't want to be reminded of what it looks like further along. Needless to say, it's just another black mark among many in my book of the silents and boomers I know personally, and an indication of the differences of generations. (I'm sure I'm asking for an inundation of outrage, but, oh well) I think it's an indication of the strength of his character that he makes the best of the situation, and has managed to become beloved by the people that work there. I once applied to be an organizer with SEIU, and they stated that nursing homes were some of the worst working environments with the most underpaid workers that they'd encountered.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c7901304555071970724 title="comment permalink">12/2/14, 4:48 PM</a><br><br>

I tried for years to get my cholesterol and Triglycerides down using Lipitor and Fenofibrate, and following various diets. The diets were based on an idea of reducing calories, yet eating every meal. Going on the theory that we were designed to miss meals intermittently (while hunting the next mastodon), I decided to skip breakfast and lunch three days a week. It took a while to work up to it, but now my cholesterol and TGs are in line, and I have lost 15 pounds and kept it off. <br><br>My doctor helped me by ordering the lab tests, but otherwise advised against this course of action. <br><br>I used a hypothesis, and tested it on myself, using labwork to see if it worked. This is the scientific method, but (in my case) encountered some hostility from my doctor...hmmm.<br>Not sure if this approach would work for everyone, but it worked for me. Not eating 6 meals a week is a lot cheaper than buying Lipitor too.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c5459604560824177686 title="comment permalink">12/2/14, 11:46 PM</a><br><br>

It is simply that the cycles have periods of 20,000 years plus, far longer than the typical climate run of a couple of hundred years. The cycles simply are *not* *relevant*. Where you have paleoclimate reconstructions over many thousands of years, then of course the cycles are taken into account. The details are usually buried in technical/mathematical subsections, not in press releases. While there are problems with some aspects of the theory, the base idea is generally accepted. One should also note that enough compute power to properly evaluate the cycles came *After* the iceage furorae of the '70s. Current calculations (see wikipedia page and references therein) show we are heading into an interstadial, or relatively non-iceage state.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c4079292877615350416 title="comment permalink">12/3/14, 3:04 AM</a><br><br>

But a valid comparison needs to take into account the scale and depth of the inquiry that was going on then. How many scientists are we talking about? How many funded research projects? How many peer-reviewed journal articles published? How much international cooperation within the scientific community to ascertain whether this hypothesis was worth pursuing? My sense is that the new-ice-age hypothesis, like many others in various fields, didn't encounter the kind of confirming evidence that would give it traction and it was accordingly dropped.<br><br><a href=dark-age-america-suicide-of-science.html#c6238215498224535122 title="comment permalink">12/27/14, 6:53 AM</a><br><br>
