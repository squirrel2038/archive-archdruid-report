I have been wondering for some time now how to talk about the weirdly autumnal note that sounds so often and so clearly in America these days. Through the babble and clatter, the seven or eight television screens yelling from the walls of every restaurant you pass and all the rest of it, there comes a tone and a mood that reminds me of wind among bare branches and dry leaves crackling underfoot:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>as though even the people who insist most loudly that it’s all onward and upward from here don’t believe it any more, and those for whom the old optimism stopped being more than a soothing shibboleth a long time ago are hunching their shoulders, shutting their eyes tight, and hoping that things can still hold together for just a little while longer.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s not just that American politicians and pundits are insisting at the top of their lungs that the United States <a href=../../2014/04/mentats-wanted-will-train.html>can threaten Russia with natural gas surpluses that don’t exist</a>, though that’s admittedly a very bad sign all by itself. It’s that this orgy of self-congratulatory nonsense appears in the news right next to reports that oil and gas companies are slashing their investments in the fracking technology and shale leases that were supposed to produce those imaginary surpluses, having lost a great deal of money pursuing the shale oil mirage, while Russia and Iran
<a href=https://www.blogger.com/null span="" style="mso-spacerun: yes"></a><a href=http://peakoil.com/publicpolicy/iran-russia-working-to-seal-20-billion-oil-for-goods-deal> pursue a trade deal that will make US sanctions against Iran all but irrelevant</a>, and China <a href=http://www.ecns.cn/business/2014/04-01/107537.shtml> is quietly making arrangements to conduct its trade with Europe in yuan rather than dollars</a>. Strong nations in control of their own destinies, it’s fair to note, don’t respond to challenges on this scale by plunging their heads quite so enthusiastically into the sands of self-deception.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To shift temporal metaphors a bit, the long day of national delusion that dawned back in 1980, when Ronald Reagan famously and fatuously proclaimed “it’s morning in America,” is drawing on rapidly toward dusk, and most Americans are hopelessly unprepared for the coming of night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They’re unprepared in practical terms, that is, for an era in which the five per cent of us who live in the United States will no longer dispose of a quarter of the world’s energy supply and a third of its raw materials and industrial products, and in which what currently counts as a normal American lifestyle will soon be no more than a fading memory for the vast majority.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They’re just as unprepared, though,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>for the psychological and emotional costs of that shattering transformation—not least because the change isn’t being imposed on them at random by an indifferent universe, but comes as the inevitable consequence of their own collective choices in decades not that long past.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The hard fact that most people in this country are trying not to remember is this:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in the years right after Reagan’s election, a vast number of Americans enthusiastically turned their backs on the promising steps toward sustainability that had been taken in the previous decade, abandoned the ideals they’d been praising to the skies up to that time, and cashed in their grandchildrens’ future so that they didn’t have to give up the extravagance and waste that defined their familiar and comfortable lifestyles. As a direct result, the nonrenewable resources that might have supported the transition to a sustainable future went instead to fuel one last orgy of wretched excess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Now, though, the party is over, the bill is due, and the consequences of that disastrous decision have become a massive though almost wholly unmentionable factor in our nation’s culture and collective psychology. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A great many of the more disturbing features of contemporary American life, I’m convinced, can’t be understood unless America’s thirty-year vacation from reality is taken into account. A sixth of the US population is currently on antidepressant medications, and since maybe half of Americans can’t afford to get medication at all, the total number of Americans who are clinically depressed is likely a good deal higher than prescription figures suggest. The sort of bizarre delusions that used to count as evidence of serious mental illness—baroque conspiracy theories thickly frosted with shrill claims of persecution, fantasies of imminent mass death as punishment for humanity’s sins, and so on—have become part of the common currency of American folk belief. For that matter, what does our pop culture’s frankly necrophiliac obsession with vampires amount to but an attempt, thinly veiled in the most transparent of symbolism, to insist that it really is okay to victimize future generations for centuries down the line in order to prolong one’s own existence? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mythic and legends such as this can be remarkably subtle barometers of the collective psyche. The transformation that turned the vampire from just another spooky Eastern European folktale into a massive pop culture presence in industrial North America has quite a bit to say about the unspoken ideas and emotions moving through the crawlspaces of our collective life. In the same way, it’s anything but an accident that the myth of the heroic quest has become so pervasive a presence in the modern industrial world that Joseph Campbell could simply label it “the monomyth,” the basic form of myth as such. In any sense other than a wholly parochial one, of course, he was quite wrong—the wild diversity of the world’s mythic stories can’t be forced into any one narrative pattern—but if we look only at popular culture in the modern industrial world, he’s almost right.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The story of the callow nobody who answers the call to adventure, goes off into the unknown, accomplishes some grand task, and returns transformed, to transform his surroundings in turn, is firmly welded into place in the imagination of our age. You’ll find it at the center of J.R.R. Tolkien’s great<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>works of fantasy, in the most forgettable products of the modern entertainment industry, and everything in between and all around. Yet there’s a curious blind spot in all this: we hear plenty about those who answer the call to adventure, and nothing at all about those who refuse it. Those latter don’t offer much of a plot engine for an adventure story, granted, but such a tale could make for a gripping psychological study—and one that has some uncomfortably familiar features. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With that in mind, with an apology in the direction of Tolkien’s ghost, and with another to those of my readers who aren’t lifelong Tolkien buffs with a head full of Middle-earth trivia—yes, I used to sign school yearbooks in fluent Elvish—I’d like to suggest a brief visit to an alternate Middle-earth:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>one in which Frodo Baggins, facing the final crisis of the Third Age and the need to leave behind everything he knew and loved in order to take the Ring to Mount Doom, crumpled instead, with a cry of “I can’t, Gandalf, I just can’t.” Perhaps you’ll join me in a quiet corner of The Green Dragon, the best inn in Bywater, take a mug of ale from the buxom hobbit barmaid, and talk about old Frodo, who lived until recently just up the road and across the bridge in Hobbiton. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You’ve heard about the magic ring he had, the one that he inherited from his uncle Bilbo, the one that Gandalf the wizard wanted him to go off and destroy? That was thirty years ago, and most folk in the Shire have heard rumors about it by now. Yes, it’s quite true; Frodo was supposed to leave the Shire and go off on an adventure, as Bilbo did before him, and couldn’t bring himself to do it. He had plenty of reasons to stay home, to be sure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was tolerably well off and quite comfortable, all his friends and connections were here, and the journey would have been difficult and dangerous. Nor was there any certainty of success—quite the contrary, it’s entirely possible that he might have perished somewhere in the wild lands, or been caught by the Dark Lord’s servants, or what have you. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So he refused, and when Gandalf tried to talk to him about it, he threw the old wizard out of Bag End and slammed the round green door in his face. Have you ever seen someone in a fight who knows that he’s in the wrong, and knows that everyone else knows it, and that knowledge just makes him even more angry and stubborn?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That was Frodo just then. Friends of mine watched the whole thing, or as much of it as could be seen from the garden outside, and it was not a pleasant spectacle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s what happened thereafter, though, that bears recalling. I’m quite sure that if Frodo had shown the least sign of leaving the Shire and going on the quest, Sauron would have sent Black Riders after him in a fine hurry, and there’s no telling what else might have come boiling up out of Mordor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s by no means impossible that the Dark Lord might have panicked, and launched a hasty, ill-advised assault on Gondor right away. For all I know, that may have been what Gandalf had in mind, tricking the Dark Lord into overreacting before he’d gathered his full strength, and before Gondor and Rohan had been thoroughly weakened from within.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, once Sauron’s spies brought him word that Frodo had refused to embark on the quest, the Dark Lord knew that he had a good deal less to fear, and that he could afford to take his time. Ever since then, there have been plenty of servants of Mordor in and around the Shire, and a Black Rider or two keeping watch nearby, but nothing obvious or direct, nothing that might rouse whatever courage Frodo might have had left or<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>convince him that he had to flee for his life. Sauron was willing to be patient—patient and cruel. I’m quite sure he knew perfectly well what the rest of Frodo’s life would be like. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So Gandalf went away, and Frodo stayed in Bag End, and for years thereafter it seemed as though the whole business had been no more than a mistake. The news that came up the Greenway from the southern lands was no worse than before; Gondor still stood firm, and though there was said to be some kind of trouble in Rohan, well, that was only to be expected now and then.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Frodo even took to joking about how gullible he’d been to believe all those alarmist claims that Gandalf had made. Sauron was still safely cooped up in Mordor, and all seemed right with Middle-earth. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of course part of that was simply that Frodo had gotten even wealthier and more comfortable than he’d been before. He patched up his relationship with the Sackville-Bagginses, and he invested a good deal of his money in Sandyman’s mill in Hobbiton, which paid off handsomely. He no longer spent time with many of his younger friends by then, partly because they had their own opinions about what he should have done, and partly because he had business connections with some of the wealthiest hobbits in the Shire, and wanted to build on those. He no longer took long walks around the Shire, as he’d done before, and he gave up visiting elves and dwarves when he stopped speaking to Gandalf. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
But of course the rumors and news from the southern lands slowly but surely turned to the worse, as the Dark Lord gathered his power and tightened his grip on the western lands a little at a time. I recall when Rohan fell to Saruman’s goblin armies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That was a shock for a great many folk, here in the Shire and elsewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Soon thereafter, though, Frodo was claiming that after all, Saruman wasn’t Sauron, and Rohan wasn’t that important, and for all anyone knew, the wizard and the Dark Lord might well end up at each other’s throats and spare the rest of us. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, it was around that time that Frodo stopped joking about Gandalf’s warnings, and got angry if anyone mentioned them in his hearing. It was around that same time, too, that he started insisting loudly and often that someone would surely stop Sauron. One day it was the elves:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>after all, they had three rings of power, and could surely overwhelm the forces of Mordor if they chose to. Another day, the dwarves would do it, or Saruman, or the men of Gondor, or the Valar in the uttermost West. There were so many alternatives!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His friends very quickly learned to nod and agree with him, for he would lose his temper and start shouting at them if they disagreed or even asked questions. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When Lorien was destroyed, that was another shock. It was after that, as I recall, that Frodo started hinting darkly that the elves didn’t seem to be doing anything with their three rings of power to stop Sauron, and maybe they weren’t as opposed to him as they claimed. He came up with any number of theories about this or that elvish conspiracy. The first troubles were starting to affect the Shire by then, of course, and his investments were beginning to lose money; it was probably inevitable that he would start claiming that the conspiracy was aimed in part against hobbits, against the Shire, or against him in particular—especially the latter. They wanted his ring, of course. That played a larger and larger role in his talk as the years passed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I don’t recall hearing of any particular change in his thinking when word came that Minas Tirith had been taken by the Dark Lord’s armies, but it wasn’t much later that a great many elves came hurrying along the East Road through the Shire, and a few months after that, word came that Rivendell had fallen. That was not merely a shock, but a blow; Frodo had grown up hearing his uncle’s stories about Rivendell and the elves and half-elves who lived there. There was a time after that news came that some of us briefly wondered if old Frodo might actually find it in himself to do the thing he’d refused to do all those years before. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
But of course he did nothing of the kind, not even when the troubles here in the Shire began to bite more and more deeply, when goblins started raiding the borders of the North Farthing and the Buckland had to be abandoned to the Old Forest. No, he started insisting to anyone who would listen that Middle-earth was doomed, that there was no hope left in elves or dying N<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">ú</span>menor, that Sauron’s final victory would surely come before—oh, I forget what the date was; it was some year or other not too far from now. He spent hours reading through books of lore, making long lists of reasons why the Dark Lord’s triumph was surely at hand. Why did he do that? Why, for the same reason that drove him to each of his other excuses in turn: to prove to himself that his decision to refuse the quest hadn’t been the terrible mistake he knew perfectly well it had been. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And then, of course, the Ring betrayed him, as it betrayed Gollum and Isildur before him. He came home late at night, after drinking himself half under the table at the Ivy Bush, and discovered that the Ring was nowhere to be found. After searching Bag End in a frantic state, he ran out the door and down the road toward Bywater shouting “My precious! My precious!” He was weeping and running blindly in the night, and when he got to the bridge he stumbled; over he went into the water, and that was the end of him. They found his body in a weir downstream the next morning.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The worst of it is that right up to the end, right up to the hour the Ring left him, he still could have embarked on the quest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It would have been a different journey, and quite possibly a harder one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With Rivendell gone, he would have had to go west rather than east, across the Far Downs to Cirdan at the Grey Havens, where you’ll find most of the high-elves who still remain in Middle-earth. From there, with such companions as might have joined him, he would have had to go north and then eastward through Arnor, past the ruins of Annuminas and Lake Evendim, to the dales of the Misty Mountains, and then across by one of the northern passes: a hard and risky journey, but by no means impossible, for with no more need to hinder travel between Rivendell and Lorien, the Dark Lord’s watch on the mountains has grown slack. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Beyond the mountains, the wood-elves still dwell in the northern reaches of Mirkwood, along with refugees from Lorien and the last of the Beornings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He could have gotten shelter and help there, and boats to travel down the River Running into the heart of Wilderland.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From there his way would have led by foot to the poorly guarded northern borders of Mordor—when has Sauron ever had to face a threat from that quarter?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So you see that it could have been done. It could still be done, if someone were willing to do it. Even though so much of what could have been saved thirty years ago has been lost, even though Minas Tirith, Edoras, Lorien and Rivendell have fallen and the line of the kings of Gondor is no more, it would still be worth doing; there would still be many things that could be saved. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nor would such a journey have to be made alone. Though Aragorn son of Arathorn was slain in the last defense of Rivendell, there are still Rangers to be found in Cirdan’s realm and the old lands of Arnor; there are elf-warriors who hope to avenge the blood shed at Rivendell, and dwarves from the Blue Mountains who have their own ancient grudges against the Dark Lord. The last free Rohirrim retreated to Minhiriath after <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">É</span>omer fell at Helm’s Deep, and still war against King Grima, while Gondor west of the river Gilrain clings to a tenuous independence and would rise up against Sauron at need. Would those and the elves of Lindon be enough? No one can say; there are no certainties in this business, except for the one Frodo chose—the certainty that doing nothing will guarantee Sauron’s victory. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And there might even still be a wizard to join such a quest. In fact, there would certainly be one—the very last of them, as far as I know. Gandalf perished when Lorien fell, I am sorry to say, and as for Saruman, the last anyone saw of him, he was screaming in terror as two Ringwraiths dragged him through the door of the Dark Tower; his double-dealing was never likely to bring him to a good end. The chief of the Ringwraiths rules in Isengard now. Still, there was a third in these western lands: fool and bird-tamer, Saruman called him, having never quite managed to notice that knowledge of the ways of nature and the friendship of birds and beasts might have considerable value in the last need of Middle-earth. Radagast is his name; yes, that would be me.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Why am I telling you all this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well, you are old Frodo’s youngest cousin, are you not? Very nearly the only one of his relatives with enough of the wild Tookish blood in you to matter, or so I am told. It was just a month ago that you and two of your friends were walking in the woods, and you spoke with quite a bit of anger about how the older generation of hobbits had decided to huddle in their holes until the darkness falls—those were your very words, I believe. How did I know that? Why, a little bird told me—a wren, to be precise, a very clever and helpful little fellow, who runs errands for me from time to time when I visit this part of Middle-earth. If you meant what you said then, there is still hope. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br>
And the Ring? No, it was not lost, or not for long. It slipped from its chain and fell from old Frodo’s pocket as he stumbled home that last night, and a field mouse spotted it. I had briefed all the animals and birds around Hobbiton, of course, and so she knew what to do; she dragged the Ring into thick grass, and when dawn came, caught the attention of a jay, who took it and hid it high up in a tree. I had to trade quite a collection of sparkling things for it! But here it is, in this envelope, waiting for someone to take up the quest that Frodo refused. The choice is yours, my dear hobbit. What will you do?</div>

I do wonder, though, what kind of life a full embrace of appropriate technology would have provided. How much would the mass of Americans been expected to give up at a time when very few people had any clue that anything really needed to be done at all?(other than the intuitively obvious clue that a finite planet is finite, but ever since men realized that they could sail around it, they have felt like that meant they could sail for ever.) My suspicion is that, even though it would have led to a future less dire than we face now, it would have been a present that most middle-class people would have recoiled from in horror.<br><br>If Christians had been humble enough to remain a minor cult religion in the Near East, 9 million "witches" wouldn't have been tortured to death. If the Southern aristocracy had freed their slaves and voluntarily accepted bankruptcy and destitution, the Civil War would have been unnecessary. There are countless moments in history where the past can be judged for not living up to a level of heroism that we ourselves can only commit to in retrospect. Thirty five years later, and even the majority of readers of this blog (myself included) still have computers, Cars, TV(?), Central heat and air, shop at the store for international merchandise, and generally enjoy American affluence. <br><br>I think the LOTR analogy fails in that no, one, brave chivalrous person could save us from Peak Oil and no single person's sacrifice makes an appreciable difference, at least to anyone but perhaps themselves and that difference is hedged by the unclear question of how much one actually needs to suffer now in order to be prepared for the future. I don't think it has ever been a part of human nature to embrace suffering with enthusiasm. Although, perhaps if Billy Graham had started a new protestant movement of Eco-puritanism to give asceticism the frisson of self-righteousness?

I'm not sure if anyone's brought it up yet, or if the news article I'm reading is accurate, but I'll paraphrase what it says.<br><br>The US Aegis-equipped destroyer USS Donald Cook sailed into the central Black Sea from Romania, where a Russian Su-24 fighter approached it. The plane was equipped with no weapons but the had the latest in Russian electronic jamming equipment. It was detected incoming, but as it approached, all the radar screens and targeting systems on the destroyer suddenly went blank. They were unable to do anything as the fighter made 12 threatening passes, simulating attacks, at distances closer than 1000 meters, before flying away. The destroyer headed immediately back to Romania with its electronic tail between its legs. Russian news source claims the entire crew tried to resign, although the Pentagon only says that they were demoralized. <br><br>Either way, I think this shows that any US military action attempted against Russia or China could be easily monkeywrenched in more or less exactly the way you portrayed it in "How It Could Happen."

I have found it rather amusing to watch the impotent flailing of the US government, the EU and their puppet regime in Kiev, not to mention the utter incompetence of the Obama administration, once it became clear that things were not going according to plan in the Ukraine. These guys make even Dubya and his handlers look like a model of professionalism and competence by comparison, and it’s pretty clear that Bush Jr. was one of the worst US presidents in history. This time, the latest attempt by the US political establishment to engineer another “color revolution” has backfired spectacularly. <br><br>The US government and the EU have gotten far too used to being able to bully their adversaries into submission. The problem with using bullying as a tactic is that sooner or later, someone comes along who has the ability and the will to fight back. Russian officials have made it clear that for them, the use of the NATO no-fly zone in Libya as a pretext for regime change was the last straw, and they have drawn the line. The result has been an embarrassing string of defeats for the US and the EU in Syria and the Ukraine since then, no doubt with more to follow in the years ahead. <br><br>I think by the time this whole sordid farce is done with, we will see the end of the American Empire and the EU and the formation of a new Russian Empire, euphemistically known as the Eurasian Union. It may not happen overnight, but it will happen. Oswald Spengler famously predicted that the next great civilization would come out of Russia, and I think he was absolutely right on that point as he was on so many others. The peoples of Europe might want to consider brushing up on their Russian language skills, and Americans would do well to start learning Spanish and Chinese if they haven’t already begun to do so…<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c4388450596557239627 title="comment permalink">4/23/14, 8:18 PM</a><br><br>

I am in a weird, fey mood tonight, so I will say it here, inspired by our host's alternate tale.<br><br>In Tolkien's version, Frodo did take up the burden Galdalf laid before him. Through many dangers and much grief he reached the fires of Mount Doom at last, and stood at the edge of its fiery heart. <br><br>And then, having done far more than anyone might have expected of him ... at the end, Frodo failed the last challenge of them all. He refused to give up the One Ring. He decisively and irrevocably failed in his task! <br><br>This is exactly right, and it is true to Frodo's character as Tolkien had delineated him up to that point.<br><br>What saved Middle Earth was not Frodo, but Gollum. <br><br>Gollum, who had been warped out of all recognition and seemed barely a hobbit any longer, fought Frodo for the Ring, and bit it from Frodo's hand. It was Gollum in his burning hunger for the Ring who overreached himself and fell to destruction, carrying the One Ring with him into the only fire that could unmake it.<br><br>Had Frodo foreseen all the danger and hardship, he might well have set out anyway. That was his character, and Gandalf knew it. Had Frodo foreknown his final failure, though, why would he have wanted to set out at all? Even so, Gandalf might have been able to persuade him to go <br><br>But . . . had Frodo foreknown that it would be Gollum who would get the job done where he, Frodo, could not . . . had he foreknown that it was precisely Gollum's insane hunger for the Ring, and not any heroic virtue at all, that would get the job done in the end . . . would Frodo have been able to face this certainty and still set out on the quest? Would Gandalf have been able to persuade him? I think not. As Tolkien portrayed Frodo, he could not have set out on his quest, had he foreknown with certainty that a creature such as Gollum would save the day at its end, not a determined and dutiful hobbit.<br><br>It was not just the Ring of Power that needed to be destroyed, but the monomyth of the hero and the quest. *That* is what Tolkien did so well. Gollum is Tolkien's masterpiece.<br><br>As we face our own lesser Dark Lords and Ringwraiths during the coming Dark Age, it seems to me that we ought to cherish the example of Gollum, and also to remember how Gandalf counseled Frodo to hold his hand when Frodo thought to slay him. <br><br>IN this weird, fey mood of mine, I am as certain as I am of anything that it will be the Gollums whom we meet in those coming Dark Ages, and not the heroes and heroines, nor even the stubborn hobbits who we might aspire to be, that will get some of the most needful tasks done for bringing a remnant of our descendants safely through the coming Dark Ages. <br><br>This is the paradox of our world, and also the paradox of the human condition. In the most desperate straits, vice will sometimes tip the balance toward a good outcome where virtue cannot.<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c7715891355996850169 title="comment permalink">4/23/14, 8:20 PM</a><br><br>

I've been thinking about the quest to do something about peak oil and a post industrializing world (as like a narrative of a fantasy adventure novel) for quite some time. (I'm just about young enough to be frodo when he first received the ring too!).<br><br>I know you're not a fan of the Harry Potter series, But i could write a similar narrative about Harry quite simply refusing to put himself in danger all those times in the books. For one thing, Lord Voldemort would have returned in the first book instead of the forth, probably with a similar reaction on the part of the ministry of magic (don't do anything/ put your head in the sand). Thus the ministry are quietly taken over without even putting up a fight. Harry meanwhile is quietly killed or imprisoned by Voldemort. No one knows what happened to him.<br><br>Still though the Order of the Phoenix continue to fight some kind of resistance.

The National Geographic video "7 Billion" made in 2010, lists the U.S. as using 23% of the world's energy. I have it embedded in an entry at my blog.<br><br>http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2012/08/student-sustainability-video-festival-5.html<br><br>In 2012, Business Insider came out with a startling report using data from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy showing that China was the number one consumer of energy, using 21.3% of the world's energy, while the U.S. share had fallen to 18.5% in 2011.<br><br>http://www.businessinsider.com/china-energy-use-2012-8?op=1<br><br>I've been looking for other sources that confirm this conclusion the I.E.A. and E.I.A. in particular, and haven't found them yet, but if it's true, the American Empire's ability to command five times our per capita share of the world's energy slipped away dramatically during the past decade. Now we can't even get four times our share.<br><br>Of course, that's mostly because China has been vastly increasing its energy use while ours has been relatively flat. Even so, the idea that the U.S. is no longer number one is an increasing number of statistics seems to be seeping through into our awareness, even as most people consciously deny any such thing.<br><br>About the monomyth--that's a hero's tale. There's also the prophet's tale, such as Buddha being born a prince or Moses being adopted as one, then leaving a life of luxury to lead a spiritual journey instead of or in addition to a physical one. It think there's one of those for Merlin. There's even a rogue's tale--which is much more picaresque. Aladdin comes to mind. It's too bad those aren't as well known as Campbell's favorite.<br><br>As for you being Radagast the Brown, that's an amusing image, especially since I now have Sylvester McCoy's protraying of the character in my mind.

I can remember going to the mall and spending the first two paychecks that I got from my first real job, this amazing feeling of what it was suddenly like to have more money than you knew how to spend and what it was like to pull $20 bill after $20 bill from your wallet and know you still had more. Followed by the empty feeling of getting home with bags of clothes and gadgets and DVDs and having the novelty of your purchases wear off. And even though my peers were not as well versed in history as I was at the time (my father was a history buff) I can remember others my age voicing this uneasy feeling that there really had to be something better for our generation to do than shop and party. But what? All the great struggles were already over with it seemed. For a brief moment it really looked like Fukayama’s end of history was upon us. We had won the future – but victory felt empty and boring and almost pointless.<br><br>There are a LOT of people out there who will happily answer the call for adventure and action. But I think especially younger people are not used to having leaders who will call for them to do anything bold and dramatic. My father was inspired to go onto politics by JFK. In contrast to that, the sacrifices that our current “leaders” ask us to make, the dangers that they tell us to endure, they don’t have a romantic or exciting quality to them, in fact they are generally just cruel and banal: live with declining wages, decreasing opportunities and the risk of dying from an illness that would have been treatable had health insurance been affordable. And don’t complain.<br><br>So far there have been two times in my life – with Bush after 9/11 and Obama after the ’08 election – when I felt that America had leaders who were about to issue that call to do something great and dramatic, but both times it fizzled out. Bush’s people told Americans that if they wanted to help they should go shopping, and Obama disappeared behind a bureaucratic wall and left his supporters demoralized. But the desire for action is still there and I believe people will still respond to a really passionate call from an effective leader. Unfortunately we don’t know who that will be. Will it be someone who can inspire people to do good? Or will it be a Fred Halliot?<br><br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c8617247671809293148 title="comment permalink">4/23/14, 9:39 PM</a><br><br>

You take your Ring the way that seems best to you, I'll head the way that seems best to me, and if enough of us do the same, sooner or later enough options will be covered...<br><br>Kutamun, I'll be talking about the Saxons in the not too distant future. <br><br>James, got it and thank you.

You've written in previous posts about this period of Reagan/Thatcher reaction in the early 80s, overturning the beginnings of a move towards sustainable adaption to our basic energy, environmental and economic realities. For those with eyes open it is now easy to see the arc of recent history in these terms: a promising future squandered by an ultimately dead-end reaction, with Jimmy Carter (in sweater and solar panels) providing the dramatic victim role.<br><br>Back in the UK, where I grew up, the narrative didn't play out that way at the time, at least as I experienced it. The mid to late 70s were difficult times: economic crisis, government-imposed 3 days weeks, power blackouts, my Dad losing his job, union strikes, trash and riots in the streets, etc. As a lower middle-class punk rocker in those days it was kind of a wild adventure, those years of "no future" Britain, and flirting with anarchy in the UK. <br><br>But then along came Thatcher's reaction, made possible by the rising flow of North Sea oil, and many breathed a sigh of relief and welcomed in prosperity. Well, not everyone. Plenty got left behind and the country was very split for a long-time. But it was split between those who wanted the old industrial settlement to continue, and those who went with the new prosperity. Me, I graduated college, shaved off the mohawk and got a job in the burgeoning computer industry. I followed the money. Not proud, but that's what I did, at least for a while. Until I got my head straight.<br><br>But my point is that we didn't think we were just giving in, like Frodo, closing our eyes and sitting on our duffs. We thought we were part of dramatic times, taking a stand. If you went left you were fighting the rise of Thatcherism, but ultimately trying to turn back the clock. If you went right you saw yourself as fighting back against decline and the rough times of the 70s. There wasn't a lot of focus on a third way of sustainable development. I've read enough of your work now to understand how destructive that binary choice was. But at the time, whether you went left or right in early 80s Britain, there was the energy of a quest behind that choice.<br><br>A doomed quest as it turned out, that was literally going to run out of gas. Looking at North Sea oil production now, it all seems so silly. Flailing at windmills was all it was.<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c1192918458229660356 title="comment permalink">4/24/14, 3:24 AM</a><br><br>

What little remained was cleared in two waves of agricultural mechanisation - the first by steam power in the 19th century, and the second by diesel in the years after WWII. What most Britons think of as natural landscapes are nothing of the sort, they're the result of clearance, enclosure, and over-grazing. Although I haven't looked into the details of the woodland you mention, there's a very good chance that it isn't really "ancient" at all. There's almost no genuine old-growth forest anywhere in the country, even in the remotest glens of Scotland. It's probably a patch of regrowth scrub no more than a couple of hundred years old, allowed to re-establish itself because the terrain didn't suit mechanised farming, which is what passes for "ancient woodland" in most of Britain these days.<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c7247983634867866840 title="comment permalink">4/24/14, 3:34 AM</a><br><br>

I hope to inspire people to say, "Screw waiting for a leader, I'm going to get up off the couch and do what must be done all by myself, and if others join me, great." If anything has the potential to do some good, it's that.<br><br>Well, unfortunately we do have leaders, and as long as we do, what they say and do does matter. They can lead people in directions that have horrible consequences - Hitler is the obvious example. Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both openly mocked and denounced your idea of trying to live sustainably. At Bush’s political party’s convention in his last year as president in 2008 the crowd chanted “drill baby drill!” at the top of their lungs. It matters that Rush Limbaugh has been on 2000 radio stations every day for the last 25 years calling people like you and others who care about saving energy, “environmental wackos”. That stuff matters. Young people without much perspective see it or hear it and are are moved by it, and they are led in the wrong direction.<br><br>You learned about sustainability from writers who wrote books about it in the 1970’s, they were leaders in the world of ideas. The ideas of sustainability and limits to growth were virtually unknown to the popular imagination before that time, and they represented a challenge to more 400 years of the dominant capitalist idea of endless growth. The fact that you yourself are trying to inspire us with those new ideas, makes you a leader. The fact that you’re growing rhubarb inspires me. Take your tall ships idea. I do have the means to grow rhubarb, but unfortunately not to build tall ships, but maybe you will inspire people of greater financial means. For instance, we do have more than 440 billionaires in the US, and a number of them, like Paul Allen and Elon Musk, are building space ships rather than tall ships. But if one of them was to start building tall sailing ships instead of space ships, that could be quite inspirational.

It doesn’t take much development before a human realises that the inevitable consequence of life is death. A coping strategy of dealing with this is to simply ignore the issue, by embracing ‘short term-ism’. In essence this is safety mechanism for dealing with anxiety. Myself having read Johns books, as well as others by Richard Heinberg etc, did start to feel the heavy burden of knowledge, and the conclusion, that alone, I can do precious little to deflect modern day society from its path. Anxiety started to become a problem. The strategy for me is to recognise the difference between ‘thinking’ based anxiety, and ‘reality’ based anxiety. I can do something about the former much more readily. Most people do not recognise the difference. By thinking short term they avoid the problems that are explored on this web site. They play out their lives in a sort of ‘matrix’, happy to live the dream peddled by politicians and the main stream media, and to make themselves blissfully unaware of other broader long term issues. Perhaps humanity is better designed to simply deal with the circumstances one finds oneself in? For all the additional capability that our brains give us, we seem quite determined simply to consume whatever resources are available until they are not, and then suffer the consequences of readjustment at that time. It may not be a sensible strategy, but perhaps the only one the majority of us can cope with. Having said that, it does not prevent us taking an adventure, as set out in the Johns article. I do wonder though, how many of us undertaken an adventure, which has a straightforward definable goal. In moving forward, the issues we face seem very complex, are require the delivery of goals that out of reach of any single individual. That being the case, perhaps the best we can do, is pursue our own individual adventures, regardless of whether they will affect the ‘whole’, because that’s the best we can offer or deliver.<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c1680993919413460123 title="comment permalink">4/24/14, 7:53 AM</a><br><br>

I find it fascinating that fantasy is the booming genre of fiction right now, taking over ever more space in bookstores and -- along with science fiction -- the top-grossing film slot every year for the last 15 years. <br><br>Yet these were marginal genres before my lifetime, relegated to pulp novels and B-movies. Better special effects aided its takeover of film and television, of course, but books had already created the demand. It’s tempting to conclude that Tolkien’s runaway success catapulted the genre to its current state, yet I believe his book sold poorly at first, only picking up steam in the 1970s among people who accepted a declining future.<br><br>I also notice that the standard Middle-Earth setting – thatched agrarian villages and ruined castles -- often resembles the Irish countryside where we live, or at least the way it looked until recently. Whether or not this was Tolkien's intent, many imitators have made the connection explicit, as in Patricia Kennealy's "Keltiad" books, or in film adaptations with pseudo-Celtic dress and music.<br><br>Finally, the standard fantasy universe is also, when you think about it, a post-collapse society, for of course vast armies of workers and a bygone empire of wealth had to build those now-ruined castles that Dungeons and Dragons parties explore or through which Aragorn leads the Hobbits.<br><br>All those things actually go hand in hand, for the traditional Ireland that Americans so sentimentalise was a post-collapse world, coming generations after the population crash of the Famine. I wrote an article about this a few years back, reprinted here: http://restoringmayberry.blogspot.ie/2014/03/osterity.html<br><br>When I give talks about a declining-energy future, I find this a useful thing to point out; the Shire is not the worst place to live. It's a sentimental version of agrarian life, to be sure, and I hope we preserve some higher level of technology than hobbits had -- and with as little hardship as possible on the way there. Nonetheless, I find people appreciate some healthier vision of post-decline life than the usual Zombie Apocalypse stories.<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c3545124559498032316 title="comment permalink">4/24/14, 9:03 AM</a><br><br>

I do wonder though what Radagast's advice might be to the young Took if he didn't know yet where the Ring was. It could still be waiting where Frodo dropped it in which case there's still time and hope; it could just as easily have been snatched up by Gollum, or by a Ringwraith in which case Middle Earth faces at best the darkness of the Second Age, at worst the doom that beset Numenor ten fold. That world wouldn't be a world without hope, but it would certainly not be a place for a Hobbit.<br><br>Not all shires can be saved, and we have no way to know where or when the worst of the crises of our age are going to take their toll.

How did you know most of your readers are avid Tolkien fans? It had a profound effect on me in High School when I read "Lord of the Rings" in the 1970s. I was actually captivated by the final story, the one not included in the film version (I guess it was too anti-climatic for a heroic epic) which seemed to me at the time to serve as an apt metaphor for what I was experiencing in post-war, suburban America. I'm refering, of course, to when the Hobbits return home, after destroying the ring of power and defeating Sauron's armies, back to the Shire only to find it occupied by Saruman and his remaining army of Orcs, who cut down all the trees, poisoned the environment and enslaved all the hobbits. It reminded me so much of what I could plainly see all around me, with the "greatest generation", high on victory, (having defeated Sauron/Hitler in Europe) beginning the project of transforming the landscape at home, i.e. building the suburbs, the highways, the strip malls, etc... you know, the sorry state of affairs we see everywhere now. Even as a kid I recognized the spiritual pall that had descended on the US/Shire, as I witnessed the destruction of everything I considered beautiful-from gorgeous 19th century buildings and homes to old farms, woods, prairies and wetlands, replaced by soul-numbing slabs of concrete and all in the name of "progress". Thanks to Tolkien though, I saw Saruman at work everywhere and resolved to fight this evil the rest of my life, which began with me and my brother pulling up surveying sticks in the forest of the Ents(slated for a shopping mall) in the wee hours of the morning. Of course I'm not as naïve as I was in those days, but in a way I'm still pulling up surveying sticks, trying to hold off the destruction of Middle Earth until reinforcements arrive. Thanks again John for all the work that you do!<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c8363665022885462181 title="comment permalink">4/24/14, 9:26 AM</a><br><br>

As a direct result, the nonrenewable resources that might have supported the transition to a sustainable future went instead to fuel one last orgy of wretched excess.

It was just what the Dr. ordered. You told me last week not to confuse grief and despair, that despair was the conviction that there was nothing worth saving. That makes sense. Perhaps it is also the idea that nothing CAN be saved. I struggle with that from time to time.<br><br>I know that it can be hard for some folks to have faith that much can still be saved. I wonder if part of the trick is to just pretend a bit, to act AS IF things can still be saved, even if you worry they may not be. <br><br>My big brother read LOTR to me when I was little. He was four years older than me, and was the resident scholar on Middle Earth and the Elder Days. I can remember asking him, "but what happened to Radagast?" Your mention of him brought back such fond memories. Thanks.<br><br>I wonder what happens to Sam and Merry and Pip in your narrative. Surely Sam married Rosie. They had a brood of kids, he expanded his gardening business and the tavern, and Miss Rosie would have none of it when he suggested that he take the Ring. He had Obligations after all. There were apprenticeships to arrange for the oldest boy, and just how exactly would Rosie make the loan payments on the Tavern expansion if he went off into the Blue? The prospect of divorce proceedings at Michael Delving was less than appealing.<br><br>Merry might have founded himself a Lifeboat Hermitage in the Old Forest from whence he fired off letters to the local paper warning of the impending Doom. He became more and more isolated as the locals shook there heads and forbade their children to associate with him. "And we thought Mad Baggins was cracked", they would say. Finally the paper began to return his letters, unopened. He was found dead of liver cirrhosis. Only four people attended his funeral.<br><br>Pippin went into politics, thinking he could change the System from within. In order to wind his election as Mayor, he was impelled to accept monies from Sandyman and the heirs of the Old Winyards and the Leaf interests of the Southfarthing. When he came up with a Grand Plan to destroy the Ring, it was made clear that his radical ideas would cost jobs, and impact the economy. Faced with the prospect of a smear campaign and a brutal election, he charted the safe course, and appointed a commission to study the potential danger the Ring might pose. The consensus was that it should be displayed at the Mathom House. The additional revenues from admission would surely offset the mounting pension costs of retired Shirrifs and Bounders, which were taking a larger and larger share of the Shire's budget each year.<br><br>And then silly old Radagast shows up with his birds and mice!

"The Hunger Games," a thinly-disguised critique of the American Empire, is a case in point. As are the book/movie "Divergent," and the TV series "Revolution" and "Continuum," to name just a few. And I think that the huge popularity of video games is due to an innate hunger in humankind to be tested, to discover our own capacity for strength and courage, and to answer the call to adventure. I am optimistic that as things get tougher, more and more people will answer that call with inner reserves they never knew they had. I am also realistic enough to know that there will be those who respond in entirely negative ways.

What I struggle with is imagining the alternate history of our own planet if somehow the US had successfully become a conserver society beginning, say, with Carter's election in 1976, and Reagan had never swept into power. You often cite this period as a turning point in history. Wouldn't another nation have moved into the power vacuum, ascended to empire, and seized a comparable share of the world's energy and resources to what the US currently disposes of? Wasn't there an unspoken assumption in the Thatcher/Reagan moment of the Cold War that, if the US and its allies didn't pick the fruits of global hegemony, someone else (the USSR, China) would? Was it not inevitable that the globe would be driven to Hubbert's peak some time in the early twenty-first century?<br><br>How much better would our current prospects be as a nation if we had simply ended our relentless drive to global hegemony? How much better the prospects of industrial civilization around the globe? From a climate standpoint we would be just as fracked if others had burned all that oil instead of us. Do you think the US could have dodged the Long Descent if we had made better choices, or that we would simply have arrived at the bottom in a less bedraggled state?<br><br>I pose the question not to excuse my own actions at the time (I was born during Reagan's campaign for a second term) but out of a true fascination for the way things might have been. I also think my generation may be better able to forgive the baby boomers if we refuse to hate them for their fundamental, universal human weakness.

Putin is re-establishing a Russian sphere of influence to its west. That's a pretty normal state of affairs. Russia can pressure the EU with its military might and its control of part of Europe's fuel supply. He cannot parlay that into total domination unless the EU doesn't put up a fight. The EU has strengths of its own and once it realizes that the US isn't coming to the rescue, I expect some native resistance. <br><br>Control of the Ukraine is not a vital US interest; Obama has decided not to throw good money after bad. But if, as JMG said a month ago, the US's goal was to destabilize Ukraine rather than to control it, then the current situation is either a draw or a win for the US.<br><br>I disagree with your opinion that the Obama administration "make even Dubya and his handlers look like a model of professionalism and competence by comparison". Bush the Younger got the U.S. into a war of choice that was won quickly and with minimal US casualties by the then-excellent conventional forces of the Army and Air Force. Bush threw away this victory by outsourcing the occupation of Iraq to crony capitalists whose entire motivation was to make obscene profits from government contracts. These interests had no care for the people of Iraq, its survival as a nation state, or the welfare of the United States of America.<br><br>Bush's botched occupation lasted about as long as the Vietnam War and has done equal damage to the morale and effectiveness of the US Army. While Obama hasn't done much that is useful, so far his mistakes aren't as spectacular as Bush's.

A variety of other reports in Western sources largely echo it. It does not contain any information saying that the ship's electronic defenses were disabled, but it does confirm that a Su-24 made 12 close, aggressive, low-altitude passes (within 1000 yards and at an altitude of 500 feet, but never directly overhead) as a second plane circled nearby, and that the ship left international waters and went directly to Romania afterward. It does claim that the ship was never in danger, but that's obvious because the Su-24s were unarmed. This occurred on April 12.<br><br>I have not found any sources without a clear Russian bias that confirmed that the Su-24 used the Khibiny electronic warfare system to disable the destroyer's radar and targeting systems, but then again I wouldn't expect the Pentagon to want us (or them) to know that either. I'll list that as "plausible but unconfirmed" for the moment. Either way, the Khibiny probably is capable of massive electronic disruption, based on previous tests.<br><br>The claimed letter of resignation from the crew is dubious - perhaps they lodged a complaint or report that was misinterpreted by the Russian media as this, or it could be a total fabrication.<br><br>http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=122052<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c2869927561338211975 title="comment permalink">4/24/14, 12:29 PM</a><br><br>

The story deserves some framing in the context of British class structures of the day, with historical antecedents in the 18thC and 19thC. <br>That would need an essay or three, but it probably goes without saying (I think one comment already points this out) that our society was marked not only by scary industrial wastelands but by a million dead in recent industrial warfare, the decline of Empire, and the dereliction of British farming especially in the 1920 - 30s. This was the time also of DH Lawrence, FR Leavis, and the American poet TS Eliot who took up his literary calling in London and in our haunted countryside.<br><br>Because British farming did not pay very well (we got cheap food ingredients from abroad that could be afforded by a very numerous low-income urban population) it followed that much of the rural scene was not very different from 19thC or even mediaeval times. Rural wages were at poverty levels. I can remember as a boy essentially Tudor rural slums in old Cities; for example a small area of Church-owned property next to Winchester Cathedral. Tewkesbury with its amazing Abbey, and others had similar pockets.<br> <br>Having said that, much of the countryside was incredibly beautiful in all its 18thC or earlier agrarian form – our poets were absolutely right, of course.<br><br> And the pubs could be of various magic – I could at that time have taken you, JMG, had you been old enough, to a rural pub not far from Glastonbury, where you could have felt at home in any of the preceding three centuries!<br> <br>I left the Shire for Scotland and the North, but it was chastening when I brought our children south and tried to find some of the old haunts. The petroleum age had worked its magic. <br><br>I did not mind lowly clerks and teachers capitalising on increased values of their houses near London and seeking to retire to places they had enjoyed on holiday as children. Ugly small bungalows had a certain authenticity. What was more startling was the removal of all the previous rural population from what had been lonely villages, and most original labourers’ cottages knocked together and transformed into incredibly expensive ‘rural’ properties by a mobile wealthy class. Think of our Prime Minister’s family, though I understand they have further up-scaled more than a bit. It can still look pretty, but it ain’t the same!<br><br>More about our loss of Ancient Woods and other rural assets beloved of the poets, I could make perhaps in another comment. (Chris Cherokee refers to our tiny fragments.) Suffice to say that most of the loss of the last 250 years occurred in my lifetime!<br><br>But not all is lost – come sip our beer and ponder with us our bewilderment among the electronics – you are more than welcome, magic and all :)<br>best<br>Phil<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c4765325820665384031 title="comment permalink">4/24/14, 2:19 PM</a><br><br>

I'll let my readers guess which one it is.<br><br>Yupped, fascinating. Well, as I've said more than once, I can only really speak to the American experience, having never lived anywhere else. <br><br>Zosima, neither you nor I nor all the readers of <i>The Archdruid Report</i> put together have any appreciable influence over who does or does not end up in a position of leadership -- nor, as Obama has demonstrated, do we have any way to know whether someone who campaigns talking about hope and change will turn around the moment he gets into office and give us eight more years of his predecessor's policies. That being the case, rather than putting your hopes on politicians and rich people, I suggest that turning off the tube, getting off the couch, and doing something about the crisis of our time is the better option. <br><br>Backfire, you can find the rules for the contest <a href=../../2014/01/return-of-space-bats.html rel=nofollow>in this post</a>. <br><br>Deserted, yes, I saw that. It's very much part of the beginning of rapid decline. <br><br>RPC, that makes sense to me. I don't think much of consumers, either!<br><br>Bill, Robinson Jeffers wrote some very good poems on that theme. I sometimes think he and Bombadil used to hang out together. <br><br>Dan, granted, the metaphor has its limits. I mostly wanted to talk about the psychology of refusing the call, anyway. <br><br>Adrian, true enough. There are many potential roles in this particular Fellowship!<br><br>Matt, depression has been recognized as an illness since the Middle Ages; the only thing that's changed is the terminology -- it used to be called "melancholy." That said, I'll accept your correction; alongside the ailments you've mentioned, there's also a very common syndrome we might as well call "my doctor wants the kickback he gets from the drug salesman when he prescribes this."<br><br>Richard, the green wizard thinks it's a very good idea. <br><br>Joe, one of the things I like about Tolkien as a source of metaphors here is that Frodo had no clear idea of what he was getting into when he headed out of Bag End that September evening.

Probably most importantly, Putin gets a huge popularity boost and shows that Russia is a great power again, thus more or less ending the national humiliation of Russia that started with the fall of the USSR. <br><br>On the Western side, the loss of territory will cause Ukraine to go from roughly 50-50 pro-Europe/pro-Russia to a strong pro-European majority. Ukraine will not come close to meeting EU membership criteria for a long time, but trade agreements could be worked out to let the European manufacturers to make use of a poor, low-wage country with a cooperative government and the added advantage of not having to transport the products long distances. Also, with the loss of its richer parts, Ukraine will be even more deeply impoverished and will accept whatever "structural adjustments" the IMF and World Bank choose to impose, allowing much of the country to be bought up by Westerners at fire-sale prices.<br><br>So I think we're going to see another Russian invasion to take Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Lugansk Oblasts, responded to by some more ineffective sanctions, minor troop movements, and strongly worded UN resolutions. Then things settle down and people get used to the new borders, while everything that isn't nailed down is sold and shipped off to Ukraine's new masters.<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c1727907919185143664 title="comment permalink">4/24/14, 6:27 PM</a><br><br>

It's those who crumple who will find them a long dark plunge into misery, ending in death. More on this in a future post. <br><br>Rich, one of these days I may have to sketch out an alternate history in which Ronald Reagan lost the 1980 election, and certain other shifts happened, leading America to plunge ahead down the road to a sustainable future. The question you've asked is the kind of thing that might best be explored that way. <br><br>Alan, I have no complaint, since you're actually out there doing things; as I've noted more than once, that's my touchstone. You choose where you make your stand. Mine is in a different place. <br><br>Cathy, the evangelical pseudoconservative movement is dying, and it's fairly common for dying pop spiritualities to get extreme in their last days. I wonder if it occurs to them that all they're doing is identifying themselves, in the eyes of their own children, as evil. <br><br>Grebulocities, it'll be interesting to see if anything else surfaces about the incident. <br><br>Ghung, no, he wouldn't get a pass.

I'll look forward to see what Brin himself has to say, if anything. <br><br>Bill, that's been my experience, too. I wonder how much of it is the unwillingness of Boomers to consider the possibility that other generations could make a better choice than they did. <br><br>Wadulisi, that's good enough to earn tonight's gold star. The sense of entitlement is a common habit of the privileged classes in imperial nations, and it quickly becomes a source of misery and disaster once the empire goes away, so yes, it's fair to compare it to the Ring. <br><br>Cherokee, your interesting news would make me pack up my gear and head for the Grey Havens pronto. Unsustainable housing bubble, check; absurd tribute demands (disguised as defense expenditures in this case), check; profiteering at the expense of the vulnerable, check. It's going to be a wild ride. <br><br>Grebulocities, to my mind it depends on whether Europe and the EU are willing to put up with the public perception that they've lost.

That's why it's crucial that we talk about it, learn from it, and draw the necessary conclusions from it, because it was in that time that nobody wants to talk about that our society chose its future. <br><br>SP, there were people predicting it in the 1970s, so your cynic in 1999 was behind the times. Still, you're right that it's not simply a matter of material excess and the end thereof; what happened was that a civilization copied Faust, sold its soul for wealth and power, and is trying to pretend that nothing is going to happen when the time is up and Mephistopheles comes to get his part of the bargain.<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c95961618480997808 title="comment permalink">4/24/14, 10:34 PM</a><br><br>

Meanwhile the Western-recognized Ukraine goes along with Western agendas, and since no voters will turn out in the east or Crimea, pro-Western politicians have a lock on the country. At the same time, deals with Russia for gas can still be made with payment via the IMF, keeping European gas flowing while also allowing the Europeans and other investors to buy up non-Russian Ukraine.<br><br>Post-Soviet Eastern Europe (incl. the Caucasus) seems to have a talent for freezing conflicts for years in this way - South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria, and Kosovo all claim independence without being recognized by all parties, but business of some sort continues among all of them and the neighboring states.

If a woman mates, she may become pregnant and the risks of childbirth loom, with no way out beyond a short period in which primitive methods of abortion may be effective. It's like being on a runaway horse, all you can do is hold on and pray for the best. So women's courage has to be of the keep on keeping on variety. The steady slog of daily work to feed, cloth, clean, etc, punctuated by the regular crisis of giving birth or the occasional crisis of sick child, dead mate, etc. Doesn't make for as good a story as killing orcs, does it?

I have one strip mounted over my ham radio desk, and it's enough to light to update the log book with, at about 12" distance. <br> <br>If you want efficient lighting, take a moment to think about what we USE lighting for: navigation (which way to the kitchen?), collision avoidance (how not to trip on the cat), and tasks (reading, writing, sewing, knitting, etc.) Sub-unity wattage is plenty, if it's in the right place.

In one sense, clearly, an exhortation to take up the heroic quest of a small, peace-loving creature who has a quiet longing for adventure... well, not your version. He's baasically a coward. Very well then.<br><br>But it is, in the terms to which our culture is disposed, even though there is a sort of consensus ignorance/denial, a time of Autumn in America, and the industrial world; and it is depressing, at least in the respect that people don't see it, that it still isn't clear yet - enough - the price in destruction as a result of concentrated power. <br><br>But the story is a poor allegory, for a few reasons... If it was a good allegory, all of Frodo's neighbors would have a ring of power too, and even if they chose to destroy it, they would by doing so merely expose themselves to the others.<br><br>What would be needed, in a situation where everyone holds a ring of power, of varying degrees of power, would be an agreement to have them all destroyed at the same time, so no one can keep one and turn it to control over the others.<br><br>And frankly, being made to feel guilty for not taking up Frodo's quest to finally once and for all dispose of these reifications of concentrated power just makes it more depressing. Because no one else is going to give up theirs.<br><br>It doesn't fit the heroic narrative (which it was a little confusing to find in this essay both derided and then employed), but it would have been better for Frodo to sit down, talk it out with Gandalf and others, smoke the pipe for awhile, wait for the ring's power to just fade away, since it's impossible to permanently enchant anything with such concentrated power, and begin the slow and stready grind of learning all the little hidden dimensions in the grass and trees and the various goodies of the hobbit garden.<br><br>Really, the answer to many of the problems at present is not heroic at all, it's quite mundane, unworthy of the old epic tale, as it were. That way of telling a story has run its course - overshot its course really. Nevertheless, the pressures of heroism are nearly inexhaustible: it just takes one jerk using a ring of power to spoil it for everyone.<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c2079345354562026022 title="comment permalink">4/25/14, 6:11 PM</a><br><br>

For me, it (yet again) virtually immortalizes (yet another facet of) the contributions to Earth's and its creatures' well-being embodied in your visionary thought and its humane expression.<br><br>Combined, last week's post and this one -- especially as topped off by the notation as regards a metaphorical multiplicity of rings, each to be handled as its own bearer judges best, has overcome my reticence and I will confess to having spent the last year enrolled in my own little quest: the pursuit of a masters program at a major NYC university, studying...sustainability management. <br><br>I well understand your antipathy to the university-industrial complex, and I imagine you might well be expected to impart reams of constructive criticism if I had the privilege of your mentorship -- not just for wasting precious time and energy at university, but also on account of what I plan to do with my degree. (In a word, my dream job is to become the general counsel of the New York Green Bank, which today is a fledgling, yet well-capitalized, public-private partnership vehicle aimed at accelerating the deployment of energy efficiency and clean energy in the state.) <br><br>From years of reading your work I believe you'd have plenty of reservations regarding any such undertaking -- which, after all, I recognize seeks to address the long descent from within the (by hypothesis, catabolically collapsing) imperial-age legal and financial construct.<br><br>And yet, I'm heartened enough to come out of the closet, so to speak, by your benediction on those of us who, while we do think we understand, and know we empathize with, your vision, nevertheless pursue such different paths as we do. Born and bred as I've been here in Gotham, green wizardry on the lower-energy, appropriate technology path just doesn't seem to be my strong suit right now and so I'm hoping I can make a difference here, in and from my own niche (which I readily admit is an object lesson in some of the absurdities of life in the flailing wealth pump's engine room).<br><br>Perhaps it's all just a form of refusing the call and clinging to the last splinters of a sinking ship. I'd welcome any feedback on that question. So while duly girding myself for any number of chastening observations about my choices, all of which hope to learn from if they come, I do wish to take the liberty of staking out my own small vision of what a worthwhile version of "ring-bearing" might look like -- if only for purposes of adding a small further measure of diversity to the rich tapestry of thought here among your readers. <br><br>I guess I'd also say it seems to me that the more confidently those of us out here reading your stuff can test our varied visions and versions of "ring-bearing" "out loud", in your forum or elsewhere, the faster the momentum may build in our own efforts to translate our variegated thoughts and reflections into effective change agency of whatever stripe.<br><br>Many thanks once again.<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c9094807396289584744 title="comment permalink">4/25/14, 6:36 PM</a><br><br>

There is no single theme, vampires or otherwise, that could be described as a massive or domineering presence. Vampires are only one of a long list of themes that come and go in cycles. That theme probably peaked when Buffy was on the air more than ten years ago. After that, the zombie apocalypse briefly surged into prominence. Now Hunger Games and Game of Thrones style fantasies are dominating. I can also assure you also that Tolkien is still very popular. Also, the astoundingly popular Harry Potter books, which featured magic and wizards, had their run. So as a fantasy fan, you should be very encouraged by American recent reading habits, right? <br><br>There is no dominant obsession, but rather a series of shifting themes. Diversity and segmentation would be the best terms to describe where the American reading population it at today. It would be hard to pull a collective monomyth out of all of that.<br><br>And at the movies - vampires? Hardly. More like an endless stream of increasingly indistinguishable comic book superhero adaptations.

As an interesting side note to you, I visited one of the historic hill station gardens up this way this morning (in the rain too).

I’d appreciate if you could have a discussion with them. It is my fault anyway because I took a short cut with the bushes earlier in the year which has proven to be disastrous for yields only because of predation.

No outsider ever does. Often even the insiders try very hard to keep from having any idea.<br><br>Seen from the inside, academia is a land of hustle and con from start to finish, with self-righteousness as frosting on the cake. [It was, of course, the never-ending quest for grant money that shaped its current form during my working lifetime, but something similar was in place as early as the 18th century.] Of course, all the hustle and con does bring about worth-while discoveries from time to time, just not as many as the hype would have it.<br><br>I'm no good whatever at either lying or unshakable certainty. That, and a low physiological tolerance for stress, is why I personally chose to be honest rather than crooked. I can't lie convincingly -- not even were it to save my life, or the lives of those I love. So I never was a very successful academic, as the academy measures success. I was just a good, competent scholar, which is something entirely different.<br><br>Yet of all the lessons I learned growing up, the ones that my grandparents' stories about their past taught me are among the most important of them all.<br><br>Here are their rules (put into my own words), for whatever value they may have for readers of this blog during the coming Dark Age:<br><br>(1) Never break the law if you can get the same result lawfully with a little more effort. They catch you by your laziness.<br><br>(2) Never break the law in the same way more than once. They catch you by your patterns (habits).<br><br>(3) Know to the thinness of a hair just how skillful you are at lawbreaking, and never overreach yourself in breaking the law. They catch you by your arrogance.<br><br>(4) Never ever break the law when you are impelled by strong emotions (fears or desires). Then you will overreach yourself and they will catch you!<br><br>I passed these rules on to my best and most trusted students whenever I thought they needed to hear them. It was one of my modest attempts to pay things forward.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Chris at Cherokee replied to me: "Unless "weeds" lay unseen, they rarely prosper in a highly over managed garden.

The yeast has been much improved by feeding it hand-ground wheat berries (now there's a chore), and the bread quality is improving, despite my taking no measurements beyond whether the dough is too tough to work or too wet (hey, pancakes!).

While that's possibly true in the case of Harry Potter and maybe a few other fantasy writers, I'm not sure it's true anymore with Tolkien. I think they now recognize Tolkien as some sort of Christian, after all, largely because of his longstanding friendship with Christian apologist and writer of Christian allegory C.S. Lewis. Of course it's true that they primarily see in both Lewis and Tolkien what they want to see; both are far more complex figures than they tend to give either credit for.

We've been taught to think of the Middle Ages (or any period before the invention of your favorite gadget) as joyless and dark, &amp; although the suffering quotient will get higher, some forms of suffering (like alienation for those who face up to things) will be less, and one may even experience profound joy and significance in saving what can be saved, &amp; in teaching others to think like this. This unexpected joy will likely be the foundation of a new religiousness and dogma, which in the West, will most easily happen by recovering the roots of real Christianity, rather than the fake, sentimental, intellectual kind which masquerades as neoliberalism, conservatism of the new variety, and a thousand other heresies.

One of those unpredictables is <i>exact timing</i> and here is an example. <br><br>Although we do not yet have a fracking bubble, we do have a big push to create one. If the US bubble bursts soon, the wind will go right out of the sails of those trying to create one here (sorry for mixed metaphor). But passively expecting an early pop cannot be relied on. Part of the reason there is no British fracking bubble is the cultural one of our planning regulations - which there is also a big push to de-fang - but another part of the reason might be that there is actual old-fashioned protest. This suggests to me that environmental protest (both polite and of the direct-action sort) <i>is</i> worth doing because it can <i>delay</i> destruction, <i>keep things from getting worse than they otherwise would be</i>. Our single Green MP (Westminster, that is - there are a few more in the Scottish and Welsh devolved assemblies) was arrested recently, with others, at a fracking protest. They were let off and I think I detect in the judge's careful remarks, a certain <i>resistance</i> to the bullying which their arrest amounted to.<br><br>I don't much like my own conclusions here - I'm not a direct action sort myself, nor am I keen on the bruising and frustrating realities of politics more generally - though at the very least there are some milder ways that I can add some support to environmental resistance. <br><br>Anyway, to tie this back into the wider issues of TAR, I would add the idea of "public resistance" to the large pile of "useful things waiting to be done, if they call to you and seem appropriate to your circumstances" - and the legalistic forms of resistance (actually using those planning regs) sit well with JMG's remarks about the skills needed for democracy. To tie this in to this week's article, it is a reminder that we still have long way to go for it to be "too late" to do something <i>useful</i> - there is almost always <i>something</i> that could make things a bit less bad than they would have been otherwise.<br><br>Now, of course, I have to think how this applies to <i>me</i>.<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c2369291761458462210 title="comment permalink">4/27/14, 3:49 AM</a><br><br>

But they do not see that the power of the ring also binds them, but more importantly that that power has limits which cannot be exceeded. It was a ring of power to be sure, just like Oil is to us, but it is not the only power in that/this world - if we fail to look, we will certainly fail to see. Even in Middle Earth there were other powers afoot.<br><br>What really irks me sometimes is that I really wish that there was someone I could seek for advice about how to live in this environment.

I live in a (mostly white) working class neighborhood. I see a lot of backyard gardens, people not owning cars and there is overall a conspicuous lack of conspicuous consumption.

In addition, being a hero in the service of something larger than oneself with potential next-life rewards feeds right back into some of the previous discussions of fascism and other movements. <br><br>This also has to do with my previous comment about Sam Gamgee. I know you thought Tolkien portrayed him in a stereotypical way. However, If you look beyond Tolkien's time- and culture-bound language, Sam could almost be seen as an anti-hero of sorts: not really taken in by grand language and visions, doing what is necessary to survive, and using what we might, in this forum, term green wizarding skills, at that. To me, his position relates to yours and Rita's comments regarding the difficulty of applying the standard heroic tropes to women's stories. Had Sam been somewhat different in character, or in a different situation he might have employed Robert Mathiesen's rules, as well.<br><br>As far as I can tell, much fantasy attempting to create a heroic model for women often builds on the male model. To me it seems--to Robert's point--that much of the future discussed here is likely to require anti-heroic skills and knowledge--yet just as much courage.<br><br>Where is the myth about the person who, not an acknowledged leader or old-style hero or someone with super powers, accomplishes a quest or goal by forging connections, by enabling people to work together to survive in adversity? <br><br>We are all ultimately alone in our personal quests, which is what the Cambell archetype is getting at. However, women are often the ones who "keep the family together," or carry on a culture while the heroes are off journeying and fighting. Penelope and Rosie the Riveter come to mind. That work needs to be brought out of the shadows and valorized in a way that makes it stand as worthy on its own as opposed to worthy because it supports the hero. I suppose that's why we have the phrase "unsung hero," now that I think of it.<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c6831372467923718527 title="comment permalink">4/27/14, 7:04 AM</a><br><br>

I have an increasing spinal deterioration that is definitely impacting my ability to garden or do other physical work – but I’m trying to 1) find ways to garden easier and 2) find what things I can do (like raising chickens). For example, if you found broccoli grew easily and you could put in a patch or two, you might trade it for other veggies.

As this thread has gone on, I've thought of more and more examples, from Egyptian mythology, to the great Athenian dramatists, through Shakespeare and Native Americans to fairy tales such as "East of the Sun, West of the Moon." <br><br>Perhaps some women are "closed," because they perceive the very unfortunate difference between the rich narratives in myths and stories and cultural expressions of said myths in which women's stories are devalued in relation to the larger culture. This, I believe, also holds true for many faith traditions (which serve as a repository and validation for myths, as has been discussed so frequently and well in this blog and forum). <br><br>For just one example, there is quite a difference between many of the stories that early judeao-christianity has to tell, and the way they get functionalized in the dogma and rituals, practices and beliefs of many Christian churches. (The Fall of Man is not really all Eve's fault.) My faith tradition, as does Druidry, affords full valorization of women and their stories/experiences/struggles, and my faith tradition's leaders (male and female) have gotten in a lot of trouble for this at various times. <br><br>I believe that perhaps many women who have objections are struggling against these tendencies in our mainstream American culture, which has been so dominated by stories that distort in so many cases what heroism is and who is heroic. The effects of this distortion can be seen throughout our popular culture, our media, even our "national narrative." What is the myth of progress, if not a story of heroism (as defined by our culture)--gone--as you have so helpfully pointed out--wrong?.<br><br>Also, in our modern American culture, much of the great mythology is lost. Many people are not exposed to the original sources, and have no chance to see the full range of human experience so well expressed.<br><br>I think I understand, and value the point made in this week's post regarding complacency, and the dangers that lie therein, along with the call to accept the necessary journey. This is important for everyone, regardless of gender, considering what the future likely holds in store. I would love to see a story with a similar point with a female-centered narrative, informed by the mythic tradition of women's quests. What would a woman's refusal look like? What would a woman's acceptance look like?<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c8710304882048431555 title="comment permalink">4/28/14, 7:20 PM</a><br><br>

I look forward to hearing about your experiences.<br><br>The serviceberry and chokeberry are available here as seeds, so it should be interesting, although I don't know how a chokeberry will cope with a hot and dry summer?<br><br>Currants both red and black are very hardy here and produce copious amounts of fruit without much effort. The Gooseberries are slightly less hardy but produce a nicer fruit that tastes like a table grape to me.<br><br>Chilean guava (ugni molinae) are worth growing too and they are hardy requiring next to no attention at all here.<br><br>Hi thrig,<br><br>Eggs will keep far longer than just a few days. Eggs have a protective coating on the outside of them which stops bacteria getting into the otherwise porous shell. My understanding is that commercial egg producers wash eggs - which removes this protective coating - and this allows bacteria to get into the contents. The reason they wash the eggs is remove all of the manure on the shell, but the old timers used to just gently brush the muck off the shell (I do here and only wash eggs when I’m gifting them).<br><br>Your mum is correct about the test too. They float because they have higher levels of gas inside the shell which is an indicator of bacterial action.<br><br>PS: Try to avoid eggs from sick chooks too.<br><br>Hi Robert,<br><br>It can be nicely summarised down to: "Don't get caught".

That question itself is a sheep in wolves clothing...<br><br>The short form is that with a few minor exceptions there are no fences here. The exceptions are: Strawberries, young fruit trees and chickens. Other than those all wildlife has free access to the farm.<br><br>I might have mentioned a few months back that there was a rat problem. An owl moves in and out of the place now and sorts the rats. There are some rats still there but not like the huge quantities of them in the bad old days.<br><br>The native herbivores (kangaroos, wombats and wallabies) keep the herbage down (which grows March to December) and browse the lower branches of the fruit trees. They turn it into manure and also bring seeds in from the surrounding area.<br><br>Rabbits are in the area, but they are food for eagles.<br><br>Foxes are run out of town by the dogs.<br><br>Small birds eat insects in the vegetables and herbs.<br><br>Larger native birds scratch through the herbage and bring fertility back up the hill. They also let out alerts when eagles or snakes are nearby.<br><br>Possums are food for the larger owls.<br><br>The tree frogs eat insects and spiders.<br><br>The interactions are complex. I fully expect about a quarter to a half of all produce here to be consumed by the wildlife and I'm watching closely to see who eats what, when and why. In response to that growing knowledge I then setup even more confusing systems for the animals based on what is and isn't working.<br><br>A fenced farm is actually an attempt to simplify a natural system which is an inherently complex beast. Think about the old timers hedge rows as a good example of an excellent system.<br><br>To give you a completely different perspective if the deer want to eat your garden if given the opportunity then who is on whose turf? As another perspective - and I'm a mostly vegetarian - those deer are moving protein snacks. If they come back consistently to places where they are being hunted then they are just plain hungry. Animals aren't stupid, they do get spear shy about places.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c3757332775356878089 title="comment permalink">4/29/14, 4:23 AM</a><br><br>

The twist in Tolkien is that the quest is to get rid of something that is attractive, dangerous, and hard to destroy.<br><br>An ancient evil being created a magic ring that controls a number of other magic rings and also has powers of its own. Being in possession of this ring has effects something like succumbing to a drug addiction. There is an initial rush of power and pleasure, followed by a gradual loss of mental and physical health and paranoia that everyone else is trying to steal the ring. The longer one is in possession of the ring, the more difficult it is to give up. It is so attractive that it almost never changes hands voluntarily.<br><br>In addition, the ring's maker is able to surveil its possessor from a distance and exert mental influence over her or him.<br><br>The ring's maker wants complete world domination, achieved through a combination of menaces, trickery and psychological warfare. In the Ring Trilogy, this domination is expressed in warfare and industrial scale ecological destruction of the mountaintop-removal kind.<br><br>Two threads of the plot: 1) a journey by a small and motley group to the one place on Middle Earth where the Ring can be destroyed; 2) efforts to get the many different cultures and species in Middle Earth to recognize their dire situation and set aside differences long enough to put up coordinated resistance to the evil plots of the Ring's ruler. The second thread is somewhat reminiscent of the run up to WWII done as a sword and sorcery novel. The first thread is timeless and has mostly to do with ordinary people rising to the occasion.<br> <br><br><br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c4256285331803830237 title="comment permalink">4/29/14, 11:46 AM</a><br><br>

Been so stinkin' busy with it being planting season around here that I barely have time to read my Green Wizardry book every night. <br><br>Deep mulch is working great in my arid climate. 8-10" of straw on my garden beds has brought forth an abundance of earthworms. I know it will probably bring an abundance of sow bugs and earwigs eventually, too, so I'll have to think about how to deal with them, but the mulch preserves moisture &amp; microbial life. Doing my best to build my wizardry skills &amp; love others' comments here re: their efforts.<br><br>On a side note, re: your comment, JMG, about how evangelical Christianity is dying (I might be mis-stating that a bit...can't remember exactly &amp; am in a bit of a rush), the Barna Group (does surveys for churches, non-profits, etc., pretty well-respected org) released results recently which showed that the percentage of adults who believe the Bible is basically just a book of stories written by men has risen by 10% in just the last three years (from 9% to now 19%). They now equal the %age of Biblical literalists (also 19%). That stopped me in my tracks. I am not a Christian, but the fact that 10% of the U.S. population can move that quickly on ANY issue seems to me to be a decisive indicator of a major change afoot. Also tells me something has to be driving that....<br><br>On one other side note, I watched a Nat'l Geographic special last night on the Dawn of the Maya, which details the first rise of the Mayan people (pre-Classical - around the time of Christ). What I found fascinating was the decline of their civilization. Basically, they mined and burnt so much lime (for the limestone on all their palaces for the elites) that they burned down thousands of acres of forest and changed the structure of the surrounding fertile march soils upon which they depended for their food. I'm not describing it well, but the parallels of short-term thinking and greed that result in destruction of the life-sustaining base(s) was shockingly similar to our own. Not that I expect those parallels surprise you, JMG.<br><br><br><a href=refusing-call-tale-rewritten.html#c3388731818365657778 title="comment permalink">4/30/14, 10:58 AM</a><br><br>
