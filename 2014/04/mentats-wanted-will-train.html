</xml><![endif]-->The theme of last week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>—the strategy of preserving or reviving technologies for the deindustrial future now, before the accelerating curve of decline makes that task more difficult than it already is—can be applied very broadly indeed. Just now, courtesy of the final blowoff of the age of cheap energy, we have relatively easy access to plenty of information about what worked in the past; some other resources are already becoming harder to get, but there’s still time and opportunity to accomplish a great deal. <br>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
I’ll be talking about some of the possibilities as we proceed, and with any luck, other people will get to work on projects of their own that I haven’t even thought of. This week, though, I want to take Gustav Erikson’s logic in a direction that probably would have made the old sea dog scratch his head in puzzlement, and talk about how a certain set of mostly forgotten techniques could be put back into use right now to meet a serious unmet need in contemporary American society. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
The unmet need I have in mind is unusually visible just now, courtesy of the recent crisis in the Ukraine. I don’t propose to get into the whys and wherefores of that crisis just now, except to note that since the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the small nations of eastern Europe have been grist between the spinning millstones of Russia and whichever great power dominates western Europe. It’s not a comfortable place to be; Timothy Snyder’s terse description of 20th century eastern Europe as “bloodlands” could be applied with equal force to any set of small nations squeezed between empires, and it would take quite a bit of unjustified faith in human goodness to think that the horrors of the last century have been safely consigned to the past. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
The issue I want to discuss, rather, has to do with the feckless American response to that crisis. Though I’m not greatly interested in joining the chorus of American antigovernment activists fawning around Vladimir Putin’s feet these days, it’s fair to say that he won this one. Russia’s actions caught the United States and EU off balance, secured the Russian navy’s access to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, and boosted Putin’s already substantial popularity at home. By contrast, Obama came across as amateurish and, worse, weak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When Obama announced that the US retaliation would consist of feeble sanctions against a few Russian banks and second-string politicians, the world rolled its eyes, and the Russian Duma passed a resolution scornfully requesting Obama to apply those same sanctions to every one of its members. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
As the crisis built, there was a great deal of talk in the media about Europe’s dependence on Russian natural gas, and the substantial influence over European politics that Russia has as a result of that unpalatable fact. It’s a major issue, and unlikely to go away any time soon; around a third of the natural gas that keeps Europeans from shivering in the dark each winter comes from Russian gas fields, and the Russian government has made no bones about the fact that it could just as well sell that gas to somebody to Russia’s south or east instead. It was in this context that American politicians and pundits started insisting at the top of their lungs that the United States had a secret weapon against the Sov—er, Russian threat: exports of abundant natural gas from America, which would replace Russian gas in Europe’s stoves, furnaces, and power plants. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
As Richard Heinberg pointed out trenchantly a few days back in <a href=http://www.resilience.org/stories/2014-03-27/export-stupidity>a typically spot-on essay</a>, there’s only one small problem with this cozy picture: the United States has no spare natural gas to export.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s <a href=http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n9180us1M.htm>a net <i>importer</i> of natural gas</a>, as it typically burns over a hundred billion more cubic feet of gas each month than it produces domestically.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What’s more, even according to <a href=http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/MT_naturalgas.cfm>the traditionally rose-colored forecasts issued by the EIA</a>, it’ll be 2020 at the earliest before the United States has any natural gas to spare for Europe’s needs. Those forecasts, by the way, blithely assume that the spike in gas production driven by the recent fracking bubble will just keep on levitating upwards for the foreseeable future; if this reminds you of the rhetoric surrounding tech stocks in the runup to 2000, housing prices in the runup to 2008, or equivalent phenomena in the history of any other speculative swindle you care to name, let’s just say you’re not alone. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
According to those forecasts that start from the annoying fact that the laws of physics and geology do actually apply to us, on the other hand, the fracking boom will be well into bust territory by 2020, and those promised torrents of natural gas that will allegedly free Europe from Russian influence will therefore never materialize at all. At the moment, furthermore, boasting about America’s alleged surplus of natural gas for export is particularly out of place, because US natural gas inventories currently in storage are <a href=http://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html>less than half their five-year average level for this time of year</a>, having dropped precipitously since December. Since all this is public information, we can be quite confident that the Russians are aware of it, and this may well explain some of the air of amused contempt with which Putin and his allies have responded to American attempts to rattle a saber that isn’t there. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
Any of the politicians and pundits who participated in that futile exercise could have found out the problems with their claim in maybe two minutes of internet time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Any of the reporters and editors who printed those claims at face value could have done the same thing. I suppose it’s possible that the whole thing was a breathtakingly cynical exercise of Goebbels’ “Big Lie” principle, intended to keep Americans from noticing that the Obama’s people armed themselves with popguns for a shootout at the OK Corral. I find this hard to believe, though, because the same kind of thinking—or, more precisely, nonthinking—is so common in America these days. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
It’s indicative that <a href=../../2014/03/american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html>my post here two weeks ago</a> brought in a bumper crop of the same kind of illogic. My post took on the popular habit of using the mantra “it’s different this time” to insist that the past has nothing to teach us about the present and the future. Every event, I pointed out, has some features that set it apart from others, and other features that it shares in common with others; pay attention to the common features and you can observe the repeating patterns, which can then be adjusted to take differences into account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Fixate on the differences and deny the common features, though, and you have no way to test your beliefs—which is great if you want to defend your beliefs against reasonable criticism, but not so useful if you want to make accurate predictions about where we’re headed. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
Did the critics of this post—and there were quite a few of them—challenge this argument, or even address it? Not in any of the peak oil websites I visited. What happened instead was that commenters brandished whatever claims about the future are dearest to their hearts and then said, in so many words, “It’s different this time”—as though that somehow answered me. It was quite an impressive example of sheer incantation, the sort of thing we saw not that long ago when Sarah Palin fans were trying to conjure crude oil into America’s depleted oilfields by chanting “Drill, baby, drill” over and over again. I honestly felt as though I’d somehow dozed off at the computer and slipped into a dream in which I was addressing an audience of sheep, who responded by bleating “But it’s different this ti-i-i-i-ime” in perfect unison.
</div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
A different mantra sung to the same bleat, so to speak, seems to have been behind the politicians and pundits, and all that nonexistent natural gas they thought was just waiting to be exported to Europe. The thoughtstopping phrase here is “America has abundant reserves of natural gas.” It will doubtless occur to many of my readers that this statement is true, at least for certain values of that nicely vague term “abundant,” just as it’s true that every historical event differs in at least some way from everything that’s happened in the past, and that an accelerated program of drilling can (and in fact did) increase US petroleum production by a certain amount, at least for a while. The fact that each of these statements is trivially true does not make any of them relevant. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
That is to say, a remarkably large number of Americans, including the leaders of our country and the movers and shakers of our public opinion, are so inept at the elementary skills of thinking that they can’t tell the difference between mouthing a platitude and having a clue. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
I suppose this shouldn’t surprise me as much as it does. For decades now, American public life has been dominated by thoughtstoppers of this kind—short, emotionally charged declarative sentences, some of them trivial, some of them incoherent, none of them relevant and all of them offered up as sound bites by politicians, pundits, and ordinary Americans alike, as though they meant something and proved something. The redoubtable H.L. Mencken, writing at a time when such things were not quite as universal in the American mass mind than they have become since then, called them “credos.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was an inspired borrowing from the Latin
<i>credo</i>, “I believe,” but its relevance extends far beyond the religious sphere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
Just as plenty of believing Americans in Mencken’s time liked to affirm their fervent faith in the doctrines of whatever church they attended without having the vaguest idea of what those doctrines actually meant, a far vaster number of Americans these days—religious, irreligious, antireligious, or concerned with nothing more supernatural than the apparent capacity of Lady Gaga’s endowments to defy the laws of gravity—gladly affirm any number of catchphrases about which they seem never to have entertained a single original thought. Those of my readers who have tried to talk about the future with their family and friends will be particularly familiar with the way this works; I’ve thought more than once of providing my readers with Bingo cards marked with the credos most commonly used to silence discussions of our future—“they’ll think of something,” “technology can solve any problem,” “the world’s going to end soon anyway,” “it’s different this time,” and so on—with some kind of prize for whoever fills theirs up first.</div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
The prevalence of credos, though, is only the most visible end of a culture of acquired stupidity that I’ve discussed here <a href=../../2011/08/twilight-of-meaning.html>in previous posts</a>, and Erik Lindberg has recently anatomized in <a href=http://transitionmilwaukee.org/profiles/blogs/the-future-of-an-illusion>a crisp and thoughtful blog post</a>. That habit of cultivated idiocy is a major contributor to the crisis of our age, but a crisis is always an opportunity, and with that in mind, I’d like to propose that it’s time for some of us, at least, to borrow a business model from the future, and start getting prepared for future job openings as mentats. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
In Frank Herbert’s iconic SF novel
<i>Dune</i>, as many of my readers will be aware, a revolt against computer technology centuries before the story opened led to a galaxywide ban on thinking machines—“Thou shalt not make a machine in the image of a human mind”—and a corresponding focus on developing human capacities instead of replacing them with hardware. The mentats were among the results: human beings trained from childhood to absorb, integrate, and synthesize information. Think of them as the opposite end of human potential from the sort of credo-muttering couch potatoes who seem to make up so much of the American population these days:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>ask a mentat if it really is different this time, and after he’s spent thirty seconds or so reviewing the entire published literature on the subject, he’ll give you a crisp first-approximation analysis explaining what’s different, what’s similar, which elements of each category are relevant to the situation, and what your best course of action would be in response. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
Now of course the training programs needed to get mentats to this level of function haven’t been invented yet, but the point still stands: people who know how to think, even at a less blinding pace than Herbert’s fictional characters manage, are going to be far better equipped to deal with a troubled future than those who haven’t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The industrial world has been conducting what amounts to a decades-long experiment to see whether computers can make human beings more intelligent, and the answer at this point is a pretty firm no. In particular, computers tend to empower decision makers without making them noticeably smarter, and the result by and large is that today’s leaders are able to make bad decisions more easily and efficiently than ever before. That is to say, machines can crunch data, but it takes a mind to turn data into information, and a well-trained and well-informed mind to refine information into wisdom. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
What makes a revival of the skills of thinking particularly tempting just now is that the bar is set so low. If you know how to follow an argument from its premises to its conclusion, recognize a dozen or so of the most common logical fallacies, and check the credentials of a purported fact, you’ve just left most Americans—including the leaders of our country and the movers and shakers of our public opinon—way back behind you in the dust. To that basic grounding in how to think, add a good general knowledge of history and culture and a few branches of useful knowledge in which you’ve put some systematic study, and you’re so far ahead of the pack that you might as well hang out your shingle as a mentat right away. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
Now of course it may be a while before there’s a job market for mentats—in the post-Roman world, it took several centuries for those people who preserved the considerable intellectual toolkit of the classical world to find a profitable economic niche, and that required them to <a href=../../2010/06/merlins-time.html>deck themselves out in tall hats with moons and stars on them</a>. In the interval before the market for wizards opens up again, though, there are solid advantages to be gained by the sort of job training I’ve outlined, unfolding from the fact that having mental skills that go beyond muttering credos makes it possible to make accurate predictions about the future that are considerably more accurate than the ones guiding most Americans today. .</div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
This has immediate practical value in all sorts of common, everyday situations these days. When all the people you know are rushing to sink every dollar they have in the speculative swindle du jour, for example, you’ll quickly recognize the obvious signs of a bubble in the offing, walk away, and keep your shirt while everyone else is losing theirs. When someone tries to tell you that you needn’t worry about energy costs or shortages because the latest piece of energy vaporware will surely solve all our problems, you’ll be prepared to ignore him and go ahead with insulating your attic, and when someone else insists that the Earth is sure to be vaporized any day now by whatever apocalypse happens to be fashionable that week, you’ll be equally prepared to ignore him and go ahead with digging the new garden bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
When the leaders of your country claim that an imaginary natural gas surplus slated to arrive six years from now will surely make Putin blink today, for that matter, you’ll draw the logical conclusion, and get ready for the economic and political impacts of another body blow to what’s left of America’s faltering global power and reputation. It may also occur to you—indeed, it may have done so already—that the handwaving about countering Russia is merely an excuse for building the infrastructure needed to export American natural gas to higher-paying global markets, which will send domestic gas prices soaring to stratospheric levels in the years ahead; this recognition might well inspire you to put a few extra inches of insulation up there in the attic, and get a backup heat source that doesn’t depend either on gas or on gas-fired grid electricity, so those soaring prices don’t have the chance to clobber you. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
If these far from inconsiderable benefits tempt you, dear reader, I’d like to offer you an exercise as the very first step in your mentat training.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The exercise is this: the next time you catch someone (or, better yet, yourself) uttering a familiar thoughtstopper about the future—“It’s different this time,” “They’ll think of something,” “There are no limits to what human beings can achieve,” “The United States has an abundant supply of natural gas,” or any of the other entries in the long and weary list of contemporary American credos—stop right there and <i>think about it</i>. Is the statement true? Is it relevant? Does it address the point under discussion?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Does the evidence that supports it, if any does, outweigh the evidence against it? Does it mean what the speaker thinks it means? Does it mean anything at all? </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>
There’s much more involved than this in learning how to think, of course, and down the road I propose to write a series of posts on the subject, using as raw material for exercises more of the popular idiocies behind which America tries to hide from the future. I would encourage all the readers of this blog to give this exercise a try, though. In an age of accelerating decline, the habit of letting arbitrary catchphrases replace actual thinking is a luxury that nobody can really afford, and those who cling to such things too tightly can expect to be blindsided by a future that has no interest in playing along with even the most fashionable credos. </div>
<div class=MsoPlainText>

In not unrelated news, I’m pleased to report that the School of Economic Science will be hosting a five week course in London on Economics, Energy and Environment, beginning April 29 of this year, based in part on ideas from my book <a href="http://www.newsociety.com/affil.mvc?Affil=ARCH&amp;Page=../Books/W/The-Wealth-of-Nature">The Wealth of Nature</a>. The course will finish up with a conference on June 1 at which, ahem, I’ll be one of the speakers. Details are at <a href=http://www.eeecourse.org/ >www.eeecourse.org</a>.</div>

Be that as it may, I do believe that there is a an enormous amount of human potential that could be levied at these problems if, as you posit, we are able to collectively break out of the rather silly notion that the planet is simply an overgrown oyster which we can scoop out in order to maintain the status quo, a status quo which is inexorably becoming less affluent then that of our folks.<br><br>I spent some time many years ago towing the conservative party line about limitless resources and waiting for my flying sports car to roll off the production line. It was only when I started wondering why so much of what I heard seemed diametrically opposed to what I observed in nature, I began my mentat exercises and broke with "the faith". It seems to me like a fairly simple equation that is given to over complication by those who want to confound us while they continue scooping out the oyster. The sad part to me is that in this country at least, as long as the road to Walmart is paved, most people won't worry about it. When that road ceases to be paved, it will already be to late to settle into the long descent.<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c274039594472877198 title="comment permalink">4/2/14, 5:58 PM</a><br><br>

What I've seen of the consequences of applying computers to thinking is parallel -- think of the almost visceral inability to think in terms of whole systems that we've seen here so often from the geekoisie!

This will make it extra easy to develop a case of collective amnesia, once the access to electronics becomes scarcer and a government has decided to reshape past History. But even on an individual level, the link to our past and future is some sort of spiritual need for humans.<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c3303592712207459310 title="comment permalink">4/2/14, 6:26 PM</a><br><br>

However, if anyone is interested in a discussion of energy transition, a podcast called "The Extra-Environmentalist" (where JMG has given interviews before) posted a nice audio discussion on that subject just a <a href=http://www.extraenvironmentalist.com/2014/03/31/episode-76-energy-slaves/ rel=nofollow>couple of days ago</a>.<br><br>JMG is in sparse company, but fortunately he is not the lone Diogenes attempting to fan the feeble spark of Western logical intelligence. This is not a bad place to start: "<a href=https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ rel=nofollow>Your Logical Fallacy Is</a>"<br><br>On the other hand, you can lead an American to logic, but you can't make him think. <br><br>I wonder just how much of this logical thought can really be learned from external teaching. At some level it has to be grasped internally, and used with personal judgment. For example, the above list of logical fallacies is great to have at one's fingertips, but I have also heard pseudo-intellectuals attempt to shout down more solid logical arguments by insisting, at great volume and repetition, that the opposing argument bears some passing resemblance to one of the well-known logical fallacies on the list. Michel de Montaigne is credited with the adage, "We can be smart with other men's knowledge but we cannot be wise with other men's wisdom." As Mr. Spock found out during numerous Star Trek episodes, logic itself is a tool which, in malicious hands, can be perverted and abused to support any position the speaker wishes. Logic itself does not help us evaluate the premises of a logical argument as worthy or unworthy.<br><br>Doctor Who: All elephants are pink, Nellie is an elephant, therefore Nellie is pink. Logical?<br><br>Davros (a nonhuman alien): Perfectly.<br><br>Doctor Who: You know what a human would say to that?<br><br>Davros: What?<br><br>Tyssan (a human passer-by): Elephants aren't pink.<br><br>Davros: Humans do not understand logic.<br><br>Pure Logic itself cannot help us make human judgments, such as what is "similar", what is "relevant", and what is "judicious". I hope some advice on those topics accompanies your course on logic!<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c3755982732095969332 title="comment permalink">4/2/14, 6:31 PM</a><br><br>

The inability for the average American to face reality - to think critically about our world and our country's place in it - has been attributed to many culprits, it has been blamed on everything from the increasingly rotten educational system to the corporate media to a cowardly inability on the part of the average person to deal with hard, unpleasant truths. Of course all of these things play a part in our current platitude-riddled predicament, but in my view the constant distractions of everyday life are also a major source of the problem. Case in point: I happened to read this latest blog entry about five minutes after JMG posted it, but that was now one hour and ten minutes ago. It has taken me this long to write even these meager few sentences because of my inability to concentrate. I'm at my office right now, and even though it's the end of the day and things are slowing down that has not stopped my cell phone from ringing. It has not stopped my e-mail from pinging with new messages. It has not stopped notifications about how this other player has attacked me in a Facebook game I play (all too much, I'm sorry to admit). And these are just the electronic distractions, I've also been stymied by in-person interruptions from co-workers and the office phone. Add to this the fact that I am so wound up from the past ten hours of work that concentration is almost impossible unless I walk away and try to organize my thoughts.<br><br>I mean this kind of thing is common. People in this society have lost the ability to focus on one task, to concentrate on one thing. I notice - on a fairly regular basis - that I am turning in shoddy work on many of my endeavors, and when I can I really have to force myself to go back and do better. Last night I had to write a biography of myself for the website of a business I am associated with, and even though I obviously knew the topic intimately I ended up turning in a shoddy draft because I had so little time to really concentrate on it. All that this technology does is make you try and do everything at once, and it makes other people expect you to do everything at once. <br><br>Going back to the critical thinking aspect - I am trying my best to at least to make a coherent point here despite my mental exhaustion - I think that a lot of these "thoughtstoppers" as you call them serve multiple functions. Obviously they provide psychological comfort but they also provide an accessible, pre-packaged viewpoint that is much easier for the mentally harried to latch onto in a world where sustained thought and reflection are rare luxuries.<br><br>On a final note, this little response of mine is quite short, yet it has taken me a full hour and a half to compose thanks to the distractions I referenced at the beginning.<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c4434241561665467243 title="comment permalink">4/2/14, 6:48 PM</a><br><br>

This is almost always followed by an assertion of how a person or organization is going to behave in some way that seems entirely common-sensical but is almost always false. I learned this one working for a startup where the boss would trot this phrase out. It's a form of self-blinding.<br><br>On the topic of what our leadership really believes: You often assert that they are, as a group, as dumbed-down as the average American appears to be. But is this true? Do you have evidence of this?<br>There's an alternative theory, that most of them mostly understand what is going on and where the world is headed. They just don't care, because they don't think it will affect them personally; and for at least some of them, they would <i>prefer</i> to be lords of some future industrial feudalism rather than merely very rich citizens of a theoretical democracy. Their rhetoric is exactly what you would expect in this case - it's red meat for the plebs, but they (again, mostly) don't believe it, or at least don't believe most of it. (This isn't to say that they are NOT deluded about the future. Just that their actual delusions are different from the delusions they project in their public speech.)<br><br>For myself, I go back and forth all the time. I feel like I really don't have enough evidence to settle on one point of view rather than the other. Both interpretations seem to fit the facts. And while I can infer that the average American really IS that dumb, based on what I see in mainstream media, I have no equivalent insight into the minds of the elite. I have only what they say publicly, and I don't know any of them personally. So I'm left with a big data gap in my model of the future.<br><br>You seem to have persuaded yourself that your interpretation is the correct one.

It's crucial for my own essays on decline, education &amp; job training I've been writing. In his work "The Vineyard of the Text" a commentary on Hugh of St. Victor's Didascalion there is much to be gleaned from any aspiring mentat. Hugh required his students, as recorded in the Didascalion, to First be versed in the Art of Memory, Before they were even to begin learning the seven liberal arts. Pretty sweet mentat stuff.<br><br>Hugh's version of a memory palace I find to be fascinating in regards to the present human predicament. He used the image of an ark, as in Noah's, instead of the traditional building or theatre. Of course the word archive is related to the word ark. With the ongoing rise of sea levels -and an attendant golden age of sail- the use of an ark as a repository for a mentats inner library fitting. <br><br>Last week in the comments you asked if I was interested in getting into distillation. My answer is I am interested in distilling the contents of all the reading I've been doing as a library worker -and perhaps preparing myself for a future as a mentat.

In-put being from hay, grain and bedding for the boarded horses, manure and bedding being taken out to pasture and spread on top of the ground. Once grass is up, (a natural selection by exposure to soil and irrigation) cattle is grazed on it, (used for cow penning), which is followed by chickens to scratch and mix manure into the soil. Then mowed for weed control, irrigated to grow grass and after recovery horses turned out on it (without the threat of persistant parasites since cows and horses don't share the same ones), and then cows turned back out on it, (rinse and repeat). The cows eventually sold for grass fed beef and the chickens and eggs from pasture fed birds.

That's a good and very important point. <br><br>Thomas, that's a good example. The passing human was using a very simple form of the scientific method to check the consequences of a logical argument against experience -- a crucial skill, and one that's very carefully neglected these days. <br><br>Unknown Jay, it's a waste of time trying to get people to listen unless they're already prepared to do so. Leading by example is one of the best ways around that. <br><br>Pongo, and one of the important aspects of mentat training will thus consist of knowing how to turn off the cell phone (or not have one in the first place), shut down the other sources of noise, and establish a personal space in which thinking can happen. <br><br>Sarah, I just clicked on it and it appears to work -- try refreshing your browser and giving it another shot. <br><br>GreenEngineer, there are a number of reasons why I don't believe that the current US political class understands what's going on and is being Machiavellian about it all. The most important, though, is that the policies they're pursuing are wrecking the system that gives them their power and influence. Lacking a viable US economy and polity, they're just another set of clueless suits -- and the actions they're taking are driving the collapse of our economy and polity, not into anything they might be able to dominate. (Lesson #1 of emergent feudalism, btw, is that the people who run things aren't the holders of abstract wealth from the former imperial society, but the people with weapons who cut the throats of the holders of abstract wealth and scoop the pot for themselves. We'll talk more about this in the upcoming series of posts.)<br><br>Dan, of course some collapses are rougher than others; some regions have a rougher time in any given collapse than others, for that matter, and so on down the range of potential variation. The claim I object to is the one that insists that because some collapses are rougher than others, we're all certain to croak by next Thursday at the latest. <br><br>Shane, I ain't arguing.

I love Dune and have been thinking along the same lines for a while now. I have four things to say about it:<br><br>1. Gray's Law applies here with our leadership. "Any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice." When a man is driving your car off a cliff, there's not much point in debating whether he means ill or not - just get out of the dang car. I couldn't say what their intentions are, but I can certainly see that it's a long way down.<br><br>2. I think I was about 19 when it finally hit me that everyone I knew was parroting what some particular authority told them. Usually it was the TV, and usually it was verbatim. When pressed beyond the soundbite, they had perhaps a single sentence to back their thinking up, after which their argument collapsed and they became uncomfortable with the conversation. I think it took another year or two before I could really take that in. <br><br>I'm pretty sure the main reason I wasn't doing the same thing was that I'd been knee-deep in Aquinas, Augustine and Plato for years by that point. I'd read others, some quite talented, but overall I think the others are wrong. :) I'll spare you the details. My main point is simply that a background in real philosophy is almost a necessity for deep thinking. And heck, even if we were miraculously spared by some deus ex machina at this point like cold fusion, these mentat skills will still be useful as the world tends toward greater specialization for most workers.<br><br>3. I've seen many people bring up these issues before, and I've noticed a theme - they universally speak of modern man as being dumbed down. This may well be true; being young, I have no first-hand experience on it. But I do believe, at the risk of sounding like an elitist snob, that the majority of humanity in every society and time has done exactly what Americans do now.<br><br>Was there <i>ever</i> a time when the average joe wasn't just focused on the day's work, didn't think much about deep subjects, and just listened to what his father/king/priest told him? It seems to me that this is just how the world is. Most people are, for lack of a better term, peasantry, and there's nothing wrong with it. <br><br>Depending on the civilization, the deep thinkers become noblemen, mayors, feudal lords, philosophers, generals, scientists, or Wall Street scam artists. Wouldn't it be more accurate to say that our leadership has failed the people, that it's not that we have a set of leaders but that we simply have the wrong ones? Democracy, in any true sense, has never really existed to my mind.<br><br>4. I bought Green Wizardry as part of my training. My wife and I are putting a great deal of it into practice this spring. So thanks!<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c8456457973266583473 title="comment permalink">4/2/14, 10:51 PM</a><br><br>

I want to do the sequence on dark ages first, and then we can start talking about what the monks and mentats will be teaching in their schools. <br><br>Ruben, excellent advice.

I'm barred from any role in founding the Bene Gesserit by possession of a Y chromosome, but if the ladies want to get working on it, I'll cheer. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, I did the same thing with real estate, the other way around. My wife and I stayed completely out of the real estate market until 2009, when prices had crashed good and proper but credit could still be had, and snapped up our current house for an absurdly small sum. Having a clue really does help!<br><br>Kyle, I do indeed. I read the <i>Illuminatus!</i> trilogy when it was first published, in fact; despite a certain tendency to take Leary's acid trips a little too seriously, Wilson's stuff is worth reading. <br><br>John, you get a gold star and advanced placement in mentat training for that.

As a Central European, I am glad you mentioned us being grist between the millstones. In the recent short period post 1989, it was easy to forget the millstones for a while. It was possible to maintain the illusion that this age is about (re)integrating with the expanded West and eventually keeping up with their level of consumption. That despite the fact that we essentially became a source of cheap labor force and a new market to dump western trash to. Also, we got to decimate our defense in favor of some few elite colonial units which we sent to places like Afghanistan. Now that more and more people wake up to the fact of having become a sort of soft-core colony and that the desired western-level consumption will never materialize (actually, it might, the west will decline to our level at some point:-), some are tempted to cheer at Putins middle finger towards the West. It is here the analogy to the millstone comes in handy. In the approaching age of what you termed as scarcity industrialism, what will remain of the big powers will be even more ruthless in pursuit of securing their power or remaining resource base. If we ever need help from the West, we will be conveniently dumped and forgotten, just as it happened many times in the past. So the western millstone will tend to ignore and abuse, but that does not make the prospect of embracing the Russian bear anymore attractive. The Central and Eastern European nations need to unite on some level and defend themselves together so that the already begun descent won't be such a turmoil as Ukraine. Oh well, dream on….<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c4801542627926516722 title="comment permalink">4/2/14, 11:57 PM</a><br><br>

To the extent that we move away from the isolating  and disconnecting hubristic effects of access to vast amounts of concentrated energy , we may get on with this business of being "planet stuff" and assist our vast being with retaining its integrity , rather than being like a comical , annoying little gnat  that is the tail mistaking itself for the dog...<br>Or....

I listened carefully to what several former opponents of nuclear power had to say, and concluded that their points of view were legitimate except for a nagging fact that was not mentioned - that industrial civilization itself is going to decline severely during the next several decades, and as a result the infrastructure necessary for the construction, operation and maintenance of enormous new power plants might not be there.<br><br>Those familiar with finance would probably mention that the capital to build large nuclear power plants is not going to be there either.<br><br>Those familiar with Peak Oil arguments would mention that all of industrial civilization, nuclear power included, is based on the availability of reasonably cheap fossil fuels, particularly oil. As those non-renewable fuels decline in availability, nearly all large-sized construction projects will gradually be abandoned. James Howard Kunstler might use such an argument.<br><br>Maybe there are other pertinent arguments against nuclear power (health issues, nuclear waste disposal problems, mining hazards for uranium, safety, etc.). The subject matter is interesting enough that you might feel inclined to weigh in on the matter at some point.<br><br>The "it's different this time" theme can be applied in this case, although not easily. The principle I would suggest (care of Chalmers Johnson) is that empires in decline invariably hasten their downfall by investing in projects too elaborate and costly in comparison to their value to the citizenry. The suggestion to build a series of new-fangled nuclear power plants (based on thorium, cooled by liquid sodium, etc.) is just another example of the pathological grandiosity which often accompanies the decline of an empire.<br><br>As Joseph Tainter might say, there are few if any declining civilizations that prudently downsize, simplify, or make a transition away from giant projects and towards smaller, simpler ones.<br><br>This simplification is what we need of course, but there is obviously no large movement in favor of disconnecting from the electric grid, joining eco-villages, giving away various electrical appliances or seeking a lifestyle that does not require an automobile.<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c7446210187405108507 title="comment permalink">4/3/14, 2:40 AM</a><br><br>

They wanted to oust democratically elected Yanukovitsh from the power and bring in more Western-oriented government. Desire for this action is no surprise, because Russia contained Western interests in Syria quite succesfully, and troops of Syrian government have made steady progress in the civil war during last two years. In Syria Russia prevented military operation against Assad government, but allowed Obama to save his face by letting him lead dearmament of chemical weapons in the country. That was wise move, because it's plain stupid thing to unnecessary make realm as mighty as US angry. <br><br>But West wanted to get even.Who can blame them?<br><br>Timing of Maidan operation was brilliant. It started practically simultaneously with Winter Olympics in Russia, making it extremely costly in the PR sense for Russia to intervene. And persons behind these calculations were right. There was no mentionable response during the Games. But after that, it seems that professionality and pure speed of Russian takeover of Crimea took Western intelligence agencies by surprise. That was excellent military operation indeed. It was fast, clean and almost bloodless. Disclipine level of Russian troops involved was astonishing, when compared to troops sent into First Chechen war at 90's. They have learned their lessons fast in the Krasnaya Armiya.<br><br>On the other hand, speed of Ukrainian mobilization was very slow. It took 4 days from them to get Zaporoszhe motorized artillery on the road. It took at least one week before Kiev government could announce that they had 60 000 men at arms, and only fraction of those were combat ready. Over half of Ukrainian army was situated at Crimea, and from those troops over half changed sides, including elite Ukrainian marine brigade. Russian sources claim that only 11 % of Ukrainian troops at Crimea chose to leave, while all the rest either defected or demilitarized. It seems that Ukrainian armed forces have not get rid of problems left behind by Soviet collapse, from which their Russian counterpart suffered also many years. <br><br>One remarkable aspect of this crisis of eastern Europe is the rise of paramilitaries. They have operated everywhere, from Crimea to Kiev, with close collision with more official forces. For example, during early days of crisis, temporary interior minister of Ukraine gave paramilitary groups of Right Sector right to patrol streets of West Ukraine. It was remarkable that those troops used as their arm band yellow cloth with inverted ”wolf fishing rod” symbol in it. I do not know it's actual English name, but in German it's called ”auf Wolfsangel”. Symbol has quite deep history behind it, and all of that history is not very nice. From paramilitaries with policing rights, using it was quite strong statement. On the other hand, ethnic Russians of East Ukraine formed their own paramilitaries, so who am I to blame anyone....<br><br>This bond between unofficial grassroots organizations of football firms of eastern Europe and paramilitary activity seems to get stronger also, week after week. Russians are paying back now, like recent burning of German national flag by Petrograd Zenit ultras during match against Borussia Dortmund shows. Last time there was this much nationalist zeal sloshing around football terraces of eastern Europe it was ultras of Belgrad Crevna Zvezda fighting now legendary battles against ultras of Zagreb Dynamo. For a while after that ultra boys of mentioned Serbian football club organized under man called by his Turkish nickname, Arkan, and formed one of the most feared paramilitaries of Yugoslavian civil war, called Arkan's Tigers. Boys in the other side of the fence were also called to arms. <br><br>History have tendency to repeat itself.<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c5864872282662306210 title="comment permalink">4/3/14, 7:24 AM</a><br><br>

Thanks for the effort and clear thoughts.<br><br>My input. For the past 17 years I taught, off and on, grades 5-12...most subjects. I was hired to teach shop but moved around when I became bored. The last few years before I retired was spent teaching at a high school that drew from a variety of sources; from poor parts of town, from upper-end French immersion type families, and from various gulf islands.... some of which were quite remote. When I started in 94 I had to insist one paper a year was based on internet research. When I quit a few years ago I had to expend huge reserves of energy and frustration to get sstudents to put down their phones, get off google, and think for themselves. It drove me crazy. The kids with fancy smart phones and huge grade expectations were average at best. The students from the remote islands had a great work ethic, could figure things out on their own, and often were quite brilliant having been raised by folks who long since dropped out of modern culture. I had parents come to see me when making a 'town run' and they were consumed with life and their projects; everything from home hydro projects to making bio-diesel. They often had children who were not only capable and able, they were the first to join the acting club and band. Many of these familes were off-grid homesteader types. Their knowledge and experience was both inspiring and daunting. Their families seemed old fashioned and 'healthy'.<br><br>My point is this. In this short version of my watching society's children become 'computerized', I could/can easily see the dumbing down of almost all. Most of the survivors, who retained imagination and work ethic, came from what was thought to be unconventional and/or disadvantaged circumstances. <br>I think many will do well with a future step down from our 'liberating technology'. It will free us by forcing people to do and think for themselves.<br><br>By the way, we relocated to a remote valley some 10 years ago and have never looked back. For now, cell phones don't work here. For now.<br><br>regards...Paulo<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c6002708873058167790 title="comment permalink">4/3/14, 7:28 AM</a><br><br>

If one can afford private security, public safety is of no concern; if one owns a Gulfstream jet, crumbling bridges cause less apprehension—and viable public transportation doesn’t even show up on the radar screen. With private doctors on call and a chartered plane to get to the Mayo Clinic, why worry about Medicare?"<br><br>It says something when two authors with as different political views as Taibbi and Lofgren are on the same page when it comes to the global rich.

Like many <br><br>here, I have tried to raise those facts with otherwise rational and <br><br>well meaning people and the response hasn't even been as elevated as <br><br>"it's different this time." It has largely been complete denial that <br><br>facts have any bearing on the situation. This morning I read an <br><br>article on BBC which referenced possible "increases in US energy <br><br>production by 2030 changing the global balance of power" (actually <br><br>2035, but I'll use the voguish date) and I felt as though I had been <br><br>reincarnated in a dismal alternate universe.<br><br>Ignorance is generally a neutral term, defined as lack of knowledge <br><br>or information on a particular subject. I was largely ignorant about <br><br>peak oil and climate change issues until 5 or 6 years ago, simply <br><br>because I had never sought to become informed on those issues. As <br><br>you and others point out, we do live in a golden age of information <br><br>access, and ignorance is now largely a choice if you have access to <br><br>the internet. I am ignorant of how to perform actual scientific <br><br>research in a particular field (such as CO2/methane release by <br><br>melting permafrost) but I am familiar with the principles behind <br><br>scientific study. What I seem to be seeing more and more is people <br><br>who may not be familiar with a subject (scientific research) simply <br><br>excluding anything flowing from it. I think I understand why a <br><br>radical religious fundamentalist movement - for example, Boko Haram <br><br>("Western Education is Sinful or No Western Knowledge") can arise in <br><br>a poor and exploited corner of the world.

When I was in College I wanted nothing more than to work in a school for advanced thinking. This blog and the discussion forum that follows it functions as such a school in many senses. Correspondence course online, and its free; though I try to buy as many books as my budget will support to balance that scale, Green Wizardry is going to be ordered today. The ongoing conversation here is a paradigm for ongoing conversation that local intellectual traditions might be inspired by and, by virtue of physical nearness of membership, aspire to supplement with practical projects. I hope Green Wizardry will provide as much support toward that goal as the other books I have acquired have.<br><br>As far as mentat training goes I want to recommend a serious study of Logic. I took two semesters of Formal Logic in school, and subsequently was the student aid for two more semesters. In retrospect it is the experience from college I most value, and it was more difficult than any other class I took. Professor Trelogan was a firm believer that every major, including philosophy, needed a course which would sift out the non hackers. Of 23 students in the first semester I was one of three to pass and one of two to take second semester. The most useful training were the arts of derivation and translation. Learning syllogistic logic is also very useful, and I recommend Lewis Carol as a gifted writer on logic generally. I takes a lot of patience, creativity, and precision to solve many derivation problems. And translation? extremely difficult in some cases! But translation makes the structure of narratives (of absence of structure) pop quite effectively. <br><br>http://www.unco.edu/philosophy/Interactive/dailytranslation.html is a good source of translation problems to practice with. Be careful sometimes there are trick sentences which cannot be translated into the formal system.<br><br>On the practical side of getting a job as a mentat I have found inspiration in the writing of Benjamin Franklin. His autobiography is very fun to read and has useful advice on how to get work as a thinker. http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/148/pg148.html<br><br>The section that has most inspired my current tact is as follows.<br><br>"...it was, therefore, every one's interest to be virtuous who wish'd to be happy even in this world; and I should, from this circumstance (there being always in the world a number of rich merchants, nobility, states, and princes, who have need of honest instruments for the management of their affairs, and such being so rare), have endeavored to convince young persons that no qualities were so likely to make a poor man's fortune as those of probity and integrity."<br><br>The ol' Wizards were such instruments, and in all times there are persons possessed of corporal power in need of good hands. Ben's writings are rich in details which are helpful to making oneself noticed by those in need of a good wizard. <br><br>I also have attempted some of the magical training which Greer has pinned, to mixed effect. Last year I introduced AODA practices into my life to... humbling effect. I found that my tact was over ambitious and managed to burn myself out by August. Surprizingly the benefits of practice actually became far more pronounced when I lapsed in practice. With the equinox I have restarted magical practices, though now based on the Celtic Golden Dawn.<br><br>Even at 25 I have noticed some of my mental faculties fade compared to youth, I was earlier possessed of incredible retention, speed, and precision of thought, by virtue of inborn talent, but in recent years I have detected that where practice does not maintain those powers they are apt to wain. Alas some lazy habits which those talents permitted me to support are now becoming a liability. Keeping a planner and taking notes being the distinctive skills whose under development vex me more often than any other, in fact they were key hindrances in my first pass at magical workings.<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c8336434529683831906 title="comment permalink">4/3/14, 11:17 AM</a><br><br>

Proposal 2012 especially has been interesting. Of course the technology set they are trying to preserve includes much more frankly expensive systems than my simple efforts are ever likely to be able to imitate. The thinking that went into the project is a valuable resource because some of the technologies they propose may be quite sustainable, and regardless of that it is a noble first stab at the problem of localizing technology systems to a complexity cost that have better than Frosty's chance in a sauna.<br><br>@sunseeker<br><br>Natural building materials are where I have most of my experience (a couple rocket stoves, some cob walls, and a lime plaster work, wood framed solar gain walls and grow boxes.) and I must admit to being very pessimistic about trying to retrofit these terrible houses of the Fort Collins population boom in to anything beyond slum conditions. There is simply very little to work with which is resilient. The crawls spaces, attics, and walls are so poorly made that the house is unlikely to survive another decade with out retrofits which are logs beyond my budget. The mold last winter was very serious, and it was a massive time commitment just to keep up with the rate of deterioration.<br><br>Even with the PDFs on the site you gave me, it only shows how unaffordable any real fixes are to me. Alas my retreat from American style housing may be coming soon. Then again the happiest times of my life have been living in trailers and tents (because they are less bother than a house). <br><br>I believe that in a very real sense these house are the sets for a participatory theater show that once captivated the nation, but the rating are faltering, some sets are being canceled. And once the glamor of living 'just like that family from Growing Pains, or Boy Meets World' stops and the show in canceled they turn back into a hastily painted set piece of cardboard and plastic film. With out cheap fuel many of these homes will be good only as scrap and ghostly reminders of the madness of the city of dreams.<br><br>Conversely some of the rich people homes in the mountains are built to world historic standards for functioning off grid in difficult conditions. But I don't know how viable the roads will be... I worked on one just this week installing radiant floor heating, made good money too. If the road goes out I wonder what will happen to those places, I hear that the squatter communities in town are licking their chops... I will watch that scene play out with curiosity.<br><br>Many of the young farmers around here are moving into little trailers I have noticed, trailers also happen to be much easier to work on, and mobile. Since work on certain organic farms equates to about $3.50 an hour, I see their life approaches as a good guideline for the decline, as they are living on resources may become standard for the working class. It it the direction that my efforts at preparing for energy efficiency are likely to go, having my greenhouse destroyed soured my interest in attempting much at my current residence. I am going to try to retrofit it for the coming winter, but if energy prices go up much my best move will be to retreat to an alternative arrangement, which I have made some quite preparations for.<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c581557496682393858 title="comment permalink">4/3/14, 12:10 PM</a><br><br>

It seems to me that this is just how the world is."<br><br>Well, rural New England, back in the late 1700s and throughout the 1800s, was such a time and place. A great number of personal archives and papers survive from the lower strata of society, farmers and tradesmen, and they show widespread original thought, deep curiosity, and considerable independence over against the wishes of the upper crust. And this was the pattern in a world where, outside of the elite, most people had only a few years education: reading, writing and arithmetic as far as the "Rule of Three" (which is about finding the fourth number in a proportion when you know the other three). My wife's great-great-grandfather lived in rural Maine (in Newfield and Parsonsfield) from (I think) 1804 to 1851. He had two winter terms of schooling and no more, but that was enough to get him started on reading and writing, and he did the rest himself. We have his library and his personal papers. He was reading Butler's Hudibras, Pope's Iliad, Ovid's metamorphoses (I forget who the translator was), a university textbook of astronomy, etc. etc. The books all show signs of heavy use. He write poetry of his own, and quite interesting essays on political and religious questions, and so forth -- apparently for his own delight. He started out a Free-Will Baptist (his father had been a personal friend of the founder of that sect) and ended up a Swedenborgian, serving as librarian of his local Swedenborgian society. And he was a farmer and jack-of-all-trades, who grew food on his own land and worked at a bit of this and that to earn what money he needed -- not too much beyond what he had to pay in taxes.<br><br>Even here in New England, we have decayed so far below this model of life that it is "unbelievable." A noticeable fraction of this decay has happened within my own seven-plus decades of life. I think the main cause has been the rise of a consumer society, its foremost technique (saturation advertising), and its preferred medium (TV). <br><br>And as for computers, don't get me started. I use them skillfully and efficiently for my own purposes; in some ways they are an advance over typewriters and hard-copy books. But I do not *like* them in the least. They are a necessity for me in my work, but a repellent necessity. Ugh!!!<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c5881118688227609685 title="comment permalink">4/3/14, 1:03 PM</a><br><br>

Congrats on all the practical steps, btw. <br><br>Robert, a sense of humor is a real asset in times such as these.

You're quite correct that escalation is the only thing American politicians know how to do at this point -- that's a central theme in my forthcoming novel <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i>, in which US politicians and generals escalate until the country falls apart around them. <br><br>Anna, why, yes, that's exactly what I'm advocating.

Your next question is this: how does that set of systems integrate into the whole systems that surround it -- those of human society as well as those of the biosphere?<br><br>That depends greatly on where it's placed. A few years ago there was some acreage, about forty total that would have done nicely. Fairly close to town for ease of access by boarders. <br><br>It was my thought to section the majority of land into large pastures, that would make it easier to grow and produce my own hay. Using hedges between them planted with blackberry vines and wild roses, with other plants and herbs that horses will naturally choose will give them a more natural diet When not stalled. Raspberry leaves are eagerly sought by horses and acts as a calmative. The wild roses are an excellent source of vitamin C for people although this being timber country pine needles do just as well! (Although pine needle tea can't compete with rose hip jelly!) The hedges would also be excellent cover for quail and other wild birds, I'd even be delighted by flocks of wild turkeys visiting. (Which the occasionally do even through the outskirts of town!) So many flowering vines, herbs and shrubs would be good for bees and butterflies adding to the diversity of life on the property.<br><br>Another notion I had was to supply realistic sized garden plots for my boarders. It would help with food budgets for an ever shrinking income and hopefully keep good horses from ending up as commodities for the meat buyers. That would help build local ties in the community. I wouldn't even mind using my AP room by the arena to run organic gardening classes. It would also assist me in keeping nasty chemicals and GMO seeds off the property! A stipulation I would make in the rental agreement. <br><br>Recently I had a thought about a rental barn for livestock, (not horses), to be used by 4H members and those not having property for small to large livestock, like pigs, sheep, goats and cows or anyone that just wants to keep a milch animal or two. Those waste products would go onto fallow garden plots.<br><br>Then after the crash once or twice a month I'd host a farmers market inside the arena in the winter, outside in the summer.<br><br>It's fun to turn over all the possibilities in my head but I don't do it often because I have no cash backers, although one or two of the local banks salivate at the thought of lending me the money! The thought of having an impersonal entity hold the note is a very uncomfortable feeling for me!<br><br>Wadulisi<br><br>(BTW, signing my name in Cherokee, which means Like a Bee!)<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c5890676589489427655 title="comment permalink">4/3/14, 1:39 PM</a><br><br>

We used to appreciate this a lot more, and even as recently as my college days, courses included a lot of general skills in the process of learning – a “classical” education as my parents would have phrased it. <br><br>Unfortunately, computers and analytics currently are moving away from simply providing ‘normalized’ data to be analyzed by subjective minds, there’s a movement within analytics to make them more predictive, so that the decision maker simply has to acquiesce to the advice the number-crunching programs produce. The overall effect is decisions made on narrower and narrower sets of data, with very little resiliency when the universe fails to conform to the models. <br><br>As for Mentats, businesses are already waking up to the fact that there are individuals who think can outside the box, who can see relationships between apparently discrete data points, and have unique skills when it comes to data processing, with some companies like SAP actively seeking them out.

It seems you have a particularly keen sense of how easily useful methods can be lost for good through traumatic upheavals in history. Your focus on technologies is one example of that. What is interesting is that you are not exactly a, er, how does one say this, a firm devotee of the science/technology camp but rather more a member of the "other team". Of course, any good mage will know when and where to apply the right tool for the job but it seems there is something else going on here - as if you have direct experience of loss.<br><br>The idea is this: You have talked in the past about there having been a turning point, say 500 years ago, when the west could have swung firmly away from the methods that formed modern science and instead focused to the occultic arts you yourself are slightly more inclined. After having tried a little bit to track this down, apparently the church's attempt at banning books they deemed a little too uncatholic around that time was not entirely successful. Apparently banning books tends to increase their popularity so in order to both make a profit and appease the authorities, publishers sold certain banned books on the sly and made a big show of burning obviously uncatholic material that wasn't necessarily on the the banned book list and a lot of those burnt books happened to be of the occult. <br><br>Perhaps this wasn't a significant event, but if it was, we can well imagine a lot of occultic material being lost for good during this period. There are many Greek works we know of because they were mentioned in Plato or what have you, but the actual work itself is lost. Has something similar gone on in occultic literature, works that you know of as they are mentioned in other sources, that you would dearly like to stick your translator's teeth into, unfortunately got lost for good in the subterfuge of some Renaissance publisher's bonfire?<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c1241288055707345039 title="comment permalink">4/3/14, 2:44 PM</a><br><br>

I don't have a background in formal logic, but should probably remedy that -- my studies have been in informal logic with a good dollop of classical Greek dialectic. The mentats of the future should certainly use both. <br><br>Robo, good. As I pointed out here <a href=../../2010/07/cybernetics-of-black-knights.html rel=nofollow>a while back</a>, data doesn't become information until it's sorted out according to an intentionality relevant to the question, and if it's sorted according to an irrelevant intentionality, it's not information but noise.<br><br>Mike, good! Two direct hits. <br><br>Robert, that used to be fairly common. Odd Fellows lodges and other fraternal benefit societies back in the day usually had libraries, since it was assumed that the working-class guys who formed the core membership of those orders all wanted to learn as much as they could in order to better themselves, and so having a common stash of good books allowed them to save money while doing so. <br><br>RPC, John the Baptist's problem was that most people in 1st century Judea took prophets very, very seriously -- it had about the same status that the job of economist has today, though a better track record at predictions. (Guiding economic policy by looking at the livers of sacrificial sheep, I'm convinced, would yield better results than today's economic theories do; even if they were right only 50% of the time, that's about 50% better than modern economists manage.) <br><br>Wadulisi, fair enough. Of course the real challenge at this point is finding something you can do with the resources you actually have available to you; as the Long Descent continues, that's going to be the task that matters for most of us. <br><br>Harry, it's a point worth noting that the push for relevance in education is inevitably a source of disaster. The world's great education systems, the ones that reliably produced smart, capable thinkers able to apply their knowledge to the real world, one and all pursued <i>irrelevant</i> forms of knowledge: think of a classical British education, the Confucian education of the old Chinese elite, the old Roman educational system, and so on. All of them were based on close study of a canon of classic texts that could not have had less to do with the practicalities of life -- but they taught students how to learn, how to reason, and how to measure their own ideas about what had been thought before them, and that was what counted. More, much more, about this as we proceed. <br><br>Phil, I'll look forward to seeing you there!<br><br>Crowandsheep, er, you need to learn a bit about the history of the late Renaissaance and early modern era, because the way you've outlined things is quite simply not what happened -- not at all.

Those who acquire it will cease to exercise their memory and become forgetful; they will rely on writing to bring things to their remembrance by external signs instead of on their own internal resources. What you have discovered is a receipt for recollection, not for memory. And as for wisdom, your pupils will have the reputation for it without proper instruction, and in consequence be thought very knowledgeable when they are for the most part quite ignorant. And because they are filled with the conceit of wisdom instead of real wisdom they will be a burden to society.<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c1428551193938672197 title="comment permalink">4/3/14, 4:52 PM</a><br><br>

A lot of the content of the Whole Earth Catalog was in fact Green Wizardry stuff, for years. But as the 60's ground into the 70's, something changed. <br><br>Perhaps it began with the Last Whole Earth Catalog, which sported the motto "we are as Gods - we might as well get good at it". From there on, it was rank hubristic technocornucopianism of the first water.<br><br>The nail in the coffin for me was his over the top endorsement in his "CoEvolution Quarterly" of G.K. O'Neill's Space Colonies as the solution to... well... all of humankind's problems. I think the headline was 'Apocalypse... Averted!'. <br><br>I sent in an anguished letter to the effect of "SB, how could you fall for this nonsense". But I wasn't the only one - many letters of dismay came in from many quarters, and the best and most cogent was from Wendell Berry. To SB's credit, he published them all, and he and WB had a conversation about it in print for a couple more issues (i.e., this thing unfolded over nearly a year - pre-internet, kids!).<br><br>Anyway, the Long Now stuff is interesting, I suppose, but I am not impressed with SB as a whole systems thinker, and haven't been for some time. He's a promoter, an entrepeneur, and he's good at it, but he seems to go straight for the 'shiny'.<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c9155065185649628747 title="comment permalink">4/3/14, 5:56 PM</a><br><br>

You could adapt that to pointless protest banners quite effectively as well.<br><br>Also happy to hear about London trip.<br><br>As for the rest regarding education, I'll see if I can be a bit of a devil's advocate on that.<br><br>1. (Adult) education<br>a) Critical thinking<br>My impression is that many people get really smart/clever/wise in spite of much of the institutionalized education - not because of it. It may be comparable to putting on nice clothes before you go to church - it will not do a whole lot for your spiritual development. It may make you curious as to what the point of putting such an effort into churches etc. is.<br>If a specific part/type of education is not valued by society people tend to ignore it. If something is valued, society doesn't necessarily have to make an "organized effort" in educating people in it. My impression is that understanding happens the (inter)personal level in a very non-linear and erratic fashion with larger variability between persons and throughout their development. Proper thinking (divergent and convergent) for me includes, speaking, listening, feeling, drawing and turning upside down, writing, dreaming, occasional intoxication, what iffing, recursion, leaving, forgetting, and remembering. A list of logical fallacies and cognitive biases sure helps, and a lot can be thought in 30 s but depth needs time (years), or travel with me. <br>b) As for teaching adults critical thinking: It depends a little whom you call an adult, but generally I would say: it is too late by then. I have just had my in-laws and my wife's pre-school age nephew there. It seems they have almost exactly the same level of control of their cognitive and meta-cognitive facilities. Sure, they have a different vocabulary and personality but the general pattern is not different. She is retired from the ministry of environment, cooked 50% more (industrial) chicken legs than anyone could eat and wrapped the surplus baguette in several layers of aluminum foil before going back by air when the option of rail travel would not have taken significantly longer or more money. <br>I can't help but try to teach the old ones - though I am fairly certain it is a waste of breath. I would rather hope they convert their lawn back into the subsistence garden plot my wife still has fond memories of. <br>My perception is when the big ones have kids, one should make one more serious effort (really only to "save the kid"), but if their horizon by then is still the herd - then that's it. There are things that no amount of beating can fix. Humans above the age of 30 maybe just cannot be considered durable goods for investment on a planet that already has so many of them.<br><br>Although I am usually not a big fan of numbers as they are all too often abused to show that one is right - before the good questions ever come up, still:<br>Education market in China (2011) 240E9 $ for 1.3E9 capita, in US (today) 1300E9 $ for 0.32E9 capita<br>Of course advertisement plays a crucial role in development and continued use of mental faculties as well. The ad market in US 2010 was estimated at 125E9 $. Is it fair to say that each month about 30$ per person is spent on misinforming the public? I would assume a substantial amount is targeted at (broke) minors, who generally are the weak back door to the parents bank account. I wonder is there countries that tax ads (targeting minors)?<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c7730924186440060038 title="comment permalink">4/3/14, 10:31 PM</a><br><br>

So there will not be a recognizable (by average Joe) bust or anything of the sort I suspect.<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c4453575726957529373 title="comment permalink">4/4/14, 2:45 AM</a><br><br>

It is really great to see your ideas and perspective getting further out into the world. I really enjoyed the book too.<br><br>Back to this weeks essay.<br><br>Ahh, master, a challenge?<br><br>I accept, but am not yet worthy.<br><br>That was an interesting observation about the possible future gas exports. Yes, that is exactly what is going on here too. Of course, we do actually have to pay for all of those imports somehow - as does the US (eventually anyway) for that matter.<br><br>You could potentially alter the phrase, "whomever controls the debt, controls the asset" to "whomever controls the energy, controls the asset". The effect would be much the same and it was quite clearly shown to be true in recent events.<br><br>That was a very cheeky "oh well"-ing, me last week, I had not forgotten. hehe! It produced a very loud chuckle here. Tidy work.<br><br>Did you know that Frank Herbert and Jack Vance were good mates? Nice mentioning Dune as it was an excellent read and original fictional universe.<br><br>Hey boss, how come no one here mentioned that the US could become dominant in world affairs again through hard graft (graft may possibly have a different definition for US readers. It means hard work here)? This could be achieved through potentially reducing the internal consumption of energy. Obviously, other drastic social changes and a drop in the standard of living would need to be made to implement this, but it should be remembered that whilst the US imports massive quantities of energy, it also produces huge quantities of energy too. Perhaps that option is not on the table?<br><br>As an interesting side issue, a couple of months back, I was harassed into watching a US show, “Breaking Bad”. Apparently the show is a modern classic. I couldn’t actually sit through much of the show because the entire story line revolved around escalation (which you mentioned earlier). Exposing my consciousness to that story line and escalation technique was unpleasant and I discontinued watching the show. Escalation is a technique, but it is only one of many techniques. I hope that show was not in any way representative of US culture as every decision that the characters made was pretty much the exact opposite of what I would have done had I been in those circumstances. Unpleasant.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c8659624976666432541 title="comment permalink">4/4/14, 3:09 AM</a><br><br>

He referred to a play written in 1882, "Enemy of the People", which Mr. Monbiot uses as a metaphor to describe reactions to climate change news. It also perfectly summarizes how people react to Peak Oil. It seems relevant to this week's topic(s), so I'm copying/pasting Mr. Monbiot's summary of the play here.<br><br>[.....in] Henrik Ibsen’s play An Enemy of the People.... Thomas Stockmann is a doctor in a small Norwegian town, and medical officer at the public baths whose construction has been overseen by his brother, the mayor. The baths, the mayor boasts, “will become the focus of our municipal life! … Houses and landed property are rising in value every day.”<br><br>But Dr Stockmann discovers that the pipes were built in the wrong place, and the water feeding the baths is contaminated. “The source is poisoned …We are making our living by retailing filth and corruption! The whole of our flourishing municipal life derives its sustenance from a lie!” People bathing in the water to improve their health are instead falling ill.<br><br>Dr Stockmann expects to be treated as a hero for exposing this deadly threat. After the mayor discovers that re-laying the pipes would cost a fortune and probably sink the whole project, he decides that his brother’s report “has not convinced me that the condition of the water at the baths is as bad as you represent it to be.” He proposes to ignore the problem, make some cosmetic adjustments and carry on as before. After all, “the matter in hand is not simply a scientific one. It is a complicated matter, and has its economic as well as its technical side.” The local paper, the baths committee and the business people side with the mayor against the doctor’s “unreliable and exaggerated accounts”.<br><br>Astonished and enraged, Dr Stockmann lashes out madly at everyone. He attacks the town as a nest of imbeciles, and finds himself, in turn, denounced as an enemy of the people. His windows are broken, his clothes are torn, he’s evicted and ruined.<br>{End of Summary}<br><br>I find it disturbing that the past 130 years or so has not brought ANY improvement whatsoever in people's willingness to hear unpleasant news. Sigh. <br><br>Peak Oil Bingo card looks great. No need to add mine, but they would be: Blank Stare (as in "why would you even be thinking about that") and the "You're-Crazy-There-Is-No-Peak-Oil-Stop-Listening-to-The-Crazies".<br><br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c5333296266628079057 title="comment permalink">4/4/14, 7:06 AM</a><br><br>

First, a moral argument: teach respect for trees, venerate them as fellow life, study and appreciation, culture appropriate uses, etc. Hard to teach, I would imagine. Second: prudence. This is warning people that hey, if you cut that last tree down, then what will you do? Maybe plant some new ones, yeah? Self-interest is likely easier to teach, if perhaps superficial. Third: practicality. Confiscate or tax the axes and saws, build walls around the trees, etc.: the trees are now much more difficult to chop down, and so humans are less able to axe them. This last method (also known as Situational Crime Prevention) has apparently been something of a thing in recent decades. Less charitably: Autopia.<br><br>Another nice mentat tidbit to ruminate on by way of Morozov is Albert Hirschman in "The Rhetoric of Reaction", whereby criticisms may be raised on concerns perversity (the boat is now sinking faster), futility (nope, still sinking), or jeopardy (boat not sinking, but is now on fire, thanks!). And these are all flawed.

Fingerprints are all over the place if you know where to look. <br><br>I can't speak about the EU, but among Americans there are a couple of different factions at work. The Brezhinsky faction, that is the evil Zbig, his progeny and assorted hangers on, have been planning something like this for years as part of the grand plan to take down Russia, the hated enemy of Poland. Obama is a Brezhinsky client who owes his career in part to their patronage, and they no doubt have blackmail material at hand. The new twist was added by the neo-con faction who lost in Syria, and needed a win to regain their confidence and influence and to separate Obama and Putin. Good relations between the American and Russian presidents is NOT part of the plan and not to be tolerated by either faction. I would say that that portion of the American public who pays attention to public events is heartily sick of the pretensions of both factions and would like to see them gone from public influence. For how much longer the entity which has lately been called the Deep State will continue to find either faction useful I can't tell, but the fact that foul mouthed Victoria still has her job is not reassuring.<br><br>There was no way Russia was going to give up its' naval base in Crimea, and even a cursory reading of the history of the region reveals no historical ties between Ukraine, or the Cossack hetmanate, is that the correct word?, which preceeded it, and Crimea, whose cultural origins seem to lie in Greek and Roman antiquity. <br><br>I think more attention needs to be paid to the role of agribusiness in the affair, especially the Four Horsemen, Monsanto, AKA Monsatan, AKA, most hated corporation on this planet, Syngenta, Dow and Du Pont, chemical companies who now are heavily involved in agriculture as a way to sell their patented seeds and their chemicals. They have previously visited pollution, corruption and financial ruin on the Great Plains of North America and the Pampas of Argentina and now have the world famous black earth of the Ukraine in their sights.<br><br>I would urge any citizen of Ukraine or neighboring countries to beware the incursion of western agribiz, and the four agents of Sauron in particular. Your governments should sign no treaties which allow for patenting of your historic vegetable and grain varieties. Monsanto is said to be building a corn processing plant in the Ukraine. I urgently and respectfully suggest that Monsatan must be not allowed to dominate your grain crops. If the processing facility is allowed to operate, it must be forced and required to accept all corns, not just its own patented varieties. And, on behalf of gardeners everywhere, I respectfully urge you to take every possible step to protect your national seed banks and the historic treasures they contain.<br><br><br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c4090462181735075947 title="comment permalink">4/4/14, 7:47 AM</a><br><br>

So if I may, I would give you a bit of advice from my own life, stop putting so much of your energy into feeding those who just wish to argue their own point no matter how unfruitful it is for them. Instead communicate more to those of us who come here because they are paying attention, and they are letting go of the cultural dreams of being outside history and/or physics. Those of us actually trying to build something workable and beautiful for our world and our families. As for those who would detract, perhaps they are just not ready in their own lives to except the knowledge that you are freely sharing.

The LSE is a completely separate thing.<br><br>I've been following JMG on here for many years and I've been a volunteer facilitator at the School of Economic Science for a number of years (the school is a completely voluntary non-profit org that has managed to work this way for almost 80 years).<br><br>JMG's thinking has had some influence on the economics study groups in the School (esp. The Wealth of Nature &amp; Green Wizardry). The school has been very supportive in allowing us to host the course and conference and bring interested people (like the readers here) together to discuss things further.<br><br>If you're interested in a bit more background, there's information on the course website <a href=http://www.eeecourse.org/#!background/cjg9 rel=nofollow>here</a> which I've quoted below.<br><br>"The Economics, Energy and Environment course emerged from a real and genuine question: why doesn’t our current economic system explain well the various environmental and challenges of the commons that we face today? Inspired by the study of both Philosophy and Economics in the School of Economic Science, we wanted to offer a holistic view of our economic system which embraced the environment and understanding of our physical sciences.<br> <br>The study of economics was the founding inspiration for the School. Dismayed by the poverty and despair of the great depression in the early 1930s, the small group of founders became convinced that economics was profoundly misunderstood and set about finding answers that conventional economics had failed to provide. The founders looked for natural laws governing societies. They found inspiration and insight in the writings of Henry George, who highlighted the key significance of access to land and natural resources as an economic factor.<br> <br>As the study progressed, taking economics to be the laws governing human beings in society, it became obvious that it was necessary to study the nature of the human being, and so began the Practical Philosophy course which is now one of the most popular courses offered by The School.<br> <br>Consequently, The School is today a centre for spiritual and practical knowledge and enquiry. Our aim is to help anyone who seeks it to lead a fuller, richer and more useful life and to evolve the spiritual aspects of their being in accordance with natural laws. This aim is pursued mainly by offering innovative courses in practical, living philosophy inspired by the philosophy of advaita or unity, and economics with justice.<br> <br>Philosophy and economics are directly related because, ultimately, economic life depends on the philosophy underlying economic systems and on the philosophic culture of the people living and working in an economy. We offer a wide range of other courses, inspired by the broad principles of practical philosophy &amp; economics, as well as seminars, workshops, concerts and lectures. We are a registered charity, founded in 1937.<br> <br>More information on The School can be found here: <a href=http://www.schooleconomicscience.org rel=nofollow>www.schooleconomicscience.org</a><br><br>Matt<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c6098676874025951833 title="comment permalink">4/4/14, 1:13 PM</a><br><br>

As a law librarian trained in the pre-internet days, I always told my students not to rely solely on the results of free text searching, referring them to early research showing that even in the context of a semi-controlled vocabulary (legalese, in this case), there was a significant chance that certain relevant documents would never be found. <a href=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/lawcrs/arc9798/lasdab1.htm rel=nofollow>The Curse of Thamus: An Analysis of Full-Text Legal Document Retrieval</a>.

The funding for the library was used to get a matching grant from the state library commission. A revised levy is coming up in May but does not contain the library funding, in part because of assertions that libraries have nothing to do with education. The school system is looking at a loss of 40% of their funding, so they eliminated everything they could from the revised levy as a matter of political survival. <br><br>The continued operation of the library will be a practical exercise of skills for the "Long Descent".

I in fact attended lectures in Thermodynamics by the aformentioned Sanjoy Mahajan back in 2004 in Cambridge as part of the Physics course of the Natural Sciences Tripos. The lecture course was somewhat controversial, because many thought we should really be diving straight into the mathematics of statistical thermodynamics, rather than doing a course based on order of magnitude estimation.<br><br>I have had an interest in computational linguistics for a while. There a sets of lecture notes from Edinburgh University available <a href=http://course.inf.ed.ac.uk rel=nofollow>here</a> on these topics. This perhaps may be a way to start to think about logic, and also the limits of computers.<br><br>I will mention something of what happened to me after beginning what was intended to be a PhD in Astronomy, focusing on Andromeda and Triangulum. I began to run into problems, in the second year, around the time I discovered this blog, and realised that the current ways of human civilisation have no long-term future. I suffered from what is thought in the medical community as a kind of mental illness. I am not sure why this happened, I don't buy the reductionist model of brain chemistry alone, it appears to me now that there was a profound reevaluation going on, that could not be completed at the conscious level. I think what was really difficult was the feeling of being pulled between different sets of incompatible expectations. After a break of a few months, I struggled on with the PhD but I wrote up as an MSc in the end. I was in work for a short time, but after more illness, was out of work and unsure what to do next. <br><br>More recently I decided to so another MSc, a sideways step, but this time in remote sensing within a geography department. I wished to continue in science but was unsure of whether another PhD and academia was right for me. At the moment I'm leaning towards the view that it isn't right now, but still not sure what should be next.<br><br>Another book I'd like to flag up is Roger Penrose's <i>Road to Reality</i>. I have had it for several years, but have yet to read much of it. This post has inspired me to have another go!<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c2100604949276325282 title="comment permalink">4/5/14, 10:35 AM</a><br><br>

"I'm already doing my share" is a version of that I hear all the time, usually with reference to a few spare bucks thrown in the direction of a big-name environmental lobbying organization now and then.

The thing I'd suggest for right now is reading stories aloud to your son -- old stories, not contaminated by modern marketing, and if at all possible stories you knew and loved when you were a child. Narratives are the basic tools of human thought, and a child that grows up hearing (and then reading) plenty of stories, with different narratives and morals, will have more to think with than a child that doesn't have that advantage. <br><br>Ursachi, fair enough! It wasn't just one roof, though -- the half-gable pattern was, iirc, on a number of roofs. <br><br>Cherokee, I see you haven't had much contact with modern American business practices. These days the sole point under discussion is whether it will boost stock prices this quarter. Huge capital investments get made here even when the result will be bankruptcy a few years down the line, because the executives who made the decision will have moved on to another firm by then, and they'll have the reputation of success while the people who come after them are left holding the bag. Yes, it's really gotten that bad. <br><br>Johan, excellent! You get today's gold star for the Coleridge reference -- and of course you're quite right as well. Using computers to think with ultimately means thinking the way a computer does, i.e., not at all. <br><br>Ray, many thanks! Looks like a very good set of mentat exercises. <br><br>Kevin -- oh man.

Private companies are already working on this."<br><br>"Right now private investors are developing space tourism for wealthy individuals. Eventually, economies of scale will make space travel affordable for everyone." <br><br>"Orbiting solar panels can easily provide all the energy we could ever need." <br><br>"We can easily provide for all our needs through technologies that don't exist yet." <br><br>Yes, I have actually encountered the last statement presented as a serious argument. In all cases I'm paraphrasing, but in this instance "technologies that don't exist yet" were the exact words used. These arguments all came from the same person, with an emphasis on libertarian ideology. His basic thesis was "there are so many ways to solve this problem that it simply isn't a problem." <br><br>Another case study: <br><br>"Nuclear batteries are on the drawing board right now. In the future they'll be powering towns and households everywhere." <br><br>"Small scale renewables simply can't compete with industrial energy and its associated products." <br><br>The last of course being true, but the implied thesis being that industrial-scale technology is eternally available, and therefore economically unassailable, as a matter of course. <br><br>And an example from an IRL conversation: <br><br>"A major Detroit motor company has invested $300,000 in a college project that's developing a new hyper-efficient and non-polluting type of engine. Now I feel much better about possibly buying a car." <br><br>In several instances the people making these arguments cited various sources: wiki articles, news items about investors proposing to launch private space enterprises, etc. But the evidentiary standard didn't rise too high, as is often the case where belief in Progress is is concerned. In the same forum, two or maybe three people got it. One had encountered Richard Heinberg's "Peak Everything," another was a serious gardener and hunter with some prepper/survivalist ideas that he was apparently putting into practice. <br><br>Here's one more IRL example, concerning the future not of energy or resource availability, but the political and economic prospects of the United States: "We won't be the world's sole superpower any more, but we'll still be a major country." Which could possibly turn out to be true, but I'm not betting my life on it. The statement came from an exceptionally intelligent and educated individual. <br><br>In short, what I've found is that once you start consistently challenging the faith in progress and presenting cogent arguments against its presumptive apotheosis, you will encounter tactics of squirming and dodging without end: as you've no doubt discovered several thousand times over. <br><br>Hopefully this will help to bring the total up to 25.

Interesting to see another librarian reference the same story to highlight the same idea. Though I guess not surprising.<br><br>As a former public librarian I'm very familiar with the threats to the mission of the public library from without and within. So I sympathize.

I also remember the attempts from misguided board members and blindly carrier-minded administrators to turn the library into a community centers where people can play video games and rent DVDs. I worry a lot about the degradation of this valuable resource. <br><br>Libraries also seem to be following the trend of contracting out services. If you follow this trend to its conclusion it could mean a lot less well-trained librarians and more clerks masquerading as librarians. While some people will not know the difference, the difference between a well-trained/read librarian and the average clerk who can barely do a keyword search is the difference between a Mentat and...well I won't say anything too insulting to library clerks. But I do recall several instances where clerks gave responses to questions that reminded me of the classic, "Do you like Kipling?" "I don't know I've never kipled." <br><br>I fear that as we slide down the long descent people won't be able to find anything in their local library except trashy romance novels and the like. I'm speaking form my experience working at a large urban public library (Brooklyn Public). From talking to other librarians I get the impression that smaller communities have a bit more control.<br><br>I also worry that like Erikson's sons abandoning windjammers, we might digitize everything and find ourselves in some trouble when that become untenable.<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c4494421981989584772 title="comment permalink">4/5/14, 1:45 PM</a><br><br>

You open it, put your shotgun down, relieved as you are that it's your friend and not a member of a traveling gang, looking for food. You give him a cup of tea, tell him 'you told him so' (you are human after all) and then you offer to help him get on his feet in the though times ahead.

It has enough land to grown much food, in case the economy collapsed, which I expected to happen at any minute.<br><br>20 years later, I still haven't mastered the art of growing food. At least, not enough to live on. My fruit trees are thriving, but not so much the fruit, which insects, birds and mold get first.<br><br>My job looks shakier than the oil availability.<br><br>At first I boarded horses, to make extra money. As the economy slowly collapsed, so did my boarders. I ended up with 3 abandoned horses. One remains, now 33 years old, and I ended up buying hay and grain for him this winter, to keep him alive. So much for making money on that business.<br><br>When my last child left college, I went to part time. I work just enough to pay the bills, and enjoy the rest of my life as free time.<br><br>Last week, the mice chewed through the circuit board of my heater, destroying it. We have been thinking about geothermal for awhile, but that would involve working more hours. The heating guy told me that I could get a high efficiency gas heater, instead. I was taken aback. Does he really think that natural gas will continue? Yes, he does. <br><br>The mice also got to my seedlings. Country living isn't all it's cracked up to be. <br><br>I was talked into a 401K for awhile, but when I realized that I was "invested" in Goldman Sachs and gold mining, I cashed it in and bought solar panels.

"A Lot" is of course problematic because it says next to nothing. "More" would be better in my opinion, but there's two problems that come up immediately competition (and incentives for juking the stats), the other thing is if you reduce destructive activity by convincing others or finding more efficient ways to do things - how is that figured into your stats?<br>For a while I just tried to imagine a bunch of dead 3rd world people (roughly in proportion of my energy over-use) following me around looking at what I do, and either approving my motives and results or not. I would imagine that they would be somewhat appeased if I was (succesfully) working on something that may save similar amounts of energy as I used up to get to that point. Of course it is not quite so simple as the non-renewable energy I used will impact later generations just as much, or even significantly more if you take the complexity of the situation into account. So I moved more towards people of the future + poor dead people model... but this is also not really satisfying in more than one way.<br><br>Then there's the issue of: if I manage to convince someone to use less energy - can I add (a fraction) to my allowance? Sure I may have had a part in the change - but also the influenced subject was most likely cooperative. I think there's no way we can split this right - which leads me away from thinking in individuals because you impose all kinds of artificial boundaries that get in the way of solutions. On the other hand it opens the door to "my XYZ commanded my to do this - without regard for the (currently existing) individual", aka fanaticism, or hubris, or not being nice. <br>Safeguard against that to a degree: valueing consensus, especially at higher levels. <br>If the consensus is hubris - tough luck.<br><br>Unfortunately the complete "white knight approach" to this also strikes me as rather vulnerable. And if I get a Ghandi quote in reply for this, I will answer with a Ghandi quote.<br><br>But Glenn also has a point. Many Good Things need not be done out of altruism exclusively, some critical thinking, perspicuity, and will to survive are often sufficient to keep you busy with many of them. <br>What I would wish for is a narrative not based solely on the individual, limited time-efficient return on investment, and rational market actors. <br>In a world where individuals are ready to die for flags, the devil defecates on the biggest pile, and positive feedback speculation is the norm, the end of the line does not converge in a nice place.<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c1551686930626318290 title="comment permalink">4/7/14, 12:26 PM</a><br><br>

What came up was the Yarmouth Beach Yawls of the East Coast of England. 50 to 75 foot open, dipping lug rigged boats that launched off the beach into the surf. Top speeds of 14 to 16 knots, a speed to length ration of around 1.85 (speed in knots divided by square root of waterline in feet). Top speed for displacement hulls is 1.33. How'd they do it? Huge sail area, fine lined shallow hulls, and massive crews; both to handle the sails (the main sails were lowered and passed behind the mast to the new lee side on each tack) and to shift sand bag ballast to windward as well. A 50 foot boat might have a crew of two dozen men. They obviously never made a nickel hauling freight or fishing due to crew costs. What did they do? From the late 18th to the mid 19th centuries they engaged in the lucrative trades of smuggling, salvage, wrecking (illegal salvage), pilotage and transporting ships officers and passengers from ship to shore and back. As well, the less lucrative act of lifesaving. A highly refined and specialized vessel, which like the American Baltimore clippers, were only viable in extremely profitable trade. The Yawls were eventually put out of business by the advent of steam tugs, iron anchor chains and Trinity House lifeboats. One of the last, the BITTERN, lay rotting on the beach in 1929.<br><br>Judging by the published lines, the similarity to longship hulls was more generic than specific. With more upright stems and flatter floors (shallower angle of rise from keel to turn of the bilge), there was more twist and less depth in the hulls. Due to their shallow draft they did not point high to windward, their fastest point of sail being a broad reach. Their light lapstrake construction and narrow shallow proportions bore the greatest resemblance to their Norse forebears.<br><br>This is from Edgar March's "Inshore Craft of Britain in the Days of Sail and Oar - Vol. 2", chapter 5, commencing page 159. Copyright 1970, published by David and Charles at Newton Abbot.<br><br>So yes, JMG, for a brief shining period, hulls resembling longships with a more modern rig did indeed sail like greased lightning. You were right, and I was wrong.<br><br>They were indeed men in those days; though many died in harness, and few of them rich. For what it's worth, the boats were usually owned by their crews in cooperative companies, as was common with such vessels all about the coast of Great Britain. All those who participated in a launch were due a share of the earnings (salvage being the most profitable); and reduced shares were paid to widows and orphans of members who died in good standing.<br><br>Glenn<br><br>in the Bramblepatch<br>Marrowstone Island<br>Salish Sea<br>Cascadia<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c334120694291991378 title="comment permalink">4/8/14, 11:16 AM</a><br><br>

I'll have everything you need, and even meet you at the door with a cup of tea."<br><br>Not sure how that's going to advance the agenda.<br><br>I think JMG's response speaks a little more effectively to situation at hand: "Well, you might want to rethink that plan. Those of us who are prepared just might not greet you with open arms when the time comes."<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c7067048209380151913 title="comment permalink">4/8/14, 9:37 PM</a><br><br>

But once the electricity falls (permanently) I assume a lot of people will have no choice but to accept reality. It's one thing to say 'nothing is the matter; when you can still use money to get food/water/heath delivered to your house. You need to be a lot more stupid to say the same thing when the petrol-system falls down. But some people will hold onto that. But I doubt they would be the ones knocking on your door. They would just freeze to that waiting in line at the gas station, not realising it will never be filled again. <br><br>@ Halfiore,<br><br>I explicitly adressed the point that this was a response to a question now, not a future scenario. And my main point remains that it doesn't help to bring a gun-threath into such a conversation. Saying you will shoot your friends if things go south, hardly ever convinces anyone that they really need to prepare. They will just as themselves why they are friends with you in the first place.<br><br>If friends get into trouble they can knock on my door. I know I can knock on theirs if I need them. That's why they are friends. (and I assume that is why they are discussing this with you in the first place.) Most people don't believe in the scenario where they need to prepare for living in a society without (a lot of) energy. When they say 'I'll just come to your house' it's a joke. (and if JMG had made it a joking 'gun' response and kept it that, I wouldn't have said anything) If they where actually convinced that the system might collapse they would probably prepare for that. I don't know that many people that like the idea of mooching off of their friend. I think the scenario where people don't prepare for decline because they know a friend that has prepared for it, is fairly unrealistic. <br><br>Keep in mind: it's not an ideal scenario for the 'friend'. He would have to learn skills to survive without the benefit off a fossil fuel society provide heath while he was isolating his house, without food if his crops fails the first harvest, without anything. He would probably want to repay you for your help, which would make life quite difficult in the first years he was adjusting to the new situation. <br><br>Most people would not see 'you get a kind word, a cup of tea and a lot of very hard work' as some sort of golden parachute.<br><br><a href=mentats-wanted-will-train.html#c3355603676092556495 title="comment permalink">4/8/14, 11:33 PM</a><br><br>
