Last week’s post on the vacuous catchphrases that so often substitute for thought in today’s America referenced only a few examples of the species under discussion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It might someday be educational, or at least entertaining, to write a sequel to H.L. Mencken’s <i>The American Credo</i>, bringing his choice collection of thoughtstoppers up to date with the latest fashionable examples; still, that enticing prospect will have to wait for some later opportunity.In the meantime, those who liked my suggestion of Peak Oil Denial Bingo will doubtless want to know that cards <a href=http://buzzwordbingogame.com/cards/peak_oil_denial/ >can now be downloaded for free</a>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What I’d like to do this week is talk about another popular credo, one that plays a very large role in blinding people nowadays to the shape of the future looming up ahead of us all just now. In an interesting display of synchronicity, it came up in a conversation I had while last week’s essay was still being written. A friend and I were talking about the myth of progress, the facile and popular conviction that all human history follows an ever-ascending arc from the caves to the stars; my friend noted how disappointed he’d been with a book about the future that backed away from tomorrow’s challenges into the shelter of a comforting thoughtstopper:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Technology will always be with us.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s take a moment to follow the advice I gave in last week’s post and think about what, if anything, that actually means. Taken in the most literal sense, it’s true but trivial. Toolmaking is one of our species’ core evolutionary strategies, and so it’s a safe bet that human beings will have some variety of technology or other as long as our species survives. That requirement could just as easily be satisfied, though, by a flint hand axe as by a laptop computer—and a flint hand axe is presumably not what people who use that particular thoughtstopper have in mind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Perhaps we might rephrase the credo, then, as “modern technology will always be with us.” That’s also true in a trivial sense, and false in another, equally trivial sense. In the first sense, every generation has its own modern technology; the latest up-to-date flint hand axes were, if you’ll pardon the pun, cutting-edge technology in the time of the Neanderthals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the second sense, much of every generation’s modern technology goes away promptly with that generation; whichever way the future goes, much of what counts as modern technology today will soon be no more modern and cutting-edge than eight-track tape players or Victorian magic-lantern projectors. That’s as true if we get a future of continued progress as it is if we get a future of regression and decline. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Perhaps our author means something like “some technology at least as complex as what we have now, and fulfilling most of the same functions, will always be with us.” This is less trivial but it’s quite simply false, as historical parallels show clearly enough. Much of the technology of the Roman era, from wheel-thrown pottery to central heating, was lost in most of the western Empire and had to be brought in from elsewhere centuries later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the dark ages that followed the fall of Mycenean Greece, even so simple a trick as the art of writing was lost, while the history of Chinese technology before the modern era is a cycle in which many discoveries made during the heyday of each great dynasty were lost in the dark age that followed its decline and fall, and had to be rediscovered when stability and prosperity returned. For people living in each of these dark ages, technology comparable to what had been in use before the dark age started was emphatically <i>not</i> always with them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, who is the “us” that we’re discussing here? Many people right now have no access to the technologies that middle-class Americans take for granted. For all the good that modern technology does them, today’s rural subsistence farmers, laborers in sweatshop factories, and the like might as well be living in some earlier era. I suspect our author is not thinking about such people, though, and the credo thus might be phrased as “some technology at least as complex as what middle-class people in the industrial world have now, providing the same services they have come to expect, will always be available to people of that same class.” Depending on how you define social classes, that’s either true but trivial—if “being middle class” equals “having access to the technology todays middle classes have,” no middle class people will ever be deprived of such a technology because, by definition, there will be no middle class people once the technology stops being available—or nontrivial but clearly false—plenty of people who think of themselves as middle class Americans right now are losing access to a great deal of technology as economic contraction deprives them of their jobs and incomes and launches them on new careers of downward mobility and radical impoverishment. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Well before the analysis got this far, of course, anyone who’s likely to mutter the credo “Technology will always be with us” will have jumped up and yelled, “Oh for heaven’s sake, you know perfectly well what I mean when I use that word! You know, <i>technology</i>!”—or words to that effect. Now of course I do know exactly what the word means in that context: it’s a vague abstraction with no real conceptual meaning at all, but an ample supply of raw emotional force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Like other thoughtstoppers of the same kind, it serves as a verbal bludgeon to prevent people from talking or even thinking about the brittle, fractious, ambivalent realities that shape our lives these days. Still, let’s go a little further with the process of analysis, because it leads somewhere that’s far from trivial. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Keep asking a believer in the credo we’re discussing the sort of annoying questions I’ve suggested above, and sooner or later you’re likely to get a redefinition that goes something like this: “The coming of the industrial revolution was a major watershed in human history, and no future society of any importance will ever again be deprived of the possibilities opened up by that revolution.” Whether or not that turns out to be true is a question nobody today can answer, but it’s a claim worth considering, because history shows that enduring shifts of this kind do happen from time to time. The agricultural revolution of c. 9000 BCE and the urban revolution of c. 3500 BCE were both decisive changes in human history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even though there were plenty of nonagricultural societies after the first, and plenty of nonurban societies after the second, the possibilities opened up by each revolution were always options thereafter, when and where ecological and social circumstances permitted. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Some 5500 years passed between the agricultural revolution and the urban revolution, and since it’s been right around 5500 years since the urban revolution began, a case could probably be made that we were due for another. Still, let’s take a closer look at the putative third revolution. What exactly <i>was</i> the industrial revolution? What changed, and what future awaits those changes? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s a far more subtle question than it might seem at first glance, because the cascade of changes that fit under the very broad label “the industrial revolution” weren’t all of a piece. I’d like to suggest, in fact, that there was not one industrial revolution, but four of them—or, more precisely, three and a half. Lewis Mumford’s important 1934 study
<i>Technics and Civilization</i> identified three of those revolutions, though the labels he used for them—the eotechnic, paleotechnic, and neotechnic phases—shoved them into a linear scheme of progress that distorts many of their key features. Instead, I propose to borrow the same habit people use when they talk about the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions, and name the revolutions after individuals who played crucial roles in making them happen. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
First of all, then—corresponding to Mumford’s eotechnic phase—is the Baconian revolution, which got under way around 1600. It takes its name from Francis Bacon, who was the first significant European thinker to propose that what he called natural philosophy and we call science ought to be reoriented away from the abstract contemplation of the cosmos, and toward making practical improvements in the technologies of the time. Such improvements were already under way, carried out by a new class of “mechanicks” who had begun to learn by experience that building a faster ship, a sturdier plow, a better spinning wheel, or the like could be a quick route to prosperity, and encouraged by governments eager to cash in new inventions for the more valued coinage of national wealth and military victory. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Baconian revolution, like those that followed it, brought with it a specific suite of technologies. Square-rigged ships capable of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>long deepwater voyages revolutionized international trade and naval warfare; canals and canal boats had a similar impact on domestic transport systems. New information and communication media—newspapers, magazines, and public libraries—were crucial elements of the Baconian technological suite, which also encompassed major improvements in agriculture and in metal and glass manufacture, and significant developments in the use of wind and water power, as well as the first factories using division of labor to allow mass production. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second revolution—corresponding to Mumford’s paleotechnic phase—was the Wattean revolution, which got started around 1780. This takes its name, of course, from James Watt, whose redesign of the steam engine turned it from a convenience for the mining industry to the throbbing heart of a wholly new technological regime, replacing renewable energy sources with concentrated fossil fuel energy and putting that latter to work in every economically viable setting. The steamship was the new vehicle of international trade, the railroad the corresponding domestic transport system; electricity came in with steam, and so did the telegraph, the major new communications technology of the era, while mass production of steel via the Bessemer process had a massive impact across the economic sphere. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The third revolution—corresponding to Mumford’s neotechnic phase—was the Ottonian revolution, which took off around 1890. I’ve named this revolution after Nikolaus Otto, who invented the four-cycle internal combustion engine in 1876 and kickstarted the process that turned petroleum from a source of lamp fuel to the resource that brought the industrial age to its zenith. In the Ottonian era, international trade shifted to diesel-powered ships, supplemented later on by air travel; the domestic transport system was the automobile; the rise of vacuum-state electronics made radio (including television, which is simply an application of radio technology) the major new communications technology; and the industrial use of organic chemistry, turning petroleum and other fossil fuels into feedstocks for plastics, gave the Ottonian era its most distinctive materials. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The fourth, partial revolution, which hadn’t yet begun when Mumford wrote his book, was the Fermian revolution, which can be dated quite precisely to 1942 and is named after Enrico Fermi, the designer and builder of the first successful nuclear reactor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The keynote of the Fermian era was the application of subatomic physics, not only in nuclear power but also in solid-state electronic devices such as the transistor and the photovoltaic cell. In the middle years of the 20th century, a great many people took it for granted that the Fermian revolution would follow the same trajectory as its Wattean and Ottonian predecessors: nuclear power would replace diesel power in freighters, electricity would elbow aside gasoline as the power source for domestic transport, and nucleonics would become as important as electronics as a core element in new technologies yet unimagined. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Unfortunately for those expectations, nuclear power turned out to be a technical triumph but an economic flop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Claims that nuclear power would make electricity too cheap to meter ran face first into the hard fact that no nation anywhere has been able to have a nuclear power industry without huge and ongoing government subsidies, while nuclear-powered ships were relegated to the navies of very rich nations, which didn’t have to turn a profit and so could afford to ignore the higher construction and operating costs. Nucleonics turned out to have certain applications, but nothing like as many or as lucrative as the giddy forecasts of 1950 suggested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Solid state electronics, on the other hand, turned out to be economically viable, at least in a world with ample fossil fuel supplies, and made the computer and the era’s distinctive communications medium, the internet, economically viable propositions. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Wattean, Ottonian, and Fermian revolutions thus had a core theme in common. Each of them relied on a previously untapped energy resource—coal, petroleum, and uranium, respectively—and set out to build a suite of technologies to exploit that resource and the forms of energy it made available. The scientific and engineering know-how that was required to manage each power source then became the key toolkit for the technological suite that unfolded from it; from the coal furnace, the Bessemer process for making steel was a logical extension, just as the knowledge of hydrocarbon chemistry needed for petroleum refining became the basis for plastics and the chemical industry, and the same revolution in physics that made nuclear fission reactors possible also launched solid state electronics—it’s not often remembered, for example, that Albert Einstein got his Nobel prize for understanding the process that makes PV cells work, not for the theory of relativity. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Regular readers of this blog will probably already have grasped the core implication of this common theme. The core technologies of the Wattean, Ottonian, and Fermian eras all depend on access to large amounts of specific nonrenewable resources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Fermian technology, for example, demands fissible material for its reactors and rare earth elements for its electronics, among many other things; Ottonian technology demands petroleum and natural gas, and some other resources; Wattean technology demands coal and iron ore. It’s sometimes possible to substitute one set of materials for another—say, to process coal into liquid fuel—but there’s always a major economic cost involved, even if there’s an ample and inexpensive supply of the other resource that isn’t needed for some other purpose. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In today’s world, by contrast, the resources needed for all three technological suites are being used at breakneck rates and thus are either already facing depletion or will do so in the near future. When coal has already been mined so heavily that sulfurous, low-energy brown coal—the kind that miners in the 19th century used to discard as waste—has become the standard fuel for coal-fired power plants, for example, it’s a bit late to talk about a coal-to-liquids program to replace any serious fraction of the world’s petroleum consumption: the attempt to do so would send coal prices soaring to economy-wrecking heights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Richard Heinberg has pointed out in his useful book <i>Peak Everything</i>, for that matter, that a great deal of the coal still remaining in the ground will take more energy to extract than it will produce when burnt, making it an energy sink rather than an energy source.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus we can expect very large elements of Wattean, Ottonian, and Fermian technologies to stop being economically viable in the years ahead, as depletion drives up resource costs and the knock-on effects of the resulting economic contraction force down demand. That doesn’t mean that every aspect of those technological suites will go away, to be sure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s not at all unusual, in the wake of a fallen civilization, to find “orphan technologies” that once functioned as parts of a coherent technological suite, still doing their jobs long after the rest of the suite has fallen out of use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Just as Roman aqueducts kept bringing water to cities in the post-Roman dark ages whose inhabitants had neither the resources nor the knowledge to build anything of the kind, it’s quite likely that (say) hydroelectric facilities in certain locations will stay in use for centuries to come, powering whatever electrical equipment can maintained or built from local resources, even if the people who tend the dams and use the electricity have long since lost the capacity to build turbines, generators, or dams at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yet there’s another issue involved, because the first of the four industrial revolutions I’ve discussed in this essay—the Baconian revolution—<i>was not dependent on nonrenewable resources</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The suite of technologies that unfolded from Francis Bacon’s original project used the same energy sources that everyone in the world’s urban-agricultural societies had been using for more than three thousand years: human and animal muscle, wind, water, and heat from burning biomass. Unlike the revolutions that followed it, to put the same issue in a different but equally relevant way, the Baconian revolution worked within the limits of the energy budget the Earth receives each year from the Sun, instead of drawing down stored sunlight from the Earth’s store of fossil carbon or its much more limited store of fissible isotopes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The Baconian era simply used that annual solar budget in a more systematic way than previous societies managed, by directing the considerable intellectual skills of the natural philosophers of the day toward practical ends. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Because of their dependence on nonrenewable resources, the three later revolutions were guaranteed all along to be transitory phases. The Baconian revolution need not be, and I think that there’s a noticeable chance that it will not be. By that I mean, to begin with, that the core intellectual leap that made the Baconian revolution possible—the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>scientific method—is sufficiently widespread at this point that with a little help, it may well get through the decline and fall of our civilization and become part of the standard toolkit of future civilizations, in much the same way that classical logic survived the wreck of Rome to be taken up by successor civilizations across the breadth of the Old World. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, that’s not all I mean to imply here. The specific technological suite that developed in the wake of the Baconian revolution will still be viable in a post-fossil fuel world, wherever the ecological and social circumstances will permit it to exist at all. Deepwater maritime shipping, canal-borne transport across nations and subcontinents, mass production of goods using the division of labor as an organizing principle, extensive use of wind and water power, and widespread literacy and information exchange involving print media, libraries, postal services, and the like, are all options available to societies in the deindustrial world. So are certain other technologies that evolved in the post-Baconian era, but fit neatly within the Baconian model: solar thermal technologies, for example, and those forms of electronics that can be economically manufactured and powered with the limited supplies of concentrated energy a sustainable society will have on hand. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve suggested in previous posts here, and in my book <a href="http://www.newsociety.com/affil.mvc?Affil=ARCH&amp;Page=../Books/E/The-Ecotechnic-Future">The Ecotechnic Future</a>, that our current industrial society may turn out to be merely the first, most wasteful, and least durable of what might<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>best be called “technic societies”—that is, human societies that get a large fraction of their total energy supply from sources other than human and animal muscle, and support complex technological suites on that basis. The technologies of the Baconian era, I propose, offer a glimpse of what an emerging ecotechnic society might look like in practice—and a sense of the foundations on which the more complex ecotechnic societies of the future will build.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When the book mentioned at the beginning of this essay claimed that “technology will always be with us,” it’s a safe bet that the author wasn’t thinking of tall ships, canal boats, solar greenhouses, and a low-power global radio net, much less the further advances along the same lines that might well be possible in a post-fossil fuel world. Still, it’s crucial to get outside the delusion that the future must either be a flashier version of the present or a smoldering wasteland full of bleached bones, and start to confront the wider and frankly more interesting possibilities that await our descendants. </div>

His response to this refrain ended up being his latest non-fiction book, "Too Much Magic."

Not only does your terminology clarify what these revolutions are about, but also clears up an issue with the other terminology. After all, whatever is "neo" (new) now won't be "neo" in the future, so the Neotechnic of Mumford isn't the new technology now. If one had to stick with Mumford's classification scheme, it would have to be the Mesotechnic, and Fermi's would be the Neotechnic.

The resources and information needed for a Baconian revolution had been available since antiquity, but the necessary economic incentives and political conditions never existed long enough to get it going. <br><br>'Such improvements were already under way, carried out by a new class of “mechanicks” who had begun to learn by experience that building a faster ship, a sturdier plow, a better spinning wheel, or the like could be a quick route to prosperity, and encouraged by governments eager to cash in new inventions for the more valued coinage of national wealth and military victory.'<br><br>At the risk of sounding like a liberal (in the historical sense) economist, I think that's a crucial point. I'm confident JMG agrees, since he mentioned it.<br><br>Other social and economic arrangements than the ones that fostered the Baconian revolution might suffice to preserve it or revive it, but not just any arrangements. At some point we may want to discuss what the minimal requirements are. <br><br>Handing down proficiency in the skills of parliamentary democracy as JMG advocates is desirable for many other reasons but perhaps not essential to this. <br><br>I think the necessary conditions include but are not limited to the rule of law, a form of government other than absolute monarchy, some guarantee of real property and/or intellectual property rights, widespread literacy or a functional equivalent and a class system that isn't too rigid. <br><br>For the younger people on this list, or their children, this might be more than a theoretical discussion.<br> <br><br><br><br><a href=the-four-industrial-revolutions.html#c938912455625611692 title="comment permalink">4/9/14, 6:43 PM</a><br><br>

For one thing anyway I reckon It'll be a good source of comfort (and hopefully motivation) for myself and for a lot of people to know despite everything that's happened western civilization was still able to bring about some lasting change (hopefully) for the better.<br><br>For example, I've been toying for a while with Niall Fergusons book 'Civilization: The six killer apps of western power". His six killer apps are(if you haven't read the book) Competition, Science, Property Rights, Consumption, Medicine and Work. Now of course, the book is very much a civil religion of progress cheerlead and it almost completely ignores the role of non renewable resources in the rise of western power, but, so far as pitching these ideas into the mainstream in a form easily accessible and less uncomfortable to an average person is concerned, it might be a useful starting point.<br><br>I guess what I'm most impressed by in the book, is the presentability of the analysis, rather than the conclusions he comes to. Still, as you've said yourself in this post, science producing technological advances initially had nothing to do with non-renewable resources. Similar cases in some form might be made in the fields of law (encompassing proerty rights) and medicine (allowing for all the energy required to keep up our current medical institutions). competition seen in the context of an antifragile model (see Nassim Talebs latest book), might also have some validity. Personally work and consumption I'd leave out. Consumption relies on an abundance of resources and 'work' is far too often simply a deferred gratification/class oppressing weapon in drag.<br><br>Anyway thanks for the post. <br><br>Cheers<br><br>Tom<br><br><a href=the-four-industrial-revolutions.html#c3814256191594595818 title="comment permalink">4/9/14, 7:20 PM</a><br><br>

The dam in N. California, Shasta, sends electricity to large portions of western states not bordered by an ocean. It creates a huge lake made mostly of numerous, root like arms that are pretty deep. Its entirely possible to open the spillways and let the river run naturally and that would clean out an amazing amount of fine silt down the main channel. (It being a given that the Sacramento Delta wasn't being used for farming because of rising sea levels or simply lack of residents.) In less mountainous areas a silted dam would make excellent farm soil. It could be carted away or used in place to grow crops and basically be sub irrigated by the river that spawned the dam. ;) Of course that would also depend on what was up-stream, whether or not there was any dirty mining or manufacturing in the area. That is the case for Keswick Dam (which provides power for Redding), just down stream of Shasta which is up stream of a super fund pollution site that can't be cleaned up because it is in large part natural but acerbated by mining, (Iron Mountain Mine), in the late 1800's. The ecological damage from cutting trees for fueling the smelters and the toxic clouds released by them is enough to make a Druid cry a hundred years later.<br><br>It appears some members of the human race are masters of destroying the environment where ever they go.

As for 'hesperotechnic', yes :-))<br><br>@Deborah Bender: "It might be happenstance that social arrangements favorable to the Baconian revolution first arose (as far as we know) in Western Europe" -- My take on that is the (major) pertinent factor in Western European society of the time was the religious Reformation. The rise of Protestantism and the consequent breaking of the stranglehold of the Catholic Church on intellectual life probably had a profound significance in freeing up alternative ways of looking at the world. This was the era of iconoclasm, after all.<br><br>@onething -- Tesla is a controversial figure, but two things must be remembered - he was brilliant, then he went a little crazy. Much of what is claimed on his behalf by modern acolytes is largely wishful hand-wavy conspiracy-fodder. A fascinating pursuit, but a diversion from doing something productive like Green Wizardry.<br><br>On another front, I've dredged my old 'steampunk calculator' out of the spare room and have begun relearning its usage.

I love my computer…and the internet. Experiencing hunger, thirst, cold and no internet are all in the same list for me. I have lots of books (love the local library) and have many knowledgeable good friends. But here are examples of why the internet provides a foundation for day to day living for me:<br>• Many seeds are very hard to germinate and although I am a Master Gardener and active at the Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center, it is the internet that provided dozens of suggestions for germination—not all of which worked but the luxury of the information was wonderful.<br>• An internet search located a new guardian dog for our little farm. His mother was the chicken guardian on the farm where he was raised and his father walked the family children to the bus and came home when they were aboard. Of course dogs are available within a reasonable drive who will kill coyotes and other predators who threaten stock, but finding one safe with children and chickens is tricky.<br>• I enjoy warm and informative email exchanges with a fiber processor a thousand miles from me. No one local will take the wool we shear from our three sheep and turn it into yarn. Mail it, select the yarn type I want (from rug to lace weight) and the dyes I want and voila’.<br><br>I suppose my point is that information exchange may be a problem in our future, not just for 'discussion' but for hard information necessary for survival. <br><br>The Bacon-influenced world was driven in part by the wealth pump operating in the New World, providing, well, lawyers, guns and money, among other things. Glenn is right that in the 11th to 13th centuries a great deal of invention was practiced and information and technology was exchanged in medieval fairs. Mail service is pretty much based on fossil fuels so I worry about that. Without a wealth pump (astroid mining anyone??) I think we may be back to fairs and face to face gatherings.<br><br>We'll miss our internet! In response to comments that accuse computer use of interfering with our thinking deeply, I can only say we should treasure these information-rich days. I enjoy my coffee on Thursday mornings with the Archdruid Report and a community that honestly discusses our future. I like access to Russian writers discussing the Ukraine situation; I enjoy Ron Patterson’s report on the current oil situation. I am accused in my family of thinking too much when I attempt to discuss reality and it is comforting to be able to ground myself reading others who also think too much. <br><br><br><a href=the-four-industrial-revolutions.html#c4176978518133138551 title="comment permalink">4/10/14, 8:05 AM</a><br><br>

Apparently the solution to all our problems was supressed...."<br><br>To which I replied:<br><br>"I think Tesla is rolling in his grave every time somebody borrows his name to label the latest perpetual motion delusion. I don't know why he, as opposed to the other inventors of his generation, has been drafted into this role.<br><br>For some reason, too, magnets have confused people more than other perpetual motion schemes. I don't hear too many people suggesting that sailboats <br>carry along big fans to make their own wind. But magnet-based schemes are a dime a dozen. There are even those who believe that a magnet outside the <br>fuel line in a car will somehow make it more efficient, or that a magnetic wristband will cure what ails you.<br><br>The great thing about studying physics is that you learn integrative <br>concepts. Such as: you can't have energy pouring out of a closed system without depleting something within. Conservation of energy and all that. Once you get that, you avoid spending endless hours re-arranging those <br>magnets in the vain hope that they'll somehow find the way to make them chase each others' tails.<br><br>And then there's the perpetual blaming of the energy cartels for hiding all the great free-energy ideas. As if they could stop all those who would market such things, if they existed, as they'd have obvious economic <br>advantage. Look at how solar panels are now selling in the billions. The oil and coal companies cannot stop them.<br><br>PS: I suspect most of the quotes attributed to Tesla are false. (So are many of those attributed to Einstein too, for that matter.)

The Baconian revolution happened in Europe at the time when Europeans happened to plunder the human and natural resources of other continents. And they did that in ways, and at rates, that depleted those resources just as if they were non-renewable. Think of native Carribeans enslaved in such a way that new slaves had to be brought in from Africa (on an ongoing basis) to keep the sugar industry going. Think of the forests of North America that were quickly depleted by use as fuel, before turning to the inferior resource, coal, out of necessity - just as happened a bit earlier in Europe. Think of the temporary and limited capacity to convince people in the Old World to give up their labor and savings in return for gold plundered from the New World, before inflation kicked in.<br><br><br><a href=the-four-industrial-revolutions.html#c8904422259544301346 title="comment permalink">4/10/14, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

A couple of quotes come to mind from books in your <a href=../../2009/02/deindustrial-reading-list.html rel=nofollow>de-industrial reading list</a>, in the context of the terms ancient/medieval/modern.<br><br>Spengler:<br>"I see world-history as a picture of endless formations and transformations, of the marvelous waxing and waning of organic forms. The professional historian, on the contrary, sees it as a sort of tapeworm industriously adding on to itself one epoch after another."<br><br>Toynbee [abridged]:<br>"While the division between 'ancient' and 'modern' stands for the break beween Hellenic and Western history, the division between 'medieval' and 'modern' only stands for the transition between one chapter of Western history and another. ...and there is ample reason for supposing that we have recently passed into a new chapter whose beginnings may be placed around 1875. So we have:<br>Western I ('Dark Ages'), 675-1075.<br>Western II ('Middle Ages'), 1075-1475.<br>Western III ('Modern'), 1475-1875.<br>Western IV ('Post-Modern'?), 1875-?<br>"<br><br>I dare say that 100 years from now, the idea that around 1970 we entered a post-modern age will be quite a knee-slapper!<br><br>I've only thus far gone through the introductions, where the above are found, but I'll get into them in earnest after I complete an upcoming permaculture course. I have a childhood dream of rehabilitating forest, and it's making itself known again in my second half of life. Speaking of permaculture, I think it's a good system, and its adherents mean well, but they're just as likely to fall into the apocolypse/cornucopian duality as anyone else.

If ever there was a crooning lullaby of self-deceiving incantation, that must be it. Just hearing it makes me feel like I've snuggled up in a warm fuzzy shoe. Seems like you must have used some cold prickly elitist notion like logic or something to do it. Very unfashionable! <br><br>Your parsing of the several industrial revolutions was also very informative. I now have a considerably clearer notion of our historical situation vis-a-vis tech, and what is or is not likely to be feasible in future. <br><br>Incidentally, I'd like to report a small success in terms of educating friends about peak oil and related matters. Yesterday I received a call from a friend who had been asking himself about renewable energy. He wanted to know why putting solar panels on the roof of his condo and such-like measures couldn't adequately substitute for the usual municipal power sources, as I had told him before. This clearly had him so perplexed that it was like a little cloud of question marks over his head. I explained by using the concept of energy density. Using your example, I asked him what mileage per gallon he gets in his car (33 mpg). I then asked him how much energy it would take take for him to push his car that far. That, I said, is how much energy is embodied in one gallon of gasoline. I could tell this really came home for him. I then followed up by pointing out that the difference between this and renewables is that the latter represent currently incoming energy, while the former is energy sequestered over hundreds of millions of years. Here's the kicker: he got it. He brightened up considerably, his perplexity banished, and said "Oh! Now I get it," thanked me for explaining, and shortly thereafter concluded the call. <br><br>For a moment or two, I began to attempt to explain to him about the Hirsch report, the surplus energy needed for a successful transition to renewables, and the too-lateness of our doing so now; but I thought better of it, and cut myself off. I could tell he wasn't ready to hear it yet. For one thing, the too-lateness is the bummer part of the peak oil story. A person has to be properly prepped to hear a line of reasoning that leads to "and that's why our civilization as we know it is doomed." Furthermore, that's not the next logical step of my disquisition. The next logical step would be to explain about EROEI and how it relates to renewables and "innovative" fracking tech and related economic film-flam. If my friend asks me further about such matters, that's what I'll follow up with. But I would probably never have known any of it without the peak oil blogosphere.<br><br><a href=the-four-industrial-revolutions.html#c6797680703051308204 title="comment permalink">4/10/14, 12:11 PM</a><br><br>

I cannot prove it, but my conjecture is that the presence of the plundered wealth -- a one-time drawdown of natural and human capital -- is what made the "revolution" in machinery, mass production, etc both economically desirable and economically possible. The organizational structures set up for the purpose also revved up the industrial growth juggernaut, leading to depletion of the stored, if nominally renewable, resources much faster than could have been.<br><br>You ask why, say, the Roman empire didn't do the same, given that it too plundered from afar? Perhaps that's a necessary but not sufficient condition. Or perhaps we can say that the Romans did do it: they did develop a lot of sophisticated technologies and mass produced many products (such as the good-quality pottery you often mention). And their system collapsed when they, too, ran into the limits of their empire's wealth pump operating on a steadily-impoverishing subject populations and lands relative to the empire's steadily increasing complexity. In other words, they, too, did not quite live within their ongoing solar income. E.g., trees for serious lumber and fuel certainly ran short. The Baconian revolution may have faded away similarly, had it not been for the Wattian revolution happening right on its heels.<br><br>But why didn't the Romans discover coal?<br><br><br><a href=the-four-industrial-revolutions.html#c6332589056696827402 title="comment permalink">4/10/14, 2:07 PM</a><br><br>

Hydrogen is gotten via electrolysis, and some CO2 is present in the seawater and can be separated, and the two combined chemically in ways not dissimilar to coal-to-liquid or gas-to-liquid facilities.

Much more so than I. Although they have come to depend on the reliable water and food here over summer. Fortunately there is plenty of good sized timber to build that ark!<br><br>The rain is wind driven, almost horizontal and lashing the windows. Not a nice day to be outside as a couple of inches have been dumped. The infrastructure is holding up pretty well. Off the property is another story though as it is very muddy (not here though - mud is a sign of dysfunctional land).<br><br>The reserve water tanks are starting to fill, but they'll need at least another 4 inches of rain before they're full.<br><br>You know, it is strange, but I've read quite a few independent accounts of how unusual combinations of animals can act in quite a civilised manner when sheltering from bushfires. I'd always dismissed those accounts as some sort of rural legend, but nowadays I'm not so sure.<br><br>Hi Mr O.<br><br>Great questions. <br><br>The system itself uses about 0.5kWh / day.<br><br>A refrigerator uses about 1.0kWh / day. The inside of the house is pleasantly warm due to the wood fire (heating, cooking and water), but this means that the refrigerator has to work in order to compensate.<br><br>If it gets desperate, the laptop uses about 1/4 of the energy that a desktop PC uses. I don't leave them on whilst they are not in use.<br><br>The only things on standby are small things such as weather station, pump controllers, smoke alarms etc. These all use about 0.3kWh / day.<br><br>The remainder is used up by lights and pumps (water). Everything else is switched off at the wall. The house pump uses 0.5kW when it is in operation so you can start to get a feel for how tight the usage needs to be.<br><br>The old timers used to have batteries in glass jars. I think they were nickel iron (NiFe) batteries and they have a very long life span. The Chinese still manufacture them, but they are really expensive. The batteries here have a maximum life span of 20 years, although I do know of people that have used lead-acid batteries for 25+ years. I have no idea how you could purchase nickel plate, so if anyone has any ideas?<br><br>The trick with ensuring a long life for deep cycle batteries is to not use them and keep them charged with an occasional heavy discharge. The more you use them and the greater the energy that you constantly discharge from them, the shorter their working life is.<br><br>Just for your interest, after 5 days of this weather, the batteries are at about 80% full. They hold 30kWh of storage. Over winter, they'll get as low as 50% full, but I'm hoping this year that it will be better than this because of the many modifications which go on here.<br><br>Great questions.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-four-industrial-revolutions.html#c8307351817104174291 title="comment permalink">4/10/14, 5:09 PM</a><br><br>

You get tonight's gold star for noticing the thing that every economist misses. <br><br>Kevin, "cold prickly elitist logic" is a keeper. It reminds me of the irate comment by a manufacturer of bogus Celtic pagan traditions that one of her critics was "mean, cruel, and academic." As for the conversation with your friend, excellent! Definitely take it one step at a time; this is a lot for anyone to get used to in a hurry. <br><br>Rich, I'm quite sure that agriculture can be made sustainable, since that has already happened in a good many areas -- consider East Asian rice paddy agriculture, which has maintained stable harvests for millennia without depleting the soil. <a href=../../2006/07/feeding-deindustrial-future.html rel=nofollow>As I've noted here more than once</a>, I suspect that future generations will consider the development of organic agriculture over the next century to be the most important achievement of our civilization. <br><br>Daelach, another simple method is to prearrange with the other person to each have a copy of the same obscure edition of the same obscure book. You agree to use 100 pages from that book -- not pages 1 through 100, but even numbered pages from 130 on or something like that. You send a series of five digit numbers; 34296 would mean the 34th page, line 29, word 6. I've been told that unless the cryptanalyst can figure out what book you're using, a code of this kind is effectively unbreakable. <br><br>Moshe, you're confounding two unrelated questions. The first is what conditions were required for the Baconian revolution to happen in the first place, and you've offered a speculative answer. The second is whether the results of the Baconian revolution can be retooled for a sustainable ecotechnic society; that's the question I'm trying to address here, and that's an entirely different matter. In the case of the Wattean, Ottonian, and Fermian revolutions, the dependence of the resulting technologies on nonrenewable resources is obvious; in the case of the Baconian, not so, and thus I think it's worth exploring the possibility that a Baconian technology could remain in use on a renewable-resource basis. <br><br>Rich, that's exactly the same sort of logic. It's equivalent to insisting that if we return to some older technology, a monster will jump out from beneath the bed and eat us. Yes, I'll certainly address that in a future post, and in the process show that slavery is the last thing we have to worry about in the next couple of centuries. <br><br>Moshe, okay, that makes a certain amount of sense.<br><br>SMJ, I haven't just heard of it, I've read several volumes of the long edition -- it's an excellent source for information on Chinese alchemy. Similar craft traditions were common in many high civilizations; there was a qualitiative as well as a quantitative difference between those and the industrial revolutions that took place in the western world. (A case could be made that China had its own Baconian revolution, but the other three? No, because the exploitation of concentrated energy resources didn't take place.) <br><br>Flagg, if they're beginning to worry about it, that's an excellent sign. They should be worrying themselves haggard about it. <br><br>William, in the same way, vacuum-tube electronics didn't strictly have that much to do with the internal combustion engine.

I am reminded of the modern Christian parable of the man in the flood zone who believed God would save him. For those unfamiliar with it is stated here, http://blog.eternalvigilance.me/2012/01/the-parable-of-the-flood/. With a few alterations the parable would seem to be a tolerable fit for our current situation.<br><br>On the subject of aspects of the Fermian revolution surviving. An aspect which I haven't seen much discussed is that of preserving the algorithms. It is technically possible for any computer algorithms to be executed by a trained human, and it seems likely that it will be practical for many algorithms to be executed by trained individuals in the de-industrial future. Could I suggest that those who use algorithms often in their current work, should learn how to perform those same algorithms by hand, and get a sense of how large of a problem they could practically do. I suspect that scientists who actually know how to calculate a Discrete Fourier Transform in the same way that Guass did in the 19th century, rather than getting Mathlab do it will have a distinct advantage when having access to a computer which can run Mathlab is restricted. It would be a shame if all of these algorithms were lost simply because it didn't occur to people that they could be performed by a human rather than because they actually are impractical in the de-industrial future (which many of them will be).<br><br>Also with respect to the book cipher. I would suspect that the problem with that setup is that if the crypt-analysts really wanted to know what book you were using they would probably be able to search both of your respective book collections/check what books you each checked out of the library around the writing/reading of the letter in order to narrow the list of possible books down.

Cryptanalysts love it because it can be proved mathematically to be secure, which is not always true for other more practical methods, but my opinion is that it is borderline close to Mencken's quote: "There is always an easy solution to every human problem--neat, plausible, and wrong."<br><br>For starters, if you try to use one dice roll per letter (which is already a lot) you are not using a one time pad, but a clever variation of a Ceasar Cipher, which has been known to be badly broken for at least a century. If you use the latin alphabet, you need at least 6 dice rolls in order to produce a number between 0 and 30 (in the ballpark of the number of symbols in the alphabet), but by just adding the result of each roll you will produce a number that is strongly biased towards the middle of the range, another more convoluted but not particulary improved version of the Caesar Cipher variation. So the construction is not trivial, and honestly who has the time to roll the dices so many times!!!<br><br>Our host's approach sounds promising, but of course it lacks the mathematical rigor tha makes One Time Pad construction such a bedrock of moder cryptography. The main problem I find in it is that you are limited to encode message whose individual words are all contained in the key book. And if the word is contained just once of twice the attacker will know that you are sending the same code over and over again, even if they cannot at first guess what it is. So, ideally you need two forms of encoding, a short form that lets you send common words in a compact way, and a long form that lets you spell a single word using the first letter of each code, or something along the lines.<br><br>By the way, don't you even thing about combining the two approaches. If you use a natural language phrase as a key for the One Time Pad, patterns are going to emerge. This happens because not all sequences of letters are equally likely in any given language. And if you combine two pads with the same pattern, another recognizable pattern is likely to emerge. I am sure there are ways to work around this, but it would require much more effort than what can be achieved by an Internet comment.<br><br><br><a href=the-four-industrial-revolutions.html#c118245172897576526 title="comment permalink">4/10/14, 10:59 PM</a><br><br>

The weak point is the key and how it was made. To achieve theoretical uncyptanalyzability, the numbers in the key must be truly random, and true randomness is very, very hard to achieve in the real, physical world -- not impossible, but impractical, or practical only with great difficulty.<br><br>Decades ago the pads were made by relatively few typists attempting to hit number keys at random, but much as one can recognize the individual "fist" of a telegrapher using Morse code, so eventually the cryptanalysts learned to recognize the individual "fists" of the typists who created the one-time pads, and then to tease out the non-random patterns in their muscle movements as they typed their pads. This was enough to decrypt the messages encrypted with a typist's pad, given enough encrypted text.<br><br>More recently, the keys have been generated by complex algorithms such as so-called pseudo-random number generators. These keys are indeed "pseudo-random," and messages encrypted by them have also been decrypted. <br><br>Book ciphers can, in principle, also be decrypted by similar sorts of analyses, given enough encrypted text and reasonable certainty as to the language of the clear message and the key (English or German or, say, Ukrainian, vel sim.). If anything, they are a little easier to decrypt than one-time pad messages. <br><br>Of course, not every encrypted message can be decrypted in practice. Sometimes the amount of encrypted text available to the cryptanalyst is too small for these complex statistical methods of cryptanalysis to be applied with success. So rarity of use is an excellent defense against cryptanalysis. Since we are a chattering species by nature, this defense is not commonly used.<br><br>Successful cryptanalysis of messages encrypted by these statistical methods is enormously facilitated by the availability of powerful electronic computers. If ever we come to the point where even the NSA and similar agencies no longer have the use of such computers, then of course many messages that could be decrypted in principle will become undecryptable in practice, or not worth the use of scarce or expensive energy to decrypt them.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-four-industrial-revolutions.html#c5160701665974990393 title="comment permalink">4/11/14, 1:42 AM</a><br><br>

The technologies of the 'industrial revolution' have indeed included many phases and tracking them by the energy sources is a pretty good division. A challenge is that the scientific insights that developed in different phases of the revolution are not so tightly tied to the energy source...so the telegraph doesn't really go with the steam engine. (Most early electrical discoveries were actually made with chemical batteries). And solid state electronics don't really have any substantial connection to nuclear power. (Solid state electronics relies on properties of semiconductor crystals that are totally free of any nuclear reactions.) I would argue that we don't really know what technologies will be available to scientists who understand quantum mechanics, electro-magnetism, material science, and biochemistry, but don't have concentrated fossil energy sources. There is very little historical precedent since coal power was already widely available before the science developed. I agree though with the main point...that the scientific part of the industrial revolution will likely survive but the parts dependent on concentrated energy will not. I would guess that not just the early modern science, but most all of the basic scientific story ( how matter is made of atoms from the periodic table interacting by electro-magnetic forces under the laws of quantum mechanics and all the way through biology) will survive. It is just too useful even if energy supplies are tight. Now what technology we will make with it...that is very hard to say.<br><br><a href=the-four-industrial-revolutions.html#c4172478334964076977 title="comment permalink">4/11/14, 2:40 PM</a><br><br>

For sparing the calculations, I have made a table which dice combination corresponds to what character/digit. Plus that this way ensures a uniform distribution. Never just add the dice numbers because that gives a bell curve (as any backgammon player will know).<br><br>Oh and btw, using a natural phrase as key is known as Viginere cypher, and that has been broken about 150 years ago - without computers, naturally. I could break a Viginere cypher myself with pen and paper, given enough time and enough cyphertext.<br><br>Setting up the one time pad scheme the right way isn't trivial, but using it is easy - that's work sharing. Like forging a knive is difficult, but using it isn't.<br><br>I estimated that you need about 5 seconds per throw including looking up the table and writing down the result, so for a 160 character pad, you need about 15 minutes. For an easier start, I have developed a computer program that will throw out lots of pads - though programming "randomness" on a deterministic machine is difficult, especially because you can't use the usual random() functions.<br><br>Of course, you will not encode long and winded letters, rather important portions. Or maybe if we have a Baconian future, maybe with a good deal of warlord feudalism (like in most failed states even today), there will be a job for a cryptographer whose task it is to cypher the letters of those in power. Like Thomas Phelippes who worked for Francis walsingham. Phelippes cracked e.g. the letters from and to Mary Stuart.<br><br>The book approach has an even bigger problem: if ever the secret is broken (the used book gets known), messages can be compromised in hindsight, so that's like a ticking time bomb. Onetimepads will never be broken once both sender and receiver have destroyed their pads after use. Torture can be used with one time pads, but there is no way to tell whether the victim is saying the truth. On the other hand, torture would be useful with the book message because the victim's statement can be verified: only the correct book will decrypt the collected encrypted messages into meaningful cleartext.<br><br><br>@ Robert:<br><br>Onetimepads have not been broken - the Venona project where the Soviets' OTP encrypted messages where proken was only possible because the Soviets reused the pads in the chaos of wartime conditions. Of course it is breakable if you reuse them, but then this isn't a <i>one time</i> pad anymore.<br><br>Plus that it is obvious you can't use the usual random() functions on a computer because their "secret" is the seed value, a 32bit integer - so it comes down to a 32bit encryption, and that's nothing if the opponents still have computers.<br><br><a href=the-four-industrial-revolutions.html#c2802663115583959272 title="comment permalink">4/12/14, 12:45 AM</a><br><br>

I remember when I first came upon this blog there was a discussion about slide rules vs log/anti-log tables and whether or not it would be possible to preserve said tables. What I thought was noticeably absent from that discussion was preserving the knowledge have how to calculate the tables, and consequently how to work out the measurements for your slide rule, would be invaluable to anyone who wishes to preserve either of those two technologies.<br><br>That said more generally I'm not certain. One of the reasons why in my original comment I called on those who used algorithms regularly in their work to learn how those algorithms worked is because those are the people who are most likely to known how the algorithm is used and thus how applicable they actually are. For example I mentioned the algorithm to calculate a discrete Fourier transform. While I know that the discrete Fourier transform is used extensively today for a multitude of different purposes, and has been around for at least a couple of centuries, I personally have no experience of using it in my own work. Thus while I suspect that it would be useful for scientists to learn the fast method of calculating the transform by hand (the obvious method for calculating the transform is orders of magnitude slower than the fast methods which have been developed), I think those who actually use it would be in a better position to comment on it's application in a de-industrial future. <br><br>I personally am interested in linear programming, which is a method of maximizing/minimizing profit/loss with respect to a system of equations. Unfortunately this also falls into the category of something which I don't have much practical experience with (My career thus far has been involved with things which I'm pretty sure are going to be of very little use after the long descent) but I know that it is currently used for many diverse problems, from working out the cheapest way to fulfill all of somebodies dietary needs to how to best transport supplies to where they are needed. As such I'm interested to see how practical it is to do a reasonable sized problem by hand and which of the currently used algorithms is best for a human computer. It will be interested to see if LP and related optimization methods will have a place in the ecotechnic future.<br><br><a href=the-four-industrial-revolutions.html#c9184099135172811435 title="comment permalink">4/12/14, 8:51 AM</a><br><br>

I'm perfectly willing to believe that this isn't your intention -- but in that case, what conclusions do you draw from your speculation? <br><br>Cherokee, that's becoming increasingly common here as well -- ham radio operators who want to work in emergencies are expected to get the digital gear. I'm far from sure it's a good idea, but if it becomes problematic, it's probably a safe bet that the hams will switch back to older gear in a hurry. <br><br>William, the word "indefinitely" is meaningless when you're dealing with the accelerating consumption of a finite, nonrenewable resource. Deepwater oil is already in production, and geologists have been locating promising drilling sites for decades now; the amount of oil that's available from that source was factored into peak oil analyses from the beginning. Remember that the oil wells being drilled and pumped today have to make up for declining production at existing oilfields!<br><br>The thing I find most interesting about the sales pitch you received was the notion that deepwater oil was the final frontier.

My plan was to develop a set of climate-specific patterns covering passive heating, solar hot water, solar cooking, etc. That fell through when one of his acolytes, who was teaching the Pattern Language course that semester, sneeringly dismissed me in front of the class one day. "Solar is just a fad. In a few years, it will all be over." She then turned around and walked away, so that I had no chance to reply.

She remembered me. "So, are you still doing that 'solar' thing?" As it happens, I had just thrown in the towel, after six years as a solar architecture consultant. I couldn't make enough to pay the rent and was switching to software (where I've had a successful - if historically irrelevant - career). <br><br>I had to work hard to keep from crying.

Aluminum production is also largely male. The Icelandic Climate is very tough on land as well - a quite "macho" attitude is required to function.<br><br>Yet, cultural evolution has lead to a high degree of gender equality (outside professions like fishing).<br><br>The well managed fisheries of Iceland are, I believe, connected with gender equality and other Social Democratic values. There are common values in both that also promote social survival. <br><br>Centuries old Newfoundland fishing villages were destroyed by overfishing - a fate Iceland was willing to go to war with the Royal Navy to avoid. Why did Canada not see - and act on - the same information that Iceland acted so decisively to avoid ? <br><br>Because Iceland is a better evolved society than Canada (and Canada is ahead of the USA). Gender equality is another part of that same evolution.<br><br>Comparable cultural evolution is leading Denmark to set the goal of being oil free by 2050 (and reduced their per capita carbon emissions by -26.5% in 5 years).<br><br>Preserving sustainable fisheries, getting off oil, saving &amp; investing instead of spending oil royalties (Norway) are all pro-survival traits.

That implies that the sexes in Iceland are more equal today than they were in the past. <br><br>Do you know this to be true or are you assuming it?<br><br> The Scandinavian peoples adopted Christianity late, and retain some cultural attitudes from their pagan past. I have a general impression that the Vikings, despite being very warlike people, had more equal power relations between the sexes than many other peoples of that period. I would welcome comments from the better informed, if it's not too far off topic.<br><br>Like other social democratic countries, I presume Iceland provides families with high quality childcare, which makes a great difference in people's freedom of choice about work. Because the United States is not a social democratic country, American feminists have tried to solve the childcare question by getting men to do more unpaid childcare and housework, with moderate success. In the US, high quality paid childcare remains a prerogative of the upper middle class and the rich. <br><br>My general point was that most movements for equality and justice take a long time to gain results and do so in the teeth of violent opposition. That's true of the labor movement, which has had as many setbacks as successes. The campaign for racial equality in the US entailed a long bloody civil war followed by one hundred fifty years of often violent struggle, and isn't over yet. The campaign to get women the vote took three generations. <br><br>By contrast, some of the goals of the second wave of the feminist movement were won in two generations with little violence. I don't believe such a rapid change in laws, social attitudes and economic arrangements happens without support from powerful interests.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-four-industrial-revolutions.html#c634669925282847646 title="comment permalink">4/15/14, 4:23 PM</a><br><br>

Those who return home in triumph e.g. as winners of a war or raid then are those in power.

If the society gives in to that wish, it will just be wiped out in the long run by other societies that either don't give in (less probable to work) or where women experience the mother role as individual fulfilment.<br><br>Cf. also what Spengler wrote about the "Ibsen-women" and the plummeting birth rate before a collapse as it was observed in both ancient Greece and Rome. Btw., Rome did try to enforce more births, that was the point of the marriage laws. It didn't work, that's why I said that the enforcing approach rather won't work.<br><br>The other possibility, being wiped out by a society where women see being mothers as their primary fulfilment (means: this IS what they want) corresponds to the birth of what Spengler called a new culture soul that will prevail against an old and dying one, in the most simple case just by numbers. It is normal that cultures are born, grow up, mature, age and die, just like individual human beings.<br><br>We are in a late phase, an already dying civilisation, among other things to be recognised by the very fact that women seriously think about mothership instead of taking it as just "natural".<br><br>That's the way things go, nothing lasts forever.<br><br>And gender equality being a product of a dying civilisation will not survive it's death.
