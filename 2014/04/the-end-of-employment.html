Nothing is easier, as the Long Descent begins to pick up speed around us, than giving in to despair—and nothing is more pointless. Those of us who are alive today are faced with the hugely demanding task of coping with the consequences of industrial civilization’s decline and fall, and saving as many as possible of the best achievements of the last few centuries so that they can cushion the descent and enrich the human societies of the far future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That won’t be easy; so?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The same challenge has been faced many times before, and quite often it’s been faced with relative success. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The circumstances of the present case are in some ways more difficult than past equivalents, to be sure, but the tools and the knowledge base available to cope with them are almost incomparably greater. All in all, factoring in the greater challenges and the greater resources, it’s probably fair to suggest that the challenge of our time is about on a par with other eras of decline and fall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The only question that still remains to be settled is how many of the people who are awake to the imminence of crisis will rise to the challenge, and how many will fail to do so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The suicide of peak oil writer Mike Ruppert two days ago puts a bit of additional emphasis on that last point. I never met Ruppert, though we corresponded back in the days when his “From The Wilderness” website was one of the few places on the internet that paid any attention at all to peak oil, and I don’t claim to know what personal demons drove him to put a bullet through his brain. Over the last eight years, though, as the project of this blog has brought me into contact with more and more people who are grappling with the predicament of our time, I’ve met a great many people whose plans for dealing with a postpeak world amount to much the same thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some of them are quite forthright about it, which at least has the virtue of honesty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Rather more of them conceal the starkness of that choice behind a variety of convenient evasions, the insistence that we’re all going to die soon anyway being far and away the most popular of these just now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I admit to a certain macabre curiosity about how that will play out in the years ahead. I’ve suspected for a while now, for example, that the baby boomers will manage one final mediagenic fad on the way out, and the generation that marked its childhood with coonskin caps and hula hoops and its puberty with love beads and Beatlemania will finish with a fad for suicide parties, in which attendees reminisce to the sound of the tunes they loved in high school, then wash down pills with vodka and help each other tie plastic bags over their heads. Still, I wonder how many people will have second thoughts once every other option has gone whistling down the wind, and fling themselves into an assortment of futile attempts to have their cake when they’ve already eaten it right down to the bare plate. We may see some truly bizarre religious movements, and some truly destructive political ones, before those who go around today insisting that they don’t want to live in a deindustrial world finally get their wish. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are, of course, plenty of other options. The best choice for most of us, as I’ve noted here <a href=../../2012/06/collapse-now-and-avoid-rush.html>in previous posts</a>, follows a strategy I’ve described wryly as “collapse first and avoid the rush:”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>getting ahead of the curve of decline, in other words, and downshifting to a much less extravagant lifestyle while there’s still time to pick up the skills and tools needed to do it competently. Despite the strident insistence from defenders of the status quo that anything less than business as usual amounts to heading straight back to the caves, it’s entirely possible to have a decent and tolerably comfortable life on a tiny fraction of the energy and resource base that middle class Americans think they can’t possibly do without. Mind you, you have to know how to do it, and that’s not the sort of knowledge you can pick up from a manual, which is why it’s crucial to start now and get through the learning curve while you still have the income and the resources to cushion the impact of the inevitable mistakes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is more or less what I’ve been saying for eight years now. The difficulty at this stage in the process, though, is that a growing number of Americans are running out of time. I don’t think it’s escaped the notice of many people in this country that despite all the cheerleading from government officials, despite all the reassurances from dignified and clueless economists, despite all those reams of doctored statistics gobbled down whole by the watchdogs-turned-lapdogs of the media and spewed forth undigested onto the evening news, the US economy is not getting better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Outside a few privileged sectors, times are hard and getting harder; more and more Americans are slipping into the bleak category of the long-term unemployed, and a great many of those who can still find employment work at part-time positions for sweatshop wages with no benefits at all.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Despite all the same cheerleading, reassurances, and doctored statistics, furthermore, the US economy is not going to get better: not for more than brief intervals by any measure, and not at all if “better”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>means returning to some equivalent of America’s late 20th century boomtime. Those days are over, and they will not return. That harsh reality is having an immediate impact on some of my readers already, and that impact will only spread as time goes on. For those who have already been caught by the economic downdrafts, it’s arguably too late to collapse first and avoid the rush; willy-nilly, they’re already collapsing as fast as they can, and the rush is picking up speed around them as we speak. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For those who aren’t yet in that situation, the need to make changes while there’s still time to do so is paramount, and a significant number of my readers seem to be aware of this. One measure of that is the number of requests for personal advice I field, which has gone up steeply in recent months. Those requests cover a pretty fair selection of the whole gamut of human situations in a failing civilization, but one question has been coming up more and more often of late: the question of what jobs might be likely to provide steady employment as the industrial economy comes apart. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s a point I’ve been mulling over of late, since its implications intersect the whole tangled web in which our economy and society is snared just now. In particular, it assumes that the current way of bringing work together with workers, and turning the potentials of human mind and muscle toward the production of goods and services, is likely to remain in place for the time being, and it’s becoming increasingly clear to me that this won’t be the case. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s important to be clear on exactly what’s being discussed here. Human beings have always had to produce goods and services to stay alive and keep their families and communities going; that’s not going to change. In nonindustrial societies, though, most work is performed by individuals who consume the product of their own labor, and most of the rest is sold or bartered directly by the people who produce it to the people who consume it. What sets the industrial world apart is that a third party, the employer, inserts himself into this process, hiring people to produce goods and services and then selling those goods and services to buyers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s employment, in the modern sense of the word; most people think of getting hired by an employer, for a fixed salary or wage, to produce goods and services that the employer then sells to someone else, as the normal and natural state of affairs—but it’s a state of affairs that is already beginning to break down around us, because the surpluses that make that kind of employment economically viable are going away. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s begin with the big picture. In any human society, whether it’s a tribe of hunter-gatherers, an industrial nation-state, or anything else, people apply energy to raw materials to produce goods and services; this is what we mean by the word “economy.” The goods and services that any economy can produce are strictly limited by the energy sources and raw materials that it can access. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A principle that ecologists call Liebig’s law of the minimum is relevant here: the amount of anything<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>that a given species or ecosystem can produce in a given place and time is limited by whichever resource is in shortest supply. Most people get that when thinking about the nonhuman world; it makes sense that plants can’t use extra sunlight to make up for a shortage of water, and that you can’t treat soil deficient in phosphates by adding extra nitrates. It’s when you apply this same logic to human societies that the mental gears jam up, because we’ve been told so often that one resource can always be substituted for another that most people believe it without a second thought. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s going on here, though, is considerably more subtle than current jargon reflects. Examine most of the cases of resource substitution that find their way into economics textbooks, and you’ll find that what’s happened is that a process of resource extraction that uses less energy on a scarcer material has been replaced by another process that takes more energy but uses more abundant materials. The shift from high-quality iron ores to low-grade taconite that reshaped the iron industry in the 20th century, for example, was possible because ever-increasing amounts of highly concentrated energy could be put into the smelting process without making the resulting iron too expensive for the market. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The point made by this and comparable examples is applicable across the board to what I’ve termed technic societies, that subset of human societies—ours is the first, though probably not the last—in which a large fraction of total energy per capita comes from nonbiological sources and is put to work by way of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>machines rather than human or animal muscles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Far more often than not, in such societies, <i>concentrated energy is the limiting resource</i>. Given an abundant enough supply of concentrated energy at a low enough price, it would be possible to supply a technic society with raw materials by extracting dissolved minerals from seawater or chewing up ordinary rock to get a part per million or so of this or that useful element. Lacking that—and there are good reasons to think that human societies will always be lacking that—access to concentrated energy is where Liebig’s law bites down hard. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Another way to make this same point is to think of how much of any given product a single worker can make in a day using a set of good hand tools, and comparing that to the quantity of the same thing that the same worker could make using the successive generations of factory equipment, from the steam-driven and belt-fed power tools of the late 19th century straight through to the computerized milling machines and assembly-line robots of today. The difference can be expressed most clearly as a matter of the amount of energy being applied directly and indirectly to the manufacturing process—not merely the energy driving the tools through the manufacturing process, but the energy that goes into<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>manufacturing and maintaining the tools, supporting the infrastructure needed for manufacture and maintenance, and so on through the whole system involved in the manufacturing process. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Maverick economist E.F. Schumacher, whose work has been discussed in this blog many times already, pointed out that the cost per worker of equipping a workplace is one of the many crucial factors that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>mainstream economic thought invariably neglects. That cost is usually expressed in financial terms, but underlying the abstract tokens we call money is a real cost in energy, expressed in terms of the goods and services that have to be consumed in the process of equipping and maintaining the workplace. If you have energy to spare, that’s not a problem; if you don’t, on the other hand, you’re actually better off <a href=../../2010/02/why-factories-arent-efficient.html>using a less complex technology</a>—what Schumacher called “intermediate technology” and the movement in which I studied green wizardry thirty years ago called “appropriate technology.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The cost per worker of equipping a workplace, in turn, also has a political dimension—a point that Schumacher did not neglect, though nearly all other economists pretend that it doesn’t exist. The more costly it is to equip a workplace, the more certain it is that workers won’t be able to set themselves up in business, and the more control the very rich will then have over economic production and the supply of jobs. As Joseph Tainter pointed out in <i>The Collapse of Complex Societies</i>, social complexity correlates precisely with social hierarchy; one of the functions of complexity, in the workplace as elsewhere, is thus to maintain existing social pecking orders. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Schumacher’s arguments, though, focused on the Third World nations of his own time, which had very little manufacturing capacity at all—most of them, remember, had been colonies of European empires, assigned the role of producing raw materials and buying finished products from the imperial center as part of <a href=../../2012/02/nature-of-empire.html>the wealth pump that drove them into grinding poverty</a> while keeping their imperial overlords rich. He focused on advising client nations on how to build their own economies and extract themselves from the political grip of their former overlords, who were usually all too eager to import high-tech factories which their upper classes inevitably controlled. The situation is considerably more challenging when<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>your economy is geared to immense surpluses of concentrated energy, and the supply of energy begins to run short—and of course that’s the situation we’re in today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even if it were just a matter of replacing factory equipment, that would be a huge challenge, because all those expensive machines—not to mention the infrastructure that manufactures them, maintains them, supplies them, and integrates their products into the wider economy—count as sunk costs, subject to what social psychologists call the “Concorde fallacy,” the conviction that it’s less wasteful to keep on throwing money into a failing project than to cut your losses and do something else. The real problem is that it’s not just factory equipment; the entire economy has been structured from the ground up to use colossal amounts of highly concentrated energy, and everything that’s been invested in that economy since the beginning of the modern era thus counts as a sunk cost to one degree or another. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What makes this even more challenging is that very few people in the modern industrial world actually produce goods and services for consumers, much less for themselves, by applying energy to raw materials. The vast majority of today’s employees, and in particular all those who have the wealth and influence that come with high social status, don’t do this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Executives, brokers, bankers, consultants, analysts, salespeople—well, I could go on for pages: the whole range of what used to be called white-collar jobs exists to support the production of goods and services by the working joes and janes managing all the energy-intensive machinery down there on the shop floor. So does the entire vast maze of the financial industry, and so do the legions of government bureaucrats—local, state, and federal—who manage, regulate, or oversee one or another aspect of economic activity. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All these people are understandably just as interested in keeping their jobs as the working joes and janes down there on the shop floor, and yet the energy surpluses that made it economically viable to perch such an immensely complex infrastructure on top of the production of goods and services for consumers are going away. The result is a frantic struggle on everyone’s part to make sure that the other guy loses his job first. It’s a struggle that all of them will ultimately lose—as the energy surplus needed to support it dwindles away, so will the entire system that’s perched on that high but precarious support—and so, as long as that system remains in place, getting hired by an employer, paid a regular wage or salary, and given work and a workplace to produce goods and services that the employer then sells to someone else, is going to become increasingly rare and increasingly unrewarding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That transformation is already well under way. Nobody I know personally who works for an employer in the sense I’ve just outlined is prospering in today’s American economy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Most of the people I know who are employees in the usual sense of the word are having their benefits slashed, their working conditions worsened, their hours cut, and their pay reduced by one maneuver or another, and the threat of being laid off is constantly hovering over their heads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The few exceptions are treading water and hoping to escape the same fate. None of this is accidental, and none of it is merely the result of greed on the part of the very rich, though admittedly the culture of executive kleptocracy at the upper end of the American social pyramid is making things a good deal worse than they might otherwise be. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The people I know who are prospering right now are those who produce goods and services for their own use, and provide goods and services directly to other people, without having an employer to provide them with work, a workplace, and a regular wage or salary. Some of these people have to stay under the radar screen of the current legal and regulatory system, since the people who work in that system are trying to preserve their own jobs by making life difficult for those who try to do without their services. Others can do things more openly. All of them have sidestepped as many as possible of the infrastructure services that are supposed to be part of an employee’s working life—for example, they aren’t getting trained at universities, since the US academic industry these days is just another predatory business sector trying to keep itself afloat by running others into the ground, and they aren’t going to banks for working capital for much the same reason. They’re using their own labor, their own wits, and their own personal connections with potential customers, to find a niche in which they can earn the money (or barter for the goods) they need or want. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d like to suggest that this is the wave of the future—not least because this is how economic life normally operates in nonindustrial societies, where the vast majority of people in the workforce are directly engaged in the production of goods and services for themselves and their own customers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The surplus that supports all those people in management, finance, and so on is a luxury that nonindustrial societies don’t have. In the most pragmatic of economic senses, collapsing now and avoiding the rush involves getting out of a dying model of economics before it drags you down, and finding your footing in the emerging informal economy while there’s still time to get past the worst of the learning curve. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Playing by the rules of a dying economy, that is, is not a strategy with a high success rate or a long shelf life. Those of my readers who are still employed in the usual sense of the term may choose to hold onto that increasingly rare status, but it’s not wise for them to assume that such arrangements will last indefinitely; using the available money and other resources to get training, tools, and skills for some other way of getting by would probably be a wise strategy. Those of my readers who have already fallen through the widening cracks of the employment economy will have a harder row to hoe in many cases; for them, the crucial requirement is getting access to food, shelter, and other necessities while figuring out what to do next and getting through any learning curve that might be required. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
All these are challenges; still, like the broader challenge of coping with the decline and fall of a civilization, they are challenges that countless other people have met in other places and times. Those who are willing to set aside currently popular fantasies of entitlement and the fashionable pleasures of despair will likely be in a position to do the same thing this time around, too. </div>

While acknowledging the need for some income, Borsodi believed that at the time people could produce 70% of their needs in a household based economy, including food, shelter, and clothing. Of course, he was talking about a less material lifestyle. He didn't believe in producing an agricultural surplus. Instead one produced for one's own needs,and then, rather stopped, and went on to produce something else for his own use. Many of Borsodi's works are no longer subject to copyright and may be available online. JMG is right to get started now, and look for opportunities to learn more. For example, there was a bumper crop of apples in the Northeast US last summer and fall. Many rural folks ended up making hard cider and vinegar for the first time, picking up valuable experience and the accompanying basic equipment to use their new founded skills in the future. It never hurts to cut your energy use NOW. Prepping for our photovoltaic array we cut our electric use to 140kwh per month, still have electric lights and a computer, but gave up the dryer and go without a lot of the electronics. Many of the back to the landers from the 60's and 70's who didn't give up, often ended up with their feet in two worlds. That meant working professional jobs AND putting in long hours gardening, cutting firewood and a long list of other activities. Those folks can be a valuable resource if you happen to have any such folks living near you.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c2249097304305062838 title="comment permalink">4/16/14, 5:26 PM</a><br><br>

Whether I want to learn how to grow food, fix broken machinery, or weatherize houses, it's all right here. And the interesting thing is that it's actually a lot of fun to be hands on.

When Ruppert's death was reported on Raw Story, that's the tack that the reporter took, calling Ruppert a conspiracy theorist. That drew dozens, if now hundreds, of Ruppert's fans to defend him.<br><br>About that slant on the story, I have two things to say. First, it vastly underplayed Ruppert's involvement in the peak oil community. I don't know if this was a good thing or a bad thing. On the one hand, it slighted an important aspect of the man and his message. On the other hand, it didn't tar peak oil with the same brush as the conspiracy theories.<br><br>Second, it's a sign of how people on what passes for the American Left engaged in a form of "Evil, Be my Good." When an unnamed Bush Administration official mocked the Administration's critics as "The reality-based community," Bush's opponents almost seemed as one to say, "yes, we are reality-based, and you're not." I consider that to be one of the great rhetorical miscues of the 21st Century. The upshot was for the bulk of the anti-Bush crowd to reject conspiracy theories and conspiracy theorists as not reality-based, and that played out in the quotes Raw Story used in their obituary, including one from David Corn.<br><br>“'Conspiracy theories may seem more nuisance than problem,' wrote columnist David Corn about Ruppert’s work in 2002. 'But they do compete with reality for attention. There is plenty to be outraged over without becoming obsessed with X Files-like nonsense.'”<br><br>http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/04/15/911-truther-mike-ruppert-kills-himself-after-finishing-his-radio-show/<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c6619069210737670720 title="comment permalink">4/16/14, 6:00 PM</a><br><br>

One is the old joke of the waiter at the Presidential dinner address. The President says, "Under my administration, we've added (X number) of new jobs." The waiter mumbles, "Yeah, I've got three of them."<br><br>The other is a thought from Gene Logsdon, The Contrary Farmer, who points out that most farmers have jobs in town to support their habit. Both employments are economically sensible when combined.<br><br>And then here in Maine, there's lots of seasonal work. Digging clams and raking blueberries, cutting boughs for wreath makers in November and December, care-taking houses when the summer people are away, and the like. Of course some of these will change, but the idea of having a range of seasonal jobs is valid.<br><br>I think that maybe the two points to keep in mind are to be entrepreneurial, cutting out the middle man employer, and develop a range of occasional trades. If those trades produce food, extend the useful life of clothing or other manufactured goods, or help folks stay warm in the winter, so much the better. Maybe rather than training for a specific skill, there needs to be the equivalent of the classic liberal arts degree that's supposed to teach the student how to be adaptable to whatever the situation calls for. That flexibility and vision (cognate with wizard, of course) seems to me to be of the utmost importance. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c7185125714268059660 title="comment permalink">4/16/14, 6:23 PM</a><br><br>

I manage a casting studio in Los Angeles and am paid quite well, more than enough for a single man to comfortably live on. And yet the sacrifices that I am required to make in order to keep this job are significant. The reason I have been able to keep it for as long as I have is that I have a high tolerance for psychological punishment – long work hours (my days are rarely shorter than ten hours), abusive and neurotic clients and long stretches of stress or extreme boredom. Besides the good pay the one other consolation is that the on-the-job downtime is frequent, which has allowed me to work on a number of other projects while at work, including the post-peak story that I will be submitting next week and a few other things of relevance to the crises we are facing. About 90% of the work that my studio does is casting for television commercials. Right now business is reasonably steady – enough to still justify my salary – but I am well aware of the speed with which that could change. It’s not exactly an industry with a bright future.<br><br>One thing I would like to add to your analysis is that this formerly stable system of third-party employment you describe also supported the creation and development of many complex cultural activities, without which said developments would either not have taken place or would have taken place at a much slower speed. Hollywood is a good example of that (although you could also use the example of stage actors in New York or musicians in Boston). It’s always been difficult to maintain stable employment in the film industry, and even the people who achieve it often slip out of it again at some point in their careers. During the twentieth century, when southern California’s economy was growing dependably and supported by such mainstays as oil, real estate development and the defense industry, it was entirely possible for some ambitious budding actor/actress/writer/director to come to Hollywood and support themselves with a job waiting tables or stocking shelves while they wrote or auditioned or looked for film opportunities on the side. Maybe they would make it, maybe they wouldn’t, but their lives usually wouldn’t hang in the balance. The ability to support yourself in other professions also provided a safety valve for people who had once made in the industry but whose careers were winding down. A lot of the actors who were big in the 30’s and 40’s saw that start to happen, so what did they do? Some of them went into television, but a very large number of them went into real estate and became successful brokers or developers.<br><br>Now this has changed very dramatically. Los Angeles is one of the toughest job markets in the nation now and new arrivals have to simply fight to get a subsistence job before they can begin the long, arduous process of establishing themselves in whatever their specialty is. This has a qualitative impact on the work that is done here, for I’ve seen so many promising endeavors either never start or flounder midway simply because the time and energy is no longer there to complete them.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c8785120866709314986 title="comment permalink">4/16/14, 6:28 PM</a><br><br>

It's actually quite comforting to me as I've been doing more and more bartering and work-trade in recent years, as well as building my food production skills.<br><br>I'll note that gaining skills in this regard is not just about figuring out how to produce something of value--though that's obviously critical--but also about how to barter and trade in general.<br><br>My approach is a soft one. I don't like to inconvenience people or make them feel like I'm pressuring them into anything, just as I don't like the same done to me. And so I tread lightly. For instance, the other day I was visiting with the neighbors, friends of mine, who are setting up a farm and homestead across the street. Part of that involves clearing out some alders and they have wood everywhere. I heat with wood, and am just getting started learning the business of procuring and keeping a stock of wood. So I make a passing comment about perhaps buying some wood from them and that pretty quickly gets into a conversation of my getting wood from them via a work-trade scenario. Score. Perfect.<br><br>Similarly, they recently purchased a walk behind tractor. I have a field I want to turn into vegetables. This is a new property, so this field is in grass. I can do it by hand and will if necessary, but breaking through that sod with their tractor would sure save a heck of a lot of work. So again, some passing references and pretty soon we have a work-trade agreement.<br><br>It's a skill. You have to always be on the lookout for local, unused resources. You have to maintain good relationships with people in your community. You have to inquire and ask questions. You often have to put the idea out there, whether that be in a very direct manner or in a passing manner that allows them to grab the ball and run with it if they want. <i>You have to be constantly thinking in community-oriented terms rather than monetary terms</i>. Time isn't money in the world of bartering--it's work and production. It's cooperation and mutual benefit.<br><br>You also are likely to get a heck of a lot farther if you're generous. Don't let yourself be walked on, but don't obsess over balancing the books down to the last cent, either. What do you have excess of? If it's not claimed for trade or barter, considering Giving it away to the right people, to the people who have helped you or who you know will. If you choose the right people, these things are remembered. After my friends made that first pass with their walk behind tractor, they left the house with a dozen eggs from my chickens and a quart of homemade yogurt. These things cost me more in effort than money and sending them out the door was not a burden for me. I did it naturally; I knew not to send them away after they had worked on my homestead without something in hand, even if I planned to work for them later.<br><br>Always remember with trade and barter that you're not in the industrial economy. You're in the community economy, the informal economy. It's a different beast, requires different interaction, requires attention to different details, demands different behavior. This is part of the learning curve. A big chunk of this economy is about building and maintaining community. It's about relationships. Those who understand that and act accordingly are likely to do well.<br><br>Lastly, always remember your debts. If someone who's helped you, been generous with you, has been there for you puts a call out for help, you show up. If they're having a work party, you make sure you're there. And if you really can't be there, you explain why and you arrange another way to help. Reciprocation is a gold standard in the informal community. People will be quite generous so long as you hold up your end of the bargain. Fail to do that and you'll find yourself cut off quick.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c7739933619112318013 title="comment permalink">4/16/14, 6:35 PM</a><br><br>

I asked a working smith a similar question a few years back He (or his helpers) can cut the thread with a file after making the blank bolt. A simple jig puts the work within an apprentice's skill. A smith could also make a wrench to turn the lag bolts.<br><br>Files are trickier, though. In the early 1800s, so the working smith at Old Sturbridge Village told me, most blacksmiths would have bought their files "from away" with cash.<br><br>For those of your readers who are in New England, I recommend the resources at Old Sturbridge Village in the highest possible terms. They have a wonderful research library (available to members) on how everything was actually done on farms and in small shops during the early 1800s.

More direct accountability for ones own work, more personal human involvement instead of everything being hidden behind faceless corporations/bureaucracies.

Wage labor only became common as the Industrial Revolution gained steam. Before then, wage labor was generally restricted to domestic servants, day laborers, hired hands, sailors and the like. As a result, wage labor and being an employee of someone else was generally looked down upon and seen as being one step above being a slave, a serf or an indentured servant, hence the term “wage slave”. The one notable exception to this attitude was military officers, judges, officials and the like, who saw themselves as being servants of the king or the state and thus had social prestige because of who they served.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c1586416680546079733 title="comment permalink">4/16/14, 8:36 PM</a><br><br>

It is going to be a long time until wages have evened out enough to make local cobblers competitive with factories in Asia. Sure, not all the colours and sizes we are used to. We might even have to go down to the docks and sort through big piles to find a left and a right that match. But I don't see be able to make much of a living as shoemaker in my lifetime. Now shoe repair is a different thing...<br><br>Similarly with baskets. I think most of us will be rather desperate to get food on the table, and won't spend too much time on basketweaving. Again, containers full of laundry baskets will be hitting the docks for decades to come. So, my children or grandchildren may need to weave baskets--the skills must be passed down. But even that project--maintaining skills purely for transmission to further generations--is a luxury that must be supported by surplus food.<br><br>Blacksmithing is another one. The salvage economy should provide us all the hinges and doorknobs we need for centuries to come. Sure, you might want to bang a point on something, but decorative gates are going to be far and few between. Now homebrew welding setups on the other hand....<br><br>So, we must make enough actual cash money to keep a roof over our heads, and buy or grow enough food to keep us from starving. Everyone is going to be facing some variation of that reality--which I think is going to get awfully Darwinian on the job front.<br><br>How about that darling of localism--the baker?

They bought sugar, flour and tea. They baked bread, made pickles, canned food, made jam, sewed clothes, built furniture, fixed and patched. Anything that falls under this sort of category I think will be very difficult to make a living at--it is just what everyone does to scrape by.<br><br>The best jobs will be in basic trades (but not carpentry because there are a million of them), ideally with an angle towards the Long Descent. So plumbing, focussing on solar hot water. Electrical, focussing on wind and PV installation. Also the repair world, shoe repair, metal repair. I think there will be many more jobs for machinists and welders than blacksmiths. Most of these jobs will be accessed through apprenticeships.<br><br>As for who is doing it--look to the Hill Williams, the rednecks who know how to fix anything and eat off their bioregion.

In the deindustrial future, institutions that preserve knowledge from the preindustrial past are going to be worth their weight in light sweet crude. I'd encourage those of my readers who have access to such things to get their buns over to those institutions sooner rather than later, and learn everything you can. <br><br>Dan, most interesting. I don't claim to know much about ironwork, so that's useful lore. <br><br>Sixbears, exactly. Dealing with the deindustrial future may be scary, as you say, but it's a lot more interesting than sitting in a cubicle daydreaming about doing something else with your life. <br><br>Tom, legal advice for individuals and small businesses might be a worthwhile niche, especially if you charge modest fixed fees and know your way around the whole range of everyday legal activities, from wills to incorporation papers. <br><br>HalFiore, bingo. It's not necessarily a compliment. <br><br>Greg, no question, you have the right idea. When you produce goods and services for your own use, or for exchange with your neighbors, you get all the value of your own labor. If you work for someone else, they take a substantial cut of the value of your labor, and if you then take the salary and use it to buy things, another cut goes to the store, etc. Thus anything you produce for your family is a significant gain. <br><br>My donkey, I'd be surprised to see peak population delayed as long as 2050.

While keeping the hazardous precipice in mind, you have to turn your attention elsewhere, or it will get you. I have a lot of respect for Carolyn Baker as well, but recently she has become convinced of near-term human extinction, and while she is very philosophical about it, it may have handicapped her ability to pull Mike out of the funk he was in. He had been depressed for a long time. He had trouble dealing with the trollery at Collapse Net. My father, who was also dealing with depression three years ago, found Mike to be very depressing. Depression has myriad causes, and staring at abysses can just be a symptom of it. I was depressed as a teenager. You circle the drain quite a while, and suicide looks like the moral choice. It is very hard to climb out of that pit. Focusing on helping others--I mean physically helping--is one step up.<br>I wouldn't call his work on 911 Truth dabbling. It was the major theme of Crossing the Rubicon. It was meticulously researched and referenced, but most of all, by tying major political events into peak oil, I think he helped give people a road map and an inkling of the seriousness and urgency of what we face. He later turned away from 911 Truth because it had become a distraction, as you have noted, from the real issues.<br>He emphasized preparation for collapse, like you do, Mr. Greer, and I love your articles. You have the right approach. The Japanese say, "Talk of next year and the devil laughs." I think, we don't die until we die, and then after we die, there we are, good and dead.<br>Until Ruppert left it, his Collapse Net blog had one particular feature that I loved. It promoted networking among the participants and encouraged people to share their experiences through regional and topical blogs. I see people sharing good ideas here, too, but I have to scroll along, and there is no way to respond directly.<br>I hope that that particular legacy of Ruppert's which is still limping along, can be refurbished and made free of charge.

These last few years I've kept a foot in both camps: building up a large garden/mini-farm and many related food preparation and preservation skills and learning herbal medicine; while continuing to generate income from the industrial economy (working part-time as an IT consultant and starting a business selling herbal products to people with industrial money). So I've kicked the regular employment habit and become much more self-sufficient. But much of my cash income still comes from the regular, industrial economy. To echo Chris' comments, a lot of what I'm doing is sticking it to the man, but then I'm still using the man to help pay for it all. Seems wrong somehow?<br><br>So what to do? In our area, decline is undeniable, but there's still enough juice in the regular economy to support this bifurcated lifestyle for sometime to come (maybe a year, maybe 5 or 10). Should we cut or ties more completely, or continue to take industrial money to fund our lifeboat building? Do we continue to surf our way down a declining economy, or jump off more decisively?

I've noticed that my attempts at sane living are often in conflict with the demands of the workplace. If I were to ask my boss for time off to work in my garden, for example, she wouldn't say of course, go grow yourself some food. She would see gardening as a somewhat quaint hobby and assume that my survival would be better guaranteed by earning my wage and going to the grocery store. Many of the sensible adjustments to sustainable living would be met with the same skepticism: if I wore only two alternating outfits to work, for example, or took time off for laundry when the weather was sunny, I could expect trouble with my employer. At some point, I suppose, we will have to make a clean break -- or it will be made for us.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c8085631136992717312 title="comment permalink">4/17/14, 3:07 AM</a><br><br>

But for me the fascinating thing is that my parents as children in postwar pre-Wirtschaftswunder Germany of the 'fifties experienced a lifestyle that seems quite close to what might be had. My maternal grandfather (born 1895, he married late, his children were born between 1943 and 52, he died in 72 before I could get to know him having been born but a few months earlier) worked in the postal service (not delivery, but sorting and loading mail at the train station). In addition, he was a "spare time" farmer. The family was probably almost self-subsistent as far as food goes. They would raise a few pigs every year, slaughter two of the for sausages and sell one or two. They kept 2-4 cows for milk (and farm labour) as well as chickens. Vegetables and fruit from the garden, fodder and rye or wheat from the fields. They bought sugar, salt and a few other things, but produced enough milk and eggs they could sell some of these. Most of the clothing was bought, but things were mended or changed for younger children to make them last.<br>Of course, this was a lot of hard work and a somewhat old-fashioned lifestyle back then, but not at all unusual and probably even less so, if one goes back to the 1920ties. Certainly, the framework was already an industrial society, but these people probably lived at a fraction of today's fossile and other resources and were self-subsistent to a remarkable degree.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c8316080150148949105 title="comment permalink">4/17/14, 4:50 AM</a><br><br>

However, I am inclined to think that lawyers who have their heart in the right place (are there any? HA) have a place in the deindustrial future. Gone of course will be the days of ridiculous billing rates and extreme specialization, which characterize the current market of legal work. The lawyer of the future must exhibit far greater versatility (a characteristic which many older country lawyers probably still possess). I am reminded of the example of Abraham Lincoln, who spent months riding around towns, handling "every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer". But at the same time, I the future might actually provide a unique opportunity to renew the honor of the profession, one badly damaged by the culture of greed prevailing in modern society. So I suppose law is a field still worth pursuing, but a capacity to adapt is crucial if one is to actually survive in it.<br><br>Anyway, that's my two cents.

Two decades ago I was at the top of my game, actually making a living as a recording engineer in Chicago. Then I got married; my wife made double my income, so it was off to the east coast. Instead of trying to hang out my shingle, I went to the big guy in town, who had some of the same major clients as I, and asked if he needed an employee. He declined, but started hiring me for gigs when he was busy. A few years later he called, saying "there's a woman putting on concerts in people's houses. She can't afford me; can I give her your name?" Well, "that woman" was successful and now runs a concert series; I'm still her engineer.

Second, this takes time; it was probably five years before I became re-established. So get started now; that way the cushions will be there when you need them!

Not only does working part-time free up time to devote to household work, hobbies, and developing skills, and forces me to live on less money, but psychologically it helps me not equate my identity solely with my job. If I were to suddenly lose my job, I wouldn't lose my identity.<br><br>Unlike those who are forced into part-time work, I have the option of working full-time if I wanted to. But so far I have declined. It was amusing, when I started this part-time job (at the public library) last year, during my initial meeting with my manager, she asked me, "Just out of curiosity, why are you working part-time?" (The other part-time workers in our division all have second jobs or are full-time students, but not me.) Without getting into too many details, I replied with some of the things I like to do in my free time (including actually having a chance to read library books). My manager's response was something like, "Well, I wish I had the option of working part-time..." I could sense a bit of envy. No such thing as a part-time manager. Before getting this job, I worked for eight years doing odd jobs of various kinds in the underground economy, so what my manager didn't understand is that now formally working part-time is actually a "step-up" for me (in her worldview). Funny.<br><br>While in most places in seems like the budget for libraries is being cut back, in our city it isn't the case. The budget was greatly increased last year and many new people were hired (me being one of them). However, I'm not sure how long-lived this will be, especially if the economy tanks again in the next decade. So, I make sure not to get too tied (both economically and psychologically) to my job.<br><br>On another note, I think I've read studies on adults who were homeschooled, finding that homeschoolers are more likely to create their own job than work for a large company.

At some point, the funds and resources provided by the federal government to localities is going to reduce to the point that localities see a greater benefit from taking control over their local resources and telling the federal government to take a hike.

Now's the time to build community, so it's there when you need it!<br><br>Wildeye, many thanks for the link. I wonder if there's a comparable site giving data on early 19th century frontier communities in the US and/or Australia -- that might be a bit of a better match to our future situation. <br><br>Sarah, a lot of people I know who still have jobs are transitioning to part time, precisely to get the flexibility, or are making arrangements with spouses etc. so that one person can move full time into the household economy.

I'm already working on my full list, because I think it's quite possible that we'll have quite a serious crisis and downward lurch in the next year or so. <br><br>Gregorach, the raised bed system actually dates from the 19th century, and was used in those days for intensive vegetable growing.

It sounds as though you're collapsing at a good clip, well ahead of the rush!<br><br>Johannes, a lot of people in Europe still remember the hard times during and after the catastrophes of the 20th century, and so are better positioned to deal with the looming catastrophes of the 21st. I wonder if it would do any good to start connecting elderly people who grew up in those more difficult conditions to younger people who want to learn how it's done, so that the practical knowledge gets passed down. <br><br>Matthew, no, I'm still predicting the same stairstep crash -- the crisis ahead of us is one of the downward lurches, and there'll be some form of stabilization afterwards, though it may be at a Third World economic level. As for a sudden realization on the part of the masses, don't hold your breath; if history's any guide, the worse conditions get, the more frantically most people will cling to the fantasy that they can have everything they've been promised. <br><br>Adrian, the early part of the learning curve is the steepest -- the fact that you're working at it, to my mind, puts you a good long leap ahead of most. <br><br>Ursachi, some are growing vegetables for sale at farmer's markets, some are doing alternative health care, some are casting horoscopes -- astrology always does well in hard times.

I need to read it again to master the comprehensiveness and elegance of the model. <br><br>But I have had a different thought, reawakened by your mention of Schumacher. We moved from science/management middle class in S. Cal. to a hilly corner of NE Iowa. Our region is not so different from a colony as described by Schumacher. Sometimes Facebook or Google will open a facility here to use the cheap labor. We export food. Recently deposits of sand suitable for frac mining for oil/gas were discovered near here, and we are threatened. They poison the air and the water, and add negative value to the local economy by destroying existing business. We're fighting it, with some prospects for success, if we can keep the state out of it.<br><br>Personally, I am now a small farmer, producing healthy food in competition with the deer, raising a few large mammals for beef and to close the nutrient loop with their composted manure for our garden. I prefer to consider this the "top" rather than the bottom of the food chain. :-)<br><br>Love your analysis, this week and most weeks!<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c33014729571806996 title="comment permalink">4/17/14, 1:08 PM</a><br><br>

I see far too many people starting up their own enterprises with the apparent belief that they can make a middle class income on what are essentially homesteading activities.<br><br>I see this a bit more with the value-added stuff, which in the Portland markets is often reaching absurd prices. The vegetables, meat, and so on is a bit of a different story--they too often are overpriced for decline conditions, but they're not making the farmers rich, either. We're caught in that tough grey period of transition when the industrial stuff is still cheaper and fossil fuels are mostly still a worthwhile subsidy. Eventually, this will even out a bit.<br><br>But again, I see and talk to too many people who want an industrial economy return on their household economy work. It's not going to happen and a good chunk of the current local food movement will be wiped out over the next couple decades.<br><br>Some of those players will be smart enough to adapt while others will realize their romanticism is unrealistic and will fade out of the scene. New players will also come in with an understanding of the new dynamics and they'll do well, most likely.<br><br>Personally, as I work to establish my little homestead and ultimately create some excess food to sell and barter, I'm looking to put together a small private buying list. I'll let people know what's available, keep prices reasonable, and bring in a bit of extra cash while I can. This also helps keep overhead low (there are a lot of costs associated with working a farmers market, for instance) and allows me to be flexible with pricing and striking deals with individuals, bartering, work-trading, and the like.<br><br>Again, it's about a community-oriented frame of mind rather than an industrial economy one. There's still too much of that in the local food movement. I can't tell you how many people I've seen in the movement who claim they despise the industrial economy--thus their presence in the local food economy--but then expect their alternative to run on all the same principles of what they claim to hate. It's total nonsense. But the increasing pressures of decline will suss them out before long and they'll be onto the next supposed savior, until they either get it through their skull that they have to start behaving differently, or they slide deeper into the abyss until there's no getting out of it.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c4552562214710900926 title="comment permalink">4/17/14, 1:14 PM</a><br><br>

Though I admit to feeling a portion of the pressure as I am currently trying to distribute my elder compost pile to a variety of interesting people whose graces I am eager to invest in. <br><br>I also really need to get a good work place ready for a couple projects, but I know that the limiting factor here in my scheduling skill. I have friends with good shops, and know how to use facilities in the manner which gets me invited back, but scheduling is challenging, especially as my life is tied to others whose lives are destabilizing. Balance is delicate, and I and very sad that triage among the many lovely people I know is becoming a more real issue. <br><br>Also, I just finished two books worth recommending. The Autobiography of Ben Franklin, which is most excellent, especially because of the attitude toward circumstances Ben had, even though for the majority of his life, even after he rose to wealth his access to goods was a tiny fraction of what I (for now) have working for 16 hours a week and a fraction over minimum wage. The second book is The Ways of my Grandmothers, by Beverly Hungry Wolf. It is a recording of folk wisdom from the Blood people of the Blackfoot alliance. Again it is fortifying to the soul to read about how one might feel wealthy in a lifestyle with much less material wealth than even our mid term future is likely to offer. Common famine, warfare, staggering mortality rates. Their response was prayer and a life filled with what I would consider intense magical practice.<br><br>Simplify and organize! And time invested in inner growth pays itself back with good returns, half of my waking time is on some form of inner development, yet I still carry forward more projects than I did going full tilt two years ago.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c5167415615004535501 title="comment permalink">4/17/14, 2:03 PM</a><br><br>

Some farmers are asking if I will start selling garden produce to them, I think that I won't make it to that point this year, but likely by next season.<br><br>I think about the good businesses (Ruben's list being similar to mine) that might thrive in the area, and my over large ambition is saddened that I cannot master nearly as many of the skills as I would like, and even more so I can not be actively employed in more than a small number at any time, regardless of what skills might develop in time. But, their are friends who have the skills to move into those niches, and I, in proxy of where my skills are lacking, encourage those friends to develop those hobbies to the level that could become business, and I aid them in every way that avails itself to me, especially the connection of skilled people to one another and the making available of useful materials.<br><br>Though, come to think of it, I need to focus more on making gifts to give away!

Although I stopped paying much attention to him a few years ago, the news of his suicide still affected me. He always seemed like a very sincere person even when I disagreed with some of his conclusions.<br><br>That got me thinking about something that is a bit of a tangent but I think related to the theme of how to deal (or how not to deal) with very troubling situations. I'm thinking of a book, one on the books of my childhood that affected me the strongest, "The Giver" by Lois Lowry.<br><br>It's not just me, ask anyone born after 1980 who liked to read in their childhood and the chances are they've read it, probably around the age of 12, and have something to say about it. It won the Newberry award. I read it at that age too, and thought of it at the time as one of the best books ever, but even then was dissatisfied about the ending. <br><br>I re-read it a couple of years or so ago. It's sort of a "Brave New World" for children, with a decent amount of fantasy rather than pure sci-fi. It's the ending that I want to mention here however, the ending is left purposely vague (none of the rest of the book is like this). Jonas, the 12-year-old main character, has learned enough about what's really going on in his world so as to make it intolerable. He ends up just running away, taking with him a baby that's due to be executed the next day. They manage to avoid capture and end up near death from cold and starvation. Then, there is seemingly happy but very vague ending. An optimist would say he's found a new home, that's what I thought when I read it as a child but was unsatisfied by the vagueness, but reading it as an adult it seems more likely that he's dying and the images are either hallucinations coming from memories or near death visions or something like that. The author purposely keeps it vague.<br><br>As much as I loved "The Giver" as a child, I wonder now if it encourages dysfunctional thinking patterns. In the book, Jonas deals with his situation by running away on what resembles a suicide mission. The vagueness of the ending is probably because the author realized a true happy ending didn't work but wasn't going to put a "Brave New World" type ending on a book for 12-year-olds, but may inadvertently encourage a problematic mindset. I think the popularity of "The Giver" has something to say about the state of our culture, but I can't put my finger on exactly what.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c6295299337438472636 title="comment permalink">4/17/14, 10:09 PM</a><br><br>

He describes vividly the way that non-commercial community mutual aid works, and how to get and keep a reputation as a valued member. Excellent advice! The judicious gift-giving is particularly important, and pays huge - non-commercial - dividends. Keep it judicious, nicely judged. Neither a sucker nor a miser be!<br><br>That's exactly how things work in my below-the-radar community too. Living this way, I get the feeling that I'm plugging back into a very ancient morphogenetic form, where humans and pre-humans in local communities always cooperated like this for thousands of generations, because it works, and because it feels - to our long-evolved instincts - to be the fundamentally 'right' way to live. It also means that even on a state pension which has just inched up this month to a bit short of £150 a week, I can actually save money, with which to buy and stash gold Sovereigns - like Silas Marner...<br><br>And hey, if you like raised beds, try soil mounds, laid straight down on the existing turf. As long as there's plenty of fertilising stuff - compost, manure, forest-floor soil and litter, etc. - laid into the upper layers as the mound gets up, they produce fulsomely the very first year. I'm into my nth year of growing staples such as potatoes like this, with consistently good results. <br><br>Try broadcasting white clover seed onto the surface as soon as your mound is raised, for a green mulch plus nitrogen fixer. If you have non-flushing loos, well-composted humanure should go fairly low down in the layers; but pee can be poured on at any stage, as a continuing practice. Food plants will grow fine in this setup, from the first year on. <br><br>Plant your food veggies much more shoulder to shoulder than is normally recommended, to crowd out volunteers. Then a bit of judicious differential clipping back, with hand shears, to favour the desired plants a little over the volunteers, keeps everything balanced nicely in your favour. And any time you cut clover growth back a bit, the corresponding die-back of their roots releases another jag of nitrates and humus material just where it's needed! You're aiming NOT to have bare surface soil anywhere, ASAP. Even couch grass is no problem, and certainly not the inveterate enemy, to be annihilated at all costs, which most gardeners in Britain still seem to think. Think no-till, and no bare soil, especially on the sloped sides.<br><br>You can go on scattering soil-feeding stuff onto the mound, year-round: compost, poultry manure, whatever. Just do it thinly, to avoid 'burn' or smothering of growing food vegs. Straw and paper/cardboard spot mulching can be applied judiciously too, to slow down volunteers getting too dominant. Never worry about volunteer seeds in your mulches. The more the better!<br><br>And of course, if you want to include plenty of woody material, from big logs to twigs and chippings, in the foundation of your mounds - why then you have hugel-stacks, with all their big advantages. My second big hugel-stack is starting out growing potatoes and onions this year. Coming up nicely right now, with a few volunteer beans that got into the mound soil accidentally, from my farming neighbour's recent tractor sowing of his adjacent field.<br><br>No sawn-timber or bolts are harmed in the making of these fertile barrows. Or even used at all.<br><br>JM, I hope to speak to you face to face in London on 1 June, and maybe buy you a beer?

It's one of those thought stoppers that is used to prevent people thinking for themselves. <br><br>Recall that Peak Oil itself has been called a "Conspiracy Theory" and when challenged on the motive of Iraq's Oil for the invasion, British War Criminal Primeminister Tony Bliar (sic), called such accusations "Conspiracy Theory" too. I really despise the phrase and the way it is used as a slur and thought stopper. <br><br>To be sure, there are plenty of bona fide "Conspiracy Theories" out there, but conflating Mike Ruppert's investigative journalism into insider trading, war-games and supranational business and intelligence connections surrounding 9/11 with "Missiles at the Pentagon" etc is very disingenuous and cheap. <br><br>The phrase "9/11 Truther" actually came later. The initial investigations of Cynthia McKinney's Citizens 9/11 Hearings, featured researchers such as Ruppert, Peter Dale Scott, Nafeez Ahmed and Paul Thompson who compiled the renowned 9/11 Timeline. Some including Ruppert and Ahmed, tied the event to Peak Oil very early on, the former after a conversation with Dale Allen Pfeiffer.<br><br>As for Mike Ruppert's issues and stances, he had become very erratic it is sad to say. His experiences following the Pat Tillman scandal that his Newsletter From the Wilderness reported on seemed to be the turning point which pushed him into despair and although he had periods when he seemed content and cheerful, he had become very much "out there", embracing some of the more "doomer" perspectives such as those of Guy McPherson and the idea of Fast Collapse. <br><br>I felt the same way myself for a while, particularly as I had a long period of illness a few years back. Ruppert suffered many demons and had been shot, poisoned and harassed over the years due to his habit of pursuing investigations into the criminality of very powerful interests. This naturally took its toll on his physical and especially mental well being over the years. I had some private exchanges with him and I was worried about his state of mind. <br><br>I still recommend his book Crossing the Rubicon however, despite the flaws that like any book of 600 pages, have slipped in to the pages. What Ruppert doesn't discuss in the book, apart from to say why, is "Physical Evidence" such as the building collapses and there is good reason for that. <br><br>My friend Rhisiart has commented above about the evidence and I agree that it should be read and understood with the work of the above mentioned people being a central point, but I'd ignore such physical evidence issues like the AE911 Building Collapse stuff, because it really is a dead end and in my view, should not be the main "talking point" of the event.<br><br>The main talking point about 9/11 - regardless of whether or not an individual believes the US government had a hand in it - is the context of a failing Empire in the light of Peak Oil. 9/11 was and continues to be used as justification for "Business as Usual" by the American Empire and this mentality deeply threatens our future.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c3409713775881894563 title="comment permalink">4/18/14, 1:35 AM</a><br><br>

The at the top have been gradually eroding benefits and increasing our workload through worker layoffs for a decade now... even as the corporation makes record profits and they pat themselves on the back with big, fat bonuses larger than the total compensation of the entire department where I work. It is a source of anger and frustration and to describe morale as poor is to overstate the case. Everyone is looking for a job somewhere else. I am not. I expect my job will be eliminated eventually. I plan to do something else.<br>Nonetheless, I shall continue here as long as I may because:<br><br>1) Although my house is completely paid off, and the massive amount of insulation I put in last year kept my gas usage this year exactly the same as last year, even though the average daily temperature was about 15 degrees colder, I'm not done insulating or renovating. I still have much to go and that will cost money.<br>2) My truck is also completely paid off, so all my costs are gas, insurance, and maintenance. I use it to frequently haul heavy things for friends. I might be able to use it to make money or as coincident to some other work.<br>3) This job pays the bills I incur while acquiring skills and knowledge which I hope will become useful as we collapse, viz., becoming:<br><br>- a competent horse trainer; I am getting a reputation for my ability to work with horses. Soon, I hope to have demonstrable results (i.e. in competitions). This takes up the bulk of my spare time, and keeps me sane and balanced and fit. It is my dream job once the current one disappears. Possibly sooner, if I can work it.<br><br>- a competent leatherworker; since I know how to turn a hide into leather, and have produced some good work making belts, bags, clothing, saddle accessories, and horse tack, this may become a means of living. I have yet to build a saddle or make boots, but they are on the list. I may use my savings to take classes to become a master saddler or harness-maker.<br><br>- a competent metal-worker; although my lathe-turning needs a lot of practice, I have built a working smithy in which I have made several small pieces.<br><br>- I know how to timber-frame a small building, specifically, the aforementioned smithy. Also, working on my house has taught me a lot about building and how to do quality work. I still am far too slow and methodical to ever make a living building or renovating houses, but I do know how they ought to work properly as a system.<br><br>- while I have achieved only pitiful success when I grow vegetables, I do produce first-class compost which kicks my friends' gardens into over-production. I got at least a dozen meals at friends' houses featuring their delicious produce last year. (Peculiar. I don't like gardening, but I am fascinated by compost -- go figure.)<br><br>So, like Yupped and Mark Rice, I think, rather than jump off now, I'll ride the descent down as far as I can and continue to feast at Hagbard's table until I can leave with the best assurance that I can survive out there. I reckon I'll need about five more years to become truly accomplished enough at something other than computers to up and leave.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c8942531194575685824 title="comment permalink">4/18/14, 2:33 AM</a><br><br>

Recently inmates at three prisons here refused (Holman, St Clair and Elmore) to work. They make numerous products for the state besides car tags, my desk was made in a correction facility workshop. Recently a bill was passed to let private business employ prison labor and the State department of Agriculture has proposed using prison labor in agriculture, in place of migrant labor. <br><br>Alabama has a history of doing this before. In the years following the Civil War, blacks were arbitrarily arrested, fined outrageous amounts, and charged with there own cost of imprisonment. They were "sold" to coal mines, brickyards, rock quarries and any other place that needed backbreaking physical labor. <br><br>My own Great Grandmother was sold from an orphanage to a textile mill when she was 12. Do you have any suggestions about how can we guard against this? I fear that just as people now do not care about the conditions that there clothing is made in Bangladesh, they won't care about the working conditions in Alabama, or think that prisoners deserve the punishment that they get. It seems that the right-wing media even pushes this view. <br><br>I can only hope that religion can make people feel a moral obligation to the treatment of there fellow man. <br><br>Thanks,<br>Darryl<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c267302648298337191 title="comment permalink">4/18/14, 7:12 AM</a><br><br>

Which makes me think of my extended family, which is a mix of atheists and Mormons. This has been entertaining for me, but we seem to be able to get along fine at family reunions.<br><br>Anyway, I find a lot of overlap in what some of my Mormon cousins and I are striving to do. They're raising chickens and rabbits, growing gardens, planting fruit trees, making applesauce, canning food, cooking from scratch, making instead of buying, homeschooling their kids... One cousin recently express interest in making homemade laundry detergent (which I do), so I shared with her my experience. Another cousin often dubs certain months "austerity months" where their family can't buy anything at all (with a few exceptions), surviving on food storage, which helps them become closer to the Lord.<br><br>Personally, I don't care much for the Mormon Church (particularly its views on homosexuality, gay marriage, its pressure on its members to have large families, avoidance of discussing overpopulation).

And in the future I think we'll find more of that.

Well, for the moment I will maintain them, but what I'm really interested in is: how close can I come to taking care of myself if those things went away or if I had to give them up but there were still some semblance of them, such as having to pay property taxes.<br><br>As for communalism, it seems to me the ideal is a combinaton. Also, it is going to depend on where you live, what the situation is. There could be some situations, suburban and urban especially, in which communal raising of food would be ideal, including use of people to watch over it in shifts. Where I live, most everyone is already in place on land that they own, but the appalachian roots are strong here, and the hippie "newcomers" took up with them as well: You grow your own stuff but people constantly help one another out and trade labor, advice, know-how, tools, and goods. Since no one person can do it all, it makes sense to trade some things, like maple syrup or what have you. But the communism could easily overlay that. For example, I've started a garden this year, but want to open a second one to grow some grain, and my neighbor (who traded roofing labor for tilling my garden as we don't have the equipment -- and it wasn't a trade like "I'll do this if you'll do that." It was that he was redoing his roof under time pressure last fall, and my husband took an entire WEEK out of his life and roofed with him but refused money for it, so now he's quite happy to do anything we need!)said that it might be better instead of the spot I'm thinking of which is quite sloped to use a small piece at the end of his meadow. I was rather taken aback, but then I pointed out that after all our properties join in a weird angle with a narrowing strip running along the side of that meadow, and I said that as far as square feet is concerned, it probably might make a good rearrangement, although not in the legal sense.<br>I can easily envision some of the large pieces of land laying around being put to use communally to share labor.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c3435945407698468548 title="comment permalink">4/18/14, 9:21 AM</a><br><br>

Despair usually has its roots in pride -- in the insistence that one already knows how the story is going to turn out. Hope, by which I don't mean the facile optimism of the privileged, requires more humility. <br><br>Catherine, true enough; I've learned several forms of natural healing in the course of my odd education, and once the legal climate changes enough that I won't be risking jail time for helping people, that may well become a tradable skill. <br><br>HalFiore, I'd look into living history sites. <br><br>Mac, if you can repair a radar set, you probably have all the skills you need to build and repair simpler electronics -- and that could be of quite some use down the road a bit. <br><br>RPC, said the porpoise to the icthyosaur! As for future professions, you ought to be able to capitalize on your existing skills and contacts in some way -- musical entertainment tends to be as popular in hard times as ever. <br><br>Rhisiart, thanks for the link!<br><br>Damo, while you're at it, pick up some other skills -- things you can do that produce goods and services other people need or want. That'll serve you in good stead if you don't get those ten years. <br><br>Lance, got it. <br><br>Wornsmooth, that's certainly a possibility. If that happens, though, there's all the more need for you to have some barterable skills and to cut your own consumption of energy and other resources as far as possible -- if the US ends up facing the economic burdens of prolonged war, not to mention the serious risk of defeat, those'll be crucial for you and the people you care about.<br><br>Beneath, that sounds like a very good strategy. <br><br>Colin, it's not a blind spot, it's a reasoned disagreement. Yes, I'm familiar with the various flavors of socialism; no, I don't think they have anything useful to offer the current situation. No doubt it's very comforting to dream of mass movements that will overthrow the status quo, but where are they? The vast majority of Americans are clinging like grim death to the status quo, because they know -- and quite rightly -- that when it goes away, their own standards of living are going to drop like so many stones. Once the US no longer has a global empire and can no longer draw down the wealth of the planet to prop up its current lifestyles, all of us are going to be a great deal poorer, as in Third World levels of poverty. That's the elephant in the American living room, and it's why progressive causes in the US have gone nowhere for decades.

I went to the big city and visited the farmer's market, and just on a whim asked a proprietor if he used pesticides. He said, "We all do." I put the produce back down. <br>At the same time the proprietors of our farmer's market, two of whom work on it more or less full time, struggle to keep prices low enough that people will buy, but their prices are significantly higher than the grocery store. And, they are not really making money! They have both admitted that, and have other income sources. I, myself, am planning to be a vendor this year. One thing I will sell is maple syrup, at store prices of perhaps 9 dollars a pint, but I doubt we will clear a dollar an hour for our labor. I do know that a lot of farmer's markets have high priced luxury goods, but on other hand have you considered what it means to raise sheep, sheer them, process the wool into yarn and make a pair of socks?<br>There's a reason that prior generations owned just a few pairs of clothes, and darned their socks!<br>I think it's true that those goods can only be afforded by yuppies, but the reason is not overcharging. The reason is that these local goods are competing with Chinese labor in a very different economy. What I'm saying is that right now, food and other goods like socks are way under priced. <br>The vendors in our market do it for fun and satisfaction, not to make a living, for if they tried to make a living, we'd have no farmer's market. Our prices are lower even on the value added things because our local population simply can't buy at yuppie prices. How things will evolve as the economy declines I don't know but most of us are aware and encourage all comers to begin to grow their own. Perhaps in the future the market will be more of a trading post.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c7355101595310220429 title="comment permalink">4/18/14, 9:45 AM</a><br><br>

I think bouts of despair are quite normal. <br><br>For example, if you had asked me twenty years ago, whether the monarch butterfly would be threatened with extinction, I'd have said you were out of your gourd. Yet just this week, an article in the local paper pointed out that monarch populations have crashed by 90%. If current trends continue, if as Derrick Jensen would put it, each year you have less and less butterflies return, at some point you have none. Then the iconic state insect of IL goes extinct.<br><br>The thought of a world devoid of monarchs is deeply saddening, it is enough to make me cry. Watching the Machine of industrial agribusiness work so hard to maintain profit at the expense of the living world causes despair. So what shall I do? Hang myself? No. Cultivate milkweed. Yes!<br><br>If we lose the monarch, I will mourn their loss, just as I mourn the loss of the passenger pigeon I was never privileged to see.

That assumes there will still be a mass media by then.

Since the beginning of the 19th century coffee was the main national product, the export (mainly to the US) which guaranteed the foreign exchange necessary to keep the economy afloat at the time. In 1906, the representatives from the three richest states at the time, São Paulo, Minas Gerais e Rio de Janeiro (not surprisingly still where the money is), worried about the precipitous fall in international prices, gathered at the city of Taubaté and decided that the government should buy the surplus coffee, subsidising the price. To make the deal work, a loan of 15 million pounds would be made to ensure the viability of the proposal, another stone to the considerable pile of foreign debt problems in our history.<br><br>The president at the time didn't want this hot potato on his hands so the states were initially the ones responsible for the subsidy, but later on that same year a more "amenable" president was elected and the federal government picked up the tab. There you have it: the whole country was paying to keep the coffee oligarchy on these three states filthy rich (of course, the governors and the presidents of that time were all from those same states). The fact that the agreement had some checks to prevent overproduction, and that they were ignored, made some fortunes even more rich on that decade.<br><br>The party went on until the 1929 crash: the coffee was quoted in the New York Stock Exchange, the prices went down for good and the "coffee and milk" oligarchy suffered a deadly blow... to be substituted by different power groups, but that's for another day :P<br><br>The historical absence of the state, and relative poverty, of some brazilian regions compared to others can be easily traced to such episodes on our past.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c5931277492589069848 title="comment permalink">4/18/14, 7:38 PM</a><br><br>

During that time I have seen housing co-ops, banking co-ops, bike co-ops, education co-ops (homeschoolers) and the discussion of auto co-ops flourish in this community. Co-ops and labor unions are intrinsically connected, and will hopefully see a resurgence as we make our way into the future. I see getting along with each other and being able to have polite discussions that end with a goal towards a forward moving solution as a paramount skill in our future societies- this nonsense of badgering each other into the dust will have to stop. Bullying gets no gold stars.<br>As a bodyworker(primarily), gardener, and general laborer, I have bartered for the last 20 years. I have bartered for multiple used cars, CSA shares. acupuncture/bodywork, picture framing, custom clothing and underwear, art, IT services, haircuts, etc. I love barter, and I'm happy to slide the scale in the favor of who I'm bartering with- because it's fun and worthwhile. The service/time exchange is not dollar for dollar in my book- it's important, to me, that we all leave the interaction feeling awesome about the barter.<br>One of the things I am looking towards is relocating to a new community, and it makes me sweat a little. To move from a place where I have a well established business where I make cash and barter for awesome services to some place new is intimidating. I'm just never wanted to settle where I'm living, and even though I have a decent scene, I get so depressed at the thought of staying here. Business is good, but I am lacking in social connections out of my professional life. It has been a somewhat of a surprise for me to have this veil lifted, and I am ready to move in the next year.<br>I'd love to see a networking opportunity of intentional community building, as I imagine we would all like to be somewhere that we can work at building something better together. I have a definite skill set, and there are definitely skills I am lacking. I don't want to have to think that I need to know how to do it all. I want to live in another community where someone has the skills I don't, and they are willing to barter and work together to make things happen positively.<br>On another note, I have considered taking out more student loan debt for acupuncture, as I have received so much healing from this ancient art and I would like to share that with the people who come to me for health and healing. Thoughts on the student loan bubble? (I think Get The Education! The knowledge is priceless and I own nothing to repo).(My son wants to go to college for art. It's great,extremely expensive and so frivolous too).<br>captcha=nichhi sacred<br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c537965363790220778 title="comment permalink">4/18/14, 9:59 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, it's a steep learning curve but an enjoyable one.<br><br>But there is strength in numbers. I have hooked up with a few other like-minded woodlanders and we have formed a community group asserting our 'usefulness' to the sometimes sceptical local 'community'. I say 'community' because, as is the case in most rural idylls, people are mainly wealthy, conservative about aesthetics and profoundly atomised. Indeed, people turning up to our woodland meetings sometimes have not even met each other - despite having been neighbours for decades. Some have thanked us for being a catalyst - maybe they sense that we will indeed have to pull together again.<br><br>Our little group is in the process of setting up a cider club - planting apple trees, scouting out abandoned ones, hassling local authorities to plant others on roadside verges etc. One member is a skilled greenwood worker and he's making the press. His wife makes baskets from willow and is a rare example of someone who has made a success of it.<br><br>Apart from the cider, we're also getting charcoal kilns put in later in the year. A chicken enclosure is being built - as soon as we can get the money for the wire - and there is talk of a pig club. Pheasants will also be arriving soon - an often overlooked source of food which are easy to keep and even easier to catch (they cannot walk backwards so you just make pens on the ground that they walk into).<br><br>Firewood, cider, charcoal and goodwill are available to anyone in the local area who comes and lends a hand. Others get firewood for free - such as the old lady in the cottage with a disabled husband. <br><br>All in all there's a great feeling of excitement and accomplishment in the air. Those people who opposed us to start with have gone grumpily silent - for the time being. <br><br>Of course, we can't all make a living from it yet. We all have to do bits of work in the 'real' economy, but few of us work full time. In my case, I do online translation work, and will soon be working one day a week managing some local gardens. Formal work helps to pay the bills, but working the land helps you avoid the bills in the first place.<br><br>BTW JMG, I'll second the offer of purchasing a beer on June 1. I suspect there might be a few ADR readers over here who'd like to take the opportunity to meet both yourself and one another. And if you find yourself venturing down to west Cornwall you would be more than welcome to stay.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c6135983731437432610 title="comment permalink">4/19/14, 2:20 AM</a><br><br>

I enjoyed Joel's accurate description of the complexities and rewards of community relationships and social currency too. It is a really grey area that has to be slowly re-learned and negotiated household by household.<br><br>I reckon the complex and fragile environment here affects the psyche too, which is where the attitude comes from. The bush creates a rough character. Interestingly too, after the bush-fires in February this year, there is a lot of property for sale up here.<br><br>Those points get me to a thought that I've been fermenting over the past few months: I reckon that there is a deep psychological and cultural aspect to decline / collapse as well.<br><br>Why else would it be so hard for people to "man up" and accept a lower standard of living for themselves and their families?<br><br>I'll tell you a little story about a mate of mine. He's a clever bloke with a PhD in science. He's had the unfortunate experience of only ever working in one business for over the past two decades. I mentioned a couple of weeks back that science in Australia has been copping it in the neck of recent times (a metric of collapse if ever there was one). Anyway, he was made redundant quite a while back and has either not found, or chosen to not find work since.<br><br>The interesting thing is that in conversations it is quite clear to me that his self-esteem still rests solely on the ability to have a job with status. I suggested to him a while back that there is an opportunity for a person with his skill set to provide their services to small business and whilst he did not laugh at me, he dismissed my opinions out of hand. The sad thing is that I could have opened a few networks for him too.<br><br>It reminded me of your essay about earlier astronomers supplementing their income with astrology readings. I respect that level of versatility. I'd do that and wouldn't think twice about it.<br><br>In fact, I reckon a lot of males define themselves through the status that they get from their employment. This may well be their undoing in the immediate future.<br><br>Years ago, I lived a few doors down from a stay at home dad who wore his heart on his sleeve about his situation. Once, I needed some help with some labouring on a job. He always talked himself up about such work so I even offered to pay cash in hand as he was always whining about his - at that time - situation. What was disappointing about his decline of that friendly offer was that he gave me what I politely call a "go away and stop hassling me price" (note the polite language used was not actually the reality!). Needless to say, it became easier to do the job myself without assistance at that price.<br><br>Anyway, a few years later, he had a bush walking accident whilst on his own and died. On hearing this news, my first - and even still today - gut reaction was that he had committed suicide in such a way that the life insurance was paid out to his partner and children (fell off a cliff). What was more disturbing for me was how much happier they all looked only a year after the event. Perhaps it is merely cynicism on my part to think such thoughts, but I can't shake them.<br><br>The recession of the early 90's here taught me everything I needed to know about decline and the appropriate place to rest my self-esteem. Nothing that I have experienced to date has changed my perspective either: Focus on what you can produce. Seems simple enough to me, but it is a very hard ask for those (particularly males) immersed in the employment economy.<br><br>I’m noticing that the frequency of shark like behaviour from government bodies seems to be on the increase here too.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c6865223437357181479 title="comment permalink">4/19/14, 2:57 AM</a><br><br>

It is certainly more likely to me than not. No one so far in the comments seems to have touched that issue.<br><br>I try very hard to keep abreast of the zeitgeist and I'll note that the merest touch of such a thought has entered the mainstream with the final episode for this season of the US TV show "Girls" (one of the very few shows that I commit any time too).<br><br>You may laugh, but Lena Dunham is an interesting writer and is more in touch with the zeitgeist than most people and is also very comfortable in her own skin which I respect (despite the appalling feedback she obviously has to deal with).<br><br>Hi Yupped,<br><br>Yeah, well of course I too have to step between two worlds.

As technology stops being cheap to buy and replace, someone who can take old devices and get them working again -- especially if he can, for example, swap out the defunct circuitry in a washer or a toaster oven and put in a mechanical timer instead -- can probably count on a thriving barter business. You might pick up some used books on small appliance repair, and start refurbishing and selling things to the retro market!<br><br>Jason, that sounds very promising!

Increasingly few people are the owners of their "homestead" - be it one, ten, or one-hundred miles from a city center.<br><br>It's curious: as a Denver resident - not a place that pops into the head as sustainable - we're in the middle of a veritable jobs and real estate boom. There are a few reasons: first, insurance rates along the gulf coast (it's hard to even get insurance along the coast anymore, and if even possible often prohibitively expensive) - but most of the migration into Colorado has been among the lower middle class service workers (canaries in the coal mine). And there are lots of migrants from those regions. Second, the rust belt migrants - that's been going on for roughly 15-20 years, into Denver. Third, the California migrants - a big segment, mostly because of the real estate premium. Going back to the end of the Cold War military base closures. There is also a very significant oil and gas presence in Denver, along with internet and telecommunications - arguably a last hold-ou among growth sectors, albeit notably ephemeral, shifty, imaginary... Lastly, the defense industry continues to hold on. Air Force, Lockheed... a big presence here. And being a continental crossroads for transportation and defense. And the acompanying construction and service booms that go along with the other industries. There is an add-on effect that creates the appearance, it's not that bad. That is, locally.<br><br>There are efforts at sustainability, and it's not impossible to get involved now. Community gardens are available across Denver. Many people are conscious of it. Still, living in the suburbs, I get lots of funny looks for riding a bicycle. But the suburbs can be self-sustaining, and better if cooperatively and systematically. We still have good water distribution systems, lots of grass to turn into gardens or be grazed... and much waste, excess that can be shed. What's scary is the uncertainty. Our whole economy is based on growth. The interest rates charged to the home buyer, the premium paid by the renter, based on economic growth. The services provided by government, based on growth. Like a good surgeon, we ought to be very selective about what is getting cut out. Much of the fight here now is about public school funding, and that's a pretty tricky matter, because people assume it will be as it was for their grandparents. But, often, first the lesson comes, then the learning. And sometimes, that is only, only by experience - no one can teach it. Indeed, most of our wise old men are bunch of fools once peak energy flips everything upside down.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c6555676451582488908 title="comment permalink">4/19/14, 5:59 PM</a><br><br>

Hence, uneconomic investment across the board, of which fracking is one example, is commonplace. But enough people have caught onto the fact that nothing about our markets makes any sense that these opinions (and denunciations thereof) are appearing here and there in the mainstream financial press, much as in 2007 after housing prices started falling but before the financial house of cards built on it collapsed.<br><br>I've also noticed a surge in advertisements for home equity loans and other speculative consumer debt, which makes me think that our financiers are becoming desperate enough that they're hoping people will fall for the same trick they fell for less than a decade ago in order to keep the bubble going a bit longer. I read this as a sign of desperation. <br><br>The last bubble collapsed shortly after the Fed increased interest rates to a "normal" rate of around 5% after leaving them at 1% into 2004, coupled with a huge rise in oil prices, which brought down some of the elaborate Ponzi schemes that made up Wall Street's business. This current one will probably pop once oil companies stop increasing capital expenditures at ~10% just to keep up with decline rates, which probably happens after QE ends and nobody can take on more debt even at nearly 0%. The bubble behavior of financial markets is all that keeps growth going, so the ~2015 recession may well be a pretty big step down in the long descent.<br><br>I found an op-ed from December by Paul Krugman, responding to Larry Summers, that is really interesting. Summers seems to have realized that we're in a period of secular stagnation, in which growth rates are insufficient to maintain anything resembling "full employment" without blowing up bubbles. His prescription is, of course, insane: massive spending no matter how wasteful as an economic stimulus, coupled with negative interest rates to discourage saving, in order to deliberately inflate bubbles whenever possible and keep business as usual running along. I find it fascinating that the economic mainstream is beginning to (re)understand the limits of growth, but is so caught up in the ideology of perpetual growth that they're willing to blow up bubbles on purpose just to keep the illusion going. This does make me wonder if the next crash might bring about a change in the dominant economic paradigm, once some critical mass of people wakes up to the fact that long-term growth has ended.<br><br>http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/secular-stagnation-coalmines-bubbles-and-larry-summers/<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c36491690021960938 title="comment permalink">4/20/14, 12:41 AM</a><br><br>

A neighbor of mine lost his high status managerial job recently, and you could see his self-confidence crumble in the course of just a few weeks. He seemed to be in the race of his life between getting another similar job and losing his mind completely. The same thing happened to me about ten years ago, but circumstances required me to take a different path and get off the employment train. I'm glad that I did. <br><br>At the same time it does seem that a person's self-esteem should be partly linked to their work. But it's much better to have it connected to how productive you are, and also to how much you are facing reality in your circumstances, than it is to status and title and whether your career expectations were met and all that jazz. It's incredible to me now, looking back at my old managerial lifestyle, how incredibly unproductive I was, moving from meeting to meeting to typing stuff, with very little tangible stuff to show for it.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c6561230829884038636 title="comment permalink">4/20/14, 5:40 AM</a><br><br>

Week after week of careful and well written analysis all on a free blog, its very existence debunking the myth of more money = more value. I came across this blog late last year while reading another recently discovered and well done series, Do the math by Tom Murphy. I have been trying to suggest that something is wrong with our current direction as a civilization and have been handing out to friends, various versions of what we might do about it. I am currently going through the 2012 -2011 posts. I have tried the story challenge and found the exercise useful. Here are my efforts.<br>http://vivalnotes.blogspot.com/<br>More may be on the way.<br> As for the this week's post, I can easily agree with you. I still mostly do odd jobs despite being a university graduate. since the field I choose to study was for personal interest I don't feel too cheated (importantly I didn't have to take loans so that helps), but I suspect it will be nasty when most people find out that the promises the education industry makes are no better than pyramid schemes. Will there be a revolt against knowledge as a pursuit for its own sake? <br>I am from the third world and it is worth noting that in many such 'developing nations', even relatively highly paid corporate and civil servants with stable jobs, practice subsistence farming almost out of habit, especially if they live in the rural areas. Even among the wealthy there are many who remember far simpler if not harsher times. But as I have found out, trying to say that the servile nations of the world are not going to have the lifestyle currently enjoyed by their former (some say they still are)masters, is not something that is politically viable. it will be interesting to see what values and narratives these nations will adopt whenever it becomes clear that the game of trying to become a "first world nation" has ended and despite the high scores of some teams, in fact produced no winners. <br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c494552662959690548 title="comment permalink">4/20/14, 11:03 AM</a><br><br>

Many, if not most, of them are already producing durable goods and services for trade or barter, and are already living outside the "legitimate" economy, on a lot fewer resources than the average middle class American family. And a lot of them are great role models for communitarian values, living cooperatively in extended families and close knit communities. And they are that much closer to traditional/non industrial lifestyles than the average middle class American I just wonder how many in the peak oil/sustainability scene have a broad enough outlook to view undocumented immigrants as a valuable resource for the future ahead? I'm glad that I speak, read, &amp; write Spanish well enough. I'm sure it will be useful.<br>My biggest concern in working with Latin American immigrants is that they are assimilating way too much of the dominant extravagant culture, that they are idealizing and internalizing too much of the extravagant American culture that is past its pull date already, and don't sufficiently value the gifts that their traditional culture has to offer.<br>JMG,<br>regarding insurrection in the West, I think the violence that the US will unleash will be one for the record books, looking back from the Civil War to Vietnam to Iraq, the US has deployed a scorched earth strategy dealing with insurgents, and considering that a Western/Southern insurrection would be an existensial threat to a weakened US, the violence unleashed would probably make Sherman's march to the sea/burning of Atlanta look tame in comparison.<br>Regarding needing land to do anything to prepare for post-employment, I've already accepted that I'm already financially collapsed enough not to aspire to buy a home/land. I'm already thinking in feudal terms, of what skills or trades that I could learn that would be useful to someone who already has land. I don't think you need land to be useful in a post-industrial economy. It's only been in postwar America that the ideal of home/land ownership is the norm.

I was so impressed with it that I think I will begin using her method tomorrow, or as soon as I can figure out where to come up with a huge enough amount of mulch, which I think has to be hay.<br><br>What I'm going to do is a combination of Bob Gregory's soil correction methods as taught at Berea Gardens, yes you can google it, and her no-till mulch method.<br><br>I'm very impressed with his results, too, including the health of his family. <br><br>Because of the mulch there's less weed problem (very little after a couple of years)and the ground isn't exactly bare either. <br>I've been somewhat perplexed by the way everyone has expensive rototillers and one guy at our farmer's market says he uses his tiller every week to control weeds. When I told my sister she said, "I do not approve! You lose moisture, worms, and soil texture. Better to mulch heavily. Then as the mulch breaks down it adds organic matter to the soil."<br><br>With Emilia's method, you till once and make mounds, and never disturb the soil again. The mounds are kept covered with mulch and you make a hole in the mulch to plant and then lightly close it over. <br><br>So I might not need a rototiller.<br><br>Now, as to Bob Gregory, we've got local farmers here who've done well for many years and they are absolutely glad of what they have learned from him. And, if you don't feel like coming for his week long class, he's got a 6 CD set that's probably about as good.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c7534236470305548632 title="comment permalink">4/20/14, 9:02 PM</a><br><br>

I'm in general agreement with those points re 9/11. I've considered it a dead issue for years, as did Ruppert who said in January 2005 that he and others "Gave it their best shot, but the window of opportunity for any meaningful political change or accountability has long gone" (words to that effect). <br><br>After that, Peak Oil issues, and such events at the BP and Fukushima disasters were his number one priority. He became too "out there" for me though. It's becoming clear that he was suicidal on and off for a number of years and turned to Native American Philosophy and Spirituality in an attempt to stave off his demons, but alas to no avail. <br><br>I do however still discuss the subject of 9/11 a little with a couple of researchers, in particular Jon Gold. This is partly because of my own continued fascination with the subject, but mainly because Gold is very aware of the context of "Business as Usual" and the damage it is doing and how the event is used as justification for ignoring the major predicaments of our time. <br><br>He doesn't "Theorise" at all, but sticks to the facts. Quite rightly, he always says that he doesn't know what really happened on that day, but only that we were lied to and his activism for issues such as the health of the 9/11 First Responders, the Families of the victims, Anti-War/Anti-Empire in general and the Israeli-Palestine issue are notable and worthwhile and undertaken with a great deal of compassion and respect for human life.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c7439396156328201270 title="comment permalink">4/21/14, 2:00 AM</a><br><br>

Fun times!<br><br>When the English first settled Australia, they offered manufactured goods to the Aboriginals. The Aboriginals in turn took those manufactured goods and promptly discarded them - much to the dismay of the Europeans.<br><br>What is interesting is that the Europeans placed value in the manufactured goods, whilst the Aboriginals placed value in natural capital. The difference itself is both quite fascinating and telling. The similarities are also interesting in that both parties recognised the concept of "value".<br><br>In fact my current understanding is that our European concept of land ownership with clearly defined boundaries translated quite well into the Aboriginal culture. The difference however was in the concept of value. The Aboriginals considered that land with higher natural capital was more valuable. Natural capital translates to more wallabies, wombats, kangaroos, higher diversity of plants (useful or otherwise), wells, springs etc. than your neighbours.<br><br>Europeans on the other hand consider many factors other than natural capital when considering the abstract value of land. Some of those factors include social capital in the form of location, perceived prestige, access to markets and employment etc.<br><br>Anyway, so I'm wondering about the orchard picking up kindling (it is very windy today - not enough to run a turbine though, unfortunately) and a thought bubble pops into my head: Our culture is fixated on the purely magical definition of the understanding of the term "value".<br><br>So, how does all of this relate to banking? Well, I was recently reading an article about how the big four banks here, are now considered "too big to fail".<br><br><a href=http://www.theage.com.au/business/size-matters-for-the-banks-for-better-and-perhaps-for-worse-20140418-36w93.html rel=nofollow>Size matters for the banks for better and perhaps for worse</a><br><br>It is an interesting article, well I thought so anyway. What jumped out at me immediately was the statistic that between 1995 and 2010 the four big banks (Down Under) Balance Sheets here jumped from 94% of GDP to 193% of GDP. Now, read that statistic again and have a good think about it. How is it possible?<br><br>As an interesting side note the Australian government provides a tax payer backed guarantee for deposits up to AU$250,000 and the banks themselves pay nothing in return for this government support on the understanding that they are too big to fail. There are no funds held aside by the government either to support this guarantee thus there is a bit of soul searching about the issue.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c4975721377207861665 title="comment permalink">4/21/14, 3:27 AM</a><br><br>

The main issue is how could the banks have possibly jumped that percentage of GDP in such a short period of time?<br><br>The simple answer is that the financial markets have very recently (in the past couple of decades) become unaligned with the natural capital of the nation. There can be room for no other explanation.<br><br>Property value growth here is obviously the main driver of this statistic.<br><br>If the financial markets become disconnected with the natural capital of a nation then obviously banks are required to provide the vehicle for demonstrating any imbalance to all and sundry (ie. You can look at a piece of paper and think about how big your phallus is relative to others!). They are essentially a tool with which to capture and display abstract wealth and serve very little other purpose.<br><br>Banks are clearly middle men that have captured the market for their own benefit.<br><br>So, let’s presume that property values are purely abstract and based on magical (as understood here) considerations.<br><br>Much of that abstract wealth I can see being spent on lifestyle and medical choices of the baby boomers in the next decade or so. There is not enough abstract wealth for the next generation - by a long way.<br><br><a href=http://www.afr.com/p/personal_finance/smart_money/inheritance_baby_boomers_leave_slim_OryNX0LRrAjUUu1HtJiIwM rel=nofollow>Baby boomers leave slim inheritance</a><br><br>There is little wonder that many baby boomer parents are assisting their children financially with housing and education. It is unconscionable that they would do otherwise. It is hardly a source of pride if anyone looks at the big picture.<br><br>Many older people in my profession never had to go to university or obtain a post graduate simply to trade at the same level that I achieved. They also receive remuneration - even now - well in excess of anything that I've ever achieved. Housing was also affordable for those baby boomers with only 3 years of salary (with a single income). But, by the time I got to that point housing required 7 years of two people working full time whilst also paying off student debts. That study I had to wholly undertake part time too due to the lifestyle choices of my baby boomer parents.<br><br>Over here, the screws of complexity just seem to be turning tighter too in all sorts of areas in a last ditch effort to extract wealth from any source possible.<br><br>All of those indicators just tell me that decline is well and truly amongst us. My gut feel says that it won't be until we remember to fixate our attentions on the natural capital that we'll stabilise as a society.<br><br>In the future, however, if the younger generations ever cotton onto the fact that they’ve been fracked, then my gut feel says that they may just be pretty angry about it.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c6755518810815539180 title="comment permalink">4/21/14, 3:27 AM</a><br><br>

He is truly an inspiring example of how one can make a living and connect with and give back to one's community. None of the garden beds that he starts have borders. As he said when I asked him how he keeps his soil and seed from washing away, "A garden doesn't have to be in a box." They make all their own soil on site through an intensive composting operation and because they don't screen their finished soil it still has enough organic matter to hold together in a two foot high raised bed with no borders. It's a great example of building healthy soil and having a productive garden with almost no start up cost or extra material needed.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c1222938193421746583 title="comment permalink">4/21/14, 5:03 AM</a><br><br>

Warren Johnson's <i>Muddling Toward Frugality</i> remains a critically important guide. <br><br>Zyriz, got your stories -- you're in the contest. As for the Third World, I suspect that at least some nonindustrial countries are going to come out way ahead as the industrial age winds down, precisely because so many people still know how to produce food and other necessities for themselves, not to mention how to get by in very hard times. The casualty rate here in America as the formerly privileged learn how to do that is likely to be considerable. <br><br>Mark, I'm impressed that there isn't a more widespread effort to deny it!<br><br>Shane, I'm sorry to say that you're right -- not least because that kind of strategy only works when the earth-scorchers can count on an overwhelming preponderance of force. At this point the US military is huge but brittle, and a little inspired monkeywrenching in the wrong place could leave it spectacularly vulnerable -- and if it's abandoned the protections of the Geneva convention and of basic humanity, the blowback is likely to be horrific. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, thanks for the links!<br><br>Babylon, yes, that's also an option. Entertainers made a decent living right through the dark ages, if they knew how to appeal to the taste of barbarian warbands!<br><br>Orwellian, oh, granted, it's an interesting question -- like the questions around exactly how JFK was assassinated. My objection is purely that too many people seem to think that arguing about how one or the other happened is a viable substitute for doing something about the future that's breathing down all our necks. <br><br>Cherokee, it's possible because the manufacture of hallucinatory wealth is very nearly the only industry left that makes any large amount of money. Those huge balance sheets consist of make-believe money, unpayable IOUs conjured out of thin air. It's an interesting spectacle, not least because as far as I know, nobody's ever tried that particular way of wrecking an economy before, and there's much to be learned in watching how it plays out. <br><br>Phil, Borsodi's comment about festivals is intriguing. Ross Nichols, arguably the 20th century's most influential Druid thinker, wrote an essay on the revival of rural life that drew exactly the same conclusion: start with the festivals, the rituals, the things that make rural life meaningful and fun, and the rest will follow. <br><br>Jogger momma, thanks for the info! My methods are not too different from Allen's, for whatever that's worth. <br><br>Anne, and why should carding be a bottleneck? I know a lot of people -- my wife is one of them -- who card wool themselves; it's not a difficult process, and can be done using very simple hand tools. <br><br>Bogatyr, thanks for the link.

In many nonindustrial societies, there were specific trades set aside for the disabled -- massage, for example, was customarily reserved for blind people in feudal Japan -- and though it'll be a while before that kind of set-aside becomes common again, there are plenty of crafts that can be done by someone with a disability even now. <br><br>Daelach, the feudal aristocracy in a medieval society, counting everyone from the king or shogun down to the lowliest man-at-arms or samurai, amounts to maybe five per cent of the population; another five per cent consists of religious professionals, and then you get maybe ten per cent in the various skilled trades, leaving 80 per cent working in subsistence food production or the household economy that supports it. Nowadays the proportions are reversed -- we have maybe 20 per cent of the population engaged in something productive, and 80 per cent in one or another parasitic role. That's going to change, in a big way, as the take-it-from-others class contracts to a scale that a nonfossil fuel society can support. As for the personnel -- yes, in parallel historical situations there's a 100% turnover in personnel, because the skill set that allows you to successfully parasitize a complex civilization has essentially no overlap with the skill set that enables you to claw your way to the top in a dark age warrior culture.<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c6321804582602053001 title="comment permalink">4/22/14, 2:20 PM</a><br><br>

Once that runs out of fuel, we will have to redirect a huge percentage of the working force to farming (unless we agree to starve).<br><br><a href=the-end-of-employment.html#c1132818534643661737 title="comment permalink">4/22/14, 3:09 PM</a><br><br>

It will be interesting too in that we have the option this time around of continuing to feed the beast. It will only stop being fed if we make the decision to do so (and few in developed countries show any signs of doing so). One possible outcome is that it may just possibly die a quiet death as it gains increasing irrelevance? Dunno. Possibly, default and replacement may end up being the more likely outcome though. There are probably all sorts of nightmare scenarios though.<br><br>Over here, they are throwing everything they have at it. The rules have changed to allow people to purchase geared (ie. with borrowings) investment properties in their superannuation funds. The superannuation system was specifically established with the rule: thou must not borrow. But somehow the rules changed. I’ve read that there are financial planners obtaining real estate licenses so they can recommend real estate. They were previously not allowed to do so as real estate is not considered to be a financial product. <br><br>What is really interesting is that in the very small window of time that I hear commercial radio (usually in other people’s businesses), commercials are spruiking this form of investment.<br><br>Remote Florida real estate anyone?<br><br>Hi Thrig,<br><br>Yeah. Plenty of uber wealthy people lost their shirts during the Great Depression. I understand the technical definition of capital. However, if the real world meaning of that term becomes distorted then what does it mean in the future and what can it purchase?<br><br>Hi Deborah,<br><br>Thanks for the idea, that's why I keep coming back here. You can buy them too. Nice work.<br><br>In cooler and drier areas carob is an excellent substitute and fixes nitrogen into the soil too.
