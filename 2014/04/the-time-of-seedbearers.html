Myths, according to the philosopher Sallust, are things that never happened but always are. With a few modifications, the same rule applies to the enduring narratives of every culture, the stories that find a new audience in every generation as long as their parent cultures last.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Stories of that stature don’t need to chronicle events that actually took place to have something profoundly relevant to say, and the heroic quest I used last week to frame a satire on the embarrassingly unheroic behavior of many of industrial civilization’s more privileged inmates is no exception to that rule. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s true of hero tales generally, of course. The thegns and ceorls who sat spellbound in an Anglo-Saxon meadhall while a scop chanted the deeds of Beowulf to the sound of a six-stringed lyre didn’t have to face the prospect of wrestling with cannibalistic ogres or battling fire-breathing dragons, and were doubtless well aware of that fact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If they believed that terrible creatures of a kind no longer found once existed in the legendary past, why, so do we—the difference in our case is merely that we call our monsters “dinosaurs,” and insist that our paleontologist-storytellers be prepared to show us the bones. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The audience in the meadhall never wondered whether Beowulf was a historical figure in the same sense as their own great-grandparents. Since history and legend hadn’t yet separated out in the thinking of the time, Beowulf and those great-grandparents occupied exactly the same status, that of people in the past about whom stories were told. Further than that it was unnecessary to go, since what mattered to them about Beowulf was not whether he lived but how he lived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The tale’s original audience, it’s worth recalling, got up the next morning to face the challenges of life in dark age Britain, in which defending their community against savage violence was a commonplace event; having the example of Beowulf’s courage and loyalty in mind must have made that harsh reality a little easier to face. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same point can be made about the hero tale I borrowed and rewrote in last week’s post, Tolkien’s <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Frodo Baggins was no Beowulf, which was of course exactly the point, since Tolkien was writing for a different audience in a different age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The experience of being wrenched out of a peaceful community and sent on a long march toward horror and death was one that Tolkien faced as a young man in the First World War, and watched his sons face in the Second. That’s what gave Tolkien’s tale its appeal: his hobbits were ordinary people facing extraordinary challenges, like so many people in the bitter years of the early twentieth century. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The contrast between <i>Beowulf</i> and
<i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is precisely that between the beginning and the zenith of a civilization. Beowulf, like his audience, was born into an age of chaos and violence, and there was never any question of what he was supposed to do about it; the only detail that had to be settled was how many of the horrors of his time he would overcome before one of them finally killed him. Frodo Baggins, like his audience, was born into a world that was mostly at peace, but found itself faced with a resurgence of a nightmare that everyone in his community thought had been laid to rest for good. In Frodo’s case, the question of what he was going to do about the crisis of his age was what mattered most—and of course that’s why I was able to stand Tolkien’s narrative on its head last week, by tracing out what would have happened if Frodo’s answer had been different.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Give it a few more centuries, and it’s a safe bet that the stories that matter will be back on Beowulf’s side of the equation, as the process of decline and fall now under way leads into an era of dissolution and rebirth that we might as well call by the time-honored label “dark age.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For the time being, though, most of us are still on Frodo’s side of things, trying to come to terms with the appalling realization that the world we know is coming apart and it’s up to us to do something about it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That said, there’s a crucial difference between the situation faced by Frodo Baggins and his friends in Middle-earth, and the situation faced by those of us who have awakened to the crisis of our time here and now. Tolkien was a profoundly conservative thinker and writer, in the full sense of that word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The plot engine of his works of adult fiction, <i>The Silmarillion</i> just as much as
<i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, was always the struggle to hold onto the last scraps of a glorious past, and his powers of evil want to make Middle-earth modern, efficient and up-to-date by annihilating the past and replacing it with a cutting-edge industrial landscape of slagheaps and smokestacks. It’s thus no accident that Saruman’s speech to Gandalf in book two, chapter two of <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> is a parody of the modern rhetoric of progress, or that <i>The Return of the King</i> ends with a Luddite revolt against Sharkey’s attempted industrialization of the Shire; Tolkien was a keen and acerbic observer of twentieth-century England, and wove much of his own political thought into his stories. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The victory won by Tolkien’s protagonists in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, accordingly, amounted to restoring Middle-Earth as far as possible to the condition it was in before the War of the Ring, with the clock turned back a bit further here and there—for example, the reestablishment of the monarchy in Gondor—and a keen sense of loss surrounding those changes that couldn’t be undone. That was a reasonable goal in Tolkien’s imagined setting, and it’s understandable that so many people want to achieve the same thing here and now:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>to preserve some semblance of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>industrial civilization in the teeth of the rising spiral of crises that are already beginning to tear it apart. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I can sympathize with their desire. It’s become fashionable in many circles to ignore the achievements of the industrial age and focus purely on its failures, or to fixate on the places where it fell short of the frankly Utopian hopes that clustered around its rise. If the Enlightenment turned out to be far more of a mixed blessing than its more enthusiastic prophets liked to imagine, and if so many achievements of science and technology turned into sources of immense misery once they were whored out in the service of greed and political power, the same can be said of most human things: “If it has passed from the high and the beautiful to darkness and ruin,” Tolkien commented of a not dissimilar trajectory, “that was of old the fate of Arda marred.” Still, the window of opportunity through which modern industrial civilization might have been able to escape its unwelcome destiny has long since slammed shut. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s one of the things I meant to suggest in last week’s post by sketching out a Middle-earth already ravaged by the Dark Lord, in which most of the heroes of Tolkien’s trilogy were dead and most of the things they fought to save had already been lost. Even with those changes, though, Tolkien’s narrative no longer fits the crisis of our age as well as it did a few decades back. Our Ring of Power was the fantastic glut of energy we got from fossil fuels; we could have renounced it, as Tolkien’s characters renounced the One Ring, before we’d burnt enough to destabilize the climate and locked ourselves into a set of economic arrangements with no future...but that’s not what happened, of course. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We didn’t make that collective choice when it still could have made a difference:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>when peak oil was still decades in the future, anthropogenic climate change hadn’t yet begun to destabilize the planet’s ice sheets and weather patterns, and the variables that define the crisis of our age—depletion rates, CO2 concentrations, global population, and the rest of them—were a good deal less overwhelming than they’ve now become.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As <i>The Limits to Growth</i> pointed out more than four decades ago, any effort to extract industrial civilization from the trap it made for itself had to get under way long before the jaws of that trap began to bite, because the rising economic burden inflicted by the ongoing depletion of nonrenewable resources and the impacts of pollution and ecosystem degradation were eating away at the surplus wealth needed to meet the costs of the transition to sustainability. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That prediction has now become our reality. Grandiose visions of vast renewable-energy buildouts and geoengineering projects on a global scale, of the kind being hawked so ebulliently these days by the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>prophets of eternal business as usual, fit awkwardly with the reality that a great many industrial nations can no longer afford to maintain basic infrastructures or to keep large and growing fractions of their populations from sliding into desperate poverty. The choice that I discussed in last week’s post, reduced to its hard economic bones, was whether we were going to put what remained of our stock of fossil fuels and other nonrenewable resources into maintaining our current standard of living for a while longer, or whether we were going to put it into building a livable world for our grandchildren. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The great majority of us chose the first option, and insisting at the top of our lungs that of course we could have both did nothing to keep the second from slipping away into the realm of might-have-beens. The political will to make the changes and accept the sacrifices that would be required to do anything else went missing in action in the 1980s and hasn’t been seen since. That’s the trap that was hidden in the crisis of our age: while the costs of transition were still small enough that we could have met them without major sacrifice, the consequences of inaction were still far enough in the future that most people could pretend they weren’t there; by the time the consequences were hard to ignore, the costs of transition had become too great for most people to accept—and not too long after that, they had become too great to be met at all. .</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As a commentary on our current situation, in other words, the story of the heroic quest has passed its pull date. As I noted years ago,
<a href=../../2006/05/knowing-only-one-story.html>insisting that the world must always follow a single narrative</a> is a fertile source of misunderstanding and misery. Consider the popular insistence that the world can grow its way out of problems caused by growth—as though you could treat the consequences of chronic alcoholism by drinking even more heavily! What gives that frankly idiotic claim the appeal it has is that it draws on one of the standard stories of our age, the Horatio Alger story of the person who overcame long odds to make a success of himself. That does happen sometimes, which is why it’s a popular story; the lie creeps in when the claim gets made that this is <i>always</i> what happens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When people insist, as so many of them do, that of course we’ll overcome the limits to growth and every other obstacle to our allegedly preordained destiny out there among the stars, all that means is that they have a single story wedged into their imagination so tightly that mere reality can’t shake it loose. The same thing’s true of all the other credos I’ve discussed in recent posts, from “they’ll think of something” through “it’s all somebody else’s fault” right on up to “we’re all going to be extinct soon anyway so it doesn’t matter any more.” Choose any thoughtstopper you like from your randomly generated <a href=http://buzzwordbingogame.com/cards/peak_oil_denial/ >Peak Oil Denial Bingo</a> card, and behind it lies a single story, repeating itself monotonously over and over in the heads of those who can’t imagine the world unfolding in any other way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The insistence that it’s not too late, that there must still be time to keep industrial civilization from crashing into ruin if only we all come together to make one great effort, and that there’s any reason to think that we can and will all come together, is another example. The narrative behind that claim has a profound appeal to people nowadays, which is why stories that feature it—again, Tolkien’s trilogy comes to mind—are as popular as they are. It’s deeply consoling to be told that there’s still one last chance to escape the harsh future that’s already taking shape around us. It seems almost cruel to point out that whether a belief appeals to our emotions has no bearing on whether or not it’s true. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The suggestion that I’ve been making since this blog first began eight years ago is that we’re long past the point at which modern industrial civilization might still have been rescued from the consequences of its own mistakes. If that’s the case, it’s no longer useful to put the very limited resources we have left into trying to stop the inevitable, and it’s even less useful to wallow in wishful thinking about how splendid it would be if the few of us who recognize the predicament we’re in were to be joined by enough other people to make a difference. If anything of value is to get through the harsh decades and centuries ahead of us, if anything worth saving is to be rescued from the wreck of our civilization, there’s plenty of work to do, and daydreaming about mass movements that aren’t happening and grand projects we can no longer afford simply wastes what little time we still have left. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s why I’ve tried to suggest <a href=../../2012/01/blood-of-earth-or-pulp-nonfiction.html>in previous posts here</a> that it’s time to set aside some of our more familiar stories and try reframing the crisis of our age in less shopworn ways. There are plenty of viable options—plenty, that is, of narratives that talk about what happens when the last hope of rescue has gone whistling down the wind and it’s time to figure out what can be saved in the midst of disaster—but the one that keeps coming back to my mind is one I learned and, ironically, dismissed as uninteresting quite a few decades ago, in the early years of my esoteric studies: the old legend of the fall of Atlantis. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably necessary to note here that whether Atlantis existed as a historical reality is not the point. While it’s interesting to speculate about whether human societies more advanced than current theory suggests might have <a href="http://llewellyn.com/product.php?ean=9780738709789">flourished in the late Ice Age and then drowned beneath rising seas</a>, those speculations are as irrelevant here as trying to fit Grendel and his mother into the family tree of the Hominidae, say, or discussing how plate tectonics could have produced the improbable mountain ranges of Middle-earth. Whatever else it might or might not have been, Atlantis is a story, one that has a potent presence in our collective imagination. Like <i>Beowulf</i>
or <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, the Atlantis story is about the confrontation with evil, but where Beowulf comes at the beginning of a civilization and Frodo Baggins marks its zenith, the Atlantis story illuminates its end.
</div>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, the version of the story of Atlantis I learned, in common with most of the versions in circulation in occult schools in those days, had three details that you won’t find in Plato’s account, or in most of the rehashes that have been churned out by the rejected-knowledge industry over the last century or so. First, according to that version, Atlantis didn’t sink all at once; rather, there were three inundations separated by long intervals. Second, the sinking of Atlantis wasn’t a natural disaster; it was the direct result of the clueless actions of the Atlanteans, who brought destruction on themselves by their misuse of advanced technology. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The third detail, though, is the one that matters here. According to the mimeographed lessons I studied back in the day, as it became clear that Atlantean technology had the potential to bring about terrifying blowback, the Atlanteans divided into two factions: the Children of the Law of One, who took the warnings seriously and tried to get the rest of Atlantean society to do so, and the Servants of the Dark Face, who dismissed the whole issue—I don’t know for a fact that these latter went around saying “I’m sure the priests of the Sun Temple will think of something,” “orichalcum will always be with us,” “the ice age wasn’t ended by an ice shortage,” and the like, but it seems likely. Those of my readers who haven’t spent the last forty years hiding at the bottom of the sea will know instantly which of these factions spoke for the majority and which was marginalized and derided as a bunch of doomers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
According to the story, when the First Inundation hit and a big chunk of Atlantis ended up permanently beneath the sea, the shock managed to convince a lot of Atlanteans that the Children of the Law of One had a point, and for a while there was an organized effort to stop doing the things that were causing the blowback. As the immediate memories of the Inundation faded, though, people convinced themselves that the flooding had just been one of those things, and went back to their old habits. When the Second Inundation followed and all of Atlantis sank but the two big islands of Ruta and Daitya, though, the same pattern didn’t repeat itself; the Children of the Law of One were marginalized even further, and the Servants of the Dark Face became even more of a majority, because nobody wanted to admit the role their own actions had had in causing the catastrophe. Again, those of my readers who have been paying attention for the last forty years know this story inside and out. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s what happened next, though, that matters most. In the years between the Second Inundation and the Third and last one, so the story goes, Atlantis was for all practical purposes a madhouse with the inmates in charge. Everybody knew what was going to happen and nobody wanted to deal with the implications of that knowledge, and the strain expressed itself in orgiastic excess, bizarre belief systems, and a rising spiral of political conflict ending in civil war—anything you care to name, as long as it didn’t address the fact that Atlantis was destroying itself and that nearly all the Atlanteans were enthusiastic participants in the activities driving the destruction. That was when the Children of the Law of One looked at one another and, so to speak, cashed out their accounts at the First National Bank of Atlantis, invested the proceeds in shipping, and sailed off to distant lands to become the seedbearers of the new age of the world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the story that speaks to me just now—enough so that I’ve more than once considered writing a fantasy novel about the fall of Atlantis as a way of talking about the crisis of our age. Of course that story doesn’t speak to everyone, and the belief systems that insist either that everything is fine or that nothing can be done anyway have no shortage of enthusiasts. If these belief systems turn out to be as delusional as they look, though, what then? The future that very few people are willing to consider or prepare for is the one that history shows us is the common destiny of every other failed civilization:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the long, bitter, ragged road of decline and fall into a dark age, from which future civilizations will eventually be born. If that’s the future ahead of us, as I believe it is, the necessary preparations need to be made now, if the best achievements of our age are to be carried into the future when the time of the seedbearers arrives. </div>

Even archdruids need to take a break from time to time, and it’s been quite a while since I took time off from these weekly essays. <i>The Archdruid Report</i> will therefore be on hiatus for the next month and a half. I’ll look forward to meeting my readers at <a href=http://ageoflimits.org/ >The Age of Limits conference in southern Pennsylvania</a>, the <a href=http://www.eeecourse.org/ > Economics, Energy and Environment conference in London</a>, or one of the less peak oil-centric speaking gigs I’ll be having over the same period. In the meantime, I wish my readers good weather for gardening, pleasant days of weatherstripping and caulking, and plenty of spare time to learn the knowledge and skills that will be needed in the future ahead of us; we’ll talk again on June 18th.</div>

People like me have to show the shells. :-)<br><br>"As a commentary on our current situation, in other words, the story of the heroic quest has passed its pull date."<br><br>I can think of a special case of a story that contains a heroic quest that I think still applies--the legend of King Arthur. The entire arc is that of a tragedy, but it does have the quest for the Holy Grail as its centerpiece. In some of its earlier incarnations as well as one of its later ones, "The Mists of Avalon," the story is set during the fall of the Roman Empire and the beginning of the Dark Ages. An updated version of the Arthur legend might be an inspiration to a group of people who figure out how to salvage a piece of a dying civilization in order to found a new one.<br><br>"[T]he sinking of Atlantis wasn’t a natural disaster; it was the direct result of the clueless actions of the Atlanteans, who brought destruction on themselves by their misuse of advanced technology."<br><br>I've run into a version of that. Larry Niven's "The Magic Goes Away," an extended metaphor for the depletion of fossil fuels, opens with a character escaping Atlantis as it sank. It turns out that the continent had been kept above water through the use of magic. When the mana that fueled the magic was exhausted, the island continent disappeared beneath the waves. Those who could survive with magic could swim away. Those that couldn't, died.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Goes_Away<br><br>As for the rest of the story, the protagonist figures out a way to get the magic back, but it would result in the destruction of the world as he knew it. He decided that it wasn't worth it, almost too late. He also regrets how wasteful he had been with magic earlier in his life.<br><br><a href=#c7450590387007826000 title="comment permalink">4/30/14, 8:34 PM</a><br><br>

R. Martin interesting in this context (apparently two 'R's is <i>de rigeur</i> for fantasy authors):<br><br><i>A major concern in A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones is power. Almost everybody – except maybe Daenerys, across the waters with her dragons – wields power badly. Ruling is hard. This was maybe my answer to Tolkien, whom, as much as I admire him, I do quibble with. Lord of the Rings had a very medieval philosophy: that if the king was a good man, the land would prosper. We look at real history and it’s not that simple. Tolkien can say that Aragorn became king and reigned for a hundred years, and he was wise and good. But Tolkien doesn’t ask the question: What was Aragorn’s tax policy? Did he maintain a standing army? What did he do in times of flood and famine? And what about all these orcs? By the end of the war, Sauron is gone but all of the orcs aren’t gone – they’re in the mountains. Did Aragorn pursue a policy of systematic genocide and kill them? Even the little baby orcs, in their little orc cradles?<br><br>In real life, real-life kings had real-life problems to deal with. Just being a good guy was not the answer. You had to make hard, hard decisions. Sometimes what seemed to be a good decision turned around and bit you in the ass; it was the law of unintended consequences. I’ve tried to get at some of these in my books. My people who are trying to rule don’t have an easy time of it. Just having good intentions doesn’t make you a wise king.</i><br><br>(from his recent interview with <i>Rolling Stone</i>)<br><br><a href=#c7031097147378610892 title="comment permalink">4/30/14, 8:58 PM</a><br><br>

Walk to Point X and huck that Ring. Easier said than done, of course, but nevertheless, simple and easy to understand. By contrast, our own heroic quests will have to be conceived and planned in our own heads, with woefully incomplete information, and the goals of our individual quests can and _must_ vary from person to person. In some respects, Frodo had it easy.<br><br><a href=#c7276845926583714241 title="comment permalink">4/30/14, 9:37 PM</a><br><br>

If I look carefully at my skill set, I don't see much that would be of use in a low energy future - and I'm a permaculture farmer! (For example, would I be able to get water to all the parts of our farm without the electric pump in our well dug with industrial drilling tech...) The one thing I cherish above my building and planting and growing skills, though, is my canny ability to ask useful questions and find creative solutions. I promise, anyone around and thriving a century from now will have this skill. In fact I'm not sure very much from our current industrial lives fits into an imagined post-industrial world besides a healthy can-do attitude and some seriously good luck.<br><br><a href=#c4753000365899892863 title="comment permalink">4/30/14, 9:46 PM</a><br><br>

Hope one of my stories makes the cut! I was actually entertaining writing a fantasy novel with very similar themes and structure as the Atlantis one you mentioned. It wouldn't be based on the ancient myth, but would still be a sort of reflection on our current madness a la Animal Farm. I'll let you know if I follow through with it.<br><br>Another feature that has changed since Tolkien's time, I think, is the desire to save what exists. I can't help but feel that everyone is ready for something new. If I were given the option of a reset at this point, or allowing things to continue as they are (with the same people/institutions/lifestyles as now), I'd have to vote for the reset. It's not just the inevitable future trend that is the problem, after all; our society is sick. There's a reason they die around this point. I'm sure you know that.

You're in the contest -- you and one mother of a lot of other people. I've got no fewer than 92 stories in the Space Bats folder right now, that compares to 63 for the first contest, and the quality has if anything nudged up a bit. I'm impressed by the amount of talent and interest this little jeu d'esprit of mine has attracted!<br><br>Andy, thank you -- and by all means blog away!<br><br>Travis, it's still on the agenda -- I can't provide a meaningful discussion of the next five centuries of North American history, after all, without talking about the natural (and unnatural) environment. As for the Quinn quote, I'd suggest that there's nothing fundamentally right with people, either...<br><br>Pinku-sensei, well, of course -- but for some reason the popular stories about prehistoric monsters in our society all have to do with vertebrates. Personally, I think that Beowulf wrestling with an <i>Anomalocaris</i> would make a great tale, but I'm in the minority. As for Arthur and the Grail, hmm -- that's a complex issue, not least because the Grail story in its mature form is a failed quest: the Grail is found, but then passes away from human sight forever. Still, it's an interesting thought. A happy Belteinne to you too!<br><br>Kutamun, I'll try to parse all that some other evening. <br><br>Glenn, you can make chain mail from wire coat hangers that can't be cut by an axe.

That's one of the reasons why I like the Atlantis story: the seedbearers didn't have a single endpoint to strive for, they were just trying to survive and preserve what they could, and had to face all the consequences of the Atlantean collapse without a guidebook or any end in sight. <br><br>Jcummings, I think there's a lot more than that. If your permaculture skills are dependent on complex machinery, learn new skills that aren't -- there are a great many ways to grow things that don't depend on an industrial economy, and some of them are much more sustainable than others! I've also argued that basic ecological theory and the scientific method could spare our descendants a lot of mistakes and misery. It might be worthwhile for you to take the time to think through that, and ask yourself what people in a deindustrial future might find useful among the things we have today. <br><br>Justin, there I think you're wrong. The reason it's so hard to see the power of stories in today's world is that so many of the stories that rule our lives are treated as literal truth; it's when we see them as stories that we can break out the editorial blue pencil and change them. <br><br>Derv, I think you're right -- one of the reasons there are so few real conservatives these days is that there's so little left to conserve!

I've been looking recently at a lot of fiction with a narrative of things not turning out well (that is, no shining utopia at the end of the tunnel), but with perhaps still some redeeming features. For example, this post brought back to mind the Cormac McCarthy The Road. Granted yes the novel is set in a classic sudden collapse post apocalypictic landscape, but what's encouraging/ inspiring the father and the son carring on, holding onto hope without really any idea about what hope there might be. The landscape around them certainly doesn't offer much. Its interesting too how while most people reading the book found it depressing, I found it quite peaceful and comforting (though i did see the film before reading the book). Hopefully that's a positive sign on my part.<br><br>Another brilliant piece of fiction with tragedy and only faint hope of partial redemption is the British film tyrannosaur. Its very gloomy and dark but at the same time with a powerful narrative of hope.<br><br>Anyway, just some reflections!

For Better or for worse I am seeing the narrative you sketched out in this post a lot more all over popular culture items. I can for example think of at least two computer games featuring a sinking Atlantis and people fleeing its imminent destruction narrative (these are Warcraft 3 and the Resistance: fall of man series for readers who are into pop culture). Whether people think they can do anything about beyond sinking into despair/carrying on zapping aliens on computer screens is of course quite another matter. The foundation of acceptance of the acceptance of a different story is maybe there, but perhaps this is mainly just more people going crazy in the twilight years of a civilization (like inventing computer games instead of doing something to preserve anything that still might be preserved of industrial civilization for example).<br><br><br><a href=#c8180950573803472233 title="comment permalink">5/1/14, 12:17 AM</a><br><br>

Early Thursday mornings with your posts have become a lovely ritual for me, so I'll miss them but will put the time to good use. <br><br>Reading this week's essay for some reason took me back to the days after 9/11 in the US. There was a brief opening back then in which hard questions could have been asked, a brief cracking of our collective confidence. But it was quickly covered up by a predictable response, the need to fight back and defend our freedoms and all that jazz - defend what we have, rather than change what we do. And then last week I was walking in NYC, where I've been doing some part-time work, and found myself at the ground zero site. It's now of course the site of the Freedom Tower, arising phoenix-like from the ashes. So the power of story and narrative is still strong, but the story is that "our lifestyle is not negotiable" and "defend the empire at all costs", etc. Maybe that's just the way it has to be, until it all comes crashing down. Have any empires ever voluntarily dismantled themselves?<br><br>Btw I'm now well into my copy of Star's Reach.

Usually better expressed and more deeply explored, too.<br><br>The myth of Atlantis only passed briefly through my head this week, largely in response to a news story about the latest science surrounding the 'tsunami' that had finally engulfed Dogger Land (which to the uninitiated was an island in the North Sea that disappeared beneath the post-glacial waters around 8,000 years ago). It's not that I had any notion of it being a historical Artlantis or anything like that, more of an appreciation that so much once-inhabited land is below the waves, and there could still be surprising discoveries from our distant past.<br><br>Perhaps the archetypal 'seedbearer' myth for our wider society (ie beyond the pale of those who even consider Atlantis...) is of course Noah and its Babylonian precursor. Although along with most of my generation, I'd rather hubristically dismiissed it as a 'mere myth', that is a groundless story, I'm now swinging back towards accepting that there is a substrate of truth behind it, namely a historical flood passed down in folk memory and eventually codified into something that served the interests of later cultures. Bear with me...<br><br>The three main features I put together were: 1) the homeland (heimat) of the Indo-European (IE) language group appears to be roughly the southern end of the Pontic Steppe; 2) IE languages radiated out suddenly around 5 or 6,000 BC, and 3) it has been suggested that the Bosphorus shelf burst around this time, flooding the Black Sea and dispersing the inhabitants of the region. It would be easy to see how different groups would migrate away and isolation would lead to the linguistic shifts that became the wide range of modern IE languages.<br><br>With Atlantis, I'm not sure whether the myth has arisen from a folk memory substrate, or if it was purely a creation of Plato. It might well have been derived from the Minoan culture which did so much to nurse-maid the Mycenean Greeks; it might even have been another, more distorted off-shoot of the Noachic tradition. If only someone could crack Linear A!<br><br>Anyway, the main point is that the truth and the usefulness of a myth may well become separated, and that the best way to miss both is to approach them literally.<br><br><a href=#c8654884494336069662 title="comment permalink">5/1/14, 5:25 AM</a><br><br>

I can't count how many times I've gotten into a conversation with someone, who uses the story of progress as if it is a literal fact in order disagree with me something peak oil-related.

Unfortunately there hasn't been the same amount of light drawn on the fundamentalists of the religion of progress (arguably the most dominant religion in contemporary society), who are treating their stories as literal truth.

One of the more valuable classes I took in college was a course on myth from around the world, which was not taught in an academic way. During the course we told and read many myths from around the world. The point of the class was to learn more about ourselves through myth. It's amazing how a simple tale can change a person.

We can't just hop in a ship with provisions and sail away from our Atlantis to some other land that isn't affected by our mistakes, and there's nowhere to go if we do, since no matter how far you run, Atlantis will be sinking and the seas will be rising. All of those stories, the Caananite flood myths, Atlantis, Tolkien's story of the fall of Numenor end with the heroes hopping on a ship and sailing away, which continues in modern myths of humans fleeing a dying earth in a spaceship (one hits TV, theatres, or bookstores at least once a year).

I've seen it done, and seen the tests. A coat of mail and a good sword might be worth handing down, though I suspect a black powder rifle might be even more so."<br><br>As an old SCA hand, I've made and used coat hanger wire mail. Early tests (Anno Societas II, about 1968) showed that the heir of a man wearing mail of any kind, struck with a mace or ax would inherit it virtually intact; almost immediately. One of the reasons I specified stainless flat lock washers was of course resistance to rust, but more importantly, flat wire mail made of square section or rectangular section wire resists cutting better because the blade strikes the full width of the wire rather than the tangent of the arc of the cross section. Oh yes, welded or riveted links are much better than butted, especially against thrusting weapons. In terms of armour, a helmet might be more useful; some kind of leather and padding makes very good cheap body armour.<br><br>I take your point about black powder weapons, with U.S. Civil War periond Minie Ball ammunition, a fairly fast muzzle loading rifle is practical. Still, we prefer bows in this household. Not that we can't have both, and AK-47 and AR-15 clones will probably last longer than the available ammunition will; which is to say my lifetime, and possibly my children's (the ammunition). But firearms and their advocacy, are as I recall, not meant to be the focus of TAR. Too many inflamed emotions from their adherents who tend to worship them and their opponents who tend to demonize them. Few seem able to view them dispassionately as a tool to be used, whether for good or for evil.<br><br>I think the most important thing I can give my heirs is knowledge, and the desire and means to acquire knowledge. Oh, I'll try to pass on my carpentry skills, and where the good fishing spots are; and my wife will pass on where things grow in the woods, how to find them, and what they're good for. But in the end, knowing how to learn is the most powerful tool we have.<br><br>Glenn<br><br>in the Bramblepatch<br>Marrowstone Island<br>Salish Sea<br>Cascadia<br><br><a href=#c6446332351961788120 title="comment permalink">5/1/14, 9:01 AM</a><br><br>

Within the Atlantis story, I just like the idea of including elements of "sacred", esoteric, or totally unfamiliar technologies that were retained and transmitted down from the Atlanteans. The superstructure collapses, but a few elements that were discovered under the protection of that superstructure might be transmittable, at least on some scale. Examples like, telekinesis, telepathy, healing arts, summoning, conjuring... who knows?<br><br>And considering more stories, upon reading Star's Reach online (much thanks for making available - I plan on giving it to a few people as a gift :) ) - a possible sequel came to mind. Set 200,000 years in the future. Slightly mutated humans, a couple ice ages and an age of jungle nasty hot, and a very ancient secret fellowship who guards the knowledge of how to re-contact the Others by radio. This fellowship holds the knowledge through the repeated, trance-like meditative recitation of an epic poem that contains clues... a poem in a language the fellows don't understand anymore, but hold very dear.<br><br>"Myths, according to the philosopher Sallust, are things that never happened but always are." It recently occurred to me that the myth of our time is unlimited energy. In the great sci fi epics, Star Wars and Star Trek, and many others, the sound of the details of where the energy comes is deafening in its silence.<br><br>I wonder if the stories of the future will return to Beowulf and the need to conquer the violent challenges that are commonplace. While human learning can be stifled by whether the past is even remembered, it seems likely that there will be tons of reminders to people of the consequences of hubris, in the form of pollution, ruins... perhaps a mythology surrounding the ultimate power of Gaia and the demonization of many human desires... ??<br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c635070940629063230 title="comment permalink">5/1/14, 9:57 AM</a><br><br>

The worst occurred when the dam that held back Lake Agassiz collapsed, sending sea levels 200 feet higher in a relatively short period of time. These rapid sea level rises would have caused catastrophic flooding in the low lying islands of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, which is the most likely site of Atlantis if it really existed, and in the lowlands and river valleys of Sundaland, which has been widely identified with the occult traditions concerning Lemuria. So the latest geological evidence actually tracks pretty well with some of the occult traditions about both Atlantis and Lemuria. This is especially curious, since geologists back in the days of Blavatsky, Alice Bailey, Dion Fortune and Edgar Cayce were not aware of these sudden sea level rises and were still very much wedded to the dogma of uniformitarianism.<br><br><a href=#c2624707275634843541 title="comment permalink">5/1/14, 2:03 PM</a><br><br>

I have made a recent observation on the "destiny in the stars" type techno optimists id like to share.<br><br>I have noticed that when they say that anything is possible, they are not really talking about "anything". They are talking about three things, three very specific things: Faster than light space travel. Quick and easy planetary scale terraforming. And the more fantastical elements of the Singularity such as AI significantly more intelligent than human beings, brain uploading and imortallity. These three things are there secret hope for the future they think is "supposed" to happen. Despite the fact that science has already proven one of them impossible and the others are likely at the very least impracticle and not likely to occur. Despite the fact that we could still have a very advanced very good society even without these things from now till the sun expands. And despite the fact that the Fermi Paradox is practically screaming at us that these things are at the very least just plain unlikely. As you have said before the idea that we will hit a wall some where in the future and NOT be able to break it down clashes with our culture mythos that we move forever onward and upward. You cant try and tell these people that it could still be pretty good even without these things iether, as they will just start talking about exploring space (as if we could not do that with probes), asteroids killing us all (as if those types of asteroids struck earth all the time, and there wasnt a more practicle means of defense that didnt involve space colonization.) About how we have experienced exponential growth in technology (like that means we will automatically experience exponential growth in it FOREVER). And the sun expanding and consuming the Earth (as if it were right around the corner and not billions of years from now, literrally more time than the first mulicelluar organisms apperaring on Earth till now.) Truth is anything short of space manifest destiny and total human dominence of nature and the universe will not satisfy them. They dress it up nice and optimistically but thats what it comes down to in the end. You cant say any of this of course as you immedietly get called a total luddit who hates science and technology and probably humanity too! I know, I used to be one and would have reacted much the same way, its a very tempting fantasy but a fantasy none the less.<br><br>Speaking of the Fermi Paradox I was wondering if you had ever heard of the Sustainability Solution to The Fermi Paradox. It basically says that the problems we are experiencing with lack of resources aliens very well may have experienced as well, wich is probably why its so unpopular. Its obviously alot more complex than that but I think you would find it interesting should you choose to look it up some time. On a side note there is a question ive been meaning to ask you. Obviously the insanely bloated population we have today is way too much but what do you think would be a good global population for an advanced ecotechnic society? Personally, considering we were already having problems with resouce growth(particularly wood) back before the industrial revolution I would put this at sub 500 million but not too much less myself, but I would be very interested to hear your opinion on this. Sorry for the long stream I dont comment on hear that often. anyway I hope your break time goes well and you get some well deserved rest, enjoy it!<br><br><a href=#c7961174605265994699 title="comment permalink">5/1/14, 2:24 PM</a><br><br>

What kind of story, in what kind of setting, has the most to say to our present predicament? Hmm...<br><br>Garde, I suppose so. I find zombies dreary, so haven't really followed the fad; still, if you're right and it's got a few useful lessons, that's something. <br><br>RogerCO, yes, I got it -- please put in a comment marked "not for posting" with your email on it so I can contact you if your story gets chosen. <br><br>Glenn, fascinating. I was involved in the SCA in the late 1970s, and watched a demo in which coathanger-wire mail over a straw bale was assaulted by a guy with an axe, and came through in remarkably good shape. (Of course you'd wear a padded leather gambeson underneath to deal with the impact; the mail's purely to prevent cutting.) <br><br>John, actually, given the consequences of the latter, there's an exact moral equivalence between slavery and fossil fuel use. In both cases person A is gaining direct economic benefit from the suffering of person B; it's just that in slavery, person B is person A's slave, and in fossil fuel use, person B is person A's descendant. <br><br>Chris, a really far-future story is something I've considered from time to time; it would be a massive challenge to come up with a future world that wasn't simply a rehash of our present or our past! <br><br>Thrig, I've seen the same thing many a time. Suggest leaving the car in the driveway, even if it's just now and again, and people get edgy and brittle. It's quite weird. <br><br>Val, the Law of One is the principle that all things are part of what we'd now call a whole system, so that everything connects to everything else and everything influences and is influenced by everything else. Yes, that's spelled "ecology" when it's expressed in the language of science!<br><br>Sheep, it folded due to a lack of entries. Clearly I have more aspiring writers than aspiring green-tech geeks among my readership!<br><br>SLClaire, by all means blog away -- but of course planting seeds comes first. <br><br>Phil, the seven stars go *way* back before Revelations -- John of Patmos was riffing off a very ancient pattern when he put that bit of symbolism into his book. <br><br>Unknown, of course -- it's that or admit that the whole shebang is going down.<br><br><a href=#c6409042201269700405 title="comment permalink">5/1/14, 3:01 PM</a><br><br>

We can't take the Atlantean escape route, or Noah's, because there is no 'ocean blue' that will take us to a New World. We are here, stuck, and all in this together. I really liked Eric's comment above about the saints, not the heroes, being the light bearers at the end of a civilisation. This is, in effect, the role the early Christians played at the dying of the Roman Empire and the beginning of the Dark Ages, not just preserving manuscripts, but literally going out into a dark world, unarmed, unprotected, and proclaiming a message of hope. Yes, a lot of them were martyred, but that just added to the appeal of this crazy, quixotic new religion. <br>And it was here that the Arthur myth was born, to make sense of a terrifying world where darkness was spreading. I used to think the Holy Grail quest was completely daft and pointless, but it was about finding meaning at a crossroad in history where the old stories didn't make sense any more.<br>So what we need now.. is a new story. A Christ, an Arthur, a Gandhi who can turn our current myths on their head.<br>Oh, and some martyrs..<br><br><a href=#c3348742394096937096 title="comment permalink">5/1/14, 5:57 PM</a><br><br>

The Archdruid has talked on a number of occasions about concept of ecology, ecosystems and systems theory in general being the organizing principle of not only many of the cutting edge sciences of today but of a new and emerging religious sensibility. This has led to me to wonder if it might be possible to come up with a theory of history based on the concept of ecology and ecologic succession as the organizing principle. Such a system would also incorporate insights from historians like Ibn Khaldun, Giambattista Vico, Oswald Spengler and Arnold Toynbee, all of whom had a cyclical view of history. Spengler in particular took a very organic view of history that borrowed heavily from Goethe, as well as the writings of Leo Frobenius, who is best known for his studies of African tribal cultures. Spengler in particular has had a huge influence on my thinking, and not just when it comes to history and philosophy. It seems to me that such an ecosystem based model might do a better job of making sense of history and the world around us. One of the ideas I have been toying with is trying to come up with such a model. Any thoughts?<br><br><a href=#c7750466850061118300 title="comment permalink">5/1/14, 6:39 PM</a><br><br>

Hay bales don't have internal organs. The initial tests in 1968 were with butted coat hanger wire mail (about 14 gage) draped over a log. The mail was mostly fine, though a few dozen of the butted links had spread. Subsequent tests were conducted with pig carcasses, with and without gambesons. Those with the padding fared better, but it was pretty easy for a man of normal strength to hit a clean blow with ax or mace that damaged the internal organs badly.

A good Viking broadsword in the hands of a competent swordsman can chop a human body in half. You might look into archeological sites from Viking-era battles; there are crushing wounds, but also plenty of amputations and lethal cuts. <br><br>Val, me and the entire body of medieval and Renaissance Western thought. Until the scientific revolution, most people in the West believed that along with the physical universe, the <i>corpus mundi</i> or body of the world, there was also the <i>spiritus mundi</i> or life-force of the world, and the <i>anima mundi</i> or consciousness of the world. That I know of, there's only been one civilization in all of history that's imagined the world as nothing more than a lump of dead matter, and you and I are living in it. <br><br>Jo, I beg to differ about one small point. We don't need a Christ, an Arthur or a Gandhi. We each, individually, need to find that spark of magnificence in ourselves, fan it into flame, and do what has to be done. Christ and Arthur and Gandhi, and every other archetypal figure you care to name, are already here, now, in each of us, whispering: you can rise up. Here, now, in the midst of this age of shadows and lies, you can rise up and become what you have the potential to be. <br><br>Ray, yes, it's already in the file. One of, ahem, 92 stories submitted for the contest. I've discussed with the publisher the possibility of doing more than one anthology, if enough of them are good -- and so far they look very good indeed -- and it's clear to me that something like a new genre of fiction is trying to be born. I'm not at all sure what to do to midwife that further, but I'll be thinking about it. <br><br>Btidwell, thank you!<br><br>Enrique, I'd say your best bet is to get to work! I'd encourage a close reading of Goethe's scientific writings, texts on systems theory, and a good book on ecosystems ecology for starters. <br><br>Nick, no problem. Comments here don't go through automatically; I screen 'em before they go up. Still, you're good to go. <br><br>Glenn, indeed it was -- did you by any chance know Baron Theodulf of Borogrove? I was a page of his for a while. Most of my sword work these days is 19th century military broadsword, for complex reasons -- among the simplest is that it converts instantly and intuitively to walking stick aka 3 foot long staff technique. <br><br>"Esther," I've been reading Blake, so reference to the Atlantic powers calls up imagery out of some of his early prophetic books!<br><br><a href=#c4011930426631126970 title="comment permalink">5/1/14, 10:34 PM</a><br><br>

So leaders were made by those who gave up worldly ambitions and returned to a place they saw as home they were willing to die for.<br><br>So a single story that contains DEATH is "We have a right to defend our home" and love of home, even for all its small minded people who don't want to understand the bigger picture, and will get sucked along into slavery without seeing and need benevolent stern leadership to direct them into defending their own self interest.<br><br>So the battle I see in the future is as the center powers fail, and chaos expands on the periphery, people are going to make a choice - to abandon history and home to safer lands, or stand up for local needs against powers that will still try to extract the remaining wealth from them.<br><br>I think of Wendell Berry's calling all civilization now as "colonial" - we'll all colonizing each other's distant lands for our short term profits, and we're paying for the soldiers and bombs that take from those who reject the irresistible force of economic debt and "progress" someday for those who work hard enough.<br><br>Anyway, so "death as a story" is dangerous one. I'm not a warrior, and I'd rather die than kill, or at least we all should know what stories we're willing to die for, and that's the starting point for relocalization perhaps?<br><br>Its hard to see, and right now DEBT and ADDICTION are the one two punch that suckers people into giving up their power.

The reason a Christ, a Buddha, an Arthur, a Gandhi pops up just when needed, is because, well, we need them. We respond to leadership. Our new story of salvation requires a story teller, someone who dreams dreams and sees visions. I love the image of that 'spark of magnificence' in each of us, but most of us require something or someone outside of ourselves to fan that into flame. That is the job of the dreaming visionary. Frankly, if we were all capable of realising our potential as human beings striving to be the best we could be.. well, we wouldn't be where we are. Most of us just wash the dishes, look after the kids, go to work. Most of us can't live with the awful responsibility of supplying our own 'god spark', or of really 'seeing' the world as it is. Frodo would have lived out his whole life at Bag End without a Gandalf..<br>Do you read Terry Pratchett? I love his 'children's' series featuring the young witch, Tiffany Aching. She discovers that it is the witch's job to see, really see what is happening in her community, and then do something about it. And that true seeing, is the essence of magic. Because as you have noted, most people don't truly 'see', instead they live according to the story in their head. And it takes someone willing to break out of the social herd, stand alone, be the outcast, be the witch (maybe the Archdruid..) to see the need for change. And then have to construct a new story and frame it in mythical terms, because that's what the people need. Stark reality is too hard to bear, and we need a story to make it palatable. The Israelites were much more comfortable worshipping a golden calf than communing with an actual real, live God up on top of the mountain, EVEN THOUGH they knew they had actually invented the calf themselves. We need a story THAT MUCH to protect us from reality. And for that, we need a storytller. Someone to follow.<br>In general of course. Me, I am hoping to find that magnificent spark.

I prefer to go with Occam’s Razor which states that among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. People were trying to save fuel 35 years ago because they were living during a time of high fuel prices, and when prices fell they stopped. Also, in order to be accurate you also need to broaden the villain in your narrative to include the people of all the industrialized countries, because they all made the same choice. None of those countries continued to reduce energy use once prices fell in the 1980’s and 1990’s. They all did what the US did, and some increased their energy use more than the US. No collective choice in favor of sustainability was made anywhere on this planet.<br><br><a href=#c2608458480554352754 title="comment permalink">5/2/14, 1:44 AM</a><br><br>

Everyone has to start somewhere I guess. Still with a broad sword or staff at my throat, minor troubles such as these vanish into thin air!<br><br>On a serious note, I've actually had someone - who I unintentionally annoyed - hold a knife to my throat from behind in a menacing way whilst at the same time describing my actions in unflattering terms. It did much to make me reconsider my youthful loutish ways and it was equally disturbing how easily I was taken - back then.<br><br>Your answer was very amusing too. Go not to the elves for advice... I cannot in all honesty say that you did not directly answer my question either, Mr Elf Lord. hehe! It was both tidy work and amusing at the same time.<br><br>On another serious note, the Aboriginals here used to incorporate the belief into their lives that if the proper rituals were not performed at the right time, then they and their souls were at risk of disaster. Since learning this belief, I can see that it is one correct response to this environment and have been throwing the ideas back and forward in my head ever since. <br><br>I'm not very good at representational tales and can see that at some point in the future, my knowledge of this particular environment will have to be handed over to a gifted - or otherwise - storyteller.<br><br>As to weapons, well, I could get a gun as I'm licensed to own one (no easy thing Down Under), but I reckon it will be something that will only be a vector to escalation of violence here. My knowledge and experience here is the weapon which I hope to utilise to my advantage. If that is not obviously respected then weapons will be of little use in any case as they will eventually break or become unusable. Plus it is impossible to be vigilant 24/7. Of course a handy staff and knife may just help as well to get your point across in a difficult situation. It would be far smarter though to have others do the dirty work... They'll come eventually – like Bogong moths to a light - of this I have no doubt.<br><br>Typical, you have already written a book about such swordsmanship matters...

I’m not sure I’ll be able to make it to London, but if I can, I’d like to say hello. <br><br>About legends: I find that the same legends can be reinterpreted anew in each age according to the needs of the audience. Readers who have complained about the lack of female protagonists in ancient legends, for example, might do well to rewrite them with genders switched. <br><br>When I teach my daughter Bible stories, I describe them in terms of what early humans did to their world; felling the forests and mismanaging the land until the Fertile Crescent was no longer fertile. I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that they then told stories of how their forebears disobeyed their holy instructions on how to keep the garden, ignored their limits, and were cast into a wasteland. I find it more useful than, say, modern people reading the Bible as a Nostradamus–like code and seeing messages of a “Rapture.” <br><br>More generally, I wanted to put a question out to the entire readership, if I may.

The saints in the stories aren't all Jesus or King Arthur, they didn't singlehandedly change the world, or fight in wars, or build kingdoms. They performed a few minor miracles and changed a few minds, but that's not what made the hagiography the staple of early medieval literature. <br><br>These were stories of completely ordinary people who gave up everything for their beliefs and faced death, suffering, and loss with peace and dignity. The sagas, epics, and romances came later. The first stories people began to cling to as Rome fell around them were stories not about saving the old world, building a new one, or even surviving the fall. They were gory, grim, difficult to read tales about people living a life of integrity and simplicity, and then suffering unimaginable horrors and death without falling into despair or losing faith. These are almost the only bits of myth and literature surviving from the time between the fall of Rome and the rise of medieval Europe and these were the stories that gave those people hope to live through every day. That's because in a world where frequent gruesome death was a fact of life, stories about dying with peace and joy in place of fear and doubt were something to aspire to.<br><br>We might be too late for twilight stories like Virgil's Aeneid (a tale of a hero fleeing a dying civilization), and we might be too early for Arthur, but we can begin learning to live with integrity and face the reality of death with peace in the here and now.

Here in the valley it got really cold last winter, (down to about zero Fahrenheit), that it actually damaged my little potted Christmas tree. I'm cheap, cheaper in the long run when it comes to putting in a system that will help the plantings get through tough weather. With the weird weather going around a pit green house would be a really good idea for more cold sensitive shrubs and trees. I was thinking of a cool tube buried about six feet down and the proper length (40 feet long) with a chimney/air intake up out of the ground (which might have good secondary use as a fence post to anchor to), that tube would keep the green house about fifty plus degrees on cold nights for shrubs/trees like oranges, lemons, limes or avocados. Plant some strawberries in tanks with the shrubs for a nice ground cover and out of season fruit. (Or almost any herbs you could use fresh, year round.) You could rig a small geodesic dome over the green house which could be opened a lot to pollinate the plantings or a little for convection on cold nights or very hot days. The domes would also be handy for keeping precious water from evaporating and being lost to the fruit. Just a thought anyway.<br><br>BTW, have you looked into earth bag building? Check with your neighbors for their plastic feed sacks. It's like the modern form of adobe or rammed earth. The walls do have to be plastered to protect the integrity of the walls.<br><br><br>In regard to future warfare:<br>I was interested in but did not join the SCA and have a current interest in mounted archery. I have a little red cutter type horse that would make a good skirmish mount, since the little booger bites! (He's 'proud', or 'a ridgeling?') But because he's been permanently crippled I intend to use the little mustang mare as my archery mount. Smooth gaits make a good platform to fight from. I also like sabers and keep looking for something that would be useful and fit artistically. I've seen a few I'd like to have and I've been dying to get into making a chain mail shirt and leggings, not to mention some matching horse tack. I really do like working with my hands, livestock and gardening. If I wasn't getting so durned old I would be going near gleefully into the descent.<br><br><br>Wadulisi<br><br><a href=#c5504240393766101702 title="comment permalink">5/2/14, 2:57 PM</a><br><br>

This was as true for samurais as it was for knights. The obvious objection in favor of the common folk could simply be resolved by noting that even the commoners had their own such conventions, involving quarterstaffs (Little John and Robin Hood settled their dispute in this manner), fisticuffs, or other such contests of strength or manhood. Even in the Wild West, there were dueling conventions, dramatized or over done in movies, but present to a large degree, which is why Europeans were fascinated (part of the reason anyway) by the ethos of the street shoot out. Of course, one doesn't observe such niceties towards those who operate outside of any such convention, but they are actually something of a luxury, once a given set of norms prevails over a wide area, and actually prevented a lot of bloodshed within those parameters. The Truce of God, for instance, was not so much a condoning of violence as an attempt to channel and limit it. War conventions also fall inside this category. I'm wondering if in addition to shooting firearms, some form of martial art training involving a noblesse oblige code is appropriate to the rising generation?<br><br><a href=#c4864569791580388615 title="comment permalink">5/2/14, 8:21 PM</a><br><br>

There is more every year. Remeber that plenty of food is produced right through the winter here due to the warmer climate than some of you may experience.<br><br>Plus I added a little bit of a footage to show how little 3.8kW of photovoltaic panels actually produce when it is late afternoon (about 4pm from memory) and cloudy. The answer is not much at all. At lunchtime on that day, the system was producing about 20A which equates to about 520W. Not much huh?<br><br>The footage is from last Wednesday, so you can see how the place has greened up from the summer dearth. I'm actually in a bit of a growth phase at the moment and the deciduous trees which haven't gone dormant are busily storing away energy for the short winter.<br><br>Interestingly too, and I forgot to show this, some of the rhododendrons are a bit confused by the weather and producing flowers. Weird, huh?<br><br>Hope you all enjoy it and there are no naughty spoken words at all in it.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c7134651174879425282 title="comment permalink">5/2/14, 9:54 PM</a><br><br>

In this case, he assumes that we all collectively looked at the situation in 1980 and chose to embrace Reagan and denial and selfishness and short-term convenience, rather than beginning the transition to green energy and economics that was suggested, and discarded, at the time.<br><br>Which ignores the reality that most people had imperfect knowledge—they tended to trust what they saw on TV, as now, and there were PR efforts then to discredit the idea of energy shortages and environmental threats. Some people DO have much more power and much more influence than others—more influence on public opinion as well as on what laws Congress passes. What about Bush Sr.’s shenanigans trading weapons to Iran to keep the hostages until after the election? (I understand they were released, to the minute, when Reagan was inaugurated, which I read as the Iranians’ tacit statement of contempt for the forces they had bargained with.) Most people still have no idea that happened.<br><br>Lots of people want to blame the elite for everything, as though the public was either entirely powerless or were trying to do the right thing and failing. That’s just as wrong, because most people DID have some awareness of these realities, and did choose Reagan’s way because it was easier, more popular, more convenient, paid better. But JMG doesn’t acknowledge that what the average person knew and understood at the time (or even now!) is not we he knew or knows. I wonder why he’s so allergic to acknowledging power imbalances.<br><br><a href=#c571399822359614940 title="comment permalink">5/3/14, 5:07 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not saying we need an actual Jesus or Arthur or Gandhi to save us, but we need the stories they gave us to light our way. The myth of progress and the myth of apocalypse are not serving us well. Christianity has been reshaped to fit both those myths, as the archdruid has pointed out, but maybe needs to be reshaped again. My money is on the new pope - he is from Argentina, which has endured significant societal collapse over the last few decades. He is a powerful figure who is refusing the trappings of power, he knows poverty, is committed to reshaping the Church. Maybe his story of the Franciscan appeal of simplicity and addressing systemic inequalities in society will strike a chord and provide a new vision. People in the developed world are very afraid of having their privileged lives taken from them. Maybe the story of quixotic Franciscan charity will make giving up privilege and embracing simplicity appealing? <br>But maybe it's also a generational thing. Gen Y doesn't seem to be particularly concerned about amassing stuff. The hipsters are closer to their hippy grannies than any other generation. They value simple and authentic, and experience over things. They do DIY with stuff from dumpsters, they knit, shop at farmers' markets, build urban vegie gardens and keep chickens. Oh, and make home brew and ride old bikes and shop at car boot sales. Maybe they are creating a new world order that values simplicity and connectedness over things and power. Maybe that's why the pope is such a hit with young people and is starting to annoy those in power?<br><br><a href=#c7354220596986276834 title="comment permalink">5/3/14, 5:51 AM</a><br><br>

If the Old West had lasted for a few more centuries, it would have seen something along the same lines. <br><br>Ares, hmm. Traveling to distant lands is usually a last resort, and for good reason -- there are potential tyrants everywhere, and at home at least you know the score. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Jo, if you need a hero, become one. If you need a story, create one. If you wait for someone else to do either of these things, well, so is everyone else...<br><br>Zosima, I'm curious -- were you around and paying attention in the late 70s and early 80s? Because I was, and I heard a lot of enthusiastic talk -- and saw some action -- in the direction of sustainability; and I also saw how that dropped out of fashion like a hot rock. <br><br>Compound F, if the cone is wider, that implies that the "smackdown" you're waiting for could also be much, much further away -- widen a probability cone, remember, and it widens all around. As I've pointed out repeatedly, fast-crash scenarios only work if the holders of power sit on their hands and do nothing, which is exactly what they don't do in a crisis situation. Mind you, if you want to say that we're on the brink of serious crisis, I won't argue at all -- I've been saying the same thing -- but it takes more than one economic crisis to take out a civilization. More on this, too, as we proceed. <br><br>Cherokee, it was a long time ago, when I was a snotnosed teenager with a bad case of fantasy-fiction addiction and few social skills. <br><br>Brian, if you can, that'd be welcome! <br><br>YJV, thank you. Hmm! Now I'm also wondering about those magical iron bolts that killed warriors by the tens of thousands. Clearly I need to do more reading...<br><br>Stephen, that's about what I understood; thanks for the confirmation. <br><br>Dylan, yes, I got it -- you're in the competition. <br><br>Iuval, the entire issue of ethics needs to be overhauled from top to bottom, as the approach that's been standard for many centuries now -- come up with a scheme for how human beings ought to behave in a perfect world, demand that people live that way in the real world, and try not to notice the resulting disasters -- is well past its pull date. I'll probably have to discuss that down the road, but it's going to take something close to a book-length series of posts to do it.<br><br><a href=#c1455748569542893499 title="comment permalink">5/3/14, 9:35 AM</a><br><br>

Did any of the people who were calling for new ways to live show any signs of walking their talk? <br><br>Matthew, it's risky to generalize too simplistically from the European experience; in Hindu epics and the early medieval Japanese period alike, the bow was the most honored weapon of the warrior, and the Old West saw the emergence of a code of chivalry centered on the gun -- though of course it was honored in the breach as often as most codes of chivalry. That said, of course the rising generation should learn martial arts, and a code of honor would also be worthwhile; it's going to be a rough half millennium or so. <br><br>Cherokee, thanks for the video!<br><br>Ares, the request was specifically for stories of the future, and you're two full days past deadline, so I have to say I'll pass. <br><br>DaShui, yes, I saw that -- when it's not feasible to use air strikes, artillery bombardment, and other methods of mass killing, some very old tactics make just as much sense as they once did. <br><br>Onething, again, I was there at the time and remember the conversations. As I've pointed out before, power imbalances do not equal elite omnipotence; I'd encourage your sister to reflect on why it was that the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act, and so many other pieces of green legislation got pushed through in the teeth of fierce corporate resistance in the 1970s, and why the grassroots support that drove those into law went away in the 1980s. <br><br>Miltonics, thank you. <br><br>Marcello, you're right about Japan, too.

For half of that hike the backpack, this laptop, and the assortment of flutes (they're wood, so are at least not heavy) are joined by, today, ah, ~1.5kg of assorted potatoes, some rhubarb, a Japanese greens bundle I forget the name of, four bundles of turnips and radishes (with greens), five bundles of kale or collards, a kilo of Whatcom country wheat berries, and 12 eggs.

The black powder rifle I bought for my dad years ago uses a ramrod in loading, it's cumbersome and requires a steady platform to pour the powder into the gun, it's time consuming. Pulling a bow is simple, draw an arrow set it to string and it requires negligible effort in balance on a horse while pulling the bow. <br><br>I think guns will be used a lot initially but after a while in the descent the effort to create and maintain the technology for firearms will become too much to sustain. Of course that's just my opinion and my inclination in waging war is to be more 'sneaky' in my efforts. You'd be crazy to expose yourself like the lobsterbacks and stand still long enough for them to use you as a target, even Francis Marion didn't turn his back on my people.

I was in Florida, and you lived in the Pacific coast states where environmental consciousness was no doubt greater. This is still true today. In all honesty I never heard a single friend or acquaintance say they that they were living their lives in order to be more sustainable. I never heard the word uttered, not once. There was a left-wing coop bookstore that had books like the Whole Earth Catalog, and on the campus where I went to school there were environmentally minded groups, and one geography professor did mention Limits to Growth. But most of my roommates were business majors, quite a few were still driving big cars even though gas prices were high. Of course, people had been exposed to environmental issues since the late 1960’s in both the news and popular culture. There was smog, and oil spills, and endangered species, and exposure to ideas like overpopulation and habitat destruction in films like Soylent Green and Silent Running. But none of that caused anyone to change their lifestyle. When oil became expensive in the 70’s and there were shortages, people blamed either the Arabs, the oil companies or governmental incompetence. Some people were insulating their homes and buying smaller cars, but it was to save money - not the planet. Yes, I knew there were hippies living on communes trying to live a different lifestyle, but if you asked the students on my campus whether they wanted to live that lifestyle or the lifestyle of their favorite rock band - well, I think you can guess the answer- and you would get the same answer on any campus today. There was no fateful choice being made at that time that set us on some path that could not be changed, it was people doing what they had always been doing - trying to survive in an industrial society. As for what the 1980 election was about, we could get into that if you want. But I've gone on too long.<br><br><a href=#c7267719000245343281 title="comment permalink">5/3/14, 2:24 PM</a><br><br>

My earliest memories were of my family conserving gas by avoiding extra trips and not taking road trips. Adults were talking as if the age of cheap gas was over. Subcompacts were the rage. My uncle, who is now a raging tea party supporter, sported a pro-55 speed limit bumper sticker on his truck (a misguided policy, but still) Energy conservation was on the lips of everyone, state and federal lawmakers as well as the average Joe. Dependence on foreign oil was deemed foolish, conservation was seen as patriotic and stabilizing after the embargo. Our family made all kinds of things ourselves as inflation reared its ugly head, as did other families in our community. We may have called it" conservation" instead of" sustainability", but the idea was the same. And these attitudes persisted through my early grade school years, albeit with less and less enthusiasm, until gas prices bottomed out in the late 80s, as Reagan's policies started to take effect. I recall enough of this to validate it, even though I was very young at the time.

The situation in certain sections of Mexico (drug lords)? What happens with the Swiss setup, where everyone is trained to use long distance arms? The Japanese handling of firearms? <br><br>There was a book recently read on guerrilla warfare (Max Boot, Invisible Armies) through the ages, and I recall one of the precepts is that you have outside help/safe havens/good local knowledge, and good leadership. Perhaps this alone nullifies the shooting back situation, at least by individuals. What are the markers for successful resistance, and where will they exist (if at all) in the world, in the future(s) you posit? <br><br>Again, look forward to your analysis.

Sometime, when you're up for it maybe you could expand more thoroughly on it. While I certainly hope my descendants know enough to wash their hands before attending a birth, for example, the scientific method is a great deal more complicated topic. Indeed, the very necrotic industrial world we live in today was breathed into existence in the same breath as the scientific method. Besides the obvious chestnut of scientific progress being used for evil and power mongering a la The Bomb and whatnot, the scientific method has huge problems that mostly manifest when it is used in isolation from a holistic evaluation of the systems it attempts to describe. A great example is the Green Revolution which did, in fact, feed millions, but which has left us with even greater problems now that the world's farmlands are depleted and barren. Antibiotic use is a similar example where the scientific method led us down roads that good honest caring people thought would change the world for the better, but actually made things harder in the long run. <br><br>How do we pass on what's great about something like the scientific method while avoiding handing down the hubris and narrow sightedness that has seemed to accompany it all along? I mean, aren't we precisely in the mess we're in because of the inherent nature of the philosophy that gave rise to the industrial age via that very scientific method you'd hand down to our descendants?<br><br>On the other topic which I can't shake, how entangled we, even the most dedicated to sustainability, are to industrial products - I think about how important the little things are to our farm - like Tek screws, without which all ourr hoop houses and chicken tractors would just blow away - and I can't help but feel like industrialism is so tightly woven into the fabric of our lives that no matter how much we'd like to disentangle ourselves, we could never get there and still maintain any semblance of humanity. I truly hope that the descent is long enough for us to relearn how to make or do every last thing in our lives - from the pencil you draft your missives with to the shoelaces on your feet to the salt on your locally sourced venison chile. I hope the optimism your posts are laced with is justified, in the end.<br><br><a href=#c5093235290123383524 title="comment permalink">5/3/14, 10:27 PM</a><br><br>

Missing flight MH 370 is a case in point... Now I understand it was was carrying a hazardous cargo of lithium batteries; such as had been in the news just prior for causing inconvenient fires in Tesla's, and in the flight deck of the Boeing 787 “Dreamliner”. It seems de rigeur these days for every new technological trinket to have a lithium battery. For MH370, I suppose we'll never find out if they caught fire, emitting deadly fumes, prompting the pilot to ascend as high as possible to put the fire out during the 12 minute span of reserve oxygen...<br><br>And what is it with these cowardly sea captains? When the Costa Concordia ran aground, I just figured the captain was a fluke. But now that Korean ferry captain sitting on his hands, then abandoning ship himself to leave hundreds of kids to drown? Even the much-maligned Captain Smith of Titanic infamy had the courage and decency to go down with the passengers he couldn't save. He was not unique. Anyway, my old habit of labeling people who do despicable things as simply being morally inferior (to me) so I could smugly despise them all-of-a-sudden felt unhelpful, but what was surprising was that I realized that I had that habit! Ouch!<br><br>What to do instead? Hmm....Why not step back and create an impersonal narrative that comports with the the facts, and see if the narrative is better than bashing? How are things different for sea captains nowadays versus Captain Smith's day, and how might that account for our recent sad examples? Hmmm... Maybe technology? I'll see where this goes.<br><br>How might GPS, say, affect sea captains? Well navigation and piloting sure got easier. Before GPS, you relied on coastal piloting skills, dead reckoning, celestial navigation. You needed a lead-line, compass, sextant, celestial tables, chronometer, charts and chart instruments, log (the one you drop in the water, not write in), etc... Navigation was a real skill, and nobody had to belabor the consequences of navigational error; but in the back of your mind, there is always “what would I do if...”. An appreciation of risk is inherent in the activity. For our contemporary captains, all that navigation bother is redundant. GPS is always right (right?). It is a black box that deskills the people who had performed those functions, reducing them to little better than bedazzled users. How might this relate to courage? Well, all this technology gives the illusion that operating a ship is as safe and predictable as operating a Disneyland ride, so you are not attuned to dangers, and so not subconsciously mulling “what would I do if...”. I'd also posit that a a loss of dignity attends the loss of skills. And does not a sense of responsibility arise when one exercises a critical skill under the shadow of danger? No skills, no concern for danger, and no dignity may lead to no sense of responsibility and no courage. So what happens when the unexpected arises on a ship? Our anti-exemplary captains were caught like the proverbial deer in headlights. There but for the grace of God...<br><br>News is out how memory chips from the I-phones recovered from those drowned Korean kids have been uploaded and the videos distributed in the Korean media. The recovered images show the kids videoing each others' last moments on the sinking ship, some saying goodbye. I have 2 kids and tried to imagine myself in those parents' place, wondering if those images might have offered some consolation. But my mind just would not go there, and some other image presented itself: Some demon, the Technology Fairy perhaps, appeared and turned around, turned ugly, and spat.<br><br><a href=#c8514482985364408261 title="comment permalink">5/4/14, 2:40 AM</a><br><br>

My wife and I have neither been out blazing trails for decline-adapted living, nor perched with no practical skills on a pile of illusory wealth ripe for a fall. We're not in debt, and we're long accustomed to frugal living in working-class communities. Years ago, before I'd even heard of peak oil, we were talking about becoming "neighborhood handy-helpers" as an avocation after retirement. Partly this idea came from my wife noticing, while working at a home supply store, how helpless many younger people have become at the simplest manual tasks like hanging a shelf on a wall; and partly it came from both of us having actually become de facto neighborhood handy-helpers by happenstance a decade ago, when we lived in a small community and <i>were</i> in debt, living on almost zero net income. We hooked up neighbors' electronic gadgets, patched their drywall, wrote their business letters, and the like, for vegetables from their gardens and first dibs on their fallen branches for our stove.<br><br>It's a little alarming, though admittedly ego-stroking, how impressed my wife's current retail co-workers -- generally sensible hard-working people -- seem to be, every time she shows up wearing nice clothing she made herself, or a hairstyle I did for her, or even a decent home-cooked meal for her dinner break. They, at least, seem to already think we're some kind of -- what's that word, starts with w -- oh yeah, weirdos!<br><br>The other critical aspect of our circumstances is that I have a developmentally disabled twin brother. His needs put a very firm floor on how far I can collapse voluntarily in advance of absolute necessity. For example, I lived without a car through the 1980s and 1990s while he still lived with our parents, but I'd be betraying what I regard as family obligations to voluntarily deprive him of the transportation I provide him now. (Plans are in place for all contingencies though.) His role in my life has influenced my outlook on pretty much everything, ever since the illusion-shattering realization, in my early teens, that despite being a hundred IQ points apart we were essentially alike. A topic for another time, perhaps.<br><br>Phew. Thoughts for the next round of conversation, gathered.

There seemed to be lots of conservation/preservation/environmentally minded folk among the intellectuals in our community. It was not at all unusual to find people who eschewed t.v., air conditioning, and other technology, and worried about its effects. Parents who restricted or sharply limited the children's consumption of pop culture were common. There were hippie types that lived "out in the county" who voluntarily lived very simple lives without running water, not to mention t.v. The high school valedictorian my 1st or 2nd grade year came from one such family. They were never a majority, of course, but they were there. I don't know what became of it all in the intervening 30 years. And this was in a rural, semi-suburban county in KY that was 80% southern Baptist, 90% evangelical, and 99.9% Christian, tobacco was the lifeblood of the community, and smoking was ubiquitous. Not liberal by any stretch of the imagination. <br>I also wanted to share my efforts to make a difference. I've been discovering what's going on locally regarding what we would call Green Wizardry, and there are promising leads regarding local food. Not sure how peak oil aware they are, but as someone had mentioned regarding Mormons, sharing the same beliefs is not as important when it comes to taking the same actions. I'm relatively poor by American standards, without land-a non homeowner, who lives with clueless family, so my focus is on similarly situated people. One focus related to that is finding a local community garden project, as well as learning a craft. (One doesn't need to be a home/landowner to do that) I've found a few permaculture homesteaders here that I've reached out to. Also, the largest restored shaker village, Pleasant Hill is nearby, and possibly a resource similar to Yankee sturbridge in pre industrial methods that I'm going to contact. On the political front, there are local signs of the fracking bust, since the bluegrass pipeline, which was to carry natural gas liquids from the Marcellus shale through KY, has been abandoned due to lack of demand. Activists are claiming their protests stopped it, but if the demand was there I'm sure the activists would've been run over. Signs of more from fracking bust to come? Interesting that at a green festival someone told me that completion of the keystone pipeline means the end of life/humanity as we know it due to global warming-I just bit my tongue. :)<br><br><a href=#c1268656214604286378 title="comment permalink">5/4/14, 11:14 AM</a><br><br>

I specifically remember the cover of an issue if IEEE spectrum (an electrical engineering trade mag) about a clever design to produce electricity from wind, solar and trash burning from a single multimodal device: There would a tall stack with slotted doors that would pick up wind and create a vortex in the tower; these base of the tower was a donout shaped container of rock encased in a=n insulated black housing to absorb and store solar hear heat, while the inner core was anincerator that burn trash to heat a boiler, while the exhaust drove a light turbine at the base of the vortex tower, synergizing with the wind vortex....

The black powder rifle I bought for my dad years ago uses a ramrod in loading, it's cumbersome and requires a steady platform to pour the powder into the gun, it's time consuming. Pulling a bow is simple, draw an arrow set it to string and it requires negligible effort in balance on a horse while pulling the bow.<br><br>I think guns will be used a lot initially but after a while in the descent the effort to create and maintain the technology for firearms will become too much to sustain. Of course that's just my opinion and my inclination in waging war is to be more 'sneaky' in my efforts. You'd be crazy to expose yourself like the lobsterbacks and stand still long enough for them to use you as a target, even Francis Marion didn't turn his back on my people"<br><br>Before Miniè and similar bullets were introduced rifles were used for hunting and select skirmisher units, the greater accuracy being more important than rate of fire. The vast majority of troops were issued smoothbore muskets loaded with paper cartridges, more handy than patched balls and loose poweder. Of course the odd ambush here and there was useful but at the end of the day you aren't going to stop signficant bodies of troops from marching where they please that way. And if you have to give battle slow firing unsupported skirmishers are going to be cut down by cavalry or to run away in the face of silly looking enemy lines pushing forward with not so silly looking rows of bayonets. <br><br>Early black powder small arms vs bows is a complex question. It is quite possible that if you can afford the training and the enemy is not awash in plate armor some bows types would be pretty competitive. But musket wielding troops can be trained quickly and manufacturing can be accomplished by a blacksmith with limited tooling (and bows seem simpler, but making them is non trivial).<br><br><br><br><a href=#c8289832755517436622 title="comment permalink">5/4/14, 2:48 PM</a><br><br>

I was angry that Mir wasn't pushed into a permanently stable orbit as an artifact for future generations. I felt more than a pang when the space shuttles were left to wear out without any replacement. I'm sad that the possibility of human space travel is closing down, perhaps forever.<br><br>I have two things to say about that, one short, one long.<br><br>The short thing is that if by habit or necessity, we spend most of our time in man made or man modified environments, most of us forget how large and amazing This Rock is. Once in awhile, I tear myself away from my comfy apartment, my books and devices, my domesticated town, and go sit on a bluff above the shore and watch the waves crashing against the rocks, the sea birds, the clouds. And I think, “Wow, this has been in progress all the time I wasn’t thinking about it. Most of the planet is like this; it is barely affected by people at all.”<br><br><br><a href=#c3770930053559740413 title="comment permalink">5/4/14, 6:36 PM</a><br><br>

In real life, manned space flight is our civilization’s final form of extreme exploration, a logical and chronological successor to the polar expeditions. Manned space travel had two origins, 1) military programs and 2) the desire of elite white men to find somewhere even more difficult and dangerous to go than the source of the Nile, Mt. Everest or Antarctica while justifying the trip as scientific research. <br><br>Visiting space or living there for a while is not a precursor to asteroid mining, terraforming Mars or spreading our genes all over the Local Group. It was always going to be the pursuit of a select handful of people with a following of interested onlookers, not a way of life for entire civilizations. <br><br>The American moon landings turned out to be like Leif Erikson's trips to Vinland. Good enough technology to visit and return more than once. Not enough resources in the home society to support a permanent settlement in a hostile environment. If the rate of economic and technological development that the human race achieved in the nineteenth century could have been carried on without mass extinctions, by 2100 we would have towns on the Moon and a couple of Mars expeditions. Throw enough money and energy at the obstacles, onward and upward. <br><br><br><a href=#c4741408593355679017 title="comment permalink">5/4/14, 6:38 PM</a><br><br>

Twelve people have walked on the surface of the satellite that flies around and around This Rock at a greater distance, came back and lived to tell the tale. Every other human being who ever lived knew nothing about this or participated in it vicariously. No person, including all the cosmonauts and astronauts, has ever gotten away from This Rock. But many human beings have seen the stars, and tens of thousands have seen another planet through a telescope.<br><br>Mammalian bodies can’t physically go a lot of places that we are curious about. We can’t, for example, go swimming in scuba gear in the Marianas Trench. We immerse ourselves in that environment in a deep sea sub, and look out at our surroundings through a thick window, a TV screen, or instrument readouts. Same thing if we want to explore Jupiter or the Sun. No matter how close we get, we never are there; we observe “there” with devices while we are completely surrounded by an artificial protective environment. <br><br>We want to explore other places and we want to interact with them, because that is how we explore. Some places on Earth and almost every place not on Earth is too deadly to us to walk around in bareheaded, and the amount of modification we would have to do to make it not deadly would erase the differences that made it interesting in the first place. If we need protection from the places we want to explore, and we need instruments to pass sensory data through the barrier of the thick rubber gloves, the pressurized suit, the lead shield or the entire flipping spaceship, what difference does it make whether the protective environment is a human construct or the Earth’s atmosphere or a radio transmission from a robotic probe in deep space? We’ll have the capacity to launch and monitor probes a while longer, and a future ecotechnic society may figure out another way to do that.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c4737412629568249348 title="comment permalink">5/4/14, 6:43 PM</a><br><br>

But that was only half the story; big guns like that needed large resources behind them, so they were only useful for kings and the like to subdue enemies who had enough resources of their own to put up fortifications that could resist anything short of big guns. So lesser things good enough to hold off bandit raids etc. would remain realistic (it's not a coincidence that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid found themselves in a killing ground at the end of that film; that was precisely why towns like that were built that way).<br><br><a href=#c372978714176296106 title="comment permalink">5/5/14, 3:36 AM</a><br><br>

Forgot to mention before that the knife incident came after me pulling a burn-out in someone’s driveway. Ahh, to be young and dumb, which is pretty much exactly what you get, without adult influences tempering the very worst of your personality! Actually the old days were akin to a bag of possum vomit. hehe!<br><br>No need to reply. Have fun.

I hope that your growing season is good.<br><br>Hi Adrian,<br><br>I'm not sure I know the answer in relation to the red and black currants? They were planted directly into very deep composted woody mulch, if that is of any relevance? They require virtually no water during summer and maintain healthy foliage, but fruit early in the season so that may be it too? I just don’t know.<br><br>Hi thrig,<br><br>You are moving closer to the chickens themselves in your journey. Many free range producers also wash their eggs as they have to store them for supply during the lean period. I don’t believe the turning is as crucial as the not washing. The eggs here last a few months stored in the cupboard. This may be a good article or guest post? Well done with the rhubarb too. I add the stalks as a bulk filler (and source of pectin) for all jams here. There are about 30 plants here and the stalks are added as a 1:1 ratio fruit to rhubarb. PS: It might be worth mentioning although you probably already know - don't eat the leaves as they are toxic. Mind you, I had a jack russell dog once years ago that ate an entire rhubarb plant and nothing happened except that he looked pretty pleased with himself...<br><br>Hi Cathy,<br><br>Wow, that is a big change in temperature. Animals go under a lot of stress and can even die here when it is a downwards drop of that sort of range. Hope your bees haven't been pesky and have settled into their new home? An idea popped into my head this morning and I'm thinking of building and then offering a top hive box as a contra swap for a bee colony. If the boxes are easy enough to make, I might even try selling a few over the Internet? I've read 2 of 3 books about them now.

His needs put a very firm floor on how far I can collapse voluntarily in advance of absolute necessity.

I have three brothers with developmental disabilities and one also has a pretty severe mental illness (the other two have some minor mental health issues).

None live with me at the moment but I'm sure at least one will be back. At any rate we now have this very large house with high energy costs in an area which homes like this aren't selling well. We really like where we live as we've built up soil for gardens and are set up for our livestock - quite a dilemma. I still have tons of driving to do for them. My 88 year old MIL lives with us now (more driving as we are six miles from town). I imagine other family members will move in as the need arises.

There is one big negative: health care access is more limited. But there is also a huge positive. Live just generally seems easier and safer for the disabled here. Extended families make a big difference, but also there is the fact that it is a small enough town that everyone knows you if you are different. The moderately-functioning adults who frequent the town are known by everyone. If one of them gets in a bad situation, everyone knows who to call and where they live. <br><br>In the coming decades, as access to health care gets worse for everyone, not just in the small towns, small-town living might really become the best option for adults with disabilities and the elderly with cognitive issues.<br><br><a href=#c206742367084488745 title="comment permalink">5/5/14, 9:03 AM</a><br><br>

The first oil crisis hit in 1973 when I was in high school in suburban Philadelphia. The second, in 1979, happened after my college graduation and as I left for grad school in Illinois. I was living in a middle class household of moderate Republicans back when such folks still existed, but I was still aware of the need for conservation because of it being part of what was talked about and acted on at the time. It influenced me enough to practice conservation when I lived on my own in grad school and beyond. Even in my yuppieish years I drove a VW Rabbit because it was the most fuel-conserving, non US made car I could buy off the lot in 1984 when I started paid employment. Detroit's compact cars could not stand up to the Japanese competition, which became abundantly clear in the wake of the oil crises. Think the US carmakers got the message? They did: they got Congress to embargo Japanese cars in 1984. It took weeks to get one. If it hadn't I'd have bought an even more fuel-efficient Japanese car. <br><br>I'm not sure Reagan would have been elected in 1980 if it hadn't been for two things: the botched rescue attempt of the US hostages Iran was holding, which did considerable damage to Carter's already-shaky image not long before the election, and the third-party candidate on the ballot, John Anderson, who I think took more votes from Carter than from Reagan. I admit mine was one of them. Still, younger people tended to prefer Carter or Anderson but a smaller percentage of them voted than did the older generations which helped to give the election to Reagan. It should be remembered too that Reagan was former governor of California, the most populous state in the US. Presidential candidates almost always win their home state and its electoral votes, a big help to Reagan. <br><br>Even in the early 1980s conservation continued to be discussed and practiced, albeit among a minority, but one which got some media attention. I think it was the 1984 election, the one featuring Reagan's Morning in America slogan, that finally doomed conservation. That seemed to be when people got tired of the struggle to conserve and be frugal, when they signaled by their votes that they were ready to party on with Reagan. (No, I wasn't one of them. I wouldn't have voted for Reagan for dog-catcher, much less president. And I continued to conserve, albeit less than I do now.) <br><br>I think JMG's characterization of making a choice in the 1980s to consume rather than conserve is fair. A good-sized percentage of the people who made that choice are dead now, while those of us who are still here are dealing with the effects, just as our choices now will affect those who live after us.<br><br><a href=#c2480661792547002077 title="comment permalink">5/5/14, 10:39 AM</a><br><br>

Not only could I mow with a scythe; I enjoyed it. *Really* enjoyed it. Enough to spend 2 1/2 hours on it that day and another hour or so the next.

This suggests to me that part of what JMG means when he says we need to get off our rears and *do* something is that we need to act to buy our souls back from Mephistopheles, to become human again.<br><br><a href=#c6739498406525190429 title="comment permalink">5/5/14, 11:03 AM</a><br><br>

However, the approach you are suggesting here is one of voluntary adoption of certain ethical principles (which has good historical precedent, e.g. the Amish and other religious orders/communities). The main ethical principle seems to be eschewing of a high consumption of petroleum and production of certain basic goods and services with a larger percentage of human and animal faculties. You are also using thaumaturgy to motivate people for such choices (e.g. if you don't you will be sorry later, or you are going to cause more pain than necessary to your descendants). My only argument here is that you are not getting at the root of the problem, which is not petroleum consumption, but the lust for power over people and nature, which can exist and has existed before petroleum consumption and which will lead to eschewing of high petroleum consumption, whereas eschewing high petroleum consumption does not lead to eschewing of power over through other means.<br><br>Why not try to motivate people to eschew power over, and help them see that usually (but not always) such passive income practices as extracting rent and interest from mere ownership are examples of such power over, despite the rationalizations used to justify such practices? Or do you believe that there is nothing to be done about these innate human tendencies? Aren't many myths attempting to influence people in just the way I propose?<br><br>Perhaps using thaumaturgy is by definition inconsistent with the ethical goal of eschewing power over people? In trying to change people's minds are we just influencing/teaching them, or attempting to have power over them?<br><br><a href=#c2045700215439290170 title="comment permalink">5/5/14, 1:46 PM</a><br><br>

Your compassion shines through and I appreciate it.<br><br>The points you make are quite rational, and my wife is a devoted rationalist. Not only that, she's a very (if you'll pardon the expression) down-to-earth person. When she complains that I haven't taken her out in over a week, she doesn't mean to a restaurant or a concert but to some stretch of woods for a twelve-mile walk.<br><br>So you'd think that the reasonable arguments you laid out would carry weight. I thought so. That's why I was so surprised that being "stuck on this rock" is something that affects her emotions so strongly. But those points don't sway her. Fundamentally it's not a rational issue.<br><br>Regardless of the future's trajectory, she has no expectation of herself ever whizzing through brightly colored nebulae (whose bright colors are not visible to human eyes anyhow, and which even at a hefty fraction of lightspeed would take subjective years to whiz through) or ever setting foot on alien worlds. Nor of being rescued or spiritually enlightened by aliens. Rather, it's a feeling that our whole species has the potential, if not some kind of genetic imperative, to propagate among the stars, thereby mitigating the inherent risk of being dependent upon one vulnerable planet. A potential that could be tragically wasted.<br><br>(That might in part be a response to growing up amid the "atomic war" paranoia of the 1950-60s, which included the dubious but prevailing belief that "only cockroaches" would survive such a war. In other words, the not altogether unjustified fear of having all your eggs in one basket. Ovunalveaphobia?)<br><br>In any case, this is definitely an instance where the Archdruid, were he so inclined, could send me a big dripping "told ya so" down the wires. Sometimes when he describes things people have told him, I think, "In the diverse circles he moves in, I'm sure he's met people who believe those things, but it can't really be that common." That's what I thought regarding people for whom space travel itself (not e.g. aliens or UFOs) is part of a de facto religion. But, turns out I was sleeping with one.<br><br><a href=#c8666926711283492844 title="comment permalink">5/5/14, 6:31 PM</a><br><br>

I have an old account at the Green Wizards forum that I have to get working again. That might be a good place. If you'd prefer privacy, Archdruid Greer has my email address and I give permission, if he's willing, for him to email it to you. (Send him your email address in a comment headed "Not for posting.")<br><br>One of several elephants in the room: the moral calculus of waste and regret, as applied to improving the quality of life of the developmentally disabled. Is my brother's Eagle Scout badge, which will end up in his grave and which was brought about by the use of about 2000 gallons of gasoline to attend weekly meetings and events over a 40-year period, something to toss into the same category as backyard swimming pools and Concorde flights and disposable diapers? Is it not the shining humanitarian achievement our parents and the many good people involved for decades at a stretch thought it was, but something foolish and shameful instead? Some facets of some peak-oil-aware sensibilities imply so, and I resist that; how much do I thereby set myself apart or plant myself in Hagsgate?<br><br>Regarding your house, that sounds like a solvable problem, especially if the location is a good one to stay in. One possibility is to choose a central portion of your house (maybe the original structure pre additions, or maybe a different portion chosen to be compact) to be the "all season" part, and the rest to become "seasonal" (read: not centrally heated) rooms. Then insulate all walls, doors, and ceilings separating the all-season parts from the seasonal parts. You will probably also need modifications to your heating system to create "zones" that can be shut off, and if there's plumbing in any of the "seasonal" areas it will need some "stop and waste" valves or similar fixtures added to allow you to shut off and drain those sections when they're not in use. Seasonal rooms were pretty common in big old houses heated by fireplaces.<br><br><a href=#c1313035501448827241 title="comment permalink">5/5/14, 6:43 PM</a><br><br>

The grace and power of the horse as it lopes and turns at the touch of heel or rein, mane flying and tail flagged as their hooves barely touch the ground that, for a moment lets me feel like I'm riding Pegasus.<br><br>I am thankful for all of these moments of perception and I cherish them as memories for I know they will all pass soon enough.

That seemed to be when people got tired of the struggle to conserve and be frugal, when they signaled by their votes that they were ready to party on with Reagan. I think JMG's characterization of making a choice in the 1980s to consume rather than conserve is fair. <br><br>SLClaire, I thought your post was very accurate up to this point. But then, just like JMG you left out the most important factor that caused the conservation in the first place - the price of oil. After 1980, reduced demand and overproduction produced a glut on the world market, causing a six-year-long decline in oil prices culminating with a 46 percent price drop in 1986. Don’t you think that might have something to do with it rather your vague “got tired” and “party on” reasons? Who continues to conserve a product that is plummeting in price? It’s quite absurd to think that people would, and that’s why characterizing it as a choice that ordinary people made is unfair. It would have taken a global effort to force people to continue to conserve a product when there is a glut of it on the market. I think it’s up to people like JMG and you to state specifically how that could have been done before you blame ordinary people.<br><br><a href=#c7673274243272134582 title="comment permalink">5/7/14, 12:16 AM</a><br><br>

I imagine Kurdish ones are similar (or were you thinking of Khyber Pass copies?).<br><br>- In the past, Khyber Pass copies (and originals like the flintlock djezails) did have their barrels made locally too. If that isn't happening now, it's not for lack of expertise but because of the readier availability of parts. Barrel making is actually lower technology than the other work involved, though it takes a skilled workman to make the buttons or broaches used to deform or cut rifling (but it doesn't take a skilled workman to use them).<br><br>- The <i>English</i> archers didn't learn how to use longbows as a necessity of their lifestyle, the original <i>Welsh</i> archers did, and this so impressed the English that laws were made requiring English villagers to learn and practise their use. They had to do it in a different sense of "had to".<br><br>- The longbow didn't decline as a result of the Black Death and its aftermath (except in so far as that led to a general shift away from serfdom and related institutions that were fostering the skill under the law), but more from the increasing protection of knights' armour (which, however, led to less manoeuvrability and lower numbers of knights in armour because of the expense). The decline in the longbow on the continent came first from the English being pushed out, which was partly related to increased warfare within England drawing forces there; however, within England, archers were still being mustered well into Tudor times, and there were even some reports of Cornish archers being summoned by the king in the 17th century Civil Wars (they seem to have been re-equipped or dispersed after a defeat, as there are no reports of their use in action that I know of).<br><br><a href=#c8374891131567823692 title="comment permalink">5/7/14, 4:44 AM</a><br><br>

In particular, note the French Revolution, where changes to power in the name of abstractions such as liberty and equality took the (admittedly quite ossified) political order through a reign of terror and beyond; large changes to our existing social order to rework the power relationships might risk similar instability. Also, there has been at least one posting here regarding various utopian movements; these experiments perhaps indicate that altering the patterns of power is no easy task, even at such small scales. And, moreover, look at what percentage of the population is willing to even invest in such movements. Burke in contrast gives high regard to the then holders of power in Britain:<br><br><i>"You, if you are what you ought to be, are in my eye the great oaks that shade a country, and perpetuate your benefits from generation to generation."</i> — Norman, Jesse (2013-05-21).

As for changes in structures of power:<br><br><i>'Richard Sosis looked closely at the history of 200 communes, religious and secular, established in the USA in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. He found that the religious communes lasted four times as long as the secular ones, and were half as likely to dissolve within the first five years of existence. Just 6 per cent of the secular communes were functioning after twenty years, as against nearly 40 per cent of the religious ones.'</i> — p. 270<br><br>Establishing a moral community might therefore be a more worthy thing to culture than worrying about whether those in power are playing their oak parts properly. Let's see...<br><br><i>'concern about falling social mobility and the emergence of entrenched and self-selecting elites, in the growing distrust of political authority, and in suspicion that those in power are distant, unaccountable and incapable of leadership.'</i> — p. 239<br><br>Uhh, yeah, so probably better to work on the ethic of community or the ethic of divinity and not more of that ethic of autonomy—valuing individual freedom too much leads to license over liberty, and then folks downstream of the coal plant are wondering if they could possibly have some liberty to clean water, though only after the levee fails...but pay me no mind!

The challenge with the barrels in either case is that modern ones are made of or lined with chrome-alloy steel which is very hard to cut with hand tools. That does not negate the greater point, that semi-automatic and fully automatic weapons can be made by hand in home shops in a de-industrial society; the chrome barrels reduce fouling and extend barrel life, but they are not necessary for a functioning weapon.<br><br>The Leibigs Limit in this case is likely to be ammunition. It can be hand loaded, of course, but that still requires factory made primers. And after half a dozen re-uses the brass has stretched too much, and along with the trimmings from the neck of the case need to be melted down and re-made into casings; another process that is trivial in a factory, but difficult in a cottage industry. But, see the Taiwanese industrial model for a possible work around. Any future in which automatic weapons are practical will require ammunition factories.<br><br>I beg to disagree with you on English Archery. It was endemic in all forested areas within the Danelaw (N.E. England). The viking era Danish bow was indistinguishable from the longbows recovered from the 1545 wreck of the Mary Rose.<br><br>Perhaps I was not clear on what the Black Death had to do with it. Running concurrently with the Hundred Years War, the Plague reduced the population by 50% in the first year. In an economy already dependent on wool, the reduction in labour available encouraged more land owners to convert farm and forest to sheep. A reduced rural population then had both smaller numbers, and less opportunity to poach deer. Most of the laws encouraging archery were in a response to this decline. A 'prentice in London or a Fuller in Dunwich did not have the incentive to shoot that a woodsman in an Essex forest did.<br><br>The English did maintain companies of bowmen right through the 16th century, and were proud of it. But their numbers were quite small; and in the Military-Political relationship I mentioned in my previous post, the English government and constitution at the time of Elizabeth Tudor were considered a quaint mediaeval novelty by Continental rulers.<br><br>I stand by my thesis, that a complicated skill is developed by real economic need (the opportunity to poach deer in this case); and when that need or opportunity goes away, no amount of legislation will maintain the skill.<br><br>Plate armour did offer glancing surfaces to arrows, but was still vulnerable to a square hit.

I would not be at all surprised if there was a civilization that existed there during the late Pleistocene. 12,000 years ago that area would have been an ideal place for settlement, a broad river valley with a clement sub-tropical climate. As close to a real Garden of Eden as likely ever existed in the world. Moreover, if you trace the ancient river courses of the Tigris, the Euphrates, the Wadi al Battin (the most likely candidate for the River Pishon) and the Karun River (likely the River Gihon mentioned in the Book of Genesis), they all converge under the northern extent of what is now the Persian Gulf, which implies that the Garden of Eden was near what is now Kharg Island. There are also clues from Sumerian mythology that suggest that their ancestors came from a land that was subsequently submerged. Most likely the Sumerians, and probably some other ancient Middle Eastern nations, were descended from refugees who once lived in the river valley where the Persian Gulf is now and had to flee upriver to escape the flooding. This would also explain why the Sumerian civilization suddenly appeared seemingly out of nowhere with advanced knowledge and technologies, since they would have been survivors from an earlier civilization and would have brought a great deal of knowledge and experience with them.<br><br>I still believe that the Archdruid (and others like Andrew Collins) makes a good case for Atlantis being in or near the Caribbean. Most likely, it would have been where the Bahamas or Cuba are now. Both had a much larger extent before the ice sheets melted, and details of their Ice Age geography match Plato’s account pretty closely. <br><br>That being said, I seriously doubt Atlantis was the only pre-historic civilization. There are many attested to in ancient legends and a lot of circumstantial evidence for civilizations during the late Pleistocene or early Holocene. I mentioned earlier that there is strong circumstantial evidence for an Ice Age civilization in Sundaland, which corresponds closely with occult traditions about Lemuria. Submerged cities have also been found off the coasts of Japan, India, Cuba and Turkey that were last above water several thousand years ago. There have also been persistent rumors of lost civilizations in other places like the Gobi Desert, the steppes of Russia, the Himalayas, the Amazon rain forest, and many other parts of the world. No doubt there were many other civilizations that existed long before Sumeria and ancient Egypt and not all at the same time either. After all, we live in a cyclical, not a linear universe, one that is filled with mysteries beyond human comprehension, and it’s the height of arrogance to think we have scratched more than the merest surface of existence. The delusional and hubristic arrogance of the Faustian civilization in which we live never ceases to amaze me.<br><br><a href=#c4678796731432607404 title="comment permalink">5/7/14, 3:22 PM</a><br><br>

So, while it was still possible to blame locals for William Rufus's being shot to death in the New Forest (but possibly by a crossbowman recruited as an assassin), by the time Edward I was subduing the Welsh that expertise simply wasn't widespread in England. Maybe archery was merely being re-introduced to England, but that was definitely a top-down product and not a lifestyle corollary. The rather Draconian laws against poaching didn't stop some people resorting to it, but they definitely kept archery from being widespread until it was compulsory.<br><br>"Running concurrently with the Hundred Years War, the Plague reduced the population by 50% in the first year.

At the end of the period, in the mid 15th century, it had been replaced by exports of finished cloth. This was in part enabled by the feedback loop between plague and war driven rural de-population driving conversion of land to sheep grazing, in turn reducing the need for rural peasants. As the population recovered from the plague, more of the peasants moved to the cities and towns, and provided the labour for the growing wool processing industries.<br><br>"You can say that the villagers had a real economic need, to practise archery so as to avoid sanctions that could reach them.

But then, just like JMG you left out the most important factor that caused the conservation in the first place - the price of oil. After 1980, reduced demand and overproduction produced a glut on the world market, causing a six-year-long decline in oil prices culminating with a 46 percent price drop in 1986. Don’t you think that might have something to do with it rather your vague “got tired” and “party on” reasons? Who continues to conserve a product that is plummeting in price? It’s quite absurd to think that people would, and that’s why characterizing it as a choice that ordinary people made is unfair. It would have taken a global effort to force people to continue to conserve a product when there is a glut of it on the market. I think it’s up to people like JMG and you to state specifically how that could have been done before you blame ordinary people."<br><br>I was in my late 20s then, working and paying attention to the people around me and the media of the time, and yes, it did indeed feel as if many/most people pretty much gave up on conservation about then. I'm not sure how old you were at the time, if you recall Reagan's presidency or not. He seemed to be perceived as a kind of father/grandfather figure who was, with his Morning in America slogan, reassuring people that everything's OK now, we're back to normal. People had been pretty shook up when the oil crises happened. It was the first rattle to the religion of progress. People didn't take it well, and I think they heaved a sigh of relief when Reagan soothed them by telling them it's over, go back to your shopping and enjoy yourself. <br><br>If you want to understand the feeling of the 1980s, the best way is to read some of the collections of the comic strip Bloom County. Berke Breathed depicted the mood better than anyone I know of.<br><br>As far as who continues to conserve a product that is plummeting in price: JMG did and does. I did and do; my husband and I dropped our thermostat setting from 66 to 60F in winter over the same past several years that natural gas has dropped considerably in price due to fracking. So, yes, these are choices that ordinary people - and I'm ordinary even though I have too much respect for JMG to call him that - make. People are responsible for their choices. I agree that some folks don't change unless price forces them to, but I don't think that is something to support them for doing. Ordinary people have brought about very significant and positive changes in the status of women and many other groups of people heretofore discriminated against, not because of any economic signal, but because they saw it was the right thing to do. And they did it by doing it, not by making excuses for themselves. I don't think it is blaming people to say that many people could make better choices than they have been and are making. It's an observation. I know the factors that make it difficult to change and I sympathize, especially since I am still working to reduce bad habits of my own. Nonetheless, using price as an excuse for avoiding the hard work of change doesn't work for me.<br><br><a href=#c7179186646128339955 title="comment permalink">5/8/14, 12:39 PM</a><br><br>

The problem with passive income such as rent or interest or stocks or slaves is that it is a parasitic relationship (though not always fully, sometimes there is some symbiosis--JMG probably thinks parasites are just as necessary to a healthy ecosystem as symbiotes). It's not about autonomy as much as it is about balanced energy flow-giving and receiving our gifts through work. The landlord suffers just as much as the tenant from that perspective, unless they use that energy to give back in some other way (which does happen!)<br><br>But I am definitely NOT advocating any kind of political revolution and would probably find Burke very agreeable to read. Just asking why if JMG would go through the trouble of trying to convince people to give up the petroleum addiction, why not go for what's behind it, which is the addiction to power over other people and nature? Perhaps he is doing that in his own indirect way?

It was only then, in the late <i>16th</i> century, that exports of finished cloth became significant (it is not a coincidence that the Lord Speaker in the House of Lords sits on a woolsack as part of the office; Elizabeth I instituted that as a reminder of the source of England's wealth, raw wool).

When the Hundred Years War started, it was still an alien, French (and French speaking) ruling class.<br><br>- It was actually already a French ruling class when it was installed after the Norman Conquest, both because the Normans had gone native by then and because (perhaps surprisingly) around half the incomers weren't Norman anyway but other continental adventurers (oddly enough, there was a higher proportion of Normans among the knights who moved on to Scotland and Ireland - or perhaps they were just less diluted later). After Stephen, even the kings weren't Norman. Over the generations, more continental adventurers kept coming, e.g. Simon De Montfort in the 13th century and Piers Gaveston in the early 14th century; we can take the latter as marking the beginning of lack of acceptance of the French among the English nobility, though that may have been because of, ah, personal issues. Certainly Simon De Montfort was so accepted that he could lead a revolt by the English nobility.<br><br>- The commoners in England were <i>not</i> Anglo-Saxons descended from Scandinavians. They were Anglo-Saxons descended from people from around Frisia (which then extended from what is now Holland into Jutland), and a comparatively few people descended from Scandinavians who were not Anglo-Saxons and whose ancestors had survived the Wasting of the North after the Norman Conquest - Yorkshiremen, Geordies, and the like. That sort of cultural connection between the ancestors of the knights and the commoners was probably stronger in lowland Scotland, and near a few of the former Viking cities in Ireland.<br><br>Anyway, it strikes me that a diktat from the top is a far more likely explanation for English archers when there were nothing like as many in other countries, particularly since the nobility's being against it was far more to do with them being jealous of their hunting privileges than with them not trusting the peasantry with weapons.<br><br><a href=#c2725166494240619311 title="comment permalink">5/10/14, 6:05 AM</a><br><br>

He seemed to be perceived as a kind of father/grandfather figure who was, with his Morning in America slogan, reassuring people that everything's OK now, we're back to normal. People had been pretty shook up when the oil crises happened. It was the first rattle to the religion of progress. People didn't take it well, and I think they heaved a sigh of relief when Reagan soothed them by telling them it's over, go back to your shopping and enjoy yourself.” <br><br>Yes I was there, this is the way I remember it. “Morning in America” was a slogan from Reagan's 1984 campaign commercials. It meant to convey the fact the the country had entered an economic recovery after a very deep recession. It’s hard to imagine a president running for reelection who wouldn’t try to give people the impression that he was responsible for better times. People were already shopping because that’s what people do in an economic recovery. They didn’t wait for a command from Reagan to do so. The same was true for conserving energy, there was no command from Reagan telling them to stop conserving. It had been known for decades that Reagan didn’t care about the environment or saving energy, so I don’t why people who did would stop caring about those things because of him. No laws were passed preventing people from continuing to conserve if they wished to do so. People didn’t continue to conserve because their heating bills were dropping, and so was the price of gasoline. It was those tangible economic realities that were reassuring and soothing to people, Reagan was just echoing economic reality.<br><br>The task that you and JMG have in order to continue your blame game, is to come up with a realistic way that a typical citizen could have changed that reality all by herself. Until you can, you have no case. Under those circumstances it's a delusion to think that large amounts of fossil fuels could ever have been set aside for future generations through the trivial individual choices you made. The same is true for today. Such a monumental task would require all of society’s individuals and institutions working together. That’s not happening now, so how realistic is it to expect that it should have happened in the 1980’s.<br><br><a href=#c7737488146502294431 title="comment permalink">5/10/14, 1:49 PM</a><br><br>

Lawrence,<br><br>I bow to your knowledge of the wool trade. However, I was concerned with the demographic shifts during the 100 Years War, rather than the 16th century, by which time, yes the population had recovered from the plague and grown yet further. I still don't see how you differentiate between the Black Death being "within" rather than "concurrent" with the 100 Years War. Yes, the Plague was about 30% shorter than the war, starting near it's beginning and petering out a generation before the end. Seems close enough to me, but I suppose it's as good a distinction for you as the word "obsession" was for me.<br><br>Yes, I was quite aware that Scandinavia normally refers to the peninsula on which Norway and Sweden are located, and that Anglo Saxons migrated from Frisia and Jutland. However, the Normans were primarily descended from Danish vikings, many from Jutland, though Rollo's (Duke Robert I) origins are contested. My point was that the cultures of Anglo Saxon England, which had frequent contacts with Normandy and which was evolving towards Feudalism, and Normandy were much closer at the time of William's conquest than the separate cultures of the military and civilian components of the Western Roman Empire when it collapsed and began to evolve into what became Feudal France.<br><br>"Anyway, it strikes me that a diktat from the top is a far more likely explanation for English archers when there were nothing like as many in other countries, particularly since the nobility's being against it was far more to do with them being jealous of their hunting privileges than with them not trusting the peasantry with weapons."<br><br>Actually, no; French nobility of the period said in contemporary documents that they did not trust their peasants with such a weapon. If your thesis is correct, the laws to encourage archery by the French kings should have been more effective. That they were not, I attribute to resistance to enforcement by local nobility.<br><br>Here, I believe, we disagree as a matter of opinion. You seem to be saying that English peasants refrained from hunting with the longbow for three centuries due to anti poaching laws, then took up the bow as a weapon of war as a result of laws requiring practice.<br><br>I think this flies in the face of human nature. You could be right, but I think the historic record supports my view better. I say this because the numbers and population percentage of English Bowmen never recovered after the 100 Years War; despite additional laws requiring archery practice aimed at the (now free) class of townsmen. If the laws were as effective as you are saying, the demographic shift from country to town (and I don't think you and I disagree that this happened) should have meant the numbers of Archers would have recovered after the plague along with the rest of the population. They did not, and a whole series of stricter laws were enacted by subsequent monarchs with little effect.<br><br>My conclusion is that the prospect of bringing a poached deer to the table is a more effective incentive to a countryman than mandated practice is to a townsman. As a note, the laws required a minimum range of 220 yards (1/8 Mile!) with a "wand" the diameter of a man's wrist as the target. No saying how often it was actually hit though.<br><br>The other reason I think legal motivation aimed at war was ineffective is the very high mortality rates due to disease, malnutrition, hypothermia and infection among the peasant class infantry. Everyone knew the odds; regardless of your skill as an archer you were more likely to die than live once you were in the army.<br><br>In any case, the relevance to this forum is what is likely to happen in the future. One would hope an examination of history would help. But, as our disagreement demonstrates, even when faced with the same facts and course of events, it is possible to come to very different conclusions about cause.<br><br>Glenn<br><br>in the Bramblepatch<br>Marrowstone Island<br>Salish Sea<br>Cascadia<br><br><a href=#c2688153879427396104 title="comment permalink">5/10/14, 3:16 PM</a><br><br>

The separate cultures of the military and civilian components of the Western Roman Empire when it collapsed were actually far closer still, consisting of Late Romans and those barbarians who had been next to the frontier for two centuries and had actually developed close connections as Foederati etc. But those did <i>not</i> begin "to evolve into what became Feudal France" at all; that came from the Franks, who were a group further removed from the frontier and who came in as a later wave. Those Franks were indeed culturally more separated from the post-Romans, with one important exception that came later and made a lot of difference to history. The Franks took up the same sort of Catholic Christianity as the post-Romans, unlike the otherwise more assimilated and earlier barbarian invaders, who were mostly Arians. So your point is accurate about the <i>Franks</i>, who weren't sidelined by history, just not about "the separate cultures of the military and civilian components of the Western Roman Empire when it collapsed"; the Franks weren't in on that.<br><br>"If your thesis is correct, the laws to encourage archery by the French kings should have been more effective".<br><br>No, because they neither had enough time to operate nor (in the face of current warfare) enough opportunity. Don't forget that even English archers didn't make enough difference until the Hundred Years War; earlier, at Bannockburn, other tactics prevailed.<br><br><a href=#c3275025453464280000 title="comment permalink">5/10/14, 11:30 PM</a><br><br>

It would have been even easier to travel from Anglesey like the modern ferries, but that was a pacification step too far.<br><br>- The English gained some knowledge of Welsh archery from all this, but even by the time of Simon de Montfort's rebellion in Henry III's reign (mid 13th century), a rebellion against which the future Edward I fought, archery seems not to have been much used.<br><br>- Edward I conquered Wales and turned his attention to Scotland (late 13th and early 14th centuries). There was peace within England itself, and so no serious disruption. This seems to have been when English archery started coming in.<br><br>- By Edward III's reign (mid 14th century) English archery was well enough established to be material in wars in France.<br><br>So I'm not "saying that English peasants refrained from hunting with the longbow for three centuries due to anti poaching laws, then took up the bow as a weapon of war as a result of laws requiring practice", I'm saying that for <i>two</i> centuries <i>too many</i> of them refrained to allow a critical mass to form until the law was changed to require it, and that this was a result of <i>a self-policing system of privileges</i> preventing poaching, i.e. nobles out hunting, and maybe a few licensed verderers, would catch enough poachers to thin them out (just read up about what the future Edward I and a few of his friends did to a peasant they simply found on the road!). The privileges system provided self-policing throughout, since everybody had some privileges (though some were more valuable than others). Nobles could hunt, but on the other hand commoners had rights to graze livestock on the commons, which others couldn't do. Why risk being spotted using someone else's privileges, when you can get some meat through your own privileges and might lose those if you were caught?<br><br><a href=#c1520238890423402789 title="comment permalink">5/10/14, 11:34 PM</a><br><br>

Townies, like vagrants, were more lost to scrutiny (what some modern researchers call "legibility").<br><br>Oh, and it <i>wasn't</i> a "demographic shift from country to town", it was simply a demographic shift from the country; some of those did indeed find places in towns, but once a peace dividend from the Wars of the Roses arrived there were many leaving the <i>villages</i> unwillingly who were thrown into vagrancy (this is a key aspect of Tudor history).<br><br>"The other reason I think legal motivation aimed at war was ineffective is the very high mortality rates due to disease, malnutrition, hypothermia and infection among the peasant class infantry.

You're conflating several different things:-<br><br>- It wasn't a law requiring people to become infantry that was at work, it was a law requiring peaceful villagers to learn archery.<br><br>- When trained archers did join up, for many of them it was plain ignorance of what was involved as all <i>they</i> had ever seen were swaggering soldiers loaded with loot (see the beginning of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's <i>The White Company</i> for a word picture of this); they didn't know about survivor bias, and no, <i>not</i> "Everyone knew the odds".

I'm doing this partly for the truth's own sake, but also because, as you point out, that same basis is going to be the one people have when looking into how the present turns into the future. (I've been keeping an eye out for specifics when people talk about "feudal" or "feudalism" around here, because it's surprising how often they are only thinking of what the French Revolutionaries were condemning in a blanket way; it's rather like the misunderstanding of "Fascist" or "Fascism" that our host has been bringing out. So far, I haven't seen that common error.)<br><br>By the way, you might be interested to know that a few years ago I did some fact checking and proof reading for Professor Geoffrey Blainey's <i>History of the World</i> - see the credits.

It was because to tackle the stagflation - more so than the unemployment issue, which in itself is an interesting thing - in the US, the Reagan administration responded by introducing budget cuts. His popularity fell to 35% which was the lowest for a president since Watergate.<br><br>After that election - possibly fearing for his job - the Reagan administration introduced: deficit spending; lower interest rates; and tax cuts.<br><br>Those 3 policies combined can be approximated to a spend today and worry about the bill tomorrow mindset.<br><br>You are quite correct in your supposition that it was not about conservation. That thought probably never crossed the average punters mind. It appears to me that it was about pushing today's costs into the future. Conservation is still an option. It always is. <br><br>The consequences of accepting conservation as an option are a lower standard of living.<br><br>The problem is that those strategies have been recycled for a rinse and repeat situation to this day, so the future costs just keep getting bigger. It has many parallels to the problem of pollution.<br><br>Quote: "The task that you and JMG have in order to continue your blame game, is to come up with a realistic way that a typical citizen could have changed that reality all by herself.

It meant to convey the fact the the country had entered an economic recovery after a very deep recession. It’s hard to imagine a president running for reelection who wouldn’t try to give people the impression that he was responsible for better times. People were already shopping because that’s what people do in an economic recovery. They didn’t wait for a command from Reagan to do so. The same was true for conserving energy, there was no command from Reagan telling them to stop conserving. It had been known for decades that Reagan didn’t care about the environment or saving energy, so I don’t why people who did would stop caring about those things because of him. No laws were passed preventing people from continuing to conserve if they wished to do so. People didn’t continue to conserve because their heating bills were dropping, and so was the price of gasoline. It was those tangible economic realities that were reassuring and soothing to people, Reagan was just echoing economic reality.<br><br>The task that you and JMG have in order to continue your blame game, is to come up with a realistic way that a typical citizen could have changed that reality all by herself. Until you can, you have no case. Under those circumstances it's a delusion to think that large amounts of fossil fuels could ever have been set aside for future generations through the trivial individual choices you made. The same is true for today. Such a monumental task would require all of society’s individuals and institutions working together. That’s not happening now, so how realistic is it to expect that it should have happened in the 1980’s.'<br><br><br>I hated Reagan, I was a junior high kid in California when he was governor and I knew what an empty, senile suit he was.<br><br>The public would have conserved with a charismatic political leader as a willing example to brace against the financial tide. However since even then so many political representatives were chasing the patronage of the super wealthy and corporations over and above the people they purported to represent, it didn't happen. What did happen was examples set by such people who ignored the obvious limits and pretended that 'they'll think of something' while scoffing at anyone 'foolish enough' to deliberately restrict the public life style. They wanted financial zombies and they got them. Fantasy triumphed over obvious reality.<br><br>With a de industrialized economy few working class families have the money to become more self sufficient without stiff hardship due to their learning curve. Especially since so many of them have no or low paying jobs to begin with.<br><br>I've always wanted land, (I think its genetic), but for one reason or another I haven't gotten it. If I buy this property I'm looking at I'll be planting a garden as soon as I can get out on it. I've already got a pygmy nanny so I'll breed her again and hopefully get another nanny and alternate breeding each to keep a good supply of milk. There will also be a small chicken flock for fresh eggs and I'm thinking of a pit green house using old sliding glass doors for the roof to grow fruit trees that wouldn't survive the winters here as well as out of season berries too. I might even be tempted to grow some tropical vegetables with long maturation periods. I'd rather spend essentially worthless paper on paying off the land then buying a lot of toys and gadgets. The dollar is losing value and land, livestock and the skills that accompany them are more valuable than a stock portfolio, IMO.<br><br>BTW, in a moribund economy such as we're headed into I'd use a gun for defensive purposes and a bow for hunting. I'm a little woman and I'd rather not advertise that I've had hunter's luck to anyone who might think to make their life easier by taking what I've gotten.<br><br><br>Wadulisi<br><br><a href=#c6501169772373789948 title="comment permalink">5/11/14, 4:32 PM</a><br><br>

Cartridge cases can be reloaded and reused a number of times, but eventually metal fatigue sets in, and with luck you notice the case deformation before you load a hot load in it, and blow the action right off your rifle. To reload cartridge ammunition - popularly known as 'bullets':<br>1. You have to have a punch to extract the spent primers, a tool to convert Berdan primer holes to Boxer if using military surplus ammo (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centerfire_ammunition), and then you've got to have a source of primers or know how to recycle them (http://castboolits.gunloads.com/archive/index.php/t-137802.html)<br>2. You have to have a bullet mold for the calibre of rifle you're using, a means of melting and pouring lead, and be able to cut and file the sprue from the casting process off the bullet. We're talking about just lead here, not FMJ or BTHP.<br>3.

You don't seem to agree with my thesis that it was because townsmen didn't have the poaching opportunities their country cousins did; yet they never produced the numbers of archers that the rural areas did before the Hundred Years War.

It was much lauded at the time as it was all about influencing the supply side of the economic equation.<br><br>What am I talking about, you ask? Well in order to break the effectiveness of the Oil Embargo during the 70’s, the US government strove to increase the supply of Oil to consumers.<br><br>Increasing the supply of Oil drove down the price as you quite correctly point out. It also undermined the need for conservation efforts.<br><br>At the same time the economic policies introduced increased the short term purchasing power of the US dollar making imports cheaper. <br><br>It was a double whammy, domestic Oil production improved and imported fuel (as well as other manufactured imports) became cheaper on the back of a stronger US dollar.<br><br>So, short term you are correct. However, the long term story is this:<br><br>Currently, my understanding is that the US imports half of all its Oil requirements.<br><br>Think about that for a minute. Half of every tank of fuel you put into your vehicle comes from an overseas source.<br><br>Ask yourself honestly: Is there any feasible way that the US could possibly produce all of the Oil it consumes? There are several options available to achieve this and none of them are business as usual.<br><br>The other economic policies are nearing their end game too. Let's have a look at how they are going:<br><br>- deficit spending. Well Federal government debt in the US is now at approximately 100% of GDP. I have read in the past - and please correct me if I am wrong, that above 90% is indicative of a failed state;<br><br>- lower interest rates. Your official interest rates are at or near zero. This is an indicator that in the real world where services are provided and goods are made and sold there is very little opportunity for a positive return on investment. Should you be worried, yes; and <br><br>- tax cuts. As your Federal government spends more every year than it receives in income (ie. taxes), it is feeding the above deficit problem.<br><br>Now, remember about that pesky imported Oil stuff which is about half of the amount you use everyday?<br><br>Well, it just so happens that the US is asking the rest of the world to accept US dollars to pay for that imported stuff. Meanwhile, the average US consumer and government is doing their very best to reduce the value of that dollar. The other strong nations who would like to get access to that Oil which the US currently imports are doing their very best to assist the US in its act of self-imploding.<br><br>They don't have to even go to the expense of fielding an army. All they have to do is keep extending credit to the US, developing alternative markets (and client states), accepted currencies and squirrelling away resources - all of which is happening right now.<br><br>I have genuinely warm feelings towards the US and its people and am not excited about other countries taking over its role.<br><br>My gut feeling is that at some point in the future, the supply of imported Oil to the US will be slowly strangled as sooner or later another country will call you out on your economic bluff game. <br><br>So ask yourself again, is conservation an option?<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c87828646976800752 title="comment permalink">5/11/14, 9:40 PM</a><br><br>

Rather, I used it as an example to show that rifles do <i>not</i> need special steels and machining for their <i>barrels</i> after all, though those do help a lot.<br><br>- The Khyber Pass copies of assault rifles etc. <i>prove</i> that perfectly good ones can be made with limited resources like that, since some <i>have</i> been made. Yes, some shoddy ones have been made too, but as I pointed out, that relates to what the locals want. When they want good ones, those can be had.<br><br>- "you can certainly with enough effort cobble together semi or full auto action that kinda, sorta works even with substandard materials and tulerances [sic]" is of course just precisely what Kalashnikov was after and got - only, with rather better "works". I suggested a slightly different approach based on other experience that was built up while working with limited resources (the Heckler &amp; Koch G3's action was originally developed for a machine gun by a firm outside the armaments industry, and the Owen gun magazine and sealing system was developed similarly and with a view to field conditions).<br><br>When you put that together, it looks very likely indeed that a very limited industrial base could produce enough such weapons for local needs. Whether it could produce enough decent ammunition is another matter, as Streamfortyseven pointed out, but that wasn't the bottleneck I was addressing just there; I was only dealing with the difficulty claimed for the weapons themselves.<br><br><a href=#c6844804454038935244 title="comment permalink">5/12/14, 6:21 AM</a><br><br>

By pointing you at Tudor developments, I showed you both that they started later and that they went in somewhat different directions from what you thought. For instance, the Tudor period was when the wool trade became a big deal and when a lot of people were first driven off the land (and they didn't simply all go to the towns, but rather a lot of them just fell through the cracks).<br><br>"I am curious, since many of the later laws requiring archery practice were aimed at townsmen, at least as late as Henry VIII, why the decline in numbers of archers available after the Hundred Years War?

If, as you say, it was more difficult to monitor compliance in a city than in the villages; why didn't any of the kings figure that out and deal with it between say 1450 and 1550?"<br><br>First off, the towns weren't vast conurbations, so townies had just as many poaching opportunities <i>anyway</i>, a short walk away (I've somewhere seen a report of a stag being brought to bay in Fulham in the late 18th century, two hours walk from the City of London proper, though it was noteworthy by then).<br><br>Second, <i>of course</i> the kings figured out that it was harder to handle people in towns (<i>or</i> as vagrants, don't forget). But you should remember that their resources and tools for dealing with that were limited - that's why it was an issue of "legibility". The kings could only try to keep people from voluntarily or involuntarily leaving village life, but since they could only work through local magnates who had vested interests the other way, their success was limited. (In case you're interested, totalitarians have figured out ways of handling townspeople since then, basically street and building committees using rationing control to control residents and perks to reward the committee members.)<br><br><a href=#c7439978273891761572 title="comment permalink">5/12/14, 6:22 AM</a><br><br>

They started coming round when Henry I used them to defeat his brother, Robert, Duke of Normandy, at Tinchebrai. Still, it was probably only the wars of Stephen and Matilda (when "God and his saints slept") that made them grateful for a strong king rather than endemic robber barons.

While both were violent, the brutal excesses of the Jacqueries indicates much stronger feeling of hostility between the classes in France and England."<br><br>But they <i>weren't</i> the same proximate causes, were they? In France, the defeats of Crecy and Poitiers led to a change of both strategy and tactics, that were followed up by an English response. The French used their castles and tried to avoid open battle, leading to incremental siege campaigns, and the English used havoc to try to draw them out. That means, they stole what they could and burned, killed or otherwise laid waste to anything they couldn't, leading long raids into nearly all parts of France to do it. The French nobility were indeed drawn out at Poitiers, but after that they grinned and bore it - because the worst was happening to the peasants, not to them.<br><br>So the French peasantry grew alienated from the nobility that they thought (correctly) had abandoned them to suffer and to die, so their own revolts took place in that context. In England, on the other hand, the young Richard II could go out and give assurances to revolting peasants which were accepted and didn't lead to him simply being scragged; he was held in respect and he tried to live up to that, with limited success (Henry VIII used a similar approach to the Pilgrimage of Grace, only he dealt with that at arm's length and visited dire retribution on it and its leaders).<br><br>As I recall, Mongolian archery used a special ring as part of the release process.

Roughly, Carter's view was that the U.S. would basically follow its hubbert's curve downward, depending primarily on domestic sources and eschewing imports. At that time, the lion's share of the world's oil was in the volatile middle east. The corresponding foreign policy was to stand down from empire. Reagan's policy was basically a dramatic expansion of the military and imperialism in the oil producing middle east, and an increase in growth fueled by imported oil (that basically continued through at least the 2nd Iraq war) Carter's view was seen as patriotic and stabilizing because it did not involve spending vast sums on military imperialism in unstable, volatile, unsupportive countries. Also, it was seen as forward thinking, in an age when limits to growth and finite fossil fuel resources were taken as a given, learning to conserve and use appropriate tech was seen as positioning the U.S. well for a future without fossil fuels. Reagan's whole shtick was that our very lifestyle and the American dream depended on growth and energy use, so that Carter's vision and conservation was basically a threat to our very way of life. So, yes the election of 1980 was definitive, tho the effects took a while in coming. Gas prices actually skyrocketed in' 82, hitting an all time high, and the recession of' 82 was particularly severe, so people were still conserving while Reagan's energy policies took a while to take effect.

Lawrence<br><br>"Do you see where you've taken your eye off the ball? You're conflating several different things:-<br><br>"- It wasn't a law requiring people to become infantry that was at work, it was a law requiring peaceful villagers to learn archery."<br><br>My eye is firmly on the ball. My conflation is quite deliberate. The sole purpose of the archery laws was to provide a body of trained men to call upon in time of war. No other purpose. The fact that not everyone who practiced at the butts was drafted didn't change that.<br><br>"- When trained archers did join up, for many of them it was plain ignorance of what was involved as all they had ever seen were swaggering soldiers loaded with loot (see the beginning of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The White Company for a word picture of this); they didn't know about survivor bias, and no, not "Everyone knew the odds"."<br><br>The villagers, at any rate, had access to the magnitude of the hazards of war, though townsmen might not. In a village of 200 people you can know everyone by name, and probably half of them pretty well. If a dozen men march off to war one fine spring day and only two or three return the next winter, everyone knows. In a town, it's easier to remain ignorant of the size of the risk.<br><br>"English archers didn't make enough difference until the Hundred Years War; earlier, at Bannockburn, other tactics <br>prevailed."<br><br>Not a good example to advance your cause. English archers were quite effective earlier at Falkirk. The failures at Stirling Bridge and Bannockburn, despite large numbers of archers available seem due to the commander's haste, or inadequate knowledge of their strengths and weakness and the right tactics to use them. Even after they got it right a few times, Patay showed what happens to unsupported archers. One could chalk this up to an uneven learning curve on the part of the English commanders. I would say it was a combination of luck, the crude state of military intelligence in the Middle Ages and the competence or lack thereof of individual commanders. Edward I for instance, pulled the fat out of the fire at Falkirk by over-riding his commanders and using the archers to soften up the schiltroons.<br><br>"Proximate cause" was probably the wrong phrase for me to use. I was thinking of the general economic situation post Black Death which bit English and French peasant just as hard. You are quite right, the French peasant's grievances were worse. Still, your example of Richard II illustrates a profound difference in class relations between the two countries. English peasants _usually_ had a better deal than their French peers. There is nothing in English history to compare with say, the French Revolution.<br><br>Glenn<br><br>in the Bramblepatch<br>Marrowstone Island<br>Salish Sea<br>Cascadia<br><br><a href=#c7128875712081429986 title="comment permalink">5/12/14, 7:07 PM</a><br><br>

They decided to encourage the latent native archery in England by various statutes, and by the 14th century had large enough numbers of archers for them to be effective in military campaigns. The losses incurred in the Hundred Years War and Black Death were not made up, in part because of the drop in rural population who were easily controlled at the village level; and the difficulties of controlling and recruiting townsmen, including opposing behaviour by local magistrates and officials who profited thereby.<br><br>I think the traditions of archery were much less latent than you; but I certainly will not disagree with the chain of events, with which you are so intimately familiar. I will use an ecologic approach here for my take on events.<br><br>From at least the time of the Danelaw, Archery was a living tradition in all forested areas of England, Wales and Scotland. It was enabled by a culture and economy that made it a usefull skill. After the conquest it was reduced more in appearance than fact by strict game laws which benefited the aristocracy. At the beginning of the Hundred Years War, and before the Plague, there were large numbers of archers available to English kings to use in campaigns. Between the war deaths of the archers themselves, and the reduction in rural peasant population in England by the plague, the breeding and cultural populations for archers fell below replacement levels. The resulting reduced population helped push the economic changes (common in most of Europe subject to the plague) from an in kind economy of direct goods and services to a more monetized economy. When the population started to recover, the previous cultural and economic environment no longer existed. Those peasants who could, chose the towns, and more relative freedom in part because of the demands of a monetized economy and the lack of money making opportunities in rural areas. Thus, despite new laws and statutes, the numbers and proportions of archers never recovered.<br><br>I know about thumb rings. I use a leather tab, which works well. The tricky part is learning the new coordination to hold the nock in place. Shoving it up against a nock ring on the string works, but I need more practice. Snap on nocks work, but reduce the power available a bit. The thumb release tends to deflect the string the opposite way from the Mediterranean release, so I was thinking of releasing the arrow off the right side of the bow rather than the left. Our range area needs to be cleared of brush, and I have too many other spring projects to get to it now.<br><br>Glenn<br><br>in the Bramblepatch<br>Marrowstone Island<br>Salish Sea<br>Cascadia<br><br><a href=#c1064763781884650380 title="comment permalink">5/12/14, 7:09 PM</a><br><br>

What they thought they were choosing, and why, is a separate issue. Sometimes people do things for reasons they aren't fully conscious of, or don't want to admit to themselves. I think this is one of those cases. JMG's discussion of the religion of progress and how that affects what he calls the crawlspace of our minds is relevant here.<br><br>Before I get into that (and thank you Cherokee Chris as I think you've made most of the argument already), allow me to use a current example where large numbers of people have been and are making a choice very much against the will of the various levels of government, in the face of far more severe personal consequences to themselves than practicing conservation would entail. That example is the use of marijuana.<br><br>With a few notable exceptions and for many years government at all levels has been dead set against the possession, production, and sale of marijuana. Serious amounts of jail time and/or fines await anyone convicted of such activities, especially after multiple convictions. Because so many workplaces do drug testing and marijuana's metabolites are retained in the body for many days and are easily detectable, using the drug makes obtaining many, probably most, jobs difficult or impossible. If you are arguing that governmental power will force people to act in certain ways, the logical deduction would be that marijuana use in the US would be quite rare, that most people would choose not to use it. Anyone who lives in the US knows this is not the case. Peoples' choices in this case are clear to themselves and to those in power: they want to use the stuff no matter what, so they do. <br><br>When making a choice would go against the religion of progress, as choosing to conserve did after Reagan's election (particularly after the 1984 election), things are a good deal murkier. The conflict between values we claim to hold and the values we actually act from have much to do with what happened. In this case, even though powerful governmental and corporate forces acted in a way to reduce the price of oil, it *still* paid people to conserve, even on a personal and selfish level. Buying a small gas-conserving car cost less than a big energy hog, both in the cost of the car and in the cost of gasoline. It didn't save as much money as it had earlier, but it still saved enough to be significant to individuals and families. Yet people chose not to do that - and yes, that was a choice they made. No one forced them to act against their own economic interest. So why did they do that? JMG's religion of progress series explains why: people felt much more comfortable to act in concert with their most deeply held values, which in this case meant acting from a belief that energy would be endlessly available in whatever form was needed. To act from a value of conservation forced confronting the value of no limits. This is the sense that I mean that people made a choice in the 1980s to stop conserving. They hadn't enjoyed conserving in the 1970s because it meant confronting their value of limitless growth. When values conflict with behavior, people need to change their behavior or change their values. Many people found it much easier to change their behavior than to deal with a value that they didn't quite realize they were operating from.<br><br><a href=#c8553204250317030818 title="comment permalink">5/13/14, 10:30 AM</a><br><br>

I'm actually about 5 years older than JMG. I got curious and asked my ex-husband and sister what they remember. Turns out, very little. <br>N says "I remember your brother Paul, talking about limits on available sources. I had read more than a few books on that. In fact we even had arguments on the topic, and I remember saying that there is more oil than meets the eye."<br><br>My sister's response was -<br>"The grassroots support for environmental protection, for peace, for nuclear disarmament, for empowering women and people of color, for international justice, did NOT “go away in the 1980’s.” They were rendered powerless and removed from most media coverage by a circling of wagons, by a deliberate and concerted and successful effort on the part of the elite to marginalize all opposition. COINTELPRO was effective against activists but had been ongoing long before that; but the startup of all these “think tanks” which push a conservative, pro-corporate message and are heavily quoted by the media, began then. I also think elements of the elite wanted environmental protection in the early 70’s and that’s why it happened—the movement may have helped, but if the elite had been as determined to prevent those Acts in the early 70s as they are now, likely none would have passed.<br><br>Wonder if JMG has seen the recent study showing that statistically, what the elite wants it generally gets while what the public wants according to polls has almost no effect on what legislation passes--therefore, stories about this usually have the word “oligarchy” in the title. But maybe we don’t want what we tell pollsters we want—there was a great cartoon, posted for years at the soy dairy, in which a politician faces a crowd bearing signs saying, “Poison our water!” “Cut our wages!” “We want another war” “higher CEO pay” “More clearcuts” etc etc. The caption was “The people have spoken”.<br><br>Yes, there was SOME shift in public attitudes around 1980, but it was minor compared to the change in policy starting rather sharply right then.<br><br>This assumption that what we get from government must be what the people want has a tinge of masochism about it in my mind, at least at this point where so much harm has been done and the corruption has gotten increasingly naked."<br><br><a href=#c4691378046121837573 title="comment permalink">5/23/14, 5:31 AM</a><br><br>

You said you would accept 25 and even a 50% loss to feed the local rabbits.<br>I told that to my neighbor, who is one of two main growers at the farmer's market, and he simply said "I would never accept a 50% loss. although there is always some." Last year, he had a garden that was farther away from his house, and he wrapped it in a cheap fence and the deer breached the fence. They had a few days to themselves because he didn't check it every day, but the loss was total. The deer didn't used to be this numerous, which is odd because hunting season around here is bigger than Christmas. But the human population has dropped, and the older generations may have hunted all year round, I don't know. Perhaps before food stamps. My other neighbor told me that finally she said to her husband, unless you put up a fence, I'll stop gardening, because what's the point. (When they moved here in the 70s, there were not so many deer.)<br>Now, I care quite a lot for the critters, and feel pity even for insects. It is only with great reluctance that I kill wasps that get in the house, and will not spray ants but found that if you wipe them away they will eventually give up and stop coming inside. Last year we went to ridiculous lengths to save a robin's nest that had been foolishly built in a potted plant on the deck.<br><br>However, the wildlife around here is doing well, and do not need humans to artificially produce food for them. Furthermore, it is backbreaking labor to grow food, and why would someone accept such a loss? Is it because you don't really need the food and it's partly a hobby, albeit one you work hard at? That providing food for Stumpy and Fatso and having them around is fun? What if you had two children to feed and would actually eat less if you let too much of it go to the animals?<br>Perhaps it is different where you live, with wildlife being more rare. In general, though, any animal will multiply to the capacity of the environment to feed it, so if you spend your labor to feed wild animals, they will respond by increasing their numbers...a losing game, it seems to me.<br>Then, too, I am trying a method that someone here linked a video to, in which you do not till up the land constantly (as most of my acquaintances do) but instead leave a raised bed that gets the constant input of mulch to its top surface to improve soil and control weeds. If deer got in they would trample it up. Now, if a rabbit gets in under the fence once in a while, that would be okay.<br>Oh, yes, and you asked the question, who owns the land, me or the deer. Odd question - we both do! I have a right to live on this earth also. I look at property rights as mostly pertaining to other people. Animals are largely excused. Which means to me that while my presence might detract from their numbers a bit, it should not greatly wipe out their habitat and they should not be killed because I don't want them around. Nor do I have a right to damage/poison the land or ecosystem, whose "rights" go deeper than any particular society's agreements about land ownership, vis a vis humans. You mentioned fencing my farm.

I do not recall every having those conversations 30 years ago with my brother and ex, but I do recall over the years having some vague thoughts about the resource of oil, that came of their own accord whenever I might read about the millions of barrels of oil a day being used in just our country, I would think, How much oil is there, anyway? But that's as far as it went. And while I have not owned a TV for most of my life, nonetheless, I just don't seem to recall anyone being concerned with resource depletion, never took the Carter thing terribly seriously, nor did I ever hear about his solar panels before this blog. And the thing is, my personality is one which if I had had those concepts impressed on me in a CLEAR way, would have responded quickly, just as I have recently, as well as prior to Y2K and about earthquake preparedness when I lived in LA. I noted in Myriad's post about how bringing his wife's mind to a point of clarity on this issue took some time.

That is, are atheists more likely to feel bad about it? I believe that being stuck on this rock is a time limited sentence, that I will be released, and right now I am not in a hurry for that release.<br><br>I do care about the human story over time. I find the idea that we may not make progress, or perhaps may be prevented from making progress, very sad. By progress, I mean moral progress, mostly in the form of learning from our own history. And by prevented, I mean that I suspect that our earth is not the stable place we think it is, and that disasters come often enough that wipe out most of our memories. This is terribly sad and frustrating, as being able to carry on and communicate events to posterity is in the top two or three attributes that make us human and would have a lot to do with our being able to learn from the past.<br><br>But I also regard the human story as parallel to the larger reality, (which I will not call spiritual as there is only one reality) or embedded within the larger reality, and when one has a limited perspective things can seem very different than they actually are.<br><br>A simple example is the way that to all appearances the sun moves across the sky, and yet it is so easy to see the bigger reality with a good model of the solar system and an explanation. <br>It's odd to me that in the modern now, when we have so many such examples of the unseen and larger reality that materialistic worldviews are so entrenched with some groups.

Because if the following pics are any indication I would not be surprised if they had at least the most essential parts machined from semi-passable steel."<br><br>I think I mentioned earlier, that isn't a matter of necessity but of convenience and cost-effectiveness. That is, it makes far more sense for those artisans to go that route if they can get those parts, but we know perfectly well that they don't <i>have</i> to from the highly accurate copies they were making in the nineteenth century and their even earlier, entirely home grown (apart from the basic idea, that the Portuguese brought to India), djezails.<br><br>"Kalashnikov design still assumed steel and machine tools. Could they be duplicated with wrought iron and basic smith tools?"<br><br>Well, no, it didn't, any more than it <i>assumed</i> chromium lining, which was practical in the U.S.S.R. But, just as other countries made serviceable copies without chromium lining in regular factories (they just needed more maintenance and/or wore out faster), so also the AK47 could easily be made in small workshops, though less cost effectively - because what its design <i>actually</i> assumed was inferior workmanship, the only kind that the U.S.S.R. could provide cheaply and in quantity (which was why it displaced the earlier, higher precision assault rifles). Steel was available in the Khyber Pass anyway, since trade brought it in, but even wrought iron would have done.<br><br>"Still I would have a lot of reservations about their reliability under duress".<br><br>That's a fair comment, but it only means that they were no better than "proper" AK47s, which <i>also</i> needed field repairs when that happened. U.S. soldiers in Vietnam were puzzled for a long time by why the Vietcong often had several mysterious short tubes with them; it eventually turned out that the pistons could buckle after heavy use, and these were the spares (at least the Vietcong didn't need to carry old toothbrushes to clean out their rifles' actions before a fire fight in jungle conditions, like U.S. soldiers).<br><br>"If you have enough industrial tools to make ammunition probably some to make at least the most essential parts should be available as well, in which case there should be no difficulties".<br><br>But you don't need industrial tools to make ammunition <i>either</i>; again, it just helps. You can make adequate ammunition with brazed sheet, hammered wire, cast bullets, and such, and none of those need industrial tools.<br><br>There is a bottleneck, though - the chemicals needed. So if trade can bring those in, it can bring in ammunition too. But it's easier to divert ammunition by buying it from corrupt soldiers or policemen, which is trickier with their personal weapons as it's harder for them to hide the loss.<br><br><a href=#c4335296879389695456 title="comment permalink">5/25/14, 2:40 AM</a><br><br>

My conflation is quite deliberate. The sole purpose of the archery laws was to provide a body of trained men to call upon in time of war. No other purpose. The fact that not everyone who practiced at the butts was drafted didn't change that."<br><br>That's why I told you you'd taken your eye off the ball. Your rebuttal is 100% factually accurate, but entirely irrelevant.<br><br>Yes, that's <i>why</i> people were made to train like that. <i>However</i>, that doesn't flow through to giving them a motive for not training, because it wouldn't have saved them from having to go to war anyway if they were able bodied. The training was compulsory, and it was better to do it than to be punished. Going to war was compulsory, it was better to do it than to be punished, and at least valuable fighting men had more chance of loot and survival than grooms left to guard the baggage. Further, there was at least a chance that training wouldn't be followed by war, whereas not training was certain to be bad.<br><br>"The villagers, at any rate, had access to the magnitude of the hazards of war, though townsmen might not. In a village of 200 people you can know everyone by name, and probably half of them pretty well. If a dozen men march off to war one fine spring day and only two or three return the next winter, everyone knows. In a town, it's easier to remain ignorant of the size of the risk."<br><br>No, for several reasons:-<br><br>- <i>Nobody</i> "return[ed] the next winter" anyway, unless there were very special circumstances. They were there for the duration or until something happened, so they spent the winter in winter quarters.<br><br>- Even when somebody never came back at all, it could also be because he had grown rich directly or joined a mercenary company to get rich; a lot of those would never go back to peasant life ("how are you going to keep them down on the farm, once they have seen Par-e-e-e..."). The villagers would only have known the odds if they saw Johnny come marching home the other way; that was routine when the regiments of regular armies were partly disbanded in peace time in later centuries, because they were usually brought home first so they could be split up safely in barracks into those to keep and those to muster out, but this was a feudal host with a seasoning of mercenary contracts. (Trivia: if Napoleon's diplomatic efforts hadn't helped the U.S.A. to attack Britain, the soldiers brought back from North America would mostly have already been disbanded right after Napoleon was sent to Elba and wouldn't have been returning to Europe in time to be available for the Waterloo Campaign.)<br><br><a href=#c1661988195537149073 title="comment permalink">5/28/14, 4:41 AM</a><br><br>

English archers were quite effective earlier at Falkirk. The failures at Stirling Bridge and Bannockburn, despite large numbers of archers available seem due to the commander's haste, or inadequate knowledge of their strengths and weakness and the right tactics to use them. Even after they got it right a few times, Patay showed what happens to unsupported archers. One could chalk this up to an uneven learning curve on the part of the English commanders. I would say it was a combination of luck, the crude state of military intelligence in the Middle Ages and the competence or lack thereof of individual commanders. Edward I for instance, pulled the fat out of the fire at Falkirk by over-riding his commanders and using the archers to soften up the schiltroons."<br><br>But all those things were just precisely what I meant, when I put that the <i>tactics</i> were not up to it until a little later, that others' tactics prevailed. <i>Of course</i> the proximate cause could be "the commander's haste, or inadequate knowledge of their strengths and weakness and the right tactics to use them.

The relevance of those conquests wasn't that the English kings learned anything <i>there</i> - they were barely ever there, the closest being a period Prince John spent there - but rather that those conquests created a strategic need to secure the coast of South Wales, so there was even more campaigning in Wales over and above what came from having troubled border marches.<br><br>"From at least the time of the Danelaw, Archery was a living tradition in all forested areas of England, Wales and Scotland. It was enabled by a culture and economy that made it a usefull skill."<br><br>Up to a point, Lord Copper. And that point wasn't one where there were all that many archers; we can see that from the way it just wasn't around in comparable numbers in England <i>until it was promoted</i>, or in Scotland at all. (Yes, there is indeed an old tradition of archery in Scotland - dating back to when it was used as a sporting cover for Jacobite training, plotting and gathering, much as English Jacobites tried to use horse races.) <i>Wales</i>, though, was different. It was an area into which holdouts had been driven, and only had a very few areas suitable for settled agriculture - at any rate, without development and a continuing threat of raids. The upper Severn valley could be controlled by the Welsh from the mountains around, as could the northern parts of several valleys in the south, the coast in the west was somewhat safe from the English (who could still get there by sea and from their holdings in "little England beyond Wales", where the port for Ireland was), and Anglesey provided a granary for the Princes of Wales in the north. Apart from that, though, the only available lifestyle was semi-pastoral, dog and stick farming, moving around a lot - and supplemented by hunting, which couldn't be controlled by the government as in England, if the Princes even wanted to.<br><br>So you are perfectly correct <i>where the conditions obtained</i>; but that means, for Wales.<br><br><a href=#c6315265126322866581 title="comment permalink">5/28/14, 4:43 AM</a><br><br>

They didn't jump, they were pushed. We know that because we have the historical record of the Enclosures of the Commons that started the pushing, which further tells us that they mostly didn't leave until that happened, in the Tudor period, much later than the time we are looking at.<br><br>What mostly happened after the Black Death etc. was, an increase in the cash economy, with feudal obligations changing into cash ones, people leaving plots of land for rural cash activities like charcoal burning, and so on. But it was slow, and mostly started at the higher levels first. Its effect was that even those who stayed were less locked down.<br><br>It wasn't the leaving the land that was the big change for supporting archery, it was that the <i>constraints</i> were looser because they <i>could</i> leave the land and/or move to other land. By Elizabethan times, with its economic repairs, things were more like your pull scenario - but the change was pretty much accomplished by then.<br><br>"The thumb release tends to deflect the string the opposite way from the Mediterranean release, so I was thinking of releasing the arrow off the right side of the bow rather than the left".<br><br>I've somewhere seen a description of a design feature of properly made arrows, no doubt discovered empirically as something that worked rather than as something that was understood. The natural force after release is towards the rest of the bow, and a rigid stick would bounce off it. However, the shaft has just the right flexibility in relation to the mass of the head, so first the middle of the shaft buckles outward and begins to clear the bow - and then, as the fletching approaches the bow, the shaft flexes the other way and keeps that clear of the bow too, even though the arrow's centre of gravity moves in a straight line.<br><br>So I suspect the release deflection matters less than how well the arrow behaves dynamically.<br><br><a href=#c487139797123871570 title="comment permalink">5/28/14, 4:44 AM</a><br><br>

I also was there.<br><br>It is no exaggeration to say that American's choice to turn against conservation and the habit of self reliance was a great tragedy. At that time, people who had grown up knowing how to do for themselves where still alive and able to pass on their skills and knowledge. Yes, you can still learn much from books and manuals, but much knowledge that was particular to specific climates and locations has been lost. <br><br>To add to what was said earlier, I remember, beginning in the early 1980s, a strong media assault on any kind of doing for oneself. which was coming from both right and left. RW local notables, the for runners of the Tea Partiers of today, had always hated the hippy and back to the land movements because those folks didn't spend. No hair done at a salon every week, no purchases at their wives' fancy boutiques, and a commune might maintain one aged vehicle, not a separate used car for every member. Retail grocers don't make a whole lot of profit off monthly purchases of bags of rice and beans.<br><br>Up until about the middle 80s, women could still wear homemade garments (well made and not violating the dress code) to work. At the present time, if you try, you are likely to be fired from white collar jobs for lack of professionalism, and subjected to some pretty extreme harassment at blue collar workplaces. Up until about the late 90s, home baked treats were still welcome in public schools, now they are not allowed in most schools and illegal in some places. We all know the dim view Home Owners Associations and city and county code enforcers take of home gardens (don't even mention keeping small livestock).<br><br>I raised two girls mostly be myself, without public assistance, which I declined to accept, mainly because I simply did not respect the social workers I met, by practicing some pretty extreme conservation. I was bucking public opinion all the way and if I were not a solitary, reading kind of person, I doubt I would have been at all successful, and instead of being employed good citizens, which both my girls now are, they would likely have become casualties of "the street" has did so many other teens in the 90s and00s.<br><br>I don't mean to imply that there was some kind of closed doors evil conspiracy to turn Americans from productive people to idiot couch potatoes, but it is true that mass advertising and mass media exist, not only to sell products, but also to establish and portray the limits of what is to be considered socially acceptable.<br><br><a href=#c797241134507271499 title="comment permalink">6/6/14, 6:33 AM</a><br><br>

(More on fossil fuels later).<br><br>Reason #2 - We're not using as much water as we thought we would be in the 60's and 70's!<br>Maybe so. Nevertheless, we're running short. Many rivers in arid regions no longer reach the sea, pumped dry for irrigation. Aquifer levels are falling worldwide. Solar-powered desalination would help things, if it could be made to work on a large enough scale. We'll have to wait and see.<br><br>Reason #3 - We'll get plenty of oil from fracking!<br>Well... yes. For a while. Fracking does indeed extract oil that can't be gotten any other way. However, it has a much lower EROEI (energy return on energy investment) than "conventional" oil, partly because the fracking process takes considerable energy and partly because fracking wells tend to go dry quickly, meaning you have to go drill another one in a couple of years. It'll pad the downslope of the Hubbert curve, is all.<br><br>Reason #4 - There's still lots of minerals, even if they aren't in conventional ores/deposits. We can just re-concentrate them!<br>...which takes energy. For which, see reason #3 concerning fossil fuels. Wind and solar electricity are yielding a reasonable amount of energy in some places... but not enough to replace fossil fuels, not for this kind of thing. <br><br>Reason #5: People that have money don't damage ecosystems, because they use electricity/fossil fuels instead of burning wood and hunting meat.<br>See #3 again. We have fossil fuels now, and will have them for a while at an ever-increasing cost, but ultimately it's a limited supply. Wind, solar, tide, geothermal, etc., however, could probably be of considerable help here, along with suitable agricultural techniques.<br><br><br>Also, another argument that he makes (in the original article) is somewhat flawed. He claims that we can just keep reducing the amount of materials that items use, citing things like cars now using much less steel than in previous decades, and gold plating in modern computer connections being 1/100th the thickness it was in early computers. But there has to be a limit to the amount of "trimming-down" that can be done. And using less or cheaper material when making an item tends to reduce that item's cost, which means more people can afford it, so more of it is produced, which means ultimately that more of the raw materials get used. You can confirm this by looking at production figures for pretty much any raw material you can think of. This isn't at all my field (I'm in college working towards a bachelor's in music), but it's interesting and I might write a full-out report on it sometime.<br><br>Now, I think this guy's argument is not totally without its merit. Sometimes, human activity does actually contribute to the natural environment, making it more productive than it would otherwise have been, and all the local species benefit. And it's true that people have come up with amazing inventions in the past. So it's possible that some space-bat solution will actually bear fruit (nuclear fusion, zero-point energy, etc.), but it's also foolish to base your worldview and future plans around some invention that has yet to materialize.<br><br><a href=#c5914546022639279725 title="comment permalink">6/8/14, 3:26 PM</a><br><br>

Sheesh! From bought and paid for American bloggers and so-called reporters I expect this kind of idiocy. I had thought better of well educated Germans.<br><br>It is hard to not overreact to this kind of egregious stupidity, but did I actually read that raising one's own children is now to be defined as "home production"? !!!<br><br>The article does lay out, in much more bare terms than I usually see, the leftist hostility to home production.<br><br>In response, I assert that private frugality is a public virtue for many reasons.<br><br>a. People with money saved are less apt to become desperate and turn to crime and violence when disaster strikes.<br><br>b. Practice of thrift increases your personal security and that of your family--if the car won't start, you have cash to get it repaired immediately--with salutary results for your and their mental health and stability. If a hurricane approaches, you can afford to remove to a nice motel instead of crowded shelter.<br><br>d. In contrast, the habit of foolish spending--not the occasional indulgence, but daily leakage--has a visibly deleterious effect on a person's health and character.<br><br>c. Thrift is also good for your community, because you can afford to support and patronize local producers--good people doing good work. If I cook at home 362 days a year, I can take my daughters out to a high end restaurant where the staff are trained and well paid and the food is locally sourced.<br><br>d. Thrift is also good for your nation, because accumulated savings can be used to fund useful production.<br><br>With respect to child care, I suggest that your children will benefit far more from a good, well-run day care facility than from having some sullen, semi-educated nanny in your home. Not to mention, that when there is a rash of home invasion robberies, it is often found that information was passed to gangs by domestic workers within the affected homes. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c1584317479027325955 title="comment permalink">6/9/14, 9:16 AM</a><br><br>

There was a dramatic difference in attitude towards renewables between the Carter and the Reagan administrations. Carter wanted the government to subsidize renewables, Reagan did not. But idea that large amounts of fossil fuel would have been saved for future generations had Carter won and continued those subsides is doubtful. One telling sign is Japan, there’s no industrial country more desperate for energy than Japan. Japan imports *all* of her oil, yet Japan also wasn’t able to develop renewables to any significant extent in the eighties and nineties. The obvious reason for this is the one I mentioned before - cheap oil. Since Japan is far more dependent on imported energy than the US, we should have seen a movement towards sustainability begin there before any place else, but we didn’t. Why not? The choice to move towards sustainability didn’t happen anywhere in the 1980’s or 1990’s, even in countries where it made more sense. So does it really make any sense to single out Americans for not making the choice?<br><br><a href=#c1707041276519827042 title="comment permalink">6/9/14, 7:31 PM</a><br><br>

I often say that there is a reason that the cost of a Super Bowl commercial is $4 million per 30-second commercial - that's $133,000 a second, BTW - and that # doesn't include the millions it costs to create/produce the actual ad. The reason is....advertising works. It works (not always, but amazingly well). It works for companies, and it works for politicians. <br><br>I believe few people are conscious enough to avoid being influenced by advertising (if, like me, you don't watch TV, it helps tremendously). Image advertising is among the most potent, and the most frequent. At age 48, I do remember the change-over from the 70s to the 80s...and the 80s seemed to give rise to more image-based lifestyles. <br><br>And one more thing, Nastarana - I also remember when it was not uncommon for a woman to sew (and to save money doing so....) And then I think of my cousin who lives in Seattle who recently went to a preschool birthday party and came home, called me, and said "Every woman there was dressed in at least $1,000 worth of clothes."

When not camping, I might leave it outside to store whole wheat flour, unfiltered vegetable oils and other items that spoil eventually if not refrigerated.

The idea of a fold up unit is neat but how often would you use that. Plus I am a bit wary of their claims particularly with regard to the solar panel bit.<br><br>The dimensions given work out to an outside volume of about 77 quarts. With reasonably insulation thickness of 1 inch, that corresponds to an internal volume of about 50 quarts. <br><br>However I would be more worried about relying on solar power. The images of the solar panels suggest an area of about 300 square inches which could give a maximum of around 35 watts with high efficiency solar cells and with the Sun directly overhead. Unless you keep adjusting the tilt of the box for best angle you are only likely to make around 175 watt hours per average day at the best. (Maybe a little more in summer). Tilting the box may give you 50% more. Plus with the solar panels built into the lid, the box has to be out in the direct sunshine where it will get hot require even better insultation. Dark blue is not the best colour either. And forget about leaving it in the shade in your vehicle or tent - no power. <br><br>A commercial camping refrigerator of about that volume would typically use around 300 watt hours per day to keep the contents around 36 F or 4 C when kept in the shade. Of course you can leave this new version plugged in to a power supply (240 or 12 V) but that rather negates the solar power idea. <br><br>There are much cheaper options for keeping some picnic stuff cool, and I really doubt its ability to serve a serious long term use away from a power supply. You would be better off getting a good quality standard camping refrigerator to keep in the shade with a separate reasonably sized solar panel and battery to put out in the Sun. It is likely to last longer and the bugs should be ironed out of it.<br><br>I don't see it as a long term Green solution.<br><br><a href=#c6597002956621865181 title="comment permalink">6/17/14, 7:31 PM</a><br><br>
