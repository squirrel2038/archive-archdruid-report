I'm delighted to report that my deindustrial novel <i>Star's Reach</i>, which appeared in episodes as a blog between 2009 and late last year, is <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2014/04/new-release-stars-reach-by-john-michael.html> now available in print and ebook formats</a> from Founders House Publishing. I've suggested here more than once that narratives are among the most important tools we have for understanding and shaping the future; from that perspective, <i>Star's Reach</i> is a contribution to imagining a future that isn't locked inside the Hobson's choice between business as usual and overnight catastrophe that's frozen into place in the collective imagination of our time. If a story of adventure and alien contact in 25th-century neomedieval America appeals to you, you might want to give it a read!</div>

Stars Reach did not inspire me as a world I would want to be living in, but it was a beautiful story. It's heartfelt and absolutely captivating! The way you wove the narrative back and forth across time was brilliant and the end brought a tear to my eye. It actually mirrored an experience I had in a research library years ago from the opposite side, taking a book off of a shelf and holding history in my hands. <br><br>I was so thankful that I didn't discover it until late last year as waiting for chapters year after year would have been absolute torture. I will be getting a copy as soon as the budget allows. I want it in my library and I'm curious about the final form it took. <br><br>I can't help but think it will be a huge success if only people know about it. Mention the places it is for sale and I will seek it out to give a glowing review. Thank you for this gift of many hours of pure pleasure and suspense!<br><br><a href=#c5881956259081969191 title="comment permalink">4/20/14, 9:08 AM</a><br><br>

A few voices ask the big question of how much energy in for how much energy out.<br><br><a href=#c6897483018638867682 title="comment permalink">4/21/14, 12:54 AM</a><br><br>

Many thanks!<br><br>Philip, thank you. <br><br>Lothar, you'll want to look up the very substantial psychological literature on <i>folie a deux</i>. As for peak oil, in the novel it's a long way in the past, but yes, it's there. <br><br>Carl, thank you!<br><br>MawKernewek, I'm delighted to hear about the Welsh novel! I've long had a desire (which I don't expect ever to see fulfilled) to see some of my books translated and published in the Celtic languages. <br><br>Dwig, that's a fine idea. My usual internet person has started a Yahoo group, starsreach@yahoogroups.com; you can subscribe to it <a href=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/starsreach/info rel=nofollow>at this URL</a>, or simply by sending an email message asking to subscribe to starsreach-subscribe@yahoogroups.com. Memberships have to be approved, to keep spam artists at bay, so it may take a bit for your subscription to be approved -- still, it's faster than sending a letter by canal boat to Cago...<br><br>Darren, exactly. Nobody's talking about where the energy is going to come from -- because if they did, they'd have to face the fact that it's not going to come from anywhere at all. <br><br>Robert, thank you!

This was before I learned (from various ADR comments) that you're well versed in John Crowley's works. And before I got accustomed to that species of synchronicity being par for the course around here.<br><br>I have a print copy on the way. I wish a hardcover were available.<br><br>If this is the literary success it had (from reading the first two thirds) the potential to be, I'll be recommending it and/or gifting it to a number of people and groups who I think will appreciate it.<br><br>The appeal for me (as I see it now, pending reading the rest and more careful review) is that there have been thousands of novels about the aftermath of nuclear or environmental devastation, but few of them are physically realistic and even fewer allow their characters to fully inhabit their worlds. The rest indulge in being "cautionary" and yes, I mean that as a negative, because it invariably means the characters are too busy demonstrating (if not outright preaching) what we shouldn't'a or should'a done back here in their past, to believably live their own lives on their own terms.<br><br>In the portion I read online, only one brief scene in <i>Star's Reach</i> strayed into something like traditional "cautionary" territory. I'll not spoil anything here, but I think most readers will recognize the scene I refer to and agree that it stands out, even though most will probably disagree that it's any kind of flaw. (A discussion for a later time, perhaps, if I haven't changed my mind by then.)<br><br><a href=#c8070129588696656185 title="comment permalink">4/22/14, 1:02 PM</a><br><br>

As for discipline, well, you learn that if you've ever done magical training! <br><br>Varun, that's good to hear. My guess is that once the fracking bubble pops, peak oil is going to be all over the place for a couple of years, before the next round of delusions covers it up for a while. <br><br>Myriad, I'll be interested to hear which scene that was.

That's purely an aesthetic judgment (and as I said, one I expect others will likely disagree with), based only on the online text.<br><br>More important is the vaster background that that scene stood out against, a world that's not pretty but radiates a profound beauty that emerges from its honesty.<br><br>I think I'll be able to manage more worthwhile comments a week or two from now, after I've read the entire final version.<br><br><a href=#c8666776339229245082 title="comment permalink">4/24/14, 10:55 AM</a><br><br>
