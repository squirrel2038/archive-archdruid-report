<div class=MsoNormal>
I've noticed, over the past few years, a growing lack of enthusiasm in the formerly raucous festivities that once marked the end of one year and the beginning of another. That was certainly in evidence last night in our old red brick mill town here in the eastern end of the Rust Belt. As my wife and I clicked glasses together, the night outside was hushed. It was as though all the people who were grateful to see 2013 hauled away to the glue factory suddenly realized that the new year might well be worse.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m not sure why I didn’t share in the general gloom. When you live in a decaying empire that’s trying to meet the rising costs of its short-term survival by selling its own grandchildren down the river, contemplating the future that results from that choice isn’t exactly a recipe for hilarity, and making a career out of writing about that future might seem like a good way to meet each new year in a profound depression or a drunken stupor, take your pick. Still, that hasn’t been the case for me. Maybe it’s that I came to terms with the reality of our civilization’s impending decline back in the 1970s, when you could still talk about such things in public without being shouted down by true believers in perpetual progress and instant apocalypse, the Tweedledoom and Tweedledee of our collective non-conversation about the future; whatever the cause, I waved hello to the New Year and sipped a glass of bourbon in relatively good cheer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There was at least one extraneous reason for that cheer. One of my solstice presents this year was a lively little book, <i>Mysteries and Lore of Western Maryland</i> by local author Susan Fair. Most parts of the United States have at least one book like it, collecting the ghost stories, spooky tales, and weird creatures of the area, and this one is a good and highly readable example of the species.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Reading it took me back to some of the least wretched hours of my childhood, when I found refuge from a disintegrating family, and a school life marred by American education’s culture of mediocrity and bullying, by chasing down anything that made the walls of the world press a little less closely against me on all sides. Monster lore played a significant role in that process, and so I was delighted, in reading Fair’s book, to make the acquaintance of one of the local “fearsome critters,” the snallygaster. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Any of my readers who happen to be adept in American monster folklore will no doubt be leaping for their keyboards to tell me that the same word’s spelled “snoligoster” or “snollygoster” elsewhere. Yes, I know; it’s different here. (In western Maryland, for reasons I haven’t yet deciphered, the letter A is more popular than its rival vowels; the Native American name for the local mountain range, written out as “Allegheny” everywhere else, is spelled “Allegany” here and rhymes with “rainy.”) The snallygaster, as I was saying, was a dragonlike creature with huge wings, a long pointed tail, a single eye in the middle of its forehead, and octopuslike tentacles that dangled behind it as it flew.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This remarkable apparition was apparently all over western Maryland in 1909, and then again in 1932; during both flaps, the newspapers splashed the story all over the front page of issue after issue, and everyone in the region seems to have known someone who knew someone who knew someone who just missed seeing it. Even when it met its end—it drowned, according to newspaper reports, after falling into a 2500-gallon vat of illegal whiskey in the notorious local moonshiner’s haven of Frog Hollow—its presence was evanescent:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>its body dissolved in the liquor, and the government agents who were raiding the operation when the snallygaster met its doom proceeded to break open the vat and spill the contents, rather than bottling and selling what would surely have been the most unique beverage ever produced by the region’s less-than-legal distilling industry. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Snallygasters thus share in the most important characteristic of the “fearsome critters” of American monster folklore:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>everybody knows about them, but you’ll never actually meet anybody who’s seen one. That characteristic isn’t unique to monsters. It also features in the peak oil scene, and in particular in one of the more common habits of that scene, especially though not only around this time of year. That’s as much justification as you’ll get for the cameo appearance of snallygasters in this week’s post—well, beyond the fact that snallygasters, and local folklore generally, deserve more attention than they usually get these days—because it’s mostly these habits that I want to talk about this week. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The weeks to either side of January 1 each year, as regular readers of peak oil blogs will have noted long since, are festooned with predictions about what’s going to happen in the year to come. That habit’s not limited to the peak oil scene, to be sure, but a curious feature is shared by many peak oil blogs: the prophecies that pop up during this annual orgy of prognostication are quite often the same ones that appeared the previous year, and the year before that, and so on back as far as the archives go. Most of those predictions, furthermore, flopped—that is, the events so confidently predicted did not happen within the time frame the prediction assigned them—but reflections on that awkward reality in these same blogs are about as rare as snallygasters singing duets in your back yard. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s high time for this bad habit to get drowned in a tub of moonshine once and for all. Those of us who talk about peak oil and the other troubles closing in on contemporary industrial civilization have precisely one thing to offer that deserves the attention of anybody else—that our ideas, and the predictions we base on them, might help others figure out what’s happening to the world around them at a time when more familiar ways of thinking aren’t providing useful guidance. If our predictions are no more accurate than those of raving maniacs, mainstream economists, and the like, nobody has any reason to listen to us. In point of fact, I’ve come to think that one of the most important reasons why the peak oil movement is all but dead in the water these days is that too many people outside it have read too many rehashes of the same failed predictions too many times, and decided that peak oil writers simply don’t know what they’re talking about. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d like to suggest that the lack of attention paid by peak oil authors to the failure rate of their predictions has contributed heartily to that reaction. For this reason, before I review the predictions I made in
<a href=../../2013/01/into-unknown-country.html>my first post of 2013</a> and offer some new ones for the year that’s just begun, I’m going to take a moment to discuss predictions of mine that flopped, and what I’ve learned from those flops. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first of my failed predictions has evaded my attempts to find it in this blog’s archives, but it appeared sometime in 2007 or 2008, if I recall correctly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I noted the skyrocketing price of oil, surveyed the claims then being made by other peak oil writers that it would just keep on zooming up forever, and argued instead that it would plateau and then decline over the course of the next few decades. I was, of course, quite wrong, but so were the people whose ideas I was challenging; the price of crude oil spiked up to just shy of $150 a barrel and then crashed at once, plunging to not much more than a fifth of that figure, before resuming a ragged upwards movement to its present level just north of $100 a barrel. The raw volatility of the oil market blindsided me, as it did many others; it was an embarrassing lesson, and one that’s shaped my efforts to estimate oil price movements since that time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second appeared in several of my posts and responses to comments in 2009 and 2010. At that time, I was convinced that Barack Obama would be a one-term president.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was inconceivable to me that the Democrats who spent eight years in a state of spit-slinging fury at George W. Bush’s war crimes, abuses of civil liberties, and huge giveaways to big corporations, would fall all over themselves finding excuses for the identical actions performed by Barack Obama. It was also inconceivable to me that the Republicans, faced with the weakest Democratic incumbent in many decades, would ransack the nation to find a candidate the American people would like even less.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of course that’s exactly what happened; a great many Democrats demonstrated with painful clarity that the respect for civil liberties and the rule of law they paraded so loudly during the Bush years was simply a cover for the usual partisan hatreds, while the Republican party showed just as clearly how detached it’s become from those Americans—a substantial majority, by the way—who don’t belong to the handful of isolated pressure groups whose vagaries currently shape GOP policy. We haven’t yet had another national election, but I can assure my readers that I won’t be making those mistakes again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The third appeared in several posts in late 2011 and early 2012, as the hoopla around the fake-Mayan 2012 prophecy was shifting into high gear. I thought, based on historical parallels, that 2012 might turn out to be an apocalyptic frenzy for the record books, with crowds of believers gathering on hilltops to wait for December 21 to dawn and watch the Space Brothers land, or what have you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That didn’t happen; quite the contrary, in the weeks just prior to December 21, quite a few of the big names in the 2012 scene started backpedaling on their previous insistence that some worldchanging event would surely happen that day. I’ve factored that curious turn of events into my thinking about the next big apocalyptic furore—of which more shortly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The fourth appeared last February in <a href=../../2013/02/the-end-of-shale-bubble.html>one of my posts on the current fracking bubble</a>. At that time, for a variety of reasons, I thought that the financial bubble that’s inflated around shale oil in the last few years was within a few months of a messy collapse. I remain convinced that it’s going to pop—bubbles always do, and the fracking business has all the classic signs of a speculative bubble, from the bellowing about a new era of prosperity right around the corner all the way down to the dodgy financial underpinnings—but I was obviously wrong about the timing; the month before, I’d suggested 2014 as a likely date for the inevitable crash, and I should have stuck with that estimate. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So those are the four failed predictions of mine I recalled while glancing back over the nearly eight years this blog has been in existence. There may have been others that I missed—if so, I encourage my readers to bring them up on the comments page and we’ll talk about them. Such mistakes are all but impossible to avoid when discussing something as elusive as the future, and archdruids are no more infallible than anyone else; in fact, the late head of a different Druid order once promulgated an official Dogma of Archdruidical Fallibility to declare in formal terms that he was going to make mistakes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We don’t have any dogmas at all in the Druid order I head, but the principle still applies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With that cautionary note in mind, let’s turn to the predictions I made at the beginning of 2013 about the year ahead. Here they are: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I thus predict that just as 2012 looked like a remake of 2011 a little further down the curve of decline, 2013 will look a good deal like 2012, but with further worsening along the same broad array of trends and yet another round of local crises and regional disasters. The number of billion-dollar weather disasters will tick up further, as will the number of Americans who have no job—though, to be sure, the official unemployment rate and other economic statistics will be gimmicked then as now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The US dollar, the Euro, and the world’s stock markets will still be in business at year’s end, and there will still be gas for sale in gas stations, groceries for sale in grocery stores, and more people interested in the Super Bowl than in global warming or peak oil, as 2013 gives way to 2014. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“As the year unfolds, I’d encourage my readers to watch the fracking bubble...I don’t expect the bubble to pop this year—my best guess at this point is that that’ll happen in 2014—but it’s already losing air as the ferocious decline rates experienced by fracked oil and gas wells gnaw the bottom out of the fantasy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Expect the new year to bring more strident claims of the imminent arrival of a shiny new future of energy abundance, coupled with a steady drumbeat of bad financial news suggesting, in essence, that the major players in that end of the oil and gas industry are well and truly fracked. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’d also encourage my readers to watch the climate...Most of the infrastructure of industrial society was built during the period of abnormally good weather we call the twentieth century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>A fair amount of it, as New York subway riders have had reason to learn, is poorly designed to handle extreme weather, and if those extremes become normal, the economics of maintaining such complex systems as the New York subways in the teeth of repeated flooding start to look very dubious indeed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I don’t expect to see significant movements out of vulnerable coastal areas quite yet, but if 2011’s Hurricane Irene and 2012’s Hurricane Sandy turn out to have a bouncing baby sibling who decides to pay a visit to the Big Apple in 2013, 2014 might see the first businesses relocating further inland, perhaps to the old mill towns of the southern Hudson valley and the eastern end of Pennsylvania, perhaps further still.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s speculative. What isn’t speculative is that all the trends that have been driving the industrial world down the arc of the Long Descent are still in play, and so are all the parallel trends that are pushing America’s global empire along its own trajectory toward history’s dustbin<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those things haven’t changed; even if anything <i>could</i> be done about them, which is far from certain, nothing <i>is</i> being done about them; indeed, outside of a handful of us on the fringes of contemporary culture, nobody is even talking about the possibility that something might need to be done about them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That being the case, it’s a safe bet that the trends I’ve sketched out will continue unhindered, and give us another year of the ordinary phenomena of slowly accelerating decline and fall.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The bouncing baby sibling of Hurricanes Irene and Sandy didn’t put in an appearance, and so the first tentative shifts of businesses and population inland from the vulnerable Atlantic coast will have to wait a few more years. Other than that, I think it’s fair to say that once again, I called it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
My prediction for 2014, in turn, is that we’ll see more of the same:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>another year, that is, of uneven but continued downward movement along the same arc of decline and fall, while official statistics here in the United States will be doctored even more extravagantly than before to manufacture a paper image of prosperity. The number of Americans trying to survive without a job will continue to increase, the effective standard of living for most of the population will continue to decline, and what used to count as the framework of ordinary life in this country will go on unraveling a thread at a time. Even so, the dollar, the Euro, the stock market, and the Super Bowl will still be functioning as 2015 begins; there will still be gas in the gas pumps and food on grocery store shelves, though fewer people will be able to afford to buy either one. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The fracking bubble has more than lived up to last year’s expectations, filling the mass media with vast amounts of meretricious handwaving about the coming era of abundance:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>the same talk, for all practical purposes, that surrounded the equally delusional claims made for the housing bubble, the tech bubble, and so on all the way back to the Dutch tulip bubble of 1637. That rhetoric will prove just as dishonest as its predecessors, and the supposed new era of prosperity will come tumbling back down to earth once the bubble pops, taking a good chunk of the American economy with it. Will that happen in 2014? That’s almost impossible to know in advance. Timing the collapse of a bubble is one of the trickiest jobs in economic life; no less a mind than Isaac Newton’s was caught flatfooted by the collapse of the South Sea Bubble in 1720, and the current bubble is far more opaque. My guess is that the collapse will come toward the end of 2014, but it could have another year or so to run first.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably a safe bet that weather-related disasters will continue to increase in number and severity. If we get a whopper on the scale of Katrina or Sandy, watch the Federal response; it’s certain to fall short of meeting the needs of the survivors and their communities, but the degree to which it falls short will be a useful measure of just how brittle and weak the national government has become. One of these years—just possibly this year, far more likely later on—that weakness is going to become one of the crucial political facts of our time, and responses to major domestic disasters are among the few good measures we’ll have of how close we are to the inevitable crisis. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, what won’t happen is at least as important as what will. Despite plenty of enthusiastic pronouncements and no shortage of infomercials disguised as meaningful journalism, there will be no grand breakthroughs on the energy front. Liquid fuels—that is to say, petroleum plus anything else that can be thrown into a gas tank—will keep on being produced at something close to 2013’s rates, though the fraction of the total supply that comes from expensive alternative fuels with lower net energy and higher production costs will continue to rise, tightening a noose around the neck of every other kind of economic activity. Renewables will remain as dependent on government subsidies as they’ve been all along, nuclear power will remain dead in the water, fusion will remain a pipe dream, and more exotic items such as algal biodiesel will continue to soak up their quotas of investment dollars before going belly up in the usual way. Once the fracking bubble starts losing air, expect something else to be scooped up hurriedly by the media and waved around to buttress the claim that peak oil won’t happen, doesn’t matter, and so on; any of my readers who happen to guess correctly what that will be, and manage their investments accordingly, may just make a great deal of money. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Sudden world-ending catastrophes will also be in short supply in 2014, though talk about them will be anything but. The current vagaries of the apocalypse lobby probably deserve a post of their own; the short version is that another prediction of mine—that the failure of the fake-Mayan 2012 prophecy would very quickly be followed by the emergence of another date of supposedly imminent doom—has already come true, with knobs on. The new date is 2030; expect to see the same dubious logic, the same frantic cherrypicking of factoids, and the same mass production of different theories sharing only a common date, that played such important and disreputable roles in the 2012 fracas. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Since we’ve got more than a decade and a half to go before the next Nothing Happened Day arrives, there’s plenty of time for the marketing machine to get rolling before the snallygaster sings, and roll it will. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Both the grandiose breakthroughs that never happen and the equally gaudy catastrophes that never happen will thus continue to fill their current role as excuses not to think about, much less do anything about, what’s actually happening around us right now—the long ragged decline and fall of industrial civilization that I’ve called the Long Descent. Given the popularity of both these evasive moves, we can safely assume that one more thing won’t happen in 2014:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>any meaningful collective response to the rising spiral of crises that’s shredding our societies and our future. As before, anything useful that’s going to happen will be the work of individuals, families, and community groups, using the resources on hand to cope with local conditions. I’ve talked at great length here, and in several of my books, about some of the things that might go into such a response, and I won’t rehash that now; we’ll be talking about much of it from another perspective in the months ahead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s at least one other question about the immediate future that I plan on leaving up in the air for now, though, and it circles back to some of the points I made toward the start of this post. I’ve just noted the times in the past where my guesses about the future have been wrong, explained why they were wrong, and talked about what I learned from the experience. I then reviewed the predictions I made at the beginning of 2013, checked them against the facts, and used the results as a basis for my 2014 predictions. I’d like to encourage other writers and bloggers exploring peak oil, and the shape of the future more generally, to do the same thing right out here in public, review their successes and their flops, and talk about how their 2013 predictions worked out over the year just past. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On second thought, I think we can go further than that. Bloggers and writers in the peak oil community who make predictions, and expect those predictions to be taken seriously, owe it to their readers to subject their predictions to honest assessment once they can be compared to the facts. If it’s reasonable for us to talk about the failed predictions of cornucopians,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>fusion-power advocates, and the like, and of course it is, we need to be willing to ‘fess up to our own mistakes and learn from them, rather than just making them over and over again in the fond belief that nobody will notice. Those who indulge in this latter habit are doing active harm to the cause of peak oil awareness, and it’s high time that the rest of us start pointing out that they’re not offering useful insights into the future—just engaging in a hackneyed form of science fiction useful for entertainment purposes only. </div>

I'll have to dig back through my own blog to see if I've made rash predictions.

The outcomes were as different as can be in tone and content – the reasoned argument full of short-term pessimism (though nothing apocalyptic!) and the tarot reading full of long-term affirmation – but I could stand by each of them equally.

Dropping sanctions is the quickest and easiest way to increase world oil supplies and moderate prices.<br><br>- internal conflict will restrict oil exports from a major oil supplier. I do not think 2014 is the year of the Arab Spring in Saudi Arabia (I think the spark will be lack of electricity one summer).<br><br>- The four nuclear reactors under construction in the USA will have their schedule slip by 3 months and price rise by a couple of hundred million. This is actually good news, since these delays and cost overruns are so moderate. TVA will wait till 2015 to commit to another nuke. 2015/16 will see another southern utility commit to build a new nuke.<br><br>- USA and fracked oil production will increase in 2014, but growth will be higher in the first half than the second half.

EscapefromWisconsin of the Hipcrime Vocab, who reads and comments here from time to time, posted a list last year of predictions from a major peak oil whose blog comes out on Monday morning that are (or in some cases, were) in the process of coming true. Here it is:<br><br>Cities grew faster than suburbs for the first time in a hundred years.<br><br>New housing starts are down indicating a floundering suburbia (they're now up from the 2011 trough, but still lower than during the entire 25 years from 1983 and 2008).<br><br>Malls are being abandoned from coast to coast and new construction is down (a year latert, mall vacancy is down from the 2011 peak, but still higher than any time during the 17 years between 1993 and 2009).<br><br>Gas is very expensive, even in a depressed economy.<br><br>Americans are driving less, and the trend is significantly down.<br><br>The average age of cars on the road hit an all-time high.<br><br>There have been furtive attempts to get high speed rail going.<br><br>At least some global trade is reverting to sail.<br><br>The Eurozone is still a basket case.<br><br>Doctors are now concerned about viruses being spread to more temperate regions by global warming.<br><br>Municipal bankruptcies are endemic.<br><br>Graduate school students are dropping out and taking up farming.<br>Americans are increasingly subscribing to a demon-haunted world of a young earth created by God from scratch, and a medieval world view of social relations.<br><br>All in all, not a bad set of predictions coming true.

Obviously the empty political rhetoric would be different, but what major policy differences would they have? <br><br>My best guess is that the Democrats are a conservative party in the narrow sense of "not wanting things to change" and will generally make decisions that tend to preserve the status quo, with maybe a few minor changes on the outside to try to get the system to work slightly better (perhaps they try to improve Obamacare somewhat while still placating their donors, or slightly expand the welfare system while slightly reducing the military, or slightly increase taxes on the rich, or decide to legalize marijuana federally, etc). <br><br>The Republicans, on the other hand, strike me as the party of change I can actually believe in. Motivated by actual beliefs, they might substantially reduce food stamps and other forms of welfare, which could cause marked civil instability. It seems to be lost on their ideologues that the Arab Spring, and a number of other revolutionary waves before it, get started because of sudden food insecurity. Government spending could also be slashed in such a way as to disproportionately affect infrastructure, education, healthcare, or science while skipping over things like corporate handouts and military spending, which may cause collapse to happen artificially quickly, especially if any more unnecessary wars are started while the cuts are in place.<br><br>I tend to support Democrats over Republicans mostly because I believe they are likely to bring about a somewhat slower collapse with somewhat less human suffering than the Republican alternative. Within the current American political system, is this a rational belief or not?<br><br><a href=#c5541631710075851753 title="comment permalink">1/1/14, 10:35 PM</a><br><br>

I mean decades beyond what would seem sustainable. I started wondering in the 1980s how housing prices could keep going up once the average person could no longer afford the average house. But the financial system found ways to make it happen, for another two decades. The consumer credit bubble has still not really burst; amazingly it actually survived the housing bubble's bursting, and has begun reinflating. I suspect (fear) that the same thing might happen with the fracking boom. <br><br>Overall, I think we have entered a long series of years in which Nothing Happens. Of course a lot happens, but it is just a continuation of what has been happening, and mostly the annoying bits, with creeping creaky slow disintegration. Like the bubbles, the status quo has incredible inertia. Its gradual unravelling is so well concealed that most folks hardly notice it as it is happening. And I also see that the rapid shifts in the zeitgeist that do happen often catch the pundits off guard.

Right or wrong, beliefs, prejudices and angles of perception are being protected by louder and louder harangues and threats.

As the attendant alienation becomes more overt, possibilities of violence and anti-social behavior escalate as well. We're going to see a lot more "bad acting" by "bad actors". It is also my theory that those who invest in ego-defense the most vociferously will make very poor co-operators, which is going to be key in closer-knit and smaller communities. As we [very gradually] commence to these smaller states of social decision-making, securing a "decent life" that includes a modicum of socially-cohesive justice is going to depend on flexible and thoughtful neighbors.<br>...I think. ;o)<br><br><a href=#c8917511923857563056 title="comment permalink">1/2/14, 7:41 AM</a><br><br>

Expansive claims for solar energy ignore the energy costs of collection and concentration, as well as the huge energy subsidies solar (like all other energy resources) currently get from fossil fuels, especially petroleum. As for fracking, the issue there isn't raw cost, but the ferocious depletion rates of fracked wells; the way that fracking (and other barrel-scraping exercises) are soaking up a rising fraction of energy, capital, and other resources for the same return in energy; and especially the baroque financial architecture, amounting to fraud, that's been built up around the fracking bubble, and is subject to the usual Ponzi-scheme dynamics of financial bubbles. <br><br>Andy, that's a classic! <br><br>Doctor W., we've already had the crash; it happened in 2008 and 2009, and the result was exactly what I'd predicted -- the world's major political and financial authorities threw everything they had into the task of keeping the economy from going completely to pieces, and succeeded.

I have a question for you. Your blog has often stated that people back in the 1970’s where starting to get it about resource depletion. These concerns went away in the early 1980 when the neoliberals like Reagan and Thatcher got into power and it became clear that concerns about oil supply where exaggerated. However since 2005 conventional oil production has plateaued out, the price has nearly quadrupled and we have had the financial crisis of 2008. In the light of these crises, I would like to know why our civilization is so resistant to concerns about resource constraints. I know that you have spent much of the last year explaining why our faith in progress has helped to blind us to concerns about resource constraints, as we think that free markets, technology etc will solve these problems for us. But the faith in technology and progress was just as strong in the 1970’s as it is now. So if people were able to start to get it about resource constraints back in the 1970’s, why are they unable to get it now?<br><br>If you think about it, our faith in progress was more justified in the 1970’s than it is now. After all in the 1970’s development on technologies like nuclear fusion had only been going on for about 20 years, so it would have been reasonable to assume that workable nuclear fusion reactors were only 10 or 20 years away. Since then we have had a further 30/40 years of development on this technology without any tangible success; so it should be obvious that workable fusion reactors are unlikely. So why are we still so resistant to concerns about resource constraint, when the grounds for our faith in progress are so much weaker than it was in the 1970’s. I would love to hear what you have to say about this.<br><br>I have a few ideas about why this may be the case. One of the biggest problems for those who try to alert our civilization about the problem of resource constraint has been the endless exaggerated predictions of catastrophe that have been around since the 1970. I have read some of the books about the environment that were brought out during that decade, and if their predictions had turned out to be correct, then none of us should still be around today. If you keep on predicting catastrophe and it does not happen, then people will stop believing you after a while. Neoliberalism has also been very successful at dominating our culture. Pretty much all of our media, opinion formers and academics have taken on board neoliberalism. There are no alternative voices or ideologies in our mainstream culture. These voices are only found on the fringes. Back in the 1970 Marxism/socialism still had a strong voice. It is important to remember that resource constraint would have been just as much of a problem for a socialist economy as it would be for a capitalist economy. However the fact that there were alternative voices and ideologies in our mainstream culture, created a space in which concerns about resource constraint could be heard. I would love to hear your views on the matter.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c896768907350004681 title="comment permalink">1/2/14, 9:03 AM</a><br><br>

How that deep problem works out in any given case is an open question, but I have yet to see any lab-bench implementations that talk about net energy in any realistic sense, and that's one of the most likely places for problems to crop up. <br><br>Jasmine, excellent.

There are so many varibles, don't know if I want to think that hard right now. So just for a quick thought: Even at $10 a gallon (and much higher) for gasoline, used to accomplish something contructive, still makes gasoline a good deal compared to equivilent human labor. But as the price increases from here (at $3.50 a gallon, depends on where you are obviously), the use of this power source will slow, the economy will slow, and vice versa. The question then becomes, at what point will the energy costs of the larger society exceed the difference in the $ of gasoline to human labor? <br><br>I listened to a clip from CNBC Cramer a few days ago, and he is pushing investing in drilling (for gas and oil).

No doubt he has some failed predictions to answer for, but seeing the work he has done on his property, and knowing that, like you, he has come to terms with the course civilization is on (mainly, he says, through writing a vision of the future, his World By Hand series, the third and penultimate installment of which is on his desk ready for final edits).<br><br>The evening was spent with good neighbors.

I hear stories of fracking leases being sold in parts of Tennessee that are on or beyond the fringes of the real-world shale deposits, with actual productive potential would be over-generously described as "marginal." More like "non-existent." This is a primo red flag to me. In a bubble when speculative demand outstrips supply, people start manufacturing bogus supply -- can you say "sub-prime mortgages?" It looks like this is happening in the shale lease market already. <br><br>So what would the popping of this bubble look like? Well, I am only guessing here... but investors begin to get concerned that their "properties" are overvalued, and this leads to a domino effect of crashing prices for leases and bankruptcies. Even productive leases get caught in the tide, and the whole market collapses. There is no longer investment capital to develop leases, and the production of shale oil and gas threatens to grind to a halt. Energy prices soar, massive government interventions are demanded to stabilize the energy market. These may happen, in which case the money comes out of funds that would have been spent on other more productive activities, or they may not happen in which case economic activity is seriously dragged down by high energy prices. Either way, the result is more recession, more financial instability, less energy availability, more infrastructure neglect and decay, etc. I have seen this movie before...<br><br>Alan - it is way, way to late to "start early."

Your Snallygaster anecdote made my day, and has turned the usually dull lag time between work tasks into an exciting quest for Snallygaster information. Apparently the creature has a pretty elaborate mythology and goes back quite a while leading me to wonder if the coming of the new religiosity will see it and others of its kin once more haunting the hills of Maryland.<br><br>As for new years predictions, one other development I see continuing this year is a continuing trend in marriage equality legislation across the US, and that trend being grasped onto by believers in progress as evidence against decline and as a distraction from other issues. The concept that social and moral progress are a part of the same myth as the myth of technological progress as for me been the most eye opening and the most difficult to digest aspect of your current series. I’d never noticed how often issues of civil rights, pacifism, wealth inequality and such are treated as obstacles in the way of technological progress. But lately I’ve started paying attention and noticed how often people talk about civil rights or social justice issues with rhetoric that consists of “we need to stop oppressing each other, the stars are waiting.” As though the only thing between us and our Gene Roddenberry future is for Man (may he rest in peace) to start getting along.<br><br>It’s been a difficult thing to swallow for me, because all my life civil rights history has been presented as a series of breakthroughs that has fundamentally changed some aspect of how we as humans see and treat each other. We look at the days before the abolition of slavery or before any other major breakthrough with horror at the thought that our ancestors could have treated other humans so inhumanely, and we look at parts of the world that haven’t made these breakthroughs with sympathy, and with horror at the thought that such things could still be happening today. But when you consider the fact that slavery has been abolished and re-instated at least 20 times just in the last 2500 years, that societies have run the gauntlet from matriarchal to treating women as property, and that homosexuality has been treated as the romantic ideal everyone should strive for, as a crime worthy of the death penalty and everything in between, the image of humans on a path towards a fairer, more egalitarian world just doesn’t hold up.<br><br>The thought that here in America we can, and possibly will lose 200 years worth of advances in civil rights is far more horrifying to me even than the thought of losing 200 years of scientific knowledge. It seems to be a common assumption that by the time the class of 2000 (or whatever generation the hope gets pinned on) turns grey-headed racism, homophobia, sexism, etc. will be a thing of the past. I don’t even think it occurs to many people that those attitudes could not only rise up again, but become culturally acceptable. I wonder what your thoughts might be on the future of civil rights, and what can be done (if anything) to carry concepts of human equality through an age of decline. I don’t expect your answer to that last question to be something you can fit into a comment reel, but I do hope it’s a topic that you consider addressing at some point in the future (unless there’s a past essay on your blog that I might have missed, in which case a link would be appreciated).<br><br>I apologize for trailing off topic, these are thoughts that have been brewing over the course of your entire year’s worth of posts and I had to express them.<br><br>-Eric Singletary<br><br><br><a href=#c8392764356883890124 title="comment permalink">1/2/14, 11:45 AM</a><br><br>

And short "e" in these positions often becomes a long "a." Hence the long "a" in the penultimate syllable of "Allegany," which receives secondary stress. In a one-syllable word, the vowel is often tripthongized, as in the archetypal southern exclamation of "Dayum!" Pronounce that with a sort "a" in place of the "ayu" tripthong if you are not sure what word I mean. The words for the place where the Devil lives and for those white balls of ice that fall from the sky during thunderstorms are often pronounced the same, "Hayull."

First of all nukes make such confrontation something leaders try to avoid. Then nobody is serious about a general mobilization in the way most countries were in the runup to WW2: during the last Iraq war it took quite a lot of time and improvisation to replace softskin with armored cars and that is one of the simplest thing. Switching the Boeing 787 line to F-22 would not happen within an useful time as by the time the need would be recognized it would be too late. Thus the gap between the high attrition rate of a modern high tech war and the ability of the military industrial complex to replaces losses and consumption only at a much slower rate would ensure that the war would be short, even if political constraints were not there. <br>The scenario published on this blog in late 2012 is a decent account of how a conventional war between major powers would play out: short and high intensity combat quickly followed by negotiations with the losing side being given generous terms.

Meanwhile, in the real world, large-scale solar electric generation is only viable with big government subsidies.<br><br>Rashakor, that's entirely plausible -- say, a cascading series of proxy wars, manufactured "color revolutions," insurgencies, low-intensity conflicts, and economic and information warfare stretching out over a couple of decades and shredding large sections of the industrial world?

Well, unmistakable to the person who isn't aware of what’s going on. As you've pointed out and we've all seen, all the stops have been pulled out to keep the juggernaut rolling beyond what anyone would expect. I’m constantly amazed at the next trick that’s devised and even more amazed that it appears to work.<br><br>I’m also truly amazed at all the people predicting that the “recovery” is just around the corner. Back in 2004 someone at a talk that I was watching showed this graph, stopping then at 2004, and said that there was no way the housing boom could keep going. Of course you know how they were ridiculed.<br><br>http://www.multpl.com/case-shiller-home-price-index-inflation-adjusted/<br><br>Notice how the inflation adjusted Home Price Index had been roughly constant for at least the last 120 years or so. Around 1998 it took off like a rocket. When I hear people today talking about the housing market “recovering”, they’re talking about it recovering to the <i>top of the bubble</i>. House prices today haven’t been this high since 1893! House prices have yet to recover <i>down</i> to where they've been for at least the last 120 years. All they’re wishing for is another bubble!<br><br><br><a href=#c6930049133940878470 title="comment permalink">1/2/14, 1:40 PM</a><br><br>

What’s necessary is to greatly lower our energy use and plan how to make use of intermittent sources wisely and it’ll make it easier in the future. That’s not <b>easy</b>, but <b>easier</b>. If you’re using Ham Radio and keep your radio on all hours and have endless meaningless conversations about your health, etc., you’re going to have a hard time powering everything on a couple PV panels or whatever other source you may have. But if you schedule your contacts and discuss important subjects, you can even power a tube radio that puts out 150-200 watts like a Drake TR4 on one 200 watt PV panel and a car battery. I know, I've done it. I agree that it’s also a lot easier to use a small PV panel and battery if you use a low-power radio and Morse code. Then a 5-10 watt panel and a small battery would provide hours of on-air time every day. I do that too.<br><br>As far as Obamacare goes, you’re quite right about that! The people who are so thrilled about it are the ones who are already covered under some other policy. The people poor enough to really need it don’t get any benefit. My wife and I have signed up as we are required to. Luckily our income is low enough now that we qualify for the full assistance. So we’re out only $24/year. Yeah, that has a $5000 deductible for each of us before anything is paid for. Yet the government is “paying” (Read that “borrowing from China”) $942/month to the insurance company! For a garbage policy that most people who can only afford it won’t get any benefit from since they don’t have $5000/year to meet the deductible. The deductible doesn't drop below $1000 until you get to a policy costing you &gt;$3-400/month and the government is still paying &gt;$900/month on top of that! Doesn't sound like a sustainable system to me or even one that many people will get any benefit from. But the insurance companies do very well!<br><br>Oh, you and your heirs also give up any right to use the legal system to pursue claims against the care providers including malpractice resulting in death. You are required to use only the mandatory mediation. That’s in the fine print. It only shows up right before you press the ENROLL button. I don’t think we’ll be using much of this coverage, just continue paying the doctor ourselves, the rare times we do go.<br><br><a href=#c80916804111249528 title="comment permalink">1/2/14, 1:47 PM</a><br><br>

The industry lost all four local elections after outspending their opponents by 10 to 1 or so. The local op-ed pages have been full of industry shills lamenting the "emotional reactions" of the voters who banned fracking in their towns, and even the industry-puppet state government is having to pretend to step up regulations on the drillers. The increased costs of equipment upgrades and legal fees don't help the profitability of marginal production.<br><br>Elsewhere it looks like another energy related speculative bubble might be in its late winter / early spring season. Chris Nelder recently put out a couple of pieces about Green Bonds and other ways of securitizing investments in renewable power and energy efficiency projects. <br><br>http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/the-take/releasing-the-kraken-of-energy-transition/<br><br>There are hedge funds nearby that specialize in this sort of thing, and some of the big 401k-type firms are starting to float these bond options to their clients. Given the likelihood of higher fossil fuel prices after the tanking of the shale bubble, these projects will look pretty attractive to people looking for allegedly low-risk returns.<br><br>A bubble is a bubble, with all the risks and downsides, but I can't help but think that this particular sector would be one of the less bad areas for a bubble to happen. After the housing boom there was plenty of over-built real estate. After the shale bubble there'll be plenty of half-drilled wells and finished pipelines to nowhere. A comparable surplus of insulation, wind and solar power, transit projects, and energy-efficient buildings wouldn't be the worst thing to have in the wake of an investment bubble...<br><br>Anyhow, thanks for setting an example for publicly learning from your past predictions, JMG.

As for my broader question, I did find a (somewhat) satisfying answer to that question from you in the comments for "The God With Three Heads:"<br><br>"The end of progress requires the loss of the easy faith that moral improvement (however defined) will happen by itself, but it doesn't mean the end of moral improvement. It simply means that if betterment is going to happen, we -- meaning you, me, and other individuals who care about it, not simply a generic "we" -- have to make it happen." -J.M. Greer<br><br>I definitely agree with you though that its an issue deserving of a longer discussion. You've given quite a bit of voice to the history and fate of science, and since the concept of human rights is another legacy of the enlightenment worth preserving into the de-industrial future, it wouldn't be entirely off topic for the current series.<br><br>In the meantime, I think I'll do some research of my own. I wonder if there are any modern human rights philosophers or activists who are trying to move beyond the idea of human rights as self-evident truths that anyone with common sense can see. It's a scary idea to face, and one that requires rewriting the entire human rights debate from scratch, since the idea of God-given, inalienable human rights has been built into the concept since before Locke. Establishing a working philosophy and approach to human rights that can survive both an age of decline and the collapse of the religious paradigms that gave birth to the idea in the first place is a challenging prospect.<br><br><a href=#c6703619740022088578 title="comment permalink">1/2/14, 2:35 PM</a><br><br>

(That is, they were relevant when the assertion had power behind it, and irrelevant when it didn't.)<br><br>Anthropologists acknowledged relatively early that human rights were merely a cultural value of the West, but that didn't mean that anthropologists couldn't work toward support of human rights! It only meant that they couldn't rest them on the claim that they were natural, god-given, culturally neutral, apolitical, or universally self-evident.<br><br>I prefer to live in a community where humans are accorded basic inalienable rights.

Grid tied, so the actual electricity that was used to run the heater didn't actually come from the PV, but from the utility. The PV was just sold to the utility at a different time.

Unstressed vowels can be lengthened too, giving the stereotypical "drawl," or they can be all but obliterated creating a marble-mouthed mumble. The long "I" is almost universally flattened to a monopthong, but exactly what vowel it lands on varies. Around here the phrase "bright white light" comes out "brott wott lott." I've always thought a southern Henry Higgins could probably identify your class, race, and home county anywhere in the south by your accent. And Florida is a real miss-mash; the farther south you go down the peninsula the less southern the speech gets; but rural parts of the Panhandle can have some of the most amazing drawls to be heard.

If you turn out to be right, they haven't gained or lost anything because they've just kept on doing what they were going to do anyway. If I turn out to be right, though, they're screwed; they're going to face a really ugly future with no meaningful preparation at all, and their chances will not be good. Logically, then, the reasonable choice is to take my prediction as the working scenario, and while hoping for something better, preparing for the Long Descent. <br><br>S P, good. I've been saying for some time now that we're likely to see a domestic insurgency here in the US within a couple of decades at the outside, and possibly much sooner. The federal government is pretty clearly preparing to fight one, and I suspect they have good reason to think that's necessary. <br><br>August, exactly! You get today's gold star for stating the unspeakable: the goal of American economics these days is the mass production of speculative bubbles, because that's the only thing that will provide the something-for-nothing economy Americans demand. As for Obamacare, you might want to check the size of your subsidy in some other source -- I've heard from several people now that the federal and at least two state exchanges are quoting wildly inflated figures for the size of the subsidy. Me, I'm planning on paying the fine. <br><br>Zed, why does the phrase "jumping the shark" come forcefully to mind at this point? <br><br>Steve, oh, granted. I've seen another round of algal biodiesel hype already -- no doubt the pond scum ponzi scheme will be rolling again before long. <br><br>Eric, please do that research! It's a massively important issue, and deserves as many minds as possible working on it. <br><br>Sgage, a fine example of the species.

I first encountered his story in a wonderful collection called something like "101 Tales of Horror to Tell Around the Campfire". (Can't remember exactly now.)<br><br>Blackwood heard the tale while on a hunting/fishing trip in Canada. His telling was eerie and suggestive and vague and utterly terrifying.

Every bubble must start with investments that have some legitimacy. In this case, the investment firms are standardizing contracts for things like leased rooftop PV systems, industrial wind and solar farms, and energy performance contracts on buildings, all of which have a proven track record of returning capital plus some small interest rate (thanks to government subsidies, of course). It's only once the bubble picks up steam and runs low on legitimate projects that the energy vaporware equivalent of "NINJA mortgages" would enter the picture, and that's a long way off if it's going to happen at all. By the time this bubble would be in full inflation, the algae fad would likely already have gone the way of the hydrogen economy of a decade ago.<br><br>@August:<br><br>No argument that the LEED ratings and such are a questionable bar at best, but I look at such a bubble with an eye toward scarcity industrialism and salvage. Thanks to a (very hypothetical) bubble of energy hogs using huge PV arrays, there would be a lot more PV panels around to salvage for other purposes, not to mention buildings that are much better insulated than the average ticky-tacky box with schizophrenic siding that's typical these days. And if speculative something-for-nothing investments are going to be directed somewhere, what's so bad about financing rail projects, efficient buildings, wind farms, and PV panels for energy hogs? Just because it's done in hopes of getting something for nothing doesn't mean something marginally useful can't come out of it. It would sure beat the stuffing out of the fracking bubble and what it's leaving behind, in my opinion. <br><br>Besides, I have an ulterior motive for thinking such a bubble would be nice. At some point the panels in my Carter-era salvaged solar hot water system will need to be replaced. It'd be nice to get surplus 2020-ish models at a discount once they've been salvaged off some project that went belly-up in the next speculative crash.<br><br><a href=#c6242956845163367996 title="comment permalink">1/2/14, 9:08 PM</a><br><br>

Most species in most areas actually seem to be doing OK, with fairly stable populations. Some are increasing, some are decreasing, dramatically in some instances (in both directions). It's not always easy to see why. Around here some of the most dramatic collapses seem as though they might be stabilizing in recent years; again no one can really put a finger on why. So far there's not much sign of large-scale upheaval. Since birds have a huge variety of ecological niches, they should be good indicators of global change. And near-real-time tracking is getting easier with more and more information from thousands of people around the planet being shared online. So if, for instance, boreal ecosystems start to fall apart, we will likely see the effects in the many species of birds that nest up there and winter down here pretty quickly. Of course, whether we would or even could do something about it if we saw something like that happening is another matter entirely. <br><br>There have been some strange events recently that suggest the oceans *may* (heavy heavy caveats on that) be having more troubles than the land. Unprecedented irruptions of Blue-footed Boobies north along the Pacific coast this summer, and Razorbills (a species of auk) south on the Atlantic coast last winter, might suggest bad things happening to food supplies in their normal home ranges. Or they might just be weird events from some odd species-specific cause. Time will (maybe) tell. Old birder adage: Birds have wings and will use them. Any bird can show up anywhere, at any time. There isn't always a profound reason for it. <br><br>Vultures are doing great, skyrocketing numbers.

Expect more as the US sphere of influence contracts, probably ending in a Sino-Japanese war -- though I won't put a date on the latter. <br><br>Puppet, you're most welcome. I suspect most of the financial blogs that run the "this is the year that everything crashes!" nonsense every single year are either talking their book, or have simply figured out that people like cheap horror fiction disguised as predictions of the future. <br><br>Alan, no, the problem with solar that matters is inadequate net energy due to the energy costs of concentration. Have you seen the latest work by Pedro Prieto and Charlie Hall on the Spanish PV experience? According to <a href=http://energyskeptic.com/2013/tilting-at-windmills-spains-solar-pv/ rel=nofollow>initial reviews</a> -- I haven't had the chance to read the book yet myself -- they were able to do whole system net energy calculations based on real data, including <i>all</i> inputs, and came up with an average EROEI, for solar PV in Europe's sunniest country, of 2.45. If that's right -- I would like to see it replicated, of course -- then solar PV is basically a roundabout way of burning fossil fuels to generate electricity, with a very modest boost from sunlight. <br><br>Onething, yes, I thought at that time that oil prices would plateau for a decade or two and then come down, as economic contraction made fewer and fewer people able to afford any oil at all. The last barrel of oil, I thought, might be sold for the equivalent of $20 or $30 in 2007 dollars, because this would be a month's wages for most people in the deindustrial and bitterly impoverished US and not many people could spring for such an extravagance. As I said, I revised that view on the basis of experience. <br><br>Melissa, other than bracing for a wild ride, I don't have any particular suggestions. <br><br>Steve, I noted the pond scum ponzi scheme simply because that shows that "alternative" tech is already gearing up to replace fracking; of course there will also be legitimate investments, possibly quite a lot of them.

They apply the same relations and obligations to all creation, guarding the universe by outlawing fundamental change, so making all creatures conservationist and conservative. In most other societies an urge for change is so entrenched as to be thought natural, nor is it clear that people entirely succeeded in leaving the world as they found it, but they (referring to the Aboriginals) dedicated their lives to conserving what they inherited, and within the perception of living generations generally they succeeded."<br><br>What a truly fascinating book.

The cultivation of virtue is an old pagan idea, but although it provides guidance for individual behavior, virtue-based ethics do not necessarily indicate what individuals have a right to expect from society as a whole.<br><br>One possible underpinning for a pagan ethical system arrives at a result similar to the Golden Rule starting from different premises. The rationale for the Golden Rule is either that God commands it, or that we are all God's children and He loves us equally.<br><br>A pagan rationale for a similar standard of behavior is absolute interconnection. No one and nothing is separate from the whole; all beings have intrinsic value; whatever we do has effects that eventually come back to us. Many tribal peoples believe that all plants and animals are our relatives. Biological sciences confirm this; all human beings have a common ancestry; and we cannot survive without (for example) the colonies of bacteria in our guts, so feeling superior to anybody or any thing on account of accidents of birth is not rational.

Things go on as they have because huge institutions have been built to keep doing what they do, conventional imagination-sapping ideologies are hammered at us and repeated ad nauseam, and individuals have few opportunities or notions other than to go along to get along. All the more so in a system in which the “radical monopolization” (see Ivan Illich, Tools for Conviviality) effectively forecloses alternative (outside the system) means for securing most of life's necessities. All this would leave one to believe that things will continue pretty much as they have, that the system will continue to find a way to sustain itself even as things deteriorate in the manner you describe week after week. But … <br><br>There is a way that things break. Stresses build, matter or behavior deforms. It appears to be a linear, gradual process. The starter motor wheezes longer before the engine turns over, but the car still starts. The water keeps getting colder but it still flows through the pipes. People become more dubious that things will get better, but they still retain a little hope. And then “suddenly” one day the car just won't start. The pipes freeze. People go from disoriented to desperate. The last rock keeping San Andreas fault from rupturing fractures. These phase changes are for the most part beyond anyone's ability to predict. And the extent to which they are self-limiting or capable of setting off calamitous cascades of phase changes through a complex interdependent system are pretty much unknowable.<br><br>No one in their right mind would wish for the kinds of dislocations the system is capable of, but it would be wishful thinking to dismiss their possibility. The arrogant hard liners who run (and think they control) this system have for many years now been unwilling to give an inch, and in so doing have allowed the stresses to build. But of late there are signs that the relentless ratcheting up of the stress may be reversing at least a little bit. Legal pot in Colorado, De Blasio in NY, calls for amnesty for Snowdon from the NY Times and a big push to raise the minimum wage to name some. So this year, like any other, it could go either way.

He's just clueless about optics, claiming the sphere sucks in all the light around it, and even focuses moonlight (big deal - what's the POWER in that light?!).<br>And he ignores the quantitative energy needs of buildings, sketching in a few of his spheres in a most artistic fashion without the slightest care for the actual kWh of energy consumption vs. the actual power of sunlight per square meter.<br>http://www.designboom.com/technology/spherical-glass-solar-energy-generator-by-rawlemon/<br>http://www.rawlemon.com/index.html<br><br>TI's spherical mini solar cells didn't work all that great in the 70's, nor have any spherical lenses thru the years worked worth a frack.<br>PV wants to be flat: maximize the area the sun shines on, minimize the area for optical/recombination losses.<br><br>My prediction for 2014 is that CPV will continue to lag, even Sunpower's 5x concentrator,<br>as commodity PV gets cheaper and cheaper, both the modules and the BOS (Balance Of Systems).<br><br><a href=#c1143586215469494763 title="comment permalink">1/3/14, 4:10 PM</a><br><br>

In order to keep things in balance, and on topic I do want to point out to John Michael Greer that, while there wasn't another Irene or Sandy, there was the typhoon in Southeast Asia a few months back, which I think fits the bill in the multi-million dollar weather related disasters/climate refugees category, so I think that may actually be a clean sweep for the year's predictions.<br><br><a href=#c2056515834863140695 title="comment permalink">1/3/14, 4:34 PM</a><br><br>

I generally get and agree with what they say, but it looks so fracking unprofessional.<br><br>I will add Prieto and Hall to the book list.<br><br>The too generous Spanish subsidies brought in the quick buck guys, who:<br>* built a bunch of small module manufacturers which were too small to effectively compete.<br>* threw up systems based on getting as much subsidy as possible, without experience or care in the long-term effectiveness of the project.<br>* bought whatever was cheap, regardless of long-term quality.<br><br>Complaints about excess cost vs. real capacity, low quality and out-and-out fraud soon got out of hand, then the government had to lower the boom. Blaming the technology for all the troubles is not honest, the crisis aspect was political in nature. (This may not help in actually alleviating the problems).<br><br>Because of the "land rush", costs (and energy use in construction) were higher than in more orderly markets like Germany. Indeed, their slide show shows that modules increased to over 3 Euro/Wp (Watt-peak)during the boom (they're under 1 Euro/Wp now.)<br><br>I have to quibble with the reviewer who says the crash of 2008 was brought on partly by <i>over-investment</i> in PV. The Spanish government, in that great tradition of bread and circuses, capped electricity prices paid by consumers, so that neither the PV subsidies <b>OR the massive increases in fossil fuel prices around 2008</b> were passed on to consumers. The money came by cutting government services - at just the time they were needed most. It wasn't over investment, it was vote-buying subsidies and wasteful giveaways on top of what was needed to stimulate the market.<br><br>The 2008 worldwide financial crash didn't help things either.<br><br>I took a look at the slides referenced in your link.<br><br>These startups in Spain, plus the new Chinese module makers were inexperienced, and made frankly crappy modules, thus the 8% loss due to "over dimensioning of the nominal power" (eg. the nameplate was higher than actual power).<br>This also accounts for most of the module degradation - 11.4% over just a few years is unacceptable, but if one has no manufacturing experience/effective QA and is buying cheap encapsulant, what does one expect? Tier 1 suppliers modules degrade a fraction of a percent per year, proven over dozens of years in the field.<br><br>I also have to quibble with their methodology of calculating energy input. They take the GDP of Spain, take the total energy used, calculate X Euros per MJ, then say we spent Y Euros on PV, therefore the energy cost was Y Euros / X Euros/MJ = Z MJ.<br><br>So, for instance does it really cost 71.9 GWh/year to provide 42 MEuro insurance? I don't think so.<br><br>I also quibble with charging energy as wasted when most of the Spanish PV companies shut down prematurely. The buildings are still there and usable, and the equipment has long since had a slow boat ride to China.<br><br>Conventional life cycle analysis gets an EROEI of about 8.3.<br><br>I note that Germany systems are now installed close to 2Euro/Wp<br>http://emp.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/lbnl-6350e.pdf<br>instead of the 6-7 Euro/Wp during the rush in Spain, and that means greatly decreased (energy) costs -&gt; better EROEI. An example: The traditional way of anchoring a module rack is to drill a hole, put a form up, stick some rebar and anchor bolts in and pour concrete. In Germany, if site conditions allow, they use drill-in anchors - big steel screws that just dig into the ground. For the cost of about the same steel in the rebar, one has an easily recyclable anchor in far less time/money/energy. <br><br>It will be interesting to dig in to this. EROEI is so critical.<br><br><a href=#c3038023398812571559 title="comment permalink">1/3/14, 6:02 PM</a><br><br>

You are as gracious as our host, something seen not just in this instance but in comments through the years.<br><br>On today's post, I will also accept the gauntlet, though my predictions at this time last year (http://riverjournal.com/vivvo/news/2591-yearinreview_gannon_012013.html) involved no risky thoughts whatsoever, and therefore were right on target. For the year to come?... Well, my son moved to Las Vegas a few months ago, and he recently told me about witnessing the robbery of someone's groceries in the store parking lot as they were loading their bags into their car. This is the type of thing I see getting more attention in the year to come. As more people find themselves struggling, there will be more and more of those who feel entitled to take what they are unable to get by other means. Even in my rural bastion, this type of crime is on the increase, and is garnering more and more attention. As for "big" things - I see Pakistan as the wild card in the deck. I lived there many many years ago, and the changes are astounding to me. When you have an enormous population, which includes a staggering number of young men who are unemployed, you have a powder keg waiting to explode. And in Pakistan's case, a nuclear one.<br><br>As a response to Chris (and somewhat to JMG) - Both you and JMG have both suggested that the actions of individuals in power only matter in the aggregate, and if that's true, I would have to agree that there's not much difference in who we elect at the national level (and, to some extent, at the local level as well). We have a broken system or rather, several broken systems and it's rare indeed that anyone with a voice that can be heard is working to change things at that level. But I tend to be a pragmatist, so I am willing to see differences among individuals in at least some areas that matter to me, and will continue to cast my votes based on that idea - those votes are certainly not always for Democrats at the local level. At the national level, President is really my only voting option, as Idaho is a red, red state.<br><br>I am a liberal, and I live in not just a conservative bastion, but in a place that was an early "heart" of the tea party (and the Aryan Nations, the Militia of Montana, and the John Birchers before that). Though I tend to think of myself as well-informed, it's entirely possible that the way I think is a 'talking' point for Democrats. I just haven't noticed that at all. From my viewpoint, most of my liberal friends are disappointed in Obama, having thought that he was somehow going to solve all the issues they cared about. <br><br>Trish<br><br><a href=#c5339320213233313290 title="comment permalink">1/3/14, 6:37 PM</a><br><br>

My reason for this is that somehow we've taken the rise of specialisation too far in relation to education.<br><br>The thought dawned on me today as I was working through the garden on various tasks that I'm constantly learning as nature keeps on teaching lessons. There is nothing inherently mystical about that learning either as anyone can read the story as long as they take the time to get their hands dirty and have a reasonably curious mind.<br><br>But there's the problem. A person actually has to do something and I see a society bogged down in mindless entertainment. Entertainment is fun and all, but it has to be done in balance.<br><br>This is where our education system falls down because it is neatly compartmentalised in people’s lives and is an awards based system. The awards based system encourages specialisation too which is why people can happily say, "you cannot speak about matter x, because you are not an expert in that field". Or: "matter x has not been studied, therefore it cannot be observed".<br><br>Such statements kill off natural curiosity and observation skills in people. We in effect spend too much effort trying to split learning and overlook the big picture and inter-relationships of things.<br><br>That lack of curiosity and observation which is engendered by the education system combined with specialisation, in turn leads people to put their faith in soothing lullaby’s from experts despite the fact that those stories may not fit the facts on the ground.<br><br>Mindless entertainment requires mindless consumers. It doesn't have to be that way though.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c1431428795250873906 title="comment permalink">1/3/14, 10:48 PM</a><br><br>

The Puritans had their “five pillars,” one of which was the Essential Depravity of Mankind. It’s said you never met a disillusioned Puritan - they had no illusions that people would do the right thing in the first place.<br><br>Why not Obama? Go back to 2000. The reason we had Bush instead of Gore was the Green party acted as a spoiler. I’ve heard they had substantial Republican funding. 2004. Guy everyone liked named Howard Dean was the frontrunner until John Kerry came from nowhere to get the Democratic nomination and then swoon in front of Bush. 2008? A one-term senator comes from nowhere to unseat the Crown Princess and then has the Republican candidate do a swan dive in front of him. As JMG says, he’s almost indistinguishable from a hypothetical Bush III administration. 2012? The Republicans commit hari-kari with a poorly conceived debate schedule.<br><br>If I was in the conspiracy theory mood, I’d think that once was happenstance, twice was coincidence, three times is enemy action.<br><br>The other reason I never believed him was his program. It was simply a mashup of all the liberal and new age wish list items, put forth with an emotional religious fervor. For me, that’s an instant turnoff. I don’t know who his advertising agency was, but whoever it was, they deserve a medal. <br><br>This gets into the prediction question. I take the “fox and hedgehog” model of evaluating people who make predictions. For some reason the book I was looking for has vanished from Google’s front page, however. There was a study about prediction styles. A “hedgehog” style depends on a single concept, and it’s usually put forth with a great deal of certainty. A “fox” style depends on analysis from a number of viewpoints, and the proponents tend to qualify their predictions, so they don’t sound at all confident. The payoff: “hedgehogs” are about as accurate as hiring a chimpanzee to throw stuff at a wall. “Foxes” can do better, and sometimes do.<br><br>Another art of prediction bit: lots of pundits have a neat way of avoiding making bad predictions. They don’t make an actual “prediction,” instead they swan around the subject weaving a spell of expectations and then leave without a concrete statement that someone can point to and say “this is a prediction.” It’s a great way of not being wrong. (I was going to point to an article, but it seems to have vanished. Or else I don’t remember where I saw it two hours ago. Sigh.)<br><br><br><br><a href=#c4372308782936734424 title="comment permalink">1/4/14, 7:37 AM</a><br><br>

They then add up the cost in Euros of stuff, like insurance, multiply by their factor, and say that's how many MJ. My point is a lot of money going to the insurance company is profit, taxes, etc. - the energy cost of which is negligible. At least from the slides, they didn't mention getting actuarial information (which I assume would be very proprietary) and figuring out what the insurance companies really are (planning to) pay in actual claims. My impression is they just took each expense line item and converted to energy. One can hope that over the whole project that things average out to their conversion factor, but as the fraction of the economy analyzed gets smaller, there would be more and more skew - either way.<br><br>Unfortunately, true energy data is often hard to come by and/or verify, though there is much better info in Europe than the U.S. The companies installing solar do keep track of money very closely. Thus Hall's method.<br><br>Other people who do bottom up energy calcs get the (average) 8.3 EROEI number (vs. the 2.3 number).<br><br>How much of the discrepancy is Prieto &amp; Hall's outdated/corrupted-by-Spain's-PV-land-rush (cost) info and possible skew from mean money to energy factor, and how much is from missing info in bottom up studies?<br><br><br>@ Cherokee Organics<br><br>Yes, August is a peak PV time. But note that wind was 16.1%.<br>If you go to the Spanish grid authority's realtime demand site<br>https://demanda.ree.es/demandaEng.html<br>(assuming you want to read the English version), you can see that "right now",<br>say at 13:40 Spain time on 5 Jan, wind is providing 43.9% of Spanish electricity needs.<br>Note the pie chart in upper right-hand, you have to mouse-over the chart to get the numbers.<br>Hydro 13.6%.<br>PV in not shown in real-time, I guess since many systems are small/distributed and takes a while for smart meter info to filter in.<br><br>The realtime chart can be moved backwards.<br>Got down to the calendar in lower left and enter/select a date, then hit "Consult selected date" button.

For most Americans, things have gotten steadily worse over the last decade, and I'm suggesting -- for reasons discussed at length in this blog -- that they may get a great deal worse over the decades immediately ahead. Sure, the stock market has bubbled up again; how much good has that done for the ever-expanding fraction of Americans who have no job and no unemployment benefits? It's easy to remain stuck in abstractions and arbitrary predictions; look at what's happening on the ground, and the easy optimism you're promoting is hard to support. <br><br>August, stay tuned. The more desperate our situation becomes, the giddier the technological gimmicks will get. <br><br>Alan, this is fascinating. Why is it that so many techno-optimists like you are equally fascinated by sudden catastrophes, but won't grapple with what lies between those two extremes -- the ordinary historical process of decline and fall? <br><br>Lewis, that's the wave of the future -- pun intended.

Still, the Napa River bone dry in January? Good gods...<br><br>Bob, Hammer films weren't central to my youthful monsterology, but I certainly enjoyed them; to this day, Christopher Lee is my idea of a vampire -- forget about those sparkly kids!<br><br>Sunseeker, most interesting. I'll look forward to more discussion of the new book. I'm far from sure that conventional life cycle analysis adequately captures the full energy cost of PV, but it's an issue worth exploring. <br><br>Dan, as rules of thumb go, that's a good one. <br><br>Lady Imbrium, as a newcomer to the state, the local language has been a repeated source of interest to me!<br><br>Grebulocities, that's an excellent point. As I mentioned in response to an earlier commenter, I get flurries of apocalypse spam seemingly aimed at convincing me that this time is different and we're really truly all going to die by 2030, and I have no reason to think that's paid for -- any more than the folks who pop up now and then pushing their favorite paranoid scapegoat fantasy on me are on somebody's salary. <br><br>Cherokee, all good points, and we'll be talking about all of that when I get to the sequence on education I need to do one of these days. <br><br>Fyreflye, there will be any number of candidates for "the wonderful new energy source that will save us all and make vast profits!" as the fracking boom goes bust. Solar energy is certainly a contender, and if Prieto and Hall are right, the solar industry has all the more reason to flog their product as fast as possible before more people (and nations) figure out that it's not cost-effective. <br><br>Mark, fascinating.

Where is the old druid verve, the zest for detailed divination, the throbbing thrill of perceptively peering into the spiritus mundi (sorry, the Latin didn't allow me to make a 4rd alliteration). By Eingen's beard, you wrote a book on prognostication. You have the tools man, pick them up, pick them up! Ok … so if you haven't got the nerve, then allow me ;-)<br><br>Now I would pick through some chicken entrails but these are is short supply given I've already slaughtered all of my meat birds. The few layers I have left are too precious to me so I am constrained to pursue more down to earth means … yes, I'm talking geomancy. Given you wrote “The Art and Practice of Geomancy”, and said book is my sole source of information on the means and meaning of this method of divination, I gratefully attribute all credit for accuracy (such that it may be) to your benevolent self. Indeed, what follows is a divination of which much is in your own words. This is appropriate as I am doing the reading in your stead.<br><br>Here goes. The “world” is just too general a subject so lets restrict ourselves to the USA. After all, its still important. So the question is “How will the USA fare in 2014?”. The querent (the one asking the question), of course, is my humble self; however, this is third party question as the reading is done on your behalf. So, as the subject matter is government, we look to the 10th house for its significator and treat that as the querent. To keep it simple, I will number the houses and list the figures in them (in English, for the uninitiated) from that house. <br><br>And the answer is (drum roll please): To be continued … See the next post.<br><br><a href=#c1227375061777346627 title="comment permalink">1/5/14, 8:48 PM</a><br><br>

I think we can see the better reading here.<br>3) Boy: the 3rd house represents international relation with neighbouring countries and Boy is “always unfavorable in matters where stability, prudence, and maturity are advantages” pg 41. Looks like nothing new on the foreign policy front.<br>4) Prison: Uh oh …. looks like some trouble in real estate, but hey, again nothing new here either.<br>5) Ending: This suggests a “situation nearing completion and thus ripe for change” pg 59 related to state governments (the kids). The 5th house is also related to personal pleasures and so the figure suggest a change in these. Life will get less pleasant.<br>6) Crowd: The 6th house governs federal civil servants and Crowd indicates “no direction or focus of their own” pg 45. I'm thinking a continued absence of moral direction. There is nothing dazzling different from last year here. <br>7) Sorrow: Same figure as in the 4st house so connects the two houses. So close (trade) partners will be in the same depressed state; same for known enemies (China? Both partner and enemy?). Perhaps something new here for Canada and China as these do not appear to be suffering quite the same as the USA yet.<br>8) Outward Fortune: The 8th is the traditional house of death and “money or property … loaned to another person” pg108; The figure represents “unstable success” and “unfavorable for matters in which fickleness or instability is a problem” pg63. I'm thinking things look sufficiently good on the outside to indicate and death is not immanent. The federal government should not expect its money back though.

Danger is said to be “good in all that is evil and evil in all that is good” pg 52. This sums up the prevailing federal philosophy as practiced rather well. Municipal governments will continue to be in trouble. What can I say; its getting tedious: no real change. <br>10) Danger (again). Same figure as in the 9st house so connects the two houses. The 10th house refers to the querent's reputation, social standing, and the weather. So many municipal governments continue to look bad (insolvency) and the weather continues to be very bad. Also, the reputation of the federal government will continue to get a battering. Again not much change from last year.<br>11) Prison: Same figure as in the 4st and house so connects the two houses. This house represents “friends, associates, promises, sources of help, the querent's hopes and wishes” pg 110. clearly there is no help for the USA from outside, in particular for real estate. The matter is locked up.<br>12) Beginning: Generally fortuitous but weak in the 12th house. The 12th governs “debts owed by the querent, imprisonment, anything secret, and enemies the querent doesn't know about.” pg 111. It is “unfavorable in questions where ending something is desirable” pg 61. It is hard to see how a new beginning in any of these things is good. So, a new beginning in any or all of debts, imprisonment (of citizens of the USA), secrets, and secret enemies.<br><br>In terms of how the year will unfold we look to the 1st (start), 10th (middle), and 7th (end) and 4th (final result, the aftermath). These are Sorrow, Danger, Sorrow, and Prison respectively. These speak for themselves.<br><br>So there you go: It has been foretold.<br><br>But wait, wait.

What I mean to say is that a substantial portion, probably most, of the posts you have to deal with that look like comments by corporate or political shills are likely to actually be real, unpaid opinions by people who have been convinced by propaganda of one sort or another. I'm going to use an example from something I know well (I studied molecular biology as a grad student for a couple of years), but this sort of process is going on in a number of political and economic arguments.<br><br>Take, for instance, a molecular biologist who has never read your blog before and whose views are scientifically mainstream. Suppose the post s/he comments on somehow involves genetic engineering of crops. His or her response is likely to be indistinguishable from that of a comment by a paid shill for a large biotech company - it will be articulate, it will come from a new user, and it will likely start by dispelling common misconceptions it thinks "anti-GM" activists have and conclude by saying that a biotech-driven Second Green Revolution is the key to feeding humanity. <br><br>Of course, the reality is more complicated - genetic engineering has shown quite limited promise at engineering better food crops, and it is mostly used as a way for a few corporations to gain intellectual property rights over large parts of the world's food supply. The actual innovations, such as inserting glyphosate resistance or production of Bt toxin, are being easily defeated by evolution. Numerous glyphosate-resistant weeds and Bt-resistant corn borers have appeared all over the Midwest and are defeating efforts to combat them with biochemical tools. <br><br>Now of course molecular biologists should know what's really going on - anyone who understands evolution would know that the techniques that have been used are guaranteed to fail as resistance evolves. In reality, though, they often side wholeheartedly with biotech firms and would make a post like this, assuming anti-GM activists are scientifically illiterate. <br><br>Some of them receive corporate grants and are biased for obvious reasons. But - this is the important point - most such people are not receiving corporate grants. Their sense of purpose and meaning in life is built around improving humanity scientifically, and they imagine that further scientific progress in agriculture can solve future world food supply problems. This happens to be exactly the view biotech firms are pushing - so you'll never know if such a post is originated by a truly (financially) disinterested scientist or a paid spokesperson of Monsanto et al.<br><br>This same process occurs in political issues as well, or anywhere else where educated people have personally identified with exactly the beliefs that certain interests are pushing. The situation from last week where someone falsely appeared to be a paid shill of the Democratic Party or its allies is a classic example - I know many highly educated types who would have made exactly the same sorts of arguments. A person who believes in Progress, and who believes that the Democratic Party is advancing Progress, would make arguments that sound like (and are in some cases taken from) the Democratic platform or Obama's slogans. Successful propaganda propagates itself.<br><br><a href=#c7372760096789144049 title="comment permalink">1/5/14, 11:07 PM</a><br><br>

I have to treat the batteries very respectfully to get this lifespan out of them too. They are a major cost component in the system.<br><br>You completely failed to address the economic issues I raised in relation to Spain (unemployment).<br><br>As an interesting aside, Australia has a small island territory off the east coast with a fascinating convict history called Norfolk Island. They recently installed a lot of grid connect solar PV panels. It all worked fine until one day the island generated more than they used and the entire system popped. Yes, renewable energy makes it really difficult to manage demand.<br><br>You should not expect anything different from a much larger electricity grid. The components that are being installed right now are completely incapable of adapting to this circumstance. It'll happen, trust me. There is a reason why I've had to pay so much to have an island system as it accounts for this situation which happens most days here (the sunny boy inverter/charger you mentioned is not a bad option, but like off grid it is expensive and few want to pay - and that one operates like a small UPS (uninterruptable power supply) for a household. Note the word small).<br><br>Hi Agent,<br><br>Just out of interest, why do you use a koala bear as an icon?<br><br>They are infrequent visitors here and all I can report about their behaviour is this:<br>- they're grumpy;<br>- they're mostly drunk because of the toxic diet they consume;<br>- they sleep for long periods of the day (up to 20 hours a day);<br>- they have these wicked claws which look like they'll do you up a treat. People rarely include these claws in photographs; and<br>- in the dark of night when they're most active they sound like razor back the wild boar is coming to kill you. Scary, blood curdling stuff.<br><br>Truly, they look cute, but pack a real punch.

A colleague from a different religious background is sold on the universality of the Golden Rule and created a poster of Golden Rule equivalents from many cultures.

The sun won't shine at all for 7 days? We have no wind and the wind blows nowhere for 7 days? We have no hydro, biomass (to burn straw men!?) or geothermal in the mix?<br><br>I'm not claiming perfection or that we will have BAU.<br><br>I've no time to search around, but a lot of work has been done on integrating large amounts of renewables, even 100%, so it is <i>technically</i> not that big a deal. (Not that that will ever happen at current power consumption levels due to other constraints on a post-peak economy).<br><br>If we have enough renewables to "gracefully" degrade, the existing or enhanced grid lets us move power, and we don't need a 7 day battery - 5% of 1 day is probably enough to provide stability (along with load shedding). If we're into more of a salvage mode decline, PV systems are small/standalone, and a few salvage batteries work great, and we have to get a good night's sleep anyway because we've got manual labor to do, so not having 24x7 everything is not a big deal.<br><br>No question renewables are more costly: one has to provide (more) storage and do without sometimes. So paying for renewables means a smaller economy - welcome to living within our means; but doing without them means essentially the end of civilization. And the increased cost of fossil fuels due to depletion means costs are going up anyway, therefor economies are declining anyway.<br><br>And many renewables keep declining in costs, which is why I question Prieto &amp; Hall, using updated numbers for system costs (down half) means their EROEI is doubled to 4.6, pretty close to the 5:1 widely assumed as needed to maintain (though NOT grow) a society. Also, the crappy vendors are gone, so degradation is lower than they assumed, and lifetime is longer.<br><br>speaking of smaller economies…<br><br>@ Cherokee Organics - unemployment in Spain<br><br>? are you presuming that was caused by PV installations?<br><br>I doubt it. Much of that money was spent in Spain on salaries, etc., and it was <i>investments</i> on the order of 28 Billion Euro, coming in from all over the world.<br><br>Here's what I think.<br>Spain has no oil, no gas, and their coal mines are declining.<br>http://mazamascience.com/OilExport/<br>Go to Spain, look at oil, gas, coal.<br>2008 they used about 1.5 million bpd.<br>Brent oil prices went from US$57/bbl in 2007 to US$147. What did doubling Spain's basic energy costs do? Call it 50 Euro/bbl increase * 1.5 million bpd * 200 days of pain = 15 Billion Euro "tax" on current income, just for liquid fuels - ALL OF WHICH WENT OUT OF THE COUNTRY. And that's not counting the ripple effect of increased costs of everything else.<br><br>Unlike the US, which produces all its coal, most of its gas, and half its oil, Spain imports nearly everything. A lot of the increased oil price in the US got recycled into our own economy, softening the blow to the US.<br><br>The US is also the world's reserve currency (lucky us - for now), so many recycled petrodollars ended up in the US (thanks Spain - ah, imperialism ;^).<br><br>The rest of Europe and the world got clobbered in 2008, including those parts with no big renewable push.

Who would lend him dollars to buy oil if they thought Japan might never recover? With the help of the Yakuza, they are certainly making progress. Scouring the streets for the homeless and otherwise disenfranchised has been a boon to TEPCO, which otherwise might have been saddled with at least minimum wage plus health cost. But I digress. Let’s talk about the Artic. <br>In the Artic, methane gas releases are growing at an astonishing rate. You might think that the IPCC might be on top of this, but you’d be wrong. Nothing passes through the IPCC that isn’t 6 years old. That’s 3 years in the peer review process, followed by three years of political sabotage. What use to bubble up in isolated streams, is now 1 mile wide plumes. That’s a lot of methane. My brother asks are we able to harness it? It comes up along the ring of fire. Evidently the rise of temperature in the artic has destabilized the shallow deposits of methane clathrate causing a dramatic increase of methane release. The tremors along the ring help shake loose he methane.<br>It turns out that methane rises and when it reaches the 70K to 100K altitude, radiation breaks it down, and the water combining with meteoric dust, forms nocto-luminescent clouds, which have now begun to be observed as far south as Denver, where they have normally been confined to the artic.<br>It is laughable that the global warming deniers are still active in their denial, but there you have it. We pump 44 cubic miles of pure CO2 into the atmosphere every year, just from oil... Small amount maybe, but it all adds up. Satellites that can measure the incoming and outgoing heat to and from the earth have been measuring a .6 watts per square yard imbalance. It sounds like a small number, but added up equates to 400,000 Hiroshima bombs of heat added to the earth every day. The deniers point to the Antarctic ice growth this past year, but then the ice is only 2 meters thick, so who gets the last laugh?<br>So predictions… <br>1. The Arctic ice will melt 80+% this coming summer. If 100%, then we are a year ahead of schedule. Yay! Nice to be early. <br>2. Methane concentrations in the arctic will exceed 3000 PPB.<br>3. Earthquakes will destabilize the Fukushima holding tank spilling the remaining contents.<br>4. The fracking will lose all investors.<br>5.

In Judaism, it is expressed as "What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow man. That is the entire Law; all the rest is commentary" which is an instruction to refrain from doing evil unto others. The Islamic is also quite good, ""No one of you is a believer until he desires for his brother that which he desires for himself." It reminds me of the New Testament epistle which states that he who says he loves God but hates his brother is a liar.<br><br>Buddhism - "Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful" matches the Judaic, and Hinduism - Do naught unto others which would cause you pain if done to you" (Mahabharata 5:5157) is also the same as the above.<br><br>Was that cherry picking?<br><br>Then too, the larger problem is that despite the teachings, people regularly do things that are completely unjustifiable.

If you disagree with this you should have addressed this specific issue, as it stands you have implied that the author of the article did not even consider a concern with it which was specifically addressed.

"<br><br>Just to put things in perspective if the US were to stay at current energy consumption levels and were just to use your 5% of one day battery then 5Gt/7/20 = 36Mt. This roughly half of known lead reserves. If energy consumption had decreased to just 10% of previous levels then the battery would require 3.6Mt roughly 5% of known lead reserves a lot more doable, especially as not all of the batteries have to be lead based/you can also use pumped hydro. That said it still looks pretty gargantuan to me. As an aside does this powered down society have the ability refine silicon to the necessary 99.999999% purity to make new solar panels?<br><br>"And many renewables keep declining in costs, which is why I question Prieto &amp; Hall, using updated numbers for system costs (down half) means their EROEI is doubled to 4.6, pretty close to the 5:1 widely assumed as needed to maintain (though NOT grow) a society."<br><br>I believe one of the assertions of Prieto &amp; Hall was that most of the energy invested didn't go into making the panels but rather into building access roads,fences, power lines, and all every else which was needed to install and maintain the panels. The cost of producing the panels halving has no effect on these other costs associated with production, thus would not result in a doubling of EROEI.<br><br>"Also, the crappy vendors are gone, so degradation is lower than they assumed, and lifetime is longer."<br><br>When did the crappy vendors go away.

I do make a habit of evaluating my predictions, though I haven't gotten around to doing so for <a href=http://flutetankar.blogspot.se/2012/12/infor-2013.html rel=nofollow>2013</a> yet.<br>One prediction I'm pretty sure was right is that Norway's crude oil extraction has kept on declining by around 6 percent this year too, although <a href=http://npd.no/ rel=nofollow>Oljedirektoratet</a> consistently predicts that the production will start levelling out instead of continuing at the same decline rate. The production figures for December will be out in about a week's time, so I'll see then how good my guess was. The figures up until <a href=http://npd.no/no/Nyheter/Produksjonstall/2013/November-2013/ rel=nofollow>november</a> show a yearly decline of around 6%, so I'm pretty confident that I was right. We're already starting to see signs of trouble in the Norwegian housing market (the world's most absurdly inflated housing bubble), which was a prediction of mine for 2013 based on their declining oil production and exports. Housing prices have fallen around 6% from May to November.<br>A failed prediction of mine for 2013 was that the Al-Assad regime in Syria would fall.<br>A better prediction of mine was that the US would not attack Iran, but that Iran would have to tackle their population's discontent with the results of the sanctions, and sure enough the Iranian regime negotiated a deal even though they consider the US to be evil incarnate.<br>The EU circus has fared better than I expected. However there are as I predicted still widening gaps between the major players, e.g. Germany under Merkel and France under Hollande. Greece and Spain have miraculously managed to keep the collapse somewhat contained without any urgent need for new "aid" packages from the richer EU countries, though one could argue that official unemployment of &gt;25% in fact equates to collapse.<br><br><a href=#c7915648326835376829 title="comment permalink">1/7/14, 2:12 AM</a><br><br>

Although aussie public hospitals will treat anyone (except tourists) for free, getting treatment when you need it can be problematic. My missus had polio when she was a bub, so we know there are certain things coming up that will need attention, that the public system will view as "elective". Her prosthetic hip is tipped to last somewhere between 7 and 25 years. Back in 1996 when the prosthetic was installed, the total bill to the insurance company was about 35 grand (for a near 6 week stay in hospital, due to complications with a split femur). Her knee job two years ago came in at a little under half that. Jim Kunstler's recent stay in a New York hospital had a 15 grand per night bed &amp; breakfast fee, let alone the actual surgery and anaesthetic. You guys really are being fracked. <br>Chris, re off grid and batteries, I recently tracked down some Ni-Fe batteries from a guy (almost) near you in Healesville. Anecdotally there are examples of these made by Edison before the first world war that are still in service, with greater than 50% of their original storage capacity. The old ones mostly seem to stop working due to breakdown of the battery casing.<br>The new ones have casings made of:<br>drumroll...<br>polypropylene.<br>Dang. Fracked again. While the new casings should last better than the old ones, the capability to manufacture them into the future is therefore limited and large scale application will never happen, never mind how plentiful the materials for the battery chemistry are (Nickel, Iron and Potassium Hydroxide).<br>So on a purely selfish plane, I figure that these batteries will allow the missus to continue to enjoy her somewhat middle class existence for the rest of her life; we'll continue to work our butts off to make this farm sustainable and those who come after us will still be able to enjoy lighting and other low voltage applications until the end of the century or so (hail storms notwithstanding). The neighbours of the future will have to come here to use the ham radio.<br>Finally, I was over having a squiz at JHK's blog just now and in the sidebar was an ad for oilprice.com that read "For every investor that missed out on the shale &amp; gas boom: THE NEXT 5 OIL &amp; GAS TRENDS". I couldn't resist and had to go and look at https://oilprice.com/premium/transcript?p=42 - could not stop laughing.

I'd say it's pretty universal to encourage people to play nice with some version of the golden rule. But it's also pretty universal to draw circles around your own in-group - The People, the brethren, (true) human beings, or whatever. So you can pretty easily constrict the rule to exclude Blacks (not really human) or spiritual leaders can try to expand it to include all humans or all living creatures. The religious challenge in times of collapse and conflict is to keep that circle of True Fellow Humans from tightening like a noose down to nation / village / family / self. Or, it may be as some doomers claim, that the noose may be the binding that keeps you and your loved ones alive as others founder.

Now let me tell you about my actual experience with 23andMe and with mainstream medical health-care providers when it comes to screening tests:<br><br>There have been some highly publicized glitches, but my experience with the 23andMe results is that they are presented clearly, quantitatively, and with abundant caveats and qualifications. A numerical estimate of your increased or decreased risk is given, so you can see if the estimated risk is 8% higher or 68% higher. You are also told what the basis for this risk estimation is (well-established versus preliminary research) so you can gage how reliable the information is. <br><br>Now, with ordinary health care providers. I have found that they run screening tests arbitrarily without even asking me in advance if I want them. The result are presented vaguely, without much explanation, and often with referrals for follow-ups. Additional research on my part usually shows that these recommended followups are not actually supported by solid research, and even the value of the screening test is usually revealed to be questionable at best. <br><br>And which one does the FDA decide to drop the axe on? Perhaps the one that is NOT making as much money for the health care industry and its habit of overly aggressive screening and treatment? So 23andMe might make someone forgo a colonoscopy? Good for them. The actual benefits of routine colonoscopies in the absence of other risk factors are dubious at best. The odds that your life will be saved by detecting an early-stage cancer are similar to the odds that your colon will be perforated.<br><br><a href=#c9210634273350750263 title="comment permalink">1/7/14, 12:39 PM</a><br><br>

Copper Indium Gallium Selenide, CdTe (Cadmium Telluride), and amorphous silicon are all moisture sensitive materials, so the actual semiconductor material slowly corrodes as water (vapor) diffuses into the modules.<br><br>Crystalline silicon, particularly mono crystalline cells, are themselves pretty impervious to moisture. Failure is due to emitter shunts (bad processing/defective wafers/poor design), cracking solder joints (bad processing/bad design), corrosion of solder/metallization (water/corrosives influx),<br>interconnect shunts (water/tin whiskers), and open circuits due to cell cracking (preexisting defects, poor encapsulation).<br><br>While emitter shunts are hard to deal with (one could conceivable find localized shunts and grind them out - but emitter poisoning is impossible to fix), all of the interconnection issues could be dealt with by someone with simple tools.<br><br>A D'Arsonval meter with battery for resistance and shunts for current measurements, pointy knives, soldering tools. Some wire, ideally silver plated, solder, and ideally some kind of goo to seal things a bit.<br><br>(assuming polymer backsheets - glass-glass modules are much harder to fix).<br><br>Fixing modules is virtually never done today, just too expensive due to the labor hours in the current scheme of things, but if/when the grid goes down, my take is that the caretakers/neighbors/passers-by of any large no-longer-grid tied PV array are going to walk off with as many modules as they can carry.<br><br>A PV module (or several), without an inverter, can drive DC motors for water pumping (domestic, irrigation, solar hot water systems, aquaculture, etc.) With some attention, it can even charge a battery, though one must monitor the battery very closely.<br><br>I would predict some itinerant "lectromen" (did you read <i>Star's Reach</i>?).<br>This class of trades-people would travel about like tinkers used to, fixing up PV and small wind systems, and things like simple DC motors (without power semi-conductors, one must use brushes and commutators, which wear out).<br>They test, recondition, and accept trade-ins for new and rebuilt batteries. Some might sell/repair lights, radios, electrical meters, battery hygrometers, etc.<br><br>There are simple relay based regulators that could be used for more un-attended battery charging, but labor may well be cheaper.<br><br>I could foresee on a farmstead/small hamlet, that the cripples/elders/kids would be put to work keeping solar ovens/cookers, batch solar water heaters, and PV arrays with associated batteries tracking toward the sun, attending to the food being prepared, using the batches of hot water to wash clothes/dishes/etc.<br><br>The other folks will be out in the fields… doing hard manual labor.

There certainly are similarities between the two systems. The 4 element of geomancy is exactly the same as that of astrology i.e. 4 quadrants generated by orthogonal two axises of order vs. chaos and inner vs. outer. These quadrants are 4 boxes for sorting any mental object. Following Ptolemy, if you further subdivide each quadrant/element into whether the activity of the object is increasing, fixed, or dissipating; you get the 12 signs of the zodiac and their corresponding 12 houses. <br><br>Geomancy does not require a time and place to calculate the contents of the houses. Though, in the chart type I used, these houses do correspond directly to those in astrology. The figures (one per house and three others I did not disclose) are generated by unconscious choice, much like I Ching figures are generated, and not by time and date as in astrology. Each geomatic figure represents a unique situation where each of the four elements is either active or inactive (2^4 gives 16 possible geomatic figures). <br><br>Prison for example represents a situation where fire (chaotic attention directed outward i.e strong desires/emotions) and earth (ordered attention directed outward i.e. a concern for concrete practical issues) absence air (ordered attention on inner objects i.e. no relationships with other minds) and water (chaotic attention directed inward i.e. no vision or myth). This would be a person or group trapped in the material world with no guiding vision or connection to others i.e. in a prison of some sort. <br><br>If the forgoing gave the impression I know what I was talking about, pleased be forewarned. Even if you were to take the leap and accept geomancy as an effective way of determining future trends (something I'm not committed to myself if for no other reason that I see something in the system that may make it be internally contradictory), you'd have to factor in the fact that I really don't know what I'm doing. I'm completely new at it. So, if you live in a climate like mine, you could go to any road and find a big chunk salt suitable for use in digesting my initial post. Rinse off the sand first though!<br><br>I did the chart mostly for fun. As our indulgent host did in fact write a book on geomancy (which I had just finished reading and enjoyed very much) I though it would be appropriate given his reticence with respect to specific forecasts. Besides, if the start of the year isn't a good time for reading oracles, when is? <br><br>@ Thread on Golden Rule<br><br>For what its worth, I think all that is really important is what works. Societies that work (sustain happiness) are societies where people don't exploit each other. The Golden Rule works reasonably well towards that end. Still it must be applied wisely since there are times when you have to be cruel to be kind. Its the kindness that matters.<br><br><a href=#c5512588161345514870 title="comment permalink">1/8/14, 5:06 PM</a><br><br>

"You" forms, in Old and Middle English, were the plural forms. The singular form was "thou" and its related forms. Over time, English speakers dropped "thou" and began using the plural "you" (and its original subject form "ye") for both singular and plural. "Thou" was dropped from common speech by the Early Modern English period (around 1500), but was retained in poetic and religious writing for a few centuries after that.<br><br>One area where I would love to see humanization take place is to restore live people to answer the telephones.
