<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week’s post on the contemporary culture of apocalypse fandom was also, more broadly, about the increasingly frantic attempts being made to ignore the future that’s looming ahead of us. Believing that the world as we know it is about to crash into ruin, popular as it is, is only one of several strategies put to work in those attempts. There’s also the claim that we can keep industrial civilization going on renewable energy sources, the claim that a finite planet can somehow contain an infinite supply of cheap fossil fuel—well, those of my readers who know their way around today’s nonconversation about energy and the future will be all too familiar with the thirty-one flavors of denial.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s ironic, though predictable, that these claims have been repeated ever more loudly as the evidence for a less comfortable view of things has mounted up. Most recently, for example, a thorough <a href=http://energyskeptic.com/2013/tilting-at-windmills-spains-solar-pv/ >study of the Spanish solar energy program</a> by Pedro Prieto and Charles A.S. Hall has worked out the net energy of large-scale solar photovoltaic systems on the basis of real-world data. It’s not pleasant reading if you happen to believe that today’s lifestyles can be supported on sunlight; they calculate that the energy return on energy invested (EROEI) of Spain’s solar energy sector works out to 2.48—about a third of the figure suggested by less comprehensive estimates. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<div style="text-align: left">
The Prieto/Hall study has already come in for criticism, some of it reasonable, some of it less so. A crucial point, though, has been left out of most of the resulting discussions. According to best current estimates, the EROEI needed to sustain an industrial civilization of any kind is somewhere between 10 and 12; according<span style="font-size: small"> to <span style="font-family: Times">most other calculations—leaving out the optimistic estimates being circulated by solar promoters as sales pitches—the</span> </span>EROEI of large scale solar photovoltaic systems comes in between 8 and 9. Even if Prieto and Hall are dead wrong, in other words, the energy return from solar PV isn’t high enough to support the kind of industrial system needed to manufacture and maintain solar PV.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If they’re right, or if the actual figure falls between their estimate and those of the optimists, the point’s even harder to dodge. </div>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Similar challenges face every other attempt to turn renewable energy into a replacement for fossil fuels. I’m thinking especially of the <a href=http://www.theoildrum.com/node/8322>study published a few years back</a> that showed, on solid thermodynamic grounds, that the total energy that can be taken from the planet’s winds is a small fraction of what windpower advocates think they can get. The logic here is irrefutable:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>there’s a finite amount of energy in wind, and what you extract in one place won’t turn the blades of another wind turbine somewhere else. Thus there’s a hard upper limit to how much energy windpower can put into the grid—and it’s not enough to provide more than a small fraction of the power needed by an industrial civilization; furthermore, estimates of the EROEI of windpower cluster around 9, which again is too little to support a society that can build and maintain wind turbines. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Point such details out to people in the contemporary green movement, and you can count on fielding an angry insistence that there’s got to be some way to run industrial civilization on renewables, since we can’t just keep on burning fossil fuels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’m not at all sure how many of the people who make this sort of statement realize just how odd it is. It’s as though they think some good fairy promised them that there would always be enough energy to support their current lifestyles, and the only challenge is figuring out where she hid it. Not so; the question at issue is not how we’re going to keep industrial fueled, but whether we can do it at all, and the answer emerging from the data is not one that they want to hear: nothing—no resource or combination of resources available to humanity at this turning of history’s wheel—can support industrial civilization once we finish using up the half a billion years of fossil sunlight that made industrial civilization briefly possible in the first place. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Green activists are quite right, though, that we can’t just keep on burning fossil fuels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We can’t just keep on burning fossil fuels because fossil fuels are a finite resource, we’ve already burnt through most of what’s economically viable to extract, and the EROEI of what’s left is dropping steadily as quality declines and costs rise. Back in the day when most petroleum on the market was light sweet crude from shallow onshore wells, its EROEI could be as high as 200; nowadays, a large and growing fraction of liquid fuels comes from deep offshore fields, fracked shales, tar sands, and other energy- and resource-intensive places, so the average for petroleum as a whole is down somewhere around 30 and sinking. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A common bad habit of contemporary thought assumes that gradual changes don’t mean anything until some threshold slips past, at which point things go boom in one way or another. Some processes in the real world happen that way, but it’s far more common for gradual shifts to have gradual impacts all along the trajectory of change. A good case can be made that EROEI decline is one such process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For more than a decade now, the world’s economies have stumbled from one crisis to another, creaking and groaning through what would likely have been visible contraction if the mass production of paper wealth out of thin air hadn’t been been cranked into overdrive to produce the illusion of normality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Plenty of explanations have been proposed for the current era of economic unraveling, but I’d like to suggest that the most important factor is the overall decline in the “energy profit” that makes modern economies possible at all. EROEI is to a civilization what gross profit is to a business, the source of the surplus that supports the entire enterprise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the overall EROEI of industrial civilization contracts, habits that were affordable in an era of abundance profit stop being viable, and decline sets in. Long before that figure drops to the point that an industrial system can no longer be supported at all, most of us will have long since lost access to the products of that system, because every drop of liquid fuel and every scrap of most other industrial resources will long since have been commandeered for critical needs or reserved for the wealthiest and most powerful among us. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The twilight of the industrial age, in other words, isn’t somewhere conveniently far off in the future; it’s happening now, in the slow, ragged, uneven, but inexorable manner that’s normal for great historical transformations. Trying to insist that this can’t be happening, that there has to be some way to keep up our extravagant lifestyles when the energetic and material basis of that extravagance is rapidly depleting away from beneath us, may be emotionally comforting but it doesn’t change, or even address, the hard facts of our predicament.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like the fashionable apocalypticism discussed last week, it simply provides an excuse for inaction at a time when action is necessary but difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Set aside all those excuses, and the hard question that remains is what to do about it all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Any answer to that question has to start by taking seriously the limits imposed by our situation, and by choices made in the decades already past. Proposing some grand project to get the entire world ready for the end of the age of abundance, for example, is wasted breath; even if the political will could be found—and it’s been missing in action since 1980 or so—the resources that might have made such a project possible were burned to fuel three decades of unsustainable extravagance. While new systems are being built, remember, the old ones have to stay functional long enough to keep people fed, housed, and supplied with other necessities of life, and we’ve passed the point at which the resources still exist to do both on any large scale. As the Hirsch report pointed out back in 2005, a meaningful response to the peaking of petroleum production had to begin at least twenty years in advance of the peak to avoid catastrophic disruptions; that didn’t happen in time, and there’s no point in pretending otherwise. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Any response to the twilight of the industrial age, in other words, will have to function within the constraints of a society already in the early stages of the Long Descent—a society in which energy and resources are increasingly hard for most people to obtain, in which the infrastructure that supports current lifestyles are becoming ever more brittle and prone to dysfunction, and in which most people will have to contend with the consequences of economic contraction, political turmoil, and social disintegration. As time passes, furthermore, all these pressures can be counted on to increase, and any improvement in conditions that takes place will be temporary. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All this places harsh constraints on any attempt to do anything constructive in response to the end of industrial civilization. Still, there are still options available, and I want to talk about one of those here:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>an option that could make the decline a little less bitter, the dark age that will follow it a little less dark, and the recovery afterwards a little easier. Compared to grand plans to save the world in a single leap, that may not sound like much—but it certainly beats sitting one one’s backside daydreaming about future societies powered by green vaporware, on the one hand, or imaginary cataclysms that will relieve us of our responsibility toward the future on the other. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s only in the imagination of true believers in the invincibility of progress that useful technologies can never be lost. History shows the same thing with painful clarity:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>over and over again, technologies in common use during the peak years of a civilization have been lost during the dark age that followed, and had to be brought in again from some other society or reinvented from scratch once the dark age was over and rebuilding could begin. It’s a commonplace of history, though, that if useful technologies can be preserved during the declining years of a society, they can spread relatively rapidly through the successor states of the dark age period and become core elements of the new civilization that follows. A relatively small number of people can preserve a technology, furthermore, by the simple acts of learning it, practicing it, and passing it on to the next generation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Not every technology is well suited for this sort of project, though. The more complex a technology is, the more dependent it is on exotic materials or concentrated energy sources, and the more infrastructure it requires, the less the chance that it can be preserved in the face of a society in crisis. Furthermore, if the technology doesn’t provide goods or services that will be useful to people during the era of decline or the dark age that follows, its chances of being preserved at all are not good at a time when resources are too scarce to divert into unproductive uses. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those are tight constraints, but I’ve identified seven technological suites that can be sustained on a very limited resource base, produce goods or services of value even under dark age conditions, and could contribute mightily to the process of rebuilding if they get through the next five centuries or so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<b>1. Organic intensive gardening.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve commented before that when future historians look back on the twentieth century, the achievement of ours that they’ll consider most important is the creation of food growing methods that build soil fertility rather than depleting it and are sustainable on a time scale of millennia. The best of the current systems of organic intensive gardening require no resource inputs other than locally available biomass, hand tools, and muscle power, and produce a great deal of food from a relatively small piece of ground. Among the technologies included in this suite, other than the basics of soil enhancement and intensive plant and animal raising, are composting, food storage and preservation, and solar-powered season extenders such as cold frames and greenhouses. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<b>2. Solar thermal technologies.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most of the attention given to solar energy these days focuses on turning sunlight into electricity, but electricity isn’t actually that useful in terms of meeting basic human needs. Far more useful is heat, and sunlight can be used forheat with vastly greater efficiencies than it can be turned into electrical current. Water heating, space heating, cooking, food preservation, and many other useful activities can all be done by concentrating the rays of the sun or collecting solar heat in an insulated space. Doing these things with sunlight rather than wood heat or some other fuel source will take significant stress off damaged ecosystems while meeting a great many human needs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<b>3. Sustainable wood heating.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the Earth’s temperate zones, solar thermal technologies can’t stand alone, and a sustainable way to produce fuel is thus high up on the list of necessities. Coppicing, a process that allows repeated harvesting of fuel wood from the same tree, and other methods of producing flammable biomass without burdening local ecosystems belong to this technological suite; so do rocket stoves and other high-efficiency means of converting wood fuel into heat. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<b>4. Sustainable health care.</b> Health care as it’s practiced in the world’s industrial nations is hopelessly unsustainable, dependent as it is on concentrated energy and resource inputs and planetwide supply chains.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As industrial society disintegrates, current methods of health care will have to be replaced by methods that require much less energy and other resources, and can be put to use by family members and local practitioners. Plenty of work will have to go into identifying practices that belong in this suite, since the entire field is a minefield of conflicting claims issuing from the mainstream medical industry as well as alternative health care; the sooner the winnowing gets under way, the better. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<b>5. Letterpress printing and its related technologies</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One crucial need in an age of decline is the ability to reproduce documents from before things fell apart. Because the monasteries of early medieval Europe had no method of copying faster than monks with pens, much of what survived the fall of Rome was lost during the following centuries as manuscripts rotted faster than they could be copied. In Asia, by contrast, hand-carved woodblock printing allowed documents to be mass produced during the same era; this helps explain why learning, science, and technology recovered more rapidly in post-Tang dynasty China and post-Heian Japan than in the post-Roman West.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Printing presses with movable type were made and used in the Middle Ages, and inkmaking, papermaking, and bookbinding are equally simple, so these are well within the range of craftspeople in the deindustrial dark ages ahead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<b>6. Low-tech shortwave radio.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The ability to communicate over long distances at a speed faster than a horse can ride is another of the significant achievements of the last two centuries, and deserves to be passed onto the future. While the scientific advances needed to work out the theory radio required nearly three hundred years of intensive study of physics, the technology itself is simple—an ordinarily enterprising medieval European or Chinese alchemist could easily have put together a working radio transmitter and receiver, along with the metal-acid batteries needed to power them, if he had known how.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The technical knowledge in the amateur radio community, which has begun to get interested in low-tech, low-power methods again after a long flirtation with high-end technologies, could become a springboard to handbuilt radio technologies that could keep going after the end of industrial society. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<b>7. Computer-free mathematics.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Until recently, it didn’t take a computer to crunch the numbers needed to build a bridge, navigate a ship, balance profits against losses, or do any of ten thousand other basic or not-so-basic mathematical operations; slide rules, nomographs, tables of logarithms, or the art of double-entry bookkeeping did the job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In the future, after computers stop being economically viable to maintain and replace, those same tasks will still need to be done, but the knowledge of how to do them without a computer is at high risk of being lost. If that knowledge can be gotten back into circulation and kept viable as the computer age winds down, a great many tasks that will need to be done in the deindustrial future will be much less problematic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
(It’s probably necessary to repeat here that the reasons our descendants a few generations from now won’t be surfing the internet or using computers at all are economic, not technical. If you want to build and maintain computers, you need an industrial infrastructure that can manufacture integrated circuits and other electronic components, and that requires an extraordinarily complex suite of technologies, sprawling supply chains, and a vast amount of energy—all of which has to be paid for. It’s unlikely that any society in the deindustrial dark ages will have that kind of wealth available; if any does, many other uses for that wealth will make more sense in a deindustrialized world; and in an age when human labor is again much cheaper than mechanical energy, it will be more affordable to hire people to do the routine secretarial, filing, and bookkeeping tasks currently done by computers than to find the resources to support the baroque industrial infrastructure needed to provide computers for those tasks.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
(The reason it’s necessary to repeat this here is that whenever I point out that computers won’t be economically viable in a deindustrial world, I field a flurry of outraged comments pretending that I haven’t mentioned economic issues at all, and insisting that computers are so cool that the future can’t possibly do without them. Here again, it’s as though they think a good fairy promised them something—and they aren’t paying attention to all the legends about the way that fairy gifts turn into a handful of dry leaves the next morning. We now return you to your regularly scheduled
<i>Archdruid Report</i>.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Organic gardens, solar and wood heat, effective low-tech health care, printed books, shortwave radios and a facility with slide rules and logarithms:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>those aren’t a recipe for the kind of civilization we have today, nor are they a recipe for a kind of civilization that’s existed in the past. It’s precisely the inability to imagine anything else that’s crippled our collective ability to think about the future. One of the lessons of history, as Arnold Toynbee pointed out, is that the decline and fall of every civilization follows the same track down but the journey back up to a new civilization almost always breaks new ground. It would be equally accurate to point out that the decline and fall of a civilization is driven by humanity in the mass, but the way back up is inevitably the work of some small creative minority with its own unique take on things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The time of that minority is still far in the future, but plenty of things that can be done right now can give the creative minds of the future more options to work with.</div>

In a New York Review of Books article, Krugman revealed that he was the research assistant for William Nordhaus’ landmark paper, “The Allocation of Energy Resources.” He “spent long hours immured in Yale’s Geology Library, poring over Bureau of Mines circulars and the like.” If someone with his experience with the economy of energy doesn’t get Peak Oil, then it’s probably hopeless for most economists to comprehend the issue. James Hamilton of UC San Diego is about it.

In my view the great advances in many of the fields you mention are not, strictly speaking, technological. I'd rather call them, for want of a better word, scientific. The greatest leap we've made in health care - I'd say it's a worthy contestant for the title of 'most important achievement of industrial civilisation as seen through the lens of future generations' - is undoubtedly the germ theory of disease. It leads to some very sustainable technologies (washing your hands, putting your knife into a fire before lancing a boil) that have very good results.<br>Would you call the germ theory a part of a technology, or would you limit your use of the word to more strictly technological achievements?<br><br>By the way: it seems that unfortunately and, if I may use so strong a word, insanely, the germ theory is contested in some areas of alt-med.<br>It's one of the problems of being ahead of the pack, I think: if you're not running <i>with</i> the pack, you're automatically on the fringe, which puts you in close association with those who end up on the fringe for, ahem, other reasons.<br><br><br>On a more cheerful note: yesterday my copy of <i>Green Wizardry</i> finally arrived.

Today I finished making a system to be able to develop mushroom spawn, its still hepa filter dependent.I know their are mushroom cultivation methods that don't need lab space, but being able to do lab work for a few years will be very helpful in leeping that option open. Hopefully the worm bin will be going together this week, but set backs abound.<br><br>When it comes to solar thermal I am concerned by how many gardening systems are dependent on fairly short lived plastic. Also glass doesn't have a great life expectancy if social order drops below a thresh hold. That does leave alot of good solar thermal work to do, but the gains with out glass are smaller. Thermal mass is of interest where I'm sitting, there are alot of thinks I love about the high elevation here, but it makes for wide temperature swings. Increasing the intercourse between earth and air I hope can help. Digging machines are still around, now its the time to dig some berms, onces made a good one can be maintained easily for a long time.

I was a bit of a math nerd growing up to be sure, but I am surprised by how serious most peoples innumeracy is right now. Many people can't measure, or run simple figures in their head. I am starting to suspect that simply being a math nerd may be enough for a millennial to stay busy. Helping projects conceptualize numbers, once the computers get too frustrating and pricey to use, and the numbers that products come with aren't enough to muddle forward. Heck, at this point alot of the "professional mathamancers" are all just fancy dancers. Me? I haven't been schooled in math since 8th grade, but I think numbers alot. Right now I can make cellular automata calculators on go boards which can sum hundreds of numbers, do multiplication, division, and a few mathematical properties that are stable behaviors but I can't find names for. Too bad the current form is only practical for people who can think in a Fibonacci Numerals system instead of base-10; on the other hand, lots of people are so tramatized by numbers from school that a different system is soothing.

Think of the Renaissance, to cite only one example -- a lot of people looked at what was going on in their own cultures, looked at what had been around in Greek and Roman times, and decided that an older set of values made a lot of sense to them. It's only in the middle and upper classes of current industrial societies, and the canned histories they repeat to themselves, that the idea of going back to get out of a blind alley is unthinkable -- and they'll catch on eventually. <br><br>Ray, yes, glass is crucial, and it can be made with medieval technologies from recycled glass or clean sand -- that's something that would be well worth putting time into learning to make. As for a number system based on Fibonacci numbers and the Golden Section, er, perhaps you haven't heard of traditional Pythagorean sacred geometry, which is all about that, and is sustainable in a medieval setting (that was standard in the last round of dark ages in the West, you know) as well as useful and beautiful.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c8497236504993338280 title="comment permalink">1/15/14, 10:49 PM</a><br><br>

How do you define industrial civilization? What features makes it industrial? and what are the energy needs of this features? can those features be achieved by lower energy needs?<br><br>For example: Technical houshold items such as small kitchen devices, entertainment and large devices such as washing machines, dishwashers and so on. All those items are designed with planned obsolescence. You have to replace (in current industrial civilization) them every few years, but it is technically no problem to design them (without additional costs worth mentioning) them to properly work for decades. So the same feature can be implemented on a smaller resource base. <br><br>Next example: Heating. Lets say heated homes for every one are a feature of industrial civilization. Of course the current way of implementing this feature, heating with a lot of energy in badly insulated homes, is not sustainable on any energy source. But it is possible to build well insulated homes without a lot of fancy technology (using strawbales or cellulosebased insulation) and satisfy the resulting (small) energy demand with the little fancy technology still available on the smaller resource base. <br><br>Example Medicine: Cuba is a great example how you can provide a very good medical service (just look at life exspectancy there) using medical science to fill the doctors brains and not their wallets. If you say that that access to scientific medical service is a feature of an industrial society, than i do not see why this feature has to be dropped on a shrinking resource base. <br><br>How many resources do we waste do build and heat office buildings and to commute to them every day in cars to do a job that can be done at home, thanks to the internet, the latter one being less energy intensive. <br><br>Before you say that i quibble over details, those are just examples to make my point. We all know that our current way of living has to change if want that or not. But when making bold statements such as claiming the end of civilization, we have to be careful. We alle agree that there is no way to power our current industrial civilization. But that does not mean that we have to drop all the features of industrial civilization. <br><br>From a bottom up approach to estimate our possible future standard of living i would suggest to make a list of features of industrial civilization and then to find for each feature the least energy intensive way to implement them, then priorize them and then see how many items you can implement on a given resource base. <br><br>So i guess we will have to drop the individual car, human space travel and making vacations around the world. But maybe we do not have to drop access to mobility (public transport), acces to information-exchange/multimedia ans access to cooled/frozen foods. Access to comfortably temperatured homes. Access to Medicine. You name it. <br><br>I am sorry to say that this article is just another bold claim about the end of our civilization. But this claim has to be fed by facts. What of our energy goes into what needs (in germany: transport 35%, room heating 25%, process heat 22%, hot water 5%, light 3,7%, information/ communication 2,5%, cooling 2,4%) and what technology enables us to get what feature on a smaller energy base. Looks as internet fridges and and electric light will long be available. <br><br>After such an evaluation you can make predictions that are believable.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c3122939590861045871 title="comment permalink">1/15/14, 11:30 PM</a><br><br>

I cut my first half acre of sweet chestnut and oak last week. Although the resulting gap in the forest now looks like someone has gone mad with a chainsaw, the stumps will now be protected from rabbits and deer and each will have grown 4 or 5 new trunks when I next harvest them in 2022. In the meantime I have about 150 trees to haul out and turn into something useful. I led a group of about 20 interested people around the woods afterwards, explaining what was going on and how the woods would now be regenerated and much more biodiverse. <br><br>Next winter I will harvest the next section, in what will be a 12 year cycle.<br><br>There’s a dizzying array of things that can be done with the wood. Traditionally, in these parts, the coppiced wood was used for making props to hold up the mine shafts for the tin miners. These days, most coppice woods are overstood and abandoned … just waiting for a Green Wizard to turn up and make a livelihood out of them. Generally, woodland is much cheaper to buy than agricultural land as the industrial economy only values it by the timber it can produce - which is not very high by modern rapacious capitalism’s standards. This seems like a great opportunity to me. Coppicing trees in temperate zones is probably one of the easiest ways to turn solar power into useable products. All the offcuts that are left over can be thrown into an old oil barrel (1 pound on eBay) and turned into charcoal. Trees just grow, they don’t require much husbandry. You leave the finest specimens alone - some of those big straight oak trees will be allowed to become standards, meaning that they will provide me with some pension income in 30 or so years.<br><br>Anyone thinking of making a living out of living in the woods should read Ben Law’s book The Woodland Way. His approach is holistic and he gets more or less everything from his woods - including food, construction materials, medicine etc. It’s a way of life that has existed for thousands of years in Britain, and was only extinguished when cheap imported wood became available. <br><br>I’ll be updating my <a href=http://talesfromfoxwood.blogspot.co.uk rel=nofollow>Fox Wood blog</a> with pictures and explanations of the coppicing in a few days’ time.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c9019881743404985798 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 12:50 AM</a><br><br>

Do you think a people with this traits of character AND the scientific and technological legacy germany has would jump head first into the adventure of going renewable if there were no way of achieving the task of creating a sustainable way of industrial civilization? <br><br>You said it takes decades of work and of course that is true and that is the reason why current government plans have directions and targets for the timeframe up to 2050. The decades of work are not only planned but broad implementation is well under way for a dozend years now. And so far every single year we exceeded the plans. <br><br>Of course there are political quibbles bout the details of implementing it, about the way of paying for it, about the role of government and the market forces and so on. But this does not change the fact that every single political party is aware of the necessity of change. Be aware that the media of your world will cherry pick details of those quibbles to paint a picture of the german energy transition being an expensive mess. But despite the high prices of fuel ($7,50 a gallon due to taxes) and elctricity (second highes rate in Europe) we are the nation with the largest trade surplus on the planet, so we are living proof that highly valuable industrial goods can be produced on a small resource base. <br><br>So why do i demand a detailed assessment before making a claim? Because thats how may world works. For example the entire german housing and construction industry is doing this very assessment for low energy buildings for a decade now, since all their future business models are based on that. In my world I just have to google the results. Zero-Energy-Housing costs in construction 5% more than a traditional house per area. Thats peanuts. But its the technology to get rid of whopping 25% of our energy needs that we use for space heating. Of course it takes decades to replace or insulate the entire housing stock. But implementation is well under way. <br><br>And dont forget that all of your EROEI-assessements are current states of technology. For example today the masts of wind turbines are made of steel. In lower saxony there is a 300 ft wooden mast carrying a 100 ton wind generator and it works so well that four more are planned. This has the potential to greatly reduce the EROEI od this technology, since you do not have to process the steel. So current EROEIs of renewables are just that, current EROEIs. Those numbers will rise year until we reach the physical limits. This is a long process. <br> <br><br>I cannot possibly summarize the loads of information my world posesses in a comment on your blog. I just can give examples to underline the statements i am making. But be aware that many questions that your world is debating about a already answered in my world with the answer being implemented right now. And be also aware that not "the world" is in decline, but that "your world" is in decline. For you that may not be a difference, but for most people on this planet it is.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c5578172657585455298 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 1:14 AM</a><br><br>

From what I've read, the EROEI of an average hydroelectric dam is around 100:1, and sometimes can be even higher, which puts it on par with the best fossil-fuel resources. Could small communities in the future cluster around areas where these dams could be built, providing them with a modest amount of electricity? It might be challenging to build and maintain that much concrete, but from what I understand, the ancient Romans had access to the technology necessary to produce concrete, so using hydroelectric power in the future might not be out of the question. It might even allow a greater range of technologies to be preserved in the long-term.

The early industrial revolution in England was based on these technologies, and they were all initially powered by water and constructed by local blacksmiths. Still, there are places (such as in the Outer Hebrides in Scotland) where hand spinning and weaving are still practised commercially, and on a significant scale. Harris tweed is known the world over, and is still produced on hand looms, from hand-spun yarn, by people for whom it's only one component of their livelihood.<br><br>One other technology that I think might manage to hang on is precision engineering - not in its modern, computer-assisted form of course, but the basic concepts of precision measurement are much harder to develop from scratch than they are to maintain, and they allow such an improvement in the efficiency and reliability of even simple machines (such as bicycles, or treadle lathes) that they seem like they might well be useful in the future.

And sulfuric acid requires sulfur, which is found here and there in small to middling quantities, made by the earth in volcanic activity or deposited with petroleum or coal. <br><br>Now in addition to the acid, you need metals. It isn't that the earth's supply of metals have declined, they are constant. But to refine metals again requires fire. I believe the Romans mowed down entire forests to get enough wood for their metal reduction projects. <br><br>So batteries are obviously a tiny niche product. Same goes for things like glassmaking ... how about a nice niche for lesser grades of silicon (good enough for PV but not necessarily for electronics)? <br><br>IMNSHO, the problem with that low-EROEI Spanish solar project is that they are trying to scale it to industrial proportions. A lot of losses are incurred in conversion and transmission and storage in that attempt. The central Asian villager using a single panel to power a variety of small machines could be making much better use of PV. <br><br>As another key technology I would like to nominate polymer chemistry. Something that was known to the ancients as more of a craft or art form, but came into its own as a technology in the last century. <br><br>And despite its bad reputation (that floating plastic sargasso sea comes to mind), polymers are useful things ... paint is a nice example. It preserves wood or metal objects and gives them a longer life. <br><br>Also please note that polymers do not require petroleum. Though they are generally made from petroleum now, traditional polymers are made from things like flax seeds and the sap of the rubber tree.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c7861146801681344007 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 4:11 AM</a><br><br>

Metals workers for many generations to come will not want for raw material to work.<br><br>With an understanding of simple mechanics and simple technologies like pedals, treadles, belts, cranks etc, metal workers, mechanics and carpenters of the future should be able to create lots of simple human powered machines.<br><br>In my youth I once saw a disused hand powered grain winnowing machine in a shed. It was a large wooden box, with a handle and most of the internal moving parts were wood. The few metal parts could be easily made by a blacksmith. Also common in my youth were disused treadle spinning machines, for spinning wool, also made mostly of wood, with a few simple metal parts.<br><br>As a teenage farm labourer I once cut up a few buckets of fodder beet with a knife. This is a slow, tedious job and dangerous when your not used to it. But many small farms at the time still had hand powered machines called mangles for the job. I never used one, but from talking to those who did a team of two could fill a wheel barrow with shredded fodder beet in a few minutes, of moderate work.<br><br>Also common in my youth were hand powered water pumps. Back then I spent some time one winter hand pumping water for housed cattle. Not as easy as a modern electric pump, but light years ahead of carrying buckets.<br><br>Even if future humans cannot make super efficient, super durable industrially produced Victorian style human powered machines like water pumps, bicycles, treadle sowing machines, or fodder beet mangles, future village carpenters and blacksmiths will certainly be able to build simple human powered machines for tasks like winnowing grain and spinning wool. Necessity being the mother of invention the same skills can be turned to making all kinds of human powered labour saving devices for the countless repetitive tasks required to run households, small farms, workshops and small businesses.<br><br>Human power is the real renewable energy source of the future, the key is to combine it with simple mechanics and produce human powered machines to increase labour productivity.

This is the kind of post that needs to be made into a (letterpress) broadside and displayed widely. Your list makes good sense both individually and as a system - an important point is that one hole in a complex system can grind many other things to a halt. <br><br>One way I practice this is to constantly ask myself what inputs are needed for whatever process or tool I’m using – how many diverse or complex things/processes are needed to get me to this stage? If they are very complex, or very dependent on farflung sources, I start looking for more manual or local versions. I have noticed also that one’s tools dictate one’s layout – ie: to use a power mower, you must have a flat, rectangular lawn of generally one species of plant. There is no room with a rototiller to stop and allow a volunteer plant to grow, etc. Manual tools are allowing me to have a different relationship to my yard and my life. More silence, more time for contemplation… much less stress from noise and hurry.<br><br>I know I'm biased - the only things on that list I haven't done is shortwave and thermal power. But I just got 5 plastic fresnel lenses (it was a package) and can't wait for the Oregon fogs to lift so I can try them. I have a slide rule and soroban; I do organic intensive (and every year learn more and more); I had my own letterpress for a while and still own some type - and I can make and bind books; I have a decent herb garden and both "Where There is No Doctor" and "Where there is No Dentist" - both fascinating! - as well as many natural medicine books. A rocket stove is on my list of things to build... and really, it's fun! Most of these processes are fascinating and it feels like when I was a kid with a chemistry set (oh yeah - and I just bought myself a chemistry set - totally wimpy compared with what I had back in the 60's, but I guess they don't trust kids anymore. ;-))<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c8163225920791323909 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 7:13 AM</a><br><br>

Some of the "lowest hanging apples" in terms of energy/cost input have the highest return. Our home energy independence plan also includes a russian oven in the kitchen (conveniently under our bedroom) and restoring our "remuddled" rumford fireplace. We're also trying to start a co-op that can use "experienced masons" to get rocket mass heaters installed to code. I'm trying to learn and record as much as I can about all of these. <br><br>But to me, there's one technology you missed which I've come to feel is very important. We hypothetically "grow 100% of our own food" based upon our dietary and caloric needs. However, we utterly lack the culinary technology to easily turn that hypothetical abundance into real meals. Processing and storing take WAY more time than growing. I don't know of any homesteaders who have solved this problem, or eat a diet that will be sustainable beyond the "green revolution" of fossil fueled grains. That intersection between "what to grow" and "how to use it" could use a lot of work. FYI to maximize our free time and minimize our labor, we're focusing on developing Jerusalem Artichokes as our primary staple.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c7934842038174554646 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 7:17 AM</a><br><br>

Re technologies of the future, two websites, lowtechmagazine.com and its sibling, notechmagazine.com both have lots of inspirational articles. One thing that comes to mind is that as we made the journey to today's industrialized present, we abandoned a lot of technologies that would be useful again in a de-industrialized future. Not only will we want to remember what is useful from the present but we will also want to rediscover what we used to know in the past such as techniques for food preservation in the absence of freezers and canning technology. We would do well to spend more time looking at how third world cultures cope since they are already at the place that we are going to, that is a world with too many people for the resources available. <br>As to how our culture copes with declining ROEI, that will be something to see. As far as I can tell, anyone trained in economics, even critics of Capitalism such as David Harvey has a hard time letting go of the idea that economic growth can go on without some material underlying growth. Economic theorists seem to believe that when you use up one resource, the invisible hand provides us with a replacement just in time and growth proceeds at 3 percent per annum. <br>In any case, it seems that our current arrangement in which we are given money to pay for food and shelter in return for performing some inane activity which goes by the name of job can go on in an environment of declining resources.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c6056816300666068192 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 8:05 AM</a><br><br>

It seems I have most of these pretty well in practice. To #1 I would add irrigation. While our garden and livestock watering system is currently supplied with a slow solar pump, it could easily be converted to a simple wind pump or tramp. The idea is to build water storage above the areas of need and use gravity to do the rest. Many possibilities there. We've also constructed a couple of small ponds for water storage and edible aquatics such as cattails and lotus, and fish, of course.<br><br>#2: Passive solar thermal is the best investment I've ever made. Our south-facing glass with overhangs to control seasonal insolation just works. I would add that windows need to be operable with screens. Thermal mass helps keep things warm or cool, and virtually all of our 'air conditioning' is passive.<br><br>#3. We've been coppicing for years now. In our area, the poplars and alders regrow to harvest-ability in 2-3 years; makes fine stove wood, especially when combined with forest dead fall.<br><br>#4. Here in the southern Appalachians we have a pharmacopia of medicinal plants which we identify and encourage. We keep a library of both folk and scientific info regarding their usage. I've learned how to make tinctures and poultices. Distilling is another useful skill in the "medicinals" area.<br><br>#5. The best I've done there is to put literally thousands of pencils in storage; often found in boxes of 500 at flea markets. Paper is another problem...<br><br>#6. Our grandson is working on his ham license and we are looking for vintage tube-based ham equipment at swap meets, etc. Unfortunately, the trend is toward going digital, but that frees up a lot of old equipment.<br><br>#7. I still have my old slide rule from my pre-calculator school days, along with its instruction book.<br><br>I would suggest adding animal husbandry to the list, especially small livestock (goats, chickens, etc.) and draft animals. Also, potting and basket weaving.<br><br>Here in the mountains, there are still some old-timers who lived very much in a semi- or pre-industrial way. I suggest folks go out and pick the brains of some of the folks who lived this way, or are preserving these things.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c8709210641619507324 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 9:08 AM</a><br><br>

The basic problem with our entire global economy is that we need more (affluent) customers.<br><br>Of course, there aren't any. That's the problem.<br><br>I find that this approach short-circuits the circular discussion that starts when you talk about resource shortages. People immediately want to talk about the "information economy" and 3D printers and the World Is Flat and how technology lets us make more with less, and the conversation heads down the rabbit-hole.<br><br>Instead, start with the fact that to sustain an exponentially-increasing economy, you need exponentially-increasing demand: so at 2% growth, we have to double our consumption every 35 years -- twice as much corn eaten, twice as many cars bought, twice as many prostitutes solicited. If you want to add new technologies, they can't detract from any of the existing industries -- you now have to eat corn AND wheat, buy a car AND ride the new maglev train, solicit the same prostitutes AND subscribe to internet pornography. <br><br>It brings the problem home: "I don't have the time or the money for all that!" Exactly.<br><br>Nor does enlisting the aid of the starving masses in Africa help. For them to buy your products, they need money. For them to get money, they must become producers. You don't have the time or the money to buy your own products, much less their products, so it means they have to buy their own products, which means they won't have any time or money left to buy yours.<br><br>Declining energy surplus is, I think, much easier to illustrate from the demand side. Yes, you can make a car for half the cost and four times the mileage using advanced technology and outsourcing, but who is left to buy it? Without an energy surplus that supports an affluent demand base, there are no customers. If there are no customers, your production costs are irrelevant.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c4429012579473890779 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 9:25 AM</a><br><br>

That receiver has no amplification, and thus can only receive from nearby high-power AM radio station transmitters. Amplification is the real "magic" to preserve, and is useful for much more than just radio communications. For that, one needs either simple transistors (perhaps a sustainable technology, but does require somewhat of an industrial base), or vacuum tubes, which potentially can be home-built, but not easily (require glass-work and high vacuum pumps). For practical use, one also needs sources for (or home-building methods for) metal wires, resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers, batteries, etc. Since in the shorter term (at least one more generation) salvage of such components will be much easier than home-building, the preservation of the homebuilding methods that will be needed later on is quite a challenge.<br><br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c1263837258783154628 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 9:31 AM</a><br><br>

Most of the greatest development in these technologies came in the 19th century, and were developed by enterprising individuals with little more than what we would now call grade-school educations. Educations that equipped them with an ability to read, comprehend, and reason from core principles in ways that I know I am incapable.<br><br>Some very interesting refinements and additions were made in the latter 20th century such as tertiary biological wastewater treatment and the like, and it would be very desirable to conserve those, as well.

And one good indicator of this is the biodiversity of the area, especially large things like trees that disperse and evolve slowly. The idea being that when your climate has been stable, you will have had fewer local extinctions and you will see more species surviving in the present day.<br><br>Here on our 40 acres of Tennessee, we have over 40 species of trees. In the whole biome of the Pacfic coastal belt (Northern CA to Puget Sound), there are only about half this many species of trees that are widespread. In any given 40 acre plot, you'd be lucky to find more than a dozen or so. Southern Appalachia and the adjoining areas in general are a major hotbed for North American biodiversity. Through the pleistocene climate swings, the forests have apparently never been wiped out and hundreds of species have managed to thrive in the region. Such has not been the case in the Mountain West and Pacific Coast, even with the greater opportunities for vertical migration in the west.<br><br>It's not an accident that we settled in one of the most biodiverse areas of the southeastern U.S. (the western highland rim of the interior plateaus province). To me that meant a healthier past and better chances for robustness and stability in the future. <br><br>And now folks will say "yes but the coming climate change is unprecedented, the past is no guide to the future now!" Sure, uh huh. But the same geographic, ecological, and atmospheric processes that helped moderate past climate changes are still our best guesses for moderation in the future too. And, curiously, the mid-south and southern Appalachia have not been showing much temperature change, a puzzle which climatologists have been discussing recently. So, maybe the past is still a guide for the future...?<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c7100175486682796605 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 10:21 AM</a><br><br>

Heritage arts, such as weaving, wine making, coopering, cooking &amp; baking, organic gardening &amp; orchards – this is what we do - woodworking and such provide for basic necessities while providing discipline and release from emotional turmoil.<br> <br>2. Music: We seem to be a species given to music of all types. It gives us joy, and with others strengthens our sense of family and encourages community participation and fulfills so many emotional needs. Obtain, or make – a heritage art – a musical instrument and then share you’re learning and playing with others. If you have no musical skill – unfortunately I don’t – you can whistle, sing or hum along with others or just soak it in. Some in our community participate in “Sacred Heart” singing sessions and travel all over to join with others to sing in unison – No it isn’t a Christian club. Several of our children play piano, guitar and flute.<br><br>3. Prepare to home school: The school system is a basket case which I suppose could be called a “failed system.” Already abandoned are the arts and music and progressively the basics of math, language and rational thinking – all this and the football team lives on.<br><br>Thanks again for a great piece.<br><br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c3215763487884542009 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 11:07 AM</a><br><br>

He also points out in the aftermath of the financial crisis, nothing of substance has changed at all:<br><br><i>Former US secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld's distinction between known unknowns and unknown unknowns has passed into everyday speech. It's not the things of which we know we're ignorant that we should worry about, he pointed out. It's the things we're unaware of not knowing that can really cause trouble.

We'd do better to confront these awkward realities and muddle through more intelligently. We humans are sturdy and resilient animals, with enormous capacities of creativity and adaptability, but consistently realistic thinking seems to be beyond our powers.

However, that's not the critical issue here because even if renewable energies' (RE) EROEI were to be significantly higher, it is probably too late for a massive shift to RE to have any sort of positive impact on the effects of peak oil worldwide. <br><br>Nevertheless I have to say that EROEI figures most probably cannot be measured to a high degree of accuracy given the large number of inputs that need to be known precisely. The best that can be achieved are probably EROEI figures that give orders of magnitude. I tend to believe that EROEI figures quoted to 2 decimal places are misleading and bizarre, it is claiming an accuracy that can't be achieved realistically. <br><br>Other measures must be used to make a realistic assessment of RE, such as pay back time and cost of KWH of electricity generated. On this front RE have been making progress as far as I have been able to gauge. For instance in Mauritius, where people are fighting against the erection of one more coal powered station, the cost of electricity from coal is Rs 4 to Rs 5 per KWH (Rs 30 = 1 US $) whereas a solar farm has just signed a supply contract of Rs 6 per KWH. <br><br>I am currently involved in attempts to introduce solar farm co-operatives in Mauritius based on the German model. Together with German experts, using real figures about costs, technology available and solar insolation in Mauritius we are coming up with figures of Rs 8 per KWH and a pay back period of 4 to 5 years! <br><br>All those figures taken together mean that subject to local circumstances, a gradual shift towards RE for electric power is most probably possible within a 20 years time frame. However peak oil may not grant us this much time, nevertheless it is worth a shot. Better late than never. I am afraid that the rational of JMG on RE may actually be counter productive as it may convince many people to mistakenly believe that a shift towards RE is a waste of time and effort when every bit of RE will help and is helping right now.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c950800651854941529 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 11:24 AM</a><br><br>

The entire pacific coastal region from northern CA to Puget Sound hosts about 25 species of native fish. In comparison, just the state of Tennessee hosts at least 277 native species; the tiny drainage basin of the Buffalo River within which I live is home to over 90 species of fish. About a dozen species live in the teeny first-order headwater stream behind my house. Conspicuously absent from the western states are all those little "headwater endemics," the species that occur only within very limited ranges in the drainage basin of only one stream. These sorts of endemics are widespread in the southeastern states. <br><br>So what does this say to me? That those western rivers dry up completely, all the way to the headwaters, periodically, and have to be recolonized by widespread species that are often able to move in from the ocean. But in the southeast, those smaller rivers don't dry up, not even in the mega-droughts, over many many millennia of drastic climate change. <br><br>Fish aren't such a good indicator farther north in the eastern states, where the pleistocene ice sheets periodically wiped out everything. Whatever we might be looking at for future climate change, most people (there are always exceptions) are not envisioning a return of the pleistocene glaciers in the next few thousand years; megadroughts are a much bigger worry.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c5760695440717642140 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 11:33 AM</a><br><br>

I’m slowly getting introductions and tutorials written for those interested in Ham Radio. I’m also planning on having a lending library of books useful to prospective or beginning Hams. I seem to be a focal point lately for those who either have for sale cheap, or want to give me, older HF rigs. I’m getting quite a collection of very fixable rigs that I’ll be able to eventually pass on at very affordable prices. I’m very interested in helping any who want to get into Ham Radio. An abundance of Drake and Yaesu rigs!<br><br>I think some I’ve been communicating with have mis-interpreted my appearing to have a total preference for tube type equipment. I have a preference for tube rigs because they’re available for less money and easier to bring back to working condition. I love the performance of the latest rigs, <i>when they work</i>, but it’s still far easier to repair the tube stuff, even to the point that modern stuff can be <i>impossible</i> to get parts for when it’s the custom Integrated Circuit that’s no longer made that you need.<br><br>I have 1,000’s of transistors here; it is very easy to throw together simple QRP rigs on a whim. Bags of 100 or 1,000 transistors are quite cheap! There’s so much stuff that’s just thrown out that parts can be salvaged from!<br><br>I also think that many don’t understand that you are talking about Ham Radio <i>during the decline</i>, when salvage parts and some of the technology are still available. Yes, once all the salvage is used up, it will be quite difficult to replicate much, but the decline is going to be a long and drawn-out process and radio can be a big help. Even if all you could make was Spark-Gap transmitters and Coherer or Crystal receivers, a lot can be done. After all, that was the technology employed back in 1900-1915 when the ARRL was formed and trans-continental relays were being performed regularly. There’s a lot to be learned by reading books like 200 Meters &amp; Down and The World of Ham Radio 1901-1950.<br><br>I’m also working on the Organic Gardening, Solar Thermal and Bookbinding. All of this is actually lots of fun, especially when you leave the High-Tech expensive stuff out of it!<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c2570560881739133188 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 11:58 AM</a><br><br>

As for Pacific Northwest climate change forecasts, they're not hard to find online -- that I recall, your area's far enough north and west to escape the droughts, but you'll want to do some research. <br><br>Bike, trig's useful for much more than that, and a good trig-function slide rule makes it easy as 3.14159 ;-). <br><br>Jason, excellent. Coppicing's crucial, and not merely for firewood -- coppiced ash trees produce splendid building timber for pole construction, for example. <br><br>Josh, fair enough. Glad to hear that you're working on it. <br><br>Jason, sounds tasty. <br><br>Deedl, for the record, I have a decent reading knowledge of German -- Latin and French had to come first for professional reasons, but there's a long list of <i>Dichter und Denker</i> I plan on reading in the original. As for your broader point, though, stripped of the triumphalist rhetoric, what it amounts to is that Germany happens to be in a position just now to be able to afford the massive government subsidies needed to prop up renewable energy -- and it's in that position because of systemic fiscal imbalances in the Eurozone that are bankrupting Southern and Eastern Europe to prop up the German economy. That's not a sustainable situation, and it will be interesting -- in the sense of the apocryphal Chinese curse -- to see how it plays out in the decades ahead. <br><br>More broadly still, of course the US empire is ending -- I spent most of my 2012 posts talking about that, and my book on the subject will be published in March. That said, I urge you and my other German readers not to fall into the old delusion of supposing that the decline and fall of an Anglophone empire necessarily means the rise of a German-led Europe to, shall we say, its place in the sun. It was because of that same fantasy that Germany spent the first half of the twentieth century slamming face first into one self-induced catastrophe after another. If the same mistaken notion is once again getting traction east of the Rhine, I have to say, along with Hermann Hesse, "O Freunde, nicht diese Töne!"<br><br>Richard, good. A better knowledge of companion planting is a contribution worth having. <br><br>Sunseeker, I'm aware that de Castro's estimate is controversial, and that it's much lower than the estimates that proponents use -- in fact, I think I said as much (as did de Castro in his paper). His methodology, though, takes into account thermodynamic limits the others don't. As for Marin county, I'll have to find the papers I read. <br><br>Orchard, you don't do any of those things without tools, of course, but that's not at issue; most of the tools are very easy to make from metal scrap and have very long working lives as well. The technologies I want to preserve are the ones that are at serious risk of being lost.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c7903326111393067428 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 1:10 PM</a><br><br>

It's the intensive gardening technology that might get lost in the interval, and that's why I want to see it saved. <br><br>Cherokee, er, "the moons have aligned"? I knew Australia was a long ways away, but the nearest place I know of with more than one moon is a bit further than that. ;-)<br><br>Christian, micro-hydro and mini-hydro is sustainable, and well worth cultivating; big dams fill up with silt in a matter of decades to a century or so, and lose most of their ability to produce power -- and of course there's also the ecological damage, which is not small. <br><br>Gregorach, good. What will you personally do to make sure these things survive to be passed onto the future? <br><br>Andrew, that's right -- not to mention the horde of flatulent unicorns on their way from Zeta Reticuli right now, who will meet all our energy needs if we can only figure out how to filter twinkle dust out of methane! <br><br>Flute, possible. Radio's actually easier and cheaper, because you don't need the network of wires connecting station to station. <br><br>Michele, you've touched on one of the most critical needs we've got -- a different way of educating both adults and children. I plan on a series of posts about that down the road a bit. <br><br>Russ, excellent. It's good to hear from someone else who gets it!<br><br>Jim, of course. Everything in the deindustrial future is going to have to function at a much smaller scale. Polymer chemistry? A possibility -- here again, what do you propose to do to preserve this? <br><br>Oogway, I'm not avoiding it, I've discussed it repeatedly here. Population is a dependent variable, not an independent one, and as the limits to growth bite harder, we're going to see population growth turn into population decline -- the original <i>Limits to Growth</i> study puts that at 2030 or so, and I expect global population to bottom out somewhere around 2150 to 2200 at maybe half a billion. The mechanisms for population contraction? There are four of them, and they ride horses. <br><br>Nestorian, I'm not at all sure I'd be comfortable describing spirituality as a technology -- it's more a relationship, as I see it. Is it crucial? Yes -- but as Spengler pointed out a long time ago, a return to religion is one of the predictable events in the decline of a civilization, so that one's probably covered.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c6899015165177183188 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 1:24 PM</a><br><br>

And yet, we really don't need all the crap we have and could live a tolerably "modern life" with much less in the way of energy consuming gadgets. The modern washing machine comes to mind. Because it is so easy, we have lots of clothes and probably wash them too often. My daughter told me that in college her roommates would throw a towel into the laundry after each shower. In the Soviet era, certainly a modern and scientific society, most people had few clothes, kept them as clean as they could, and washed by hand in the house and hung them up to dry. <br><br>Thijs Goverde-<br><br>I don't think it is exactly true that some people don't buy the germ theory of disease. It is rather that they think other things can trump germs, such as having a healthy immune system and getting enough of the right nutrients. It was Claude Bernard who said "The terrain is everything." Certainly we know that some people seem to catch every cold and flu that comes along, and others are rarely sick despite great exposure. So there is obviously more going on than the germs themselves.<br><br>Having said that, I completely agree that asepsis is crucial and easy to attain. Medicine might need to drop a lot of expensive tests and use more clinical diagnostic skills. <br>Another thing similar as regards health is our knowledge of nutrition. If people got exercise and ate natural foods, and understood that variety in the diet is needed, we could get by with much less medical intervention. Pine needles are meant to be very high in vitamin C. So you can gather them and make tea (minimally boiled).<br><br>Barbara Fisher -<br><br>That was an excellent list.

I also have an artist friend who does a lot of artwork with a steampunk theme as well. <br><br>The funny thing is that it’s very likely that the highest level of technology that could be sustained by an ecotechnic society is probably equivalent to late Victorian or World War I level technology, with a few new twists such as modern ecology and sustainable organic farming thrown in for good measure. Moreover, there is a great deal that could be done with technologies that were developed during that era, such as windjammers, dirigibles or those magnificent solar powered engines that were developed by the French in the late 19th century.<br><br>Maybe steampunk is the true wave of the future.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c3143787472513428030 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 1:51 PM</a><br><br>

I know that the greed and short sightedness of the people of my time will cause a great many troubles for you.” The Priestess looked up and said “Now, that is an understatement.” She then continued to read “ I hope these buckets contain materials and objects that you will find useful. It is my hope that these things will make your life a little less difficult.”<br><br>…….<br><br>Our party found the site and dug up the 12 black plas buckets, and I asked the ruinman how to open one up. He took one bucket and pulled a piece of black plas of the top, then made some slits in the top with his knife and pried off the top. Inside the container was a small booklet made of white plas the title was “On Optics”. I had no idea what that meant, but there were other things in the container, Binoculars!! Two pair, they would be worth a fortune in Sinadi. This strange metal object with wheels and a mirror that has the word Ziess on the side. Ten boxes filled with small rectangular pieces of glass, and several boxes with round glass. My sister and I hugged each other because we knew that just one bucket was going to be enough to make our lives much easier.

And is that the number required to support our particular industrial civilization, or any industrial civilization at all? Can you cite your sources?<br><br>EROEI is a complicated thing, because the ability of a technology to be sustained, in my view, depends more on the complexity of the required inputs than the measured EROEI. <br><br>If energy is all that is needed, and in the form produced by the technology in question, then a low EROEI looks the same as a low conversion efficiency. Let's say I need 1 MWh of electricity per year, and I have hypothetical solar panels with an EROEI of 2 that require only basic materials (wood, straw) and electricity to produce. In that case, I simply need to install enough panels to product 2 MWh per year and put half of them to work producing more panels.<br><br>Of course, real photovoltaic panels don't work that way, requiring mined materials and a great deal of intense heat (charcoal furnace? solar thermal?) for their manufacture. And yet they are simpler than giant wind turbines, which require cranes that can handle many-ton structures and electrical capacity to manage shifting generation on the scale of megawatts. <br><br>All of this is to say that I don't care for the way you write off wind and solar because their EROEI is around 9 and somebody came up with a study that no less than 10 will do. I realize that there is a false tendency to feel that because something really ought to work, then it will, and you are reminding us to avoid falling into that trap. Even so, it seems that with an EROEI of 9, or even 4-5, it should be possible to build a solar-powered factory that produces photovoltaics, and if that is possible then it just might also be possible for small communities of "higher" technology to survive through the coming decline.

It's probably natural given Germany's population advantage and economic power (China is in a similar position in East Asia). The main difference between today and the first half of the 20th century is that today Germany is dominating economically, not militarily -- one could say that Germany has become more Bavarian and less Prussian. There are more differences: The United Kingdom is not much involved in continental Europe anymore; France is economically married to Germany and essentially emulating German policy; and Russia is trying to win Germany, its biggest oil and gas customer, over as an ally, now that Germany is reunified and doesn't need NATO any more. The other European countries are politically and economically insignificant (compared to Germany) and/or integrated with German economy. That's at least my interpretation of the situation, as a non-German who regularly reads German, French and English newspapers.<br><br>@JMG - regarding your blog post: I would add one technology/device category to the list: Mechanical precision instruments.

Hydroelectric gets around that problem elegantly by letting the environment do the concentrating into easy to use rivers.<br><br> There are, or course, problems. They silt up and have ecological impacts. But the big problem is that hydro won't provide all the power that an industrial society needs. We are pretty much using all the good hydro sites already and we still need lots more power. But just because it can't power the entirety of our civilization's needs doesn't mean that we can't use it at all.<br><br> The EROEI of hydro depends mostly on the location, but I have heard numbers as high as 100:1 several times.

That is an understanding of our personal and collective relation to nature, time, and spirit.<br><br>We are, besides the problems of energy limits, and changes to climate effected by human action, also limited in our relation to the world by rationality. While rationality gives us greater power, this is limited because it is confined to our concept of self - a physical self. This is demonstrated by the willingness to allow other species to go extinct, a willingness to disrupt natural processes, as well as by a worship of selfishness represented in our political, economic, and cultural relations.<br><br>When the matter of energy limits gets discussed, the limits are either ignored (by most, which is an aspect of selfishness) or denied (because it seems "they" have always come up with something to save us.)<br><br>That selfishness in large part, I believe, is fed by an erroneous concept of time, well demonstrated in Christianity, where some still feel it necessary to conceive of the Earth/Universe as only 6000 years old.<br><br>What the list in JMG's post represents is a recognition of the need to be part of the greater whole of life/nature, a willingness to adapt to what it can provide for us, rather than the need to stretch nature to our desires.<br><br>Over and over following this subject and JMG's blog, I'm reminded that, really, the problem isn't how much sunlight got stored up for our use, or whether we can devise new, more powerful ways to gather energy together for our use; but the ability of the rational mind to adapt to changes. We are quite adaptable, however, and one of the key adaptations, a kind of spiritual technology, is to recognize the limits of the unique human adaptation to nature, called rationality. To recognize that there are times to quit thinking about things and use other modes of adaptation.<br><br>This is represented often in those who dispute the particular measurements, for instance, of EROEI. Maybe the numbers are a little more "optimistic" (re human ability to harness power); but really at best that offers maybe another 100 years, or maybe 200 years, of industrial civilization, mass production, greatly augmented human physical power. Compared to a million years, or even just 6000 years, is that worth more extinctions, more climate disruptions?<br><br>And just as importantly, what we've gotten for having tapped into all this energy for human control, is greatly diminished human capabilities, sadly degenerate human behavior, lots of destruction and conflict. Power corrupts, so thank goodness, I would say, for limits.<br><br>What can be found in the list above, a practical list of technologies that are adaptive, and many of the others mentioned by the commenters, is the peace that comes from being part of something much, much greater than oneself - the rest of the world.<br><br>(ps, all due credit, a lot of the ideas in this comment come from what I've gleaned from JMG, as well as other writers.)<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c7885995625889257639 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 7:49 PM</a><br><br>

Getting from there to here is the problem -- we missed the window of opportunity that would have allowed us to make a smooth transition, and only a small minority of people are willing to make the sacrifices that would be necessary to avoid the normal processes of decline and fall, so the emergence of ecotechnic societies is going to have to wait until the approaching dark age is over and done with.<br><br>MPL, solar dehydrators used to be fairly popular -- I used one in the early 1980s, with extremely good results.

There are actually quite a few nontechnological skills that could use developing, and the ability to get along constructively in a community is certainly one of them.<br><br>Jesse, I don't happen to know whether bicycles will be viable or not in a deindustrial future; a lot depends on whether specialized technologies such as steelmaking can be carried out extensively enough to make steel frames affordable -- and what about tires? I'd encourage you, personally, to do some research on that.<br><br>Sunyata, my impression of his work -- which is admittedly based on a fairly limited amount of reading -- is that he's pushing yet another version of the myth of progress, with leaps into new and more expanded states of consciousness providing the necessary onward-and-upward mechanism. I don't find that interesting, helpful, or relevant to the real world. If I'm misunderstanding him, though, by all means clue me in.<br><br>Wolfgang, I'd like to offer one amendment. It's not just that lifestyles that have a lot less energy and the products of energy look like poverty to us; such lifestyles are, in fact, impoverished in every material sense of the term.

When you have six and a half billion spare people who will do just about anything to get enough food to stay alive, there's no need to invest in the social complexities of slavery -- you just have to put out a "Help Wanted" sign. <br><br>Joseph, I've spent most of the last year talking about the most abstract end of the subject this blog is meant to explore, so I'm not surprised that this week's post is getting so enthusiastic a response.

Thus the need to get a good wide range of mathematical options into the hands of future calculators. <br><br>Dan, glad to hear it. I don't see botany as a technology, which is why I didn't include it in the list. Is it worth preserving? Good heavens, yes -- a solid grasp of botany is essential for the gardener, farmer, herbal healer, ecosystem repair tech, etc., etc., etc. <br><br>Moshe, you might want to have a look at Pete Friedrich's book <i>Instruments of Amplification</i>, which covers a range of different handbuilt amplification technologies suitable for radio frequencies. Handbuilt vacuum tubes are well within the reach of medieval technology -- you need glassblowing, delicate metalwork, and a simple vacuum pump, and all those are easily arranged (medieval alchemists used vacuum distillation in some of their work). Once you have amplification, furthermore, the rest is easy -- books on radio from the 1920s have plans in which every single component other than one tube is completely handbuilt. <br><br>Erica, no argument there. We grow and save about half our own seed these days, and that's only going to pick up as things proceed. <br><br>SLClaire, that strikes me as an excellent idea.

May I encourage you to take one more step? Take all your texts that are out of copyright, scan them to PDF, and get them onto a website for free download, then post something to the Green Wizards website and here as well for those who might find them useful.

As recently as the Miocene, what's now the Pacific Northwest was under the western Pacific; the convulsions that created the Cascade Mountains and flooded the lands east of them with a layer of lava more than a mile thick left the entire region with a depauperate flora and fauna -- and then, of course, the Ice Age didn't exactly help things. Puget Sound was excavated by a glacier; the whole region was glacial tundra, and cut off by mountains from warmer areas that could have restocked the biota -- from south of Eugene OR to just north of Redding CA, you're in rugged mountains that extend from the Cascade-Sierra jumble out to the sea. The central-to-southern Appalachian region had a considerably less brutal time of it!<br><br>Varun, the site you want to visit is http://www.greenwizards.org -- it's about to go through a major makeover, and will be serving as a venue for exactly the kind of discussions you've suggested. <br><br>Alphonse, yes, I know the last year or so has been very abstract. My academic background is in history of ideas; I consider Nietzsche and Schopenhauer pleasant light reading, and I like to discuss the philosophical dimensions of all this at some length now and then. Still, trust me, I've noticed how many of my readers would much rather read a discussion of what they can do about the crisis of our time, and I promise we'll be covering that in more detail in posts to come -- it'll make a pleasant diversion from talking about the future of fascism and the shape of the coming dark age. <br><br>MawKernewek, those are good questions, to which I don't know the answers. I do know that coppicing provides firewood without devastating forests, which is a crucial point, and that when other resources run out, coppiced wood and a rocket stove can still be cooking your dinner!<br><br>Escape, thanks for the heads up -- he's quite correct, of course. I'm going to quibble a bit about your comment that none of these are new -- that's true in very general terms but emphatically not so in specifics, and the specifics are worth preserving. <br><br>Karim, if investing in PV or other green technologies becomes an excuse not to deal with the desperate need to conserve resources and use much less energy, then I'm far from sure that investing in PV is a good idea. As for the possibility of sustaining some kind of technic civilization on renewables, of course -- that's the core theme of my book <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i>, you know! <br><br>Bill, the reason you won't find headwater endemics in the Puget Sound basin, again, is that the Puget Sound basin was under a mile of ice until about 13,000 years ago. Further south, the Coast Range and the Cascades both had massive glaciation during the ice ages, and the streams then flowed through tundra to the sea -- and let's not even talk about the cataclysmic floods from glacial Lake Missoula that devastated the entire inland basin! Again, it's a depauperate ecosystem for reasons that go far beyond the kind of climate change we're talking about at this stage of the game. <br><br>Max, extensive discussions on The Oil Drum and Resilience.org. You might find it useful to search their archives. <br><br>Wolfgang, thank you. <br><br>August, delighted to hear it. I'm far from sure that tube radios won't be available for the long term -- again, glassblowing, delicate metalwork, and simple vacuum pumps were well within the reach of your common or garden variety alchemist long before fossil fuels were more than geological curiosities -- and in the meantime, as you say, there's an enormous amount that can be done with salvage.

For the record I am not concerned about air quality, our population density is low enough that even when all the neighbors have their stoves cranked up there's no notable smoke accumulation.

It's easy to get all caught up in the details about what level of technology and civilization can we keep with solar (or other) forms of electricity. But let's keep in perspective that these discussions are about *electricity*, which is only a fraction of our industrial energy use, and I would hazard not the most important one.<br><br>On our homestead, when I think about serious survival, having a little bit of power--to run the chest freezer, for instance--makes a big difference to our lifestyles. As might a solar lantern or a solar oven, if the stories from the developing world are to be believed. A little bit of electricity is a nice thing to have, and we are looking into trying to produce a little.<br><br>However. Our industrial system, I would argue, is far more dependent on liquid gases for transportation than anything else, and solar isn't going to make a dent in that realm. How do we mine, manufacture, and then transport goods, resources, minerals, food,or information without diesel or other liquid fuels? We're not making concrete or building wireless towers with solar!<br><br>So go ahead--build solar panels with an EROEI of 10 or 12. And then try to produce steel or mine silicon or rare earth metals with them. Let us know how that goes.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c8752066957739021007 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 9:15 PM</a><br><br>

Glad to hear it!<br><br>Mark, well, he's an economist -- the poor dear can't be expected to think clearly about resources, can he, now? <br><br>Carl, exactly! Some of the handbuilt vacuum tubes I've seen are things of real beauty, and have quite a decent Mu (that's "amplification factor" for those who don't speak the jargon) to boot. <br><br>Onething, the thing to keep in mind is that an energy source has to provide enough energy to support all the infrastructure that's needed to provide it with raw materials, spare parts, ways to transmit energy to its end users, and so on. Grid-tied PV, in other words, isn't viable over the long term unless it produces enough electricity not only to cover its own manufacturing and maintenance, but to cover its share of the supply chains, mines, factories, and the electrical grid, with all <i>its</i>&gt; supply chains and so on. An EROEI of less than 3 won't do that. Are there useful things to do with solar energy? You bet, but they presuppose a much simpler lifestyle and a less interdependent technological infrastructure. <br><br>Enrique, funny you should mention that. I'm planning a post on steampunk, or something like it, as the wave of the future. If you do live-action roleplaying, and have or can do a steampunk engineer persona, why not add a slide rule to your gear and brandish it authoritatively as you make emergency repairs on the dirigible? ;-)<br><br>Jim, your crystal ball is working well, I see. I'll be saying more about this next week, but I'll whisper this now: there's going to be a second short story contest, and another anthology. Are you up for finishing that story and submitting it? <br><br>Raul, I want you to stop and think about what you've just said, and why. It's absolutely standard these days, when a discussion of the practical realities of the Long Descent gets under way, for people to come charging in, insisting that (insert unproven vaporware technology here) will, or can, or may save us. Why do they do that with such regularity? <i>Because it provides them with an excuse for not doing anything as the crisis of our age tightens around us all</i>. That's what you're doing, and what everyone is doing when they come barging in here to talk about some other technology that some other people are creating somewhere else that will make everything better. <br><br>I'd encourage you to remember, furthermore, that the further any nuclear technology is from being actually deployed for commercial power generation, the cheaper and more wonderful it seems -- ordinary fission power, remember, was being sold as "electricity too cheap to meter" back before the first generation of commercial nuclear power plants came out and proved otherwise. Do you know what technical challenges and economic difficulties might be involved in trying to deploy thorium reactors on a large enough scale to make any difference? Have you even thought about such questions? I have to confess I doubt it -- and in the absence of such real-world considerations, excited chirping about thorium reactors or some other bit of vaporware is simply one more distraction in the way of thinking clearly about the mess we're in and what has to be done about it.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c552011396818264412 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 9:16 PM</a><br><br>

So far, though, PV cells require chip fabrication plants with clean rooms, nearly worldwide supply chains to provide the raw materials not only for the cells and dopants but all the other requirements of manufacturing, and a great deal more in the way of extremely energy- and resource-costly inputs. Can that change? Potentially, but in that case someone needs to get to work on it right away -- and until that happens, I'd like to suggest that it's more sensible for the rest of us to focus on those options that are known to work (such as solar thermal technologies) rather than betting the future on a technological gamble that may not pay off. <br><br>Kathleen, maybe it's just because I live in a region with a long tradition of moonshine production, butI have no fear that the brewing and distilling of alcoholic beverages will ever, anywhere, become a lost art! Of course it's worth preserving, and not just for enjoyment -- alcohol is an excellent disinfectant, a very good fuel, and also a highly useful solvent. <br><br>Yupped, an excellent point -- good enough that you get tonight's gold star. <br><br>Fidelius, of course. The questions I have are, first, whether Germany can weather the backlash from the financial imbalances that are making it prosper at the expense of southern and eastern Europe; second, if a Russian-German alliance emerges -- and it's far and away the most sensible approach for both sides -- whether that will split the EU into pro- and anti-Russian camps, as seems most likely; and third, whether any of that can keep Germany and the rest of Europe from being dragged down in the common wreck of the industrial world. <br><br>Ashley, delighted to hear it. I already get a significant fraction of my clothing from my wife's spindle, knitting needles, crochet hooks, etc., so I'm inclined to think that there's a vast amount that can be done along these lines!<br><br>Phil, that's a fascinating question. I'd be happy to have some Roman sheet music -- but sound recordings for the future, yes, that might work. As for documentation on soil, yes again; as far as I know, the whole country had its soils surveyed on a county-by-county level, and that's exactly the sort of lore that gets lost all too easily as things come apart. <br><br>Daelach, excellent! I've done a little work with a Chinese abacus, not enough to be fluent but enough to get a sense of the potential; slide rules and logarithm tables are more my style, mostly because they relate to math I use fairly often. Still, good to hear that somebody else is working on low-tech mathematics. <br><br>Ms. K., true enough. <br><br>Liquid, well, yes.

That's because many of today's liberals have taken over the role of the church, as the prophets and theologians of the religion of progress. <br><br>Russ, do you happen to know if those old CB rigs can be refitted for 10 meters? If so, that might be another way for people to get inexpensive ham rigs.<br><br>Tim, that's a good question, to which I don't know the answer. 500 years, though, seems like a very long time given river siltation issues. <br><br>Cathy, that BBC piece is stunning. High carbon steel is what you need for really good knives, swords, and many classes of tools. I had no idea that was being made that long ago! It's certainly doable in a low-tech setting -- some of the best steel on Earth, tamagahane steel (the raw material for the finest Japanese swords), is made by hand using pine charcoal in a very simple smelter -- but it's fascinating to learn that the trick was worked out so much earlier than older histories of technology thought. <br><br>Chris, well, yes. That's a lot of what I was trying to talk about last year. As I mentioned to Nestorian, I don't consider it a technology so much as a relationship, but it's crucial. <br><br>Dave, you really need to check your claims against history. Did the Germans have coal-to-liquids technology? You bet...and yet the Wehrmacht still ran out of fuel. Why? because coal-to-liquids technology has a very low rate of energy return on energy invested, too low to meet the needs of an industrial society. You might also want to check those airy comments about biomass against real world data, because they don't support your fantasy either, you know. <br><br>Backyardfeast, exactly. A little electricity is easy to generate -- wind, micro-hydro, a Stirling motor bolted onto your wod stove flue, you name it -- and easy to store in metal-acid batteries. Liquid fuel's another matter; one gallon of gasoline, remember, contains as much energy as one ton of fully charged car batteries. That's why, again, I want to focus on the things that are known to work on a home- and village-scale level. <br><br>Bill, there are some glorious U-shaped glacial valleys in the Siskiyous, just north of the CA-OR border, so the answer is at least partly yes. As for the Bay area, though, that's a different bioregion, and one I don't know at all well; I wouldn't be a bit surprised, since it's semiarid at best, if it got hammered by serious droughts at certain phases of the planetary weather cycle.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c7232704970758297953 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 10:10 PM</a><br><br>

Germans are sick of getting involved with other nations problems (see Iraq, see Lybia). It is rather that most Germans just don't want to be dominated by Europe in a way that they have to pay the others bills. That is an important distinction. Of course with a sixth of the population and a quarter of economic output Germany is a major player in Europe, but it is still to small to influence European politics without partners.<br><br>@ daelach: Here you have a nice overview about the energy and emergy of the internet (http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~barath/papers/emergy-hotnets11.pdf). It concludes that the total energy for both operating AND maintaining physically the internet (includign replacing every smartphone every two years and every server every three years) results in 1,1-1,7% of world energy consumption. This Energy is roughly half operation and half embodied energy in the hardware. <br><br>You can easily further reduce those costs by using the hardware much longer (it is technically no problem to build computers that run for decades) and by reducing the use of the internet for the important data (you can cut the amount of data and therefore operational costs enormously by just stopping to stream videos). Access to knews, to scientific knowledge, realtime communication and individually produced content can all be text based and therefore produce no significant amount of data. So a simple textbased internet can be maintained on a very small budget and still offers the significant advantages. If you ask people below 30 if thex would rather use their car or their internet, we all know how the will choose, and they are the generation that will be faced with those decisions.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c6535103017109300778 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 11:14 PM</a><br><br>

I have been following this blog for a few years now. <br>Concerning healthcare, I am a dentist and have volunteered as one in rural Nepal back in 2009. There I could see first-hand how energy and technology/equipment-intensive the profession is and how brittle and prone to disruptions due to ever-present power cuts is its exercise. Also, the need for the profession comes from one of the most widespread diseases, the tooth decay. Tooth decay is a disease of the industrial world ever since refined sugar has entered our food chain on a large scale. Prior to that, tooth decay was a disease of the rich. That is why there were really no dentists, say, in the 1790s. Rural Nepal essentially is a pre-industrial culture, so the people need to pull a tooth here, wisdom teeth can cause problems. Then there is gum disease and tooth wear, but as you grow older, it is considered natural that the teeth get worn or get lost. This is not really considered a disease among the locals and is definitely not a priority health care concern. Under primitive conditions and in the absence of refined sugar in the industrial food, all you need to do is to have someone to pull teeth. In Europe in the 1600s, you would go to a blacksmith for that. As for gum disease, you can brush your teeth yourself with a primitive brush, maybe you could add a herbal decoction. As a useful remnant of our industrial age, maybe a simple glass ionomer cement, which could be blended by hand from a powder-liquid, could be used as a filling material after removing carious substance from a tooth by a simple hand instrument. These are the things you simply could add to physician training, so that a future sustainable health care worker/physician will be a true generalist and will eliminate the whole dental profession. In fact, tooth extractions are a part of training of physicians in Nepal. Some of those are sent to mountainous outposts by the government and serve as true health care generalists. To be sure, in the cities, as well as among the few affluent Nepalese, tooth decay is rampant, just as it was in the industrial world after the diet had changed, but before the advances of the dental profession were introduced to the public. It seems to me that we first export some of the features of our culture, in this case, introduce cheap candy so that the poor can afford it, then a disease will spread, which again creates a much greater need for dental care. And here I was, imported dentist on a volunteer mission. The rural Nepalese can actually do without all of these - bits of industrial culture, candies and imported dentists. As mentioned before, the only useful aspect of what I did there and thousands of other dentists in other so called developing countries, is to identify the procedures, tools and technologies that can still be put to use if you don't have power, water lines, expensive dental chair etc.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c4561386751201519640 title="comment permalink">1/16/14, 11:17 PM</a><br><br>

Technology with a high EROEI that serves man first and not the market. But society as it is right now won’t support a shift to lower tech solutions of any kind. <br><br>I'm reading an old book I recently picked up at a used book store. Written in the seventies the title is '<i>Fundamentals of Solar Heating</i>'. <br><br>I pass a new housing development near where I live daily which is about half finished. All the new homes will have gas heat and the development which is under construction by a national home builder could have easily been built with solar heating systems to augment the conventional heating systems being built into the homes. <br><br>The added cost of solar heat augmentation could have been folded into the home mortgages in such a way that new buyers could have saved money at the end of the day on a month by month basis through gas savings. <br><br>To expect such sagacity from a particular builder of a dozen homes may be unreasonable but no such wisdom is expressed on any homes built anywhere. Our economic arrangements only allow for the fastest possible buck to be made and the wisdom of adding solar heating would be considered foolish by a builder who only desires to build homes as fast as possible, sell them, and move on.<br><br>At what point would lower more human and earth friendly technology be expected to replace corporate resource intensive technologies? It seems to me our economy and culture will not allow any shift in the way things are done until long after the need becomes apparent. As things are now a dark age will be well under way before any sustainable technologies emerge.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c940188622076126199 title="comment permalink">1/17/14, 12:10 AM</a><br><br>

Massive. Which, naturally, led to a lot of thinking then, and much more these days, about the basic fact that it would be simply ridiculous to consider the idea that you could use photovoltaics to manufacture photovoltaics. <br><br>I didn't have the information to be able to do any calculations, but I always wondered...<br><br>...given that the estimated projections were that the things would probably have around 20 years of functional life, if you knew the total amount of electrical power required, between the processes and all the support systems of the plant, to make a panel, in KW-Hrs, how would the total lifetime output of a panel in KW-Hrs compare?<br><br>And, of course, people will have taken note of one bit of information there; the estimated 20 year lifetime before it becomes effectively scrap. (Did I mention the toxic ingredients that make the current flow when sunlight hits it?)<br><br>One other note, relevant to the essay. Readers with better memory might check me on this, but I vaguely recall a short story by, I think, Harlan Ellison, about future "calculators". <br><br>In this story, the "calculators" were actually people who actually knew and practiced the generally forgotten craft of doing mathematical calculations... without any electronic equipment! In the setting of the story, the gizmos that had once done such things were gone, and over the course of the time of the gizmos, most people had forgotten (and eventually, never learned) how to actually do math with a pencil and paper (or some other low-tech means). So the specialized group known as the calculators did the math for people. It was basically like medieval monks who kept the art of letters alive in a culture where the average schlub was illiterate.<br><br>JLE<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c4529199888516125752 title="comment permalink">1/17/14, 12:20 AM</a><br><br>

And if you try to prove otherwise the Shao-lin monk has devised a way to sneakily snap you in the jaw with his shovel. <br><br>I'd like to second another commenter that the stance 'against germ theory' is not necessarily saying that a 'germ' doesn't necessarily cause cholera sympotms, aids, or TB, but that much of the inner and outer world are inhabited by 'germs'. The effect of the germ is varied as exemplified by the fact that 30% (aprox) of the world is infected with the TB mycobacteria or whatever its called. Yet only half or less (again i forget the details) will ever experience TB. Instead it is found that organisms can be held in check by a healthy superorganism. Some take it a step further and would say that the rapid proliferation of a various organism is intended as a healing response, say for instance TB helping you to clear your lungs. I don't know that I think that could be considered 100% true, and is probably often wrong, but I think its a good notion to consider. <br><br>As for the ASH trees, and the maples birches etc. Its always sad if a species doesnt make it but I always see the death of a tree on my property as an opportunity to put in a new one. I am all about establishing as many useful trees (shrubs, herbs, vines, roots) as I can. I don't much buy into the native nonnative argument. I will plant anything I can control (avoid vigorous runners in many situations) but i certainly do not believe i have the right to tell someone they cant grow it. I do not believe its our job to keep lands 'native' as we are a main infractor of that in america. By forcing lands to be native we force our food to be grown elsewhere and force all the negative consequences far and wide. Instead our only obligation should be to find the species which keep introduced opportunists in check. So for our imported ash destroyers it is our job to find their enemies. I do not believe the ash will be wiped out. Just as the american elm wasn't and the chestnut wasnt.. The losses were devastating almost unimaginable but are being overcome by plant breeding. To say we need a 100% american chestnut, to me, is like saying the 'whites and the blacks shouldnt breed' (absurd). <br><br>So rambling done, my main point is that food/plants are the most important thing to the human world. The more diversity, the more skills and simple metal tools we can use effectively to work with plants (including animal husbandry) the easier and more pleasurable our lives will be. When the supply lines shut down plant mobility will too and so I believe that their motion needs to be facilitated now.<br><br>By all means people should tend vulnerable natives, but do that as a hobby, do it where you would tend your garlic, and grow garlic mustard where the native was if its gonna help with survival.<br><br>Personally I am working to create a fully functioning diverse farmstead using a global list of species. It is my intention and hope to incorporate animals in such a way that their life is not more valuable in death. Being a buddhist vegetarian I believe certain animals have a role not just in death for humans but as workers who can provide functions.<br><br>The breeding of plants, for more resistant ashes perhaps, or chickens who lay later in life. To breed better yielding northern nut trees. More resistant bees. The list goes on. It borders on technology/knowledge/skills, and its insanely vital to the human species. <br><br>I also love old methods of wood working, but i use the new power tools now. I find it a fine balance that I still keep up with what people expect of me and what I can do using the primitive lifestyle.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c8128046900688965165 title="comment permalink">1/17/14, 12:20 AM</a><br><br>

I clash with greenies all the time on this. One aspect you didn't mention, though, is that all (100%) of the energy that reaches our planet and is not reflected immediately back into space goes into producing the planet and environment that we have. It may be deteriorating (through our actions) and some parts may not be too great at times (like extreme weather), so diverting that energy for our personal pleasure may have unintended consequences and no-one knows how little need be diverted from its natural course to have those consequences. Research by Alex Kleidon, nearly 3 years ago, perhaps along the same lines as the research you mentioned, starts to hint at the damage large scale use of wind would wreak.<br><br><br>Regarding technologies to save, to give the next civilisation a flying start, I cringed at the thought of yet another civilisation starting to damage the environment. Isn't that what civilisations do?<br><br>To the actual technologies, you mentioned cold frames and greenhouses in number 1. Even though glass or (perish the thought) plastics might be around for much of the decline, can they be expected to be available between civilisations? Maybe number 2 may also suffer from the lack of processed materials in that phase. Coppicing - yes; I only wish I could figure out how to do it, with two failed attempts so far. Healthcare - agreed. Number 5, maybe, depending on how severe the final stages of this civilisation's collapse is. Shortwave radio - yes but, again, I'm not sure this could be kept alive through the bottleneck.

The land was re-colonised by plants each time during the inter-glacials - except for some stony ground in very inclement places. A lot of re-stocking came from 'refugia'; at least we know this for Europe. There are significant differences in tree diversity North / South, where typically tree species are many times fewer in the northern re-colonised zones (see boreal forests). <br><br>In Britain the diversity is very noticeable in inventories of total plant wild species. Britain has been at the boundary of successive glaciations. Very roughly 200+ species in a kilometre square in the north near latitude 56, and 400+ species only 600 Kilometres further south. (There is also a huge range in species / communities with slight changes in elevation in Britain, which equate to climate boundaries. Here in Scotland, the arctic is barely a 2 mile walk up any steep and high enough hillside. We still have alpine plants on some of our higher slopes.)<br><br>Evolution of individual species clearly goes back a lot further than a few ice ages. I have not looked for info on the evolution of for example redwood species adapted for fire-climax – but we must be looking at millions of years? The redwoods must have been able to compete for other reasons in very different environments that came and went in alternation with fire climax? These were wetter as well as warmer worlds if we go back more than a million years.<br><br>best<br>Phil H<br><br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c7509936228128277308 title="comment permalink">1/17/14, 5:24 AM</a><br><br>

It's absolutely standard these days... for people to come charging in, insisting that (insert unproven vaporware technology here) will, or can, or may save us</i><br> <br><br><br>I did not come <i>charging to sell vaporware</i>. I pointed out that the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) is an interesting technology, and that the Chinese Academy of Sciences (with DOE and Berkeley Univ) is working on it. I even added: <b>if (a big if)</b> the technology is resurrected successfully, things could dramatically change.<br> <br><br><br>2) <i>Do you know what technical challenges and economic difficulties might be involved in trying to deploy thorium reactors on a large enough scale to make any difference?</i><br><br><br><br>First: the MSR technology is not a "cute idea"; the kernel was proven at ORNL in the 60s (by the same engineer who patented the LWR, Alvin Weinberg). The Chinese visited ORNL a few years ago and took a copy of all the documentation. <br>Now: it may take 7 years to build several prototypes (e.g., China completion date for prototypes is 2017 and 2020), and 10 years more to start mass production. <br><br><br><br>How many reactors would be needed? take as objective to replace Coal consumption. The world burns more than 1400 GWY of Coal per year. <br>How long would it take to replace that poison? if we installed a 1 GW MSR per Week, it would take 27 years. <br><br><br> <br>I am aware that all this may be too late for our planet (as we know it), so it's just a possibility.

One commenter pointed out that you need amplification if you're ever to get beyond high-power AM stations feeding crystal receivers. This means either tubes or transistors. On YouTube there's a French guy who demonstrates crafting his own tubes (after building the equipment on which they're constructed, like high-vacuum pumps). But there's one serious (I think) stumbling block: he salvages the tungsten filaments from incandescent light bulbs. Now anyone who's examined a light-bulb filament with a magnifying glass or low-power microscope will appreciate the challenge of fabricating such an infinitesimal piece of wire - it's a <b>helix within a helix</b>, a very long and thin wire of pure tungsten double-helixed so it can be crammed into a little light bulb. Given the incredibly high melting point of tungsten, how in heck do you fabricate such an object? I realize that even this technology is 100 years old, but this step of the process stumps me.

Crochet is a kind of knot making which is extremely versatile. Almost any string-like substance, from lace, to torn-up old clothing strips to various yarns can be crocheted into rugs, potholders and similar useful items.

Two good books are by Dorothy Moore and Donald McGunn. Both are OOP and were selling for from $10-$20 second hand the last time I looked. Wishful thinking to the contrary, tropical ethnic clothing styles are not practical in cooler climates, and, people do love the comfort of clothing which fits them exactly, as Ashley said above.<br><br>I also suggest that technical drawing is a skill which should be preserved. The textbooks and tools are still around, and the essential tools, T-square, dividers, compass, scale, etc., were well made from good materials and can last almost forever.

I'm typing this as I look down onto Nevsky Prospekt in St Petersburg. My job comes with an apartment in a Soviet-era housing block. It has a cramped kitchen, a small bedroom, a living room, a tiny toilet and a not-very big bathroom. I feel - with my British sensibilities of space - that I have just enough space, living on my own. When it was built, of course, there would likely have been three generations of a family squeezed in here.<br><br>Not only is there no washing machine, there is no space where one could possibly be fitted. In the bathroom, I found a T-shaped wooden tool, used for agitating clothes so that they can be washed in the bath without bending over. I'm not very good at doing this, not having had much practice. Fortunately, this morning I discovered that this apartment complex has a central laundry, where residents can take their dirty clothes. Its fees are quite reasonable - but probably, Soviet citizens may have found them quite steep, and would have preferred to wash and dry their clothes in the apartment, as granny slept on the sofa and the kids amused themselves out on the streets somewhere...<br><br>Central St Petersburg, as I look at it out of the window here, is quite interesting. Nevsky Prospekt itself looks very prosperous these days, but even the major streets radiating off it have grand 18th or 19th century buildings with the plaster crumbling and the roofing entirely made of rusting corrugated iron.

Same basic layout and dimensions as my last house which was built in 1763. At any rate I installed a very large masonry heater in the center of the house and a Jotul 121 in the basement. This winter I’m on track to burning 4 cord of wood. The masonry heater takes a small fire twice a day, the woodstove is back up in case of polar vortices! The heater has a brick oven above the combustion chamber which is great for breads, pizzas, cassole, grilling meats, etc. It starts at about 1000F post firing, hangs at 400-450 for about 4 hours, then settles out at 325 until the next fire. It takes about a week to get the mass up to temp in October, and about a week for it to lose the heat if we go away or when spring comes. Because it is fired flat out it can burn woods that you wouldn’t put in a wood stove, for example resinous pine and other softwoods. There is no creosote production at these combustion temperatures. A serious investment, right around 20K including the chimney, but the fuel is free (50 acres of forest) so payback is less than ten years at $/btu.

Exporting would accrue Bancors, importing would expend Bancors. Nations would be expected to maintain, within a small percentage, a zero account with the ICU. Each nation’s Bancor account would be related to its national currency through a fixed but adjustable exchange rate.<br><br>Nations that imported more than they exported, debtor nations, would pay a small interest charge to the Clearing Union on their overdrawn account. This would encourage them to promote exports as well as a marginal currency devaluation. But equally nations that ran an aggressive trade policy and exported more than they imported would also be charged by the Clearing Union for their surplus account. This would encourage them to find ways to spend their excess Bancors back into debtor nations or gradually lose that surplus. These charges were intended not so much as a deterrant or punishment but as a benign feedback mechanism ensuring that over time trade would remain in balance.<br><br>If Greece and the other weaker countries were allowed to restore their national currencies but were part of Keynesian type European Currency Union with the remaining Eurozone the currency problem and the chronic trade deficits with Germany could be resolved.<br><br>It would also be in the interests of the US to cooperate with the BRICs and the EU and agree to a Keynesian ICU for the global economy. As things stand the dollar's role as world reserve currency is not sustainable and if an ICU were set up the US would be cushioned against a potential collapse of the dollar with devasting effects on the US economy. <br><br>In my view it is only the US military that maintains the dollar's role. It's interesting that the only thing the Axis of Evil nations had in common when they were first labelled such was using the euro to denominate their bank reserves and do all their overseas trading and shopping. At one stage, Venezuela and OPEC also considered switching to euros.<br><br>The Eurozone crisis has already led to the rise of neo Nazis in Greece and could give rise to terrorism in the Meditteranean countries. The global competition between the dollar, euro and yuan could lead to war. A Keynesian ICU might avoid a lot a people getting killed. <br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c7712819356699524714 title="comment permalink">1/17/14, 1:38 PM</a><br><br>

One the one hand, some people insist that only a massive government programme along with broad support could possibly avoid or at least slow down decline. But when a government actually implements this -- and has been doing so quite successfully for more than a decade now -- suddenly the same people will say it's all useless and won't work anyway.<br><br>I tend to interpret this as a moral superiority complex: Pointing out what others should do (but aren't doing) can feel incredibly good. Until the others actually start doing what you pointed out. Now they've taken away your moral superiority. Who do they think they are? Quickly, tell them it's all wrong and futile anyway so you can feel morally superior again! Ha, that'll show them!<br><br>On a more serious note: I'm quite sure the German think tanks involved in the energy transition are acutely aware that our current energy habits cannot possibly be sustained with renewables. In 2010 a study on peak oil by a Bundeswehr think tank was leaked and made the rounds in the media (if anyone is interested, simply google "german military peak oil study"). It shows that the German military (and, by extension, the German government) have a <i>very</i> clear understanding of peak oil and its dire consequences (the government wisely chose not to comment on the study at all). Still, something like the energy transition has to be sold to the masses somehow without causing panic or despair. The claim that everything will be alright and we can continue to consume as before is a sales pitch, nothing more. <i>Keep calm and build windmills.</i><br><br>What else should they do? Nothing, like all the others?<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c560745150662491273 title="comment permalink">1/17/14, 2:30 PM</a><br><br>

Any plan for the future that doesn't start with using much less in the way of energy and other resources simply isn't serious. The strategy they and other national governments should have embraced would focus first and foremost on energy and resource conservation, along with decentralized (homescale and village/neighborhood scale) energy production and incentives for local production of necessities. That would have sharply increased the resilience of the nation as a whole, and made it less likely that a crisis in one area would trigger cascading failures elsewhere. Politically, of course, that's a non-starter, because it requires coming to grips with the reality of our predicament; still, that's the approach that would actually have helped. <br><br>Deedl, I'm uncomfortable with the thought of giving you a lesson in your own cultural history, so I'll simply encourage you to look up the bog-standard German rhetoric about "the Anglo-Saxon cultural circle" between 1871 and 1914, and note the similarities to your post. That said, if that's not what you had in mind, fair enough; I admit I was nettled by the bland arrogance of your assumption that I couldn't possibly be familiar with any language but the one I grew up with. That comment of yours would have been gauche under any conditions; given that I've just spent a year talking about Friedrich Nietzsche and Oswald Spengler, it was really quite uncommonly rude. <br><br>Tom, those are excellent points. One of the major challenges to be faced by health care in the deindustrial future is the need for health care providers to back out of the current fetish for hyperspecialization and get back to plenty of general practitioners and a few specialists. <br><br>K-dog, that's why it's up to us -- individuals who see the need and are willing to invest their own time and effort -- to make the thing happen now, while there's still time to save much of what's currently known. <br><br>Anonymous JLE, yes, that's one of the things that solar power proponents usually forget -- just how much energy it takes to manufacture a PV cell. As for the story, I don't recall anything by Ellison like that -- are you possibly thinking of Asimov's "The Feeling of Power," which has a similar plot? <br><br>Boddah Meep, I've seen Shaolin shovel forms; I don't know that I'd call them sneaky, as they're well designed to reduce an opponent to bloody chunks, but they'd certainly do the trick. <br><br>Irishwildeye, excellent. Glad to hear it. <br><br>Joel, of course it'll require sorting and a fair amount of the sort of hands-on knowledge any craft picks up. "Now you don't just throw bottles like this into the crucible," the master says to the apprentice; "you have to crush it, and mix it with some of this sand over here, and then you get something you can use..." <br><br>Mkroberts, yes, there's also that little point! As for glass, granted, that could be a bottleneck, but there may be ways around that; the sooner it gets some serious attention from green tech types, the better.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c3470421454983735381 title="comment permalink">1/17/14, 2:54 PM</a><br><br>

At the beginning of the First World War, when almost everyone else in the German literary scene was spouting bombastic Prussian platitudes, Hesse published an essay using Schiller's words as the title, trying to counter the hysteria; of course he was denounced for it in extreme terms. <br><br>Parenthetically, I take a wry amusement in the way that Hesse so often got (and gets) dismissed as an impractical dreamer disconnected from the real world. In 1914, he predicted that the war would be a disaster for Germany; by the early 1920s -- you'll find this in <i>Steppenwolf</i>, for example -- he was already saying that what passed for German patriotism at that point was driving Germany straight toward a second war that would be even more disastrous than the first; in <i>The Glass Bead Game</i>, he predicted that the wars of the 20th century would end European global dominance and reduce Europe's nations to minor players in global politics. The soi-disant "hardheaded realists" dismissed all these predictions -- and we've seen who turned out to be right...<br><br>Cherokee, that's got to be grim. Stay safe!<br><br>Karim, that's very good to hear. Here the US, unfortunately, most people treat PV and other green energy options as excuses not to conserve. <br><br>Tyler, remember that <i>Star's Reach</i> is well along the curve of recovery, long after the really harsh times of the drought years or the Third Civil War and its aftermath. I'll be discussing dark ages in more detail as we proceed.<br><br>Phil, it's similar here, though there are inescapable differences generated by the location and orientation of mountain ranges. <br><br>Raul, until it's proven to be commercially and economically viable, it's vaporware. Plenty of technically feasible processes are expensive toys or irrelevancies because they can't be used in a manner that will pay for itself. The core point I was trying to make, though, is that what you did here is something that happens whenever anybody tries to have a serious discussion about the aftermath of the industrial age, and what to do about it: instead of contributing to that discussion, people try to derail it by waving around some technology or other that can save us all, blah blah blah. That's an evasion, not a contribution. <br><br>RPC, that's a complicated issue. Of course fossil fuels also get subsidies, but for the most part, they have vastly better EROEIs than renewables do. A case can be made that subsidies for fossil fuels are mostly there to line the pockets of the rich, while subsidies for renewables in many cases are the only things that make renewables economically viable at all. <br><br>Dick, I'm going to repeat my recommendation of Pete Friedrich's book <i>Instruments of Amplification</i>, which presents several handbuilt vacuum tubes that don't require tungsten filaments, and several other ways of amplifying that don't use tubes at all. There are other ways of doing the thing!<br><br>Ozoner, damp climates are hard on paper, no question. I don't know a lot about the best ways to counter that, but it's an issue that needs to be explored. <br><br>August, I thought so. Thanks for the details!<br><br>Thrig, good.

(My wife, who teaches drop-spindle spinning at the local yarn shop, is delighted as well; she says it's great that more people who work with fiber are realizing that what they're doing isn't just a hobby, but a contribution to the future as well.) Yes, yes, and yes; all of this is worth doing. <br><br>Progress, good. Yes, I will indeed ask that, and look forward to hearing from you. <br><br>Roger, take a moment sometime to calculate how much of your income gets paid out in taxes and other payments to government at all levels, national, state, and local. Your average medieval peasant paid considerably less of his annual in-kind income to the local baron and the church. One of the reasons that feudalism takes off so quickly and so reliably in the aftermath of a failed civilization is that the local baron normally charges much less for his services than the late and not always lamented empire charged for the equivalent.

The sort of multiculturalism that we accept as the norm today and view as a human right is another offshoot of the fossil fuels boom and derivative effects like globalization. Historically, people lived in communities of people who were like them, and this has always been the normal way of things. This is especially true since different cultures and ethnic groups often have radically different beliefs and cultural values, and it’s not always possible to split the difference or dumb everything down to the lowest common denominator. Even in the UK, we see Pakistani immigrants forming neighborhood watches in areas where Roma immigrants have moved in because crime rates and ethnic conflicts have gone through the roof wherever the Roma have settled. What is wrong with people preferring the company of those who are like them and share the same set of values?<br><br> A professor of mine once argued that much of the social welfare system and so-called “affirmative action” programs are essentially the result of the government buying peace by bribing potentially aggrieved elements of society into not rioting or challenging the status quo. He also argued that much of what passes for politics these days is essentially political economy, that is to say, who gets the goodies and who has to pay the price.<br><br>As recent riots in London, Paris and Stockholm show, that seems to be not working as well as it used to, and I think we see a lot more that sort of ethnically motivated conflict in Europe, America and elsewhere. As the Long Descent continues, governments will be less and less able to keep the peace using this approach because the funds and resources will no longer be there. We will have to return to a community based model, those communities will be much more homogeneous, will be based on a firm set of cultural and moral values, and those who either cannot or will not abide by the values of their community will have to leave or pay a heavy price for not doing so. There will no doubt be many such communities living side by side, but within a given community, there will be a lot less “diversity” and a lot less tolerance for criminal, deviant and antisocial behavior and behavior which violates the social norms of that community.<br><br>The sort of mass immigration and enforced multiculturalism and “diversity” (which is really nothing more than a weasel word for the socially destructive racial, ethnic and gender politics of the radical Left) that we see today is going to cause huge conflicts, even civil wars and insurgencies, in the not so distant future in many countries. It’s only due to the fossil fuels boom and the things it made possible that the leftists and liberals could indulge their utopian fantasies, including those of an egalitarian society, which has never existed on the face of the Earth and never will. Even hunter-gatherer tribes tended to be dominated by a small group of tribal elders and often warred with other tribes. It’s just the way things are.<br><br>We should and will return to smaller, decentralized political structures, and yes, communities that are based on ethnic ties, in part because the ethnic, racial and religious conflicts will be too severe to manage otherwise in the absence of the Leviathan state.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c1760771009905066281 title="comment permalink">1/17/14, 3:25 PM</a><br><br>

Since the start of winter, we have had less than a week of heavy rainfall, and nothing beyond that. The governor has now declared a state of emergency predicated by drought, and wildfires are starting up already down south. Locally, the water authorities are apparently about to open up the reservoir to provide for the coming irrigation. Ironic, considering that we're right next to the California delta, the water transmission hub for the entire state. Last winter, I seem to remember, had heavier rainfall with less concern over water supply. Winter 2011/2012, though, was an outlier, as there was no rainfall at all until the latter half of spring. Almost like some sort of tropical monsoon?<br><br>It's also interesting to read Bill's comments about the west coast fish populations being repopulated from the sea. The Delta water supply controversy was partly predicated by a judge's ruling that the endangered Delta smelt was being killed by the pumps which provide much of the San Joaquin Valley, and there's also concern about the population of salmon spawning on the Sacramento River. The San Joaquin River is pretty much innavigable in the northern part of the valley, and even if industrial-grade irrigation tapered off, climate trends make me wonder if that would really change.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c4646162778283368843 title="comment permalink">1/17/14, 3:51 PM</a><br><br>

Not so much over the long term, because you have losses in the bearings: they run down over time.<br><br>They're easy to make, and are excellent accumulators: you can spend an hour on a bicycle spinning one up, and then throw the clutch and use up all that energy in a fraction of a second -- that's a lot of power. It's also fairly easy to charge in parallel -- many people riding bicycles for an hour, say.<br><br>The issue you'll find with existing flywheel technology is that it's trying to duplicate the feats of the dead dinosaurs (oil) and compete in the big business environment. It's not enough to make a decent flywheel that serves a purpose: it has to compete with an electric motor attached to a gasoline-powered generator, AND you have to be able to standardize it and sell one to everyone for all possible uses.

Will it be possible to retain any appropriate technologies by those who pass through to the other end? Perhaps any technologies that can make use of only what can be found in nature, would be great ones to pass down. Provided life can persist, there will always be fibrous plants, trees and animals. It could be that the sun will only be captured by plants for a long period of time, and wind will only be dispersing seeds and nutrients. Building anything may be exceedingly difficult and likely to yield temporary structures. <br><br>Permaculture, particularly forest gardens, would be useful to pass down. Working with, rather than against nature, would certainly be preferable to what civilisations usually end up doing.<br><br>Humans, of course, will go extinct some day, and any passed down knowledge will be lost. Maybe we shouldn't be trying to pass down anything other than basic survival knowledge (which isn't don't now). That got humans to and through past civilisations.

TomK for one.<br><br>A number a people have questioned for what purpose primitive calculation could be deployed. <br><br>The first numerical weather prediction forecast, by pencil-paper-slide rule combo, was undertaken by Lewis Fry Richardson during World War I in between hauling bodies from trenches to hospital units (now that is a scientist!). Richardson estimated that one would need tens of thousands of human calculators to give a useful forecast before the weather arrived as Richardson's own forecast of 6 hours took weeks to complete. This was not viable until von Neumann put his ENIAC machine to work 30 years later using a stripped down version of Richardson's own equations. <br><br>Perhaps it is possible to produce a viable forecast using even a more minimalist weather model with a slide rule, and with what we know today about the weather? Perhaps a network of that neolithic technology, the barometer, could be maintained and communicated with a bunch of Greer's radios to provide the intial conditions? Or are more traditional methods ranging from the mythological to the graphical to the statistical (which is sometimes a complete connected circle) more realistic? <br><br>The real question though is whether any systematic weather forecast is terribly high up on the list of necessities going forward? It is quite possible that a weather forecast is an industrial-era luxury that doesn't work perfectly anyway and can be essentially papered over with a bit of know-how, experience (climate change?) and an umbrella.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c117004550460004218 title="comment permalink">1/18/14, 6:34 AM</a><br><br>

I know you were being helpful, and it is appreciated. It was a shock to the system to see the topic dismissed, as I've spent 10 years studying the subject and with each, I feel I know less and less. And I'm sure that I could spend the next few decades on it as well. <br><br>7 or 8 years back, I had the opportunity to lead an ongoing discussion on this topic, which included subsistence farmers from truly non-western, isolated tribal regions of Argentina, Mexico and Honduras. It was interesting to learn that their approach to food was basically similar to our North American Native approach, or to the "pottage-centered" approach of medieval European peasants. Or really, any community that has to grow most of its own food and is pressed (or values) time, like Dogen's culinary prescriptions in medieval Japan. <br><br>So, of course, applying that approach, I can claim to have grown 100% of my own food last year, but to have been too spoiled to take advantage of it. I'm sure many homesteaders can make the same claim. It can be used for anything you can grow, forage or hunt, and requires NO storage processing and minimal preparation labor.<br><br>But a "bread and pottage" diet isn't likely to win over many to the cause of sustainable living. And providing calories becomes a major problem. <br><br>I cannot fathom that grains will continue to be a major part of our diet in North America. Even if I assume that we're only going to attempt to keep a tiny fraction of our population going, I can't imagine us growing as much grain as was grown in our pioneer era on our now depleted soils, under climate stress, and current levels of ecosystem degredation. Impossible. <br><br>Unfortunately, the meat-heavy diets implied by the AMAZING farming experimentation of Joel Salatin or Mark Sheppard seem equally unsustainable. First, these methods are heavily energy dependent. But more importantly, their "multi-level marketing" business model should be a huge clue that they haven't found something sustainable. And finally, can you imagine a North American diet where meat is an EVEN BIGGER percentage of the diet than what we eat now? <br><br>So I have focused on the diets experimented with by Ecology Action as the best way forward. We use plans similar to that provided in One Circle Garden to ensure food autonomy and limit our growing time requirements. Next, we use extensive methods to add variety to our diets. This is very similar to the hedgerow culture of England, or really the foraging cultures throughout Europe. And still, turning all the stuff we grow into FOOD, minus the "bread and pottage" approach, in a sensible amount of time is difficult. I cannot yet imagine a culture that can do this and sustain the amount of specialization necessary to maintain our critical multi-generational projects, such as dangerous nuclear infrastructure, etc.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c3639802338124812510 title="comment permalink">1/18/14, 7:13 AM</a><br><br>

I'm also aware that much of the tax levy is thrown away. <br><br>For example, are military expenditures worthwhile? Many people see the US military as a force for global order. I see it mostly as a gigantic waste of money.<br><br>Global order? The US fleet runs hither and yon with dozens of aircraft carriers and nuclear armed submarines. What good are they? Everyone knows the nuclear arsenal is for show. <br><br>Sanctions? Iranian mullahs laugh in their beards. As for this current Iranian charm offensive, everybody's in stitches. And I'll bet these current "negotiations" have them rolling in the aisles in Teheran. And not only in Teheran. I mean, who are we kidding? Was the eventual outcome - an Iranian nuclear stockpile - ever in doubt? <br><br>Around the South China Sea the local regimes are hoping hopelessly for American help because it isn't coming. They will confront China - or not - on their own. The realization must be dawning on them. Blue State Americans (who at least in their own minds are highly educated and knowledgeable about the wider world) are running foreign policy for now. And, from that lofty perspective, is the South China Sea, or Syria for that matter, worth the bones of even one misguided and ignorant Red State patriot? No chance. <br><br>As for the Palestinians and Israelis, can they even keep a straight face when Hillary or John go over to talk sense? <br><br>The US "supports" this or that kleptocratic despot? So what, it's all a waste of money, the regimes in question don't need American "support". They have more than enough money of their own. <br><br>You could go on forever on the waste and the pointlessness. <br><br>How will it be in the future? I'm not optimistic. It may be cheaper for a local Baron to run things but I have a feeling they'll still find ways to really annoy their subjects. I think they'll go from whacking jihadis overseas to whacking people on their own soil. Nothing like a good rampage. This is what people do. <br><br>But, as you say, more on this as we proceed.

But, if that's the case, then the wolf came in sheep's clothing as they say and the wolfish ideology clothed itself with talk of love, compassion, equality. All good things. Who could argue? Only the mean-spirited and those of ill-will could argue. <br><br>But, regardless of motive, those in favor cast themselves as good hearted, enlightened, intellectual, forward looking, rational. Who wouldn't want to be like them? Really, don't you want to be able to get delectable ethnic dishes? Of course you do. Enough of the racism and judgmentalism and closed mindedness, enough of the church and the scowling pastor and the glowering old-people and nosy church-ladies, enough of parched Anglo ways and tasteless roast beef and dry and overcooked chicken.

Because, decades into this venture, it is how it is and we'll collectively have to find a way forward and try to keep the hot-heads under control. <br><br>The end point may be constellations of culturally homogeneous communities. It's how we get from here to there that's the worrying part. We've seen ethnic cleansing pretty recently. We see on the news and on youtube how multi-religious and multi-ethnic places crack up.

I am very worried about those in Europe who wage hateful campaigns against Islam per se. There are many Fascists and far right militants in Europe who regard Muslims the way they did Jews in the Thirties and see the left as traitors betraying the nation. This is the ideology of Breivik.<br><br>However this is not to be confused with criticizing multiculturalism. I believe Marine LePen in France is right in criticizing multiculturalism. It is a concept that cannot work if you desire a cohesive, society, built on solidarity, justice and trust. Those goals can only be achieved when there is a high level of trust present in a society, which is in turn a result of shared behaviors, norms and values and yes identity. Multiculturalism undermines this by putting all norms, values, behaviors and identities on an equal footing. I fear that multiculturalism and trust in a society are inversely related, whereas the more culturally homogeneous a society the more social solidarity there will be.<br><br>Perhaps in the early days our decision makers were too naive to see that mass immigration is detrimental to solidarity, national cohesion etc. But mass immigration is the perfect weapon against the working classes. It leads to wage dumping, and if those imported for work can't find work it puts strain on the social safety net that was supposed to protect the working class of a country. The more the majority believes that a disproportionate amount of social security benefits are going to ethnic minorities and immigrants the more likely they are to be hostile to the welfare state. Labour unions in many places were always a little bit more uneasy about mass immigration than other parts of the left, because it was so blatantly obvious that it damages one of their core interests. But by now they're either completely subdued by the diktat of political correctness and the fear of being branded racists when they criticize mass immigration, or they have changed sides to the likes of the National Front in France. It's a sad situation because it really is a case of one vulnerable group (the working class) being played against the other (poor undereducated immigrants who want a better life). Sure the Middle Eastern or South Asian immigrants didn't come to France or Britain with the intention of damaging social cohesion and being troublesome. They didn't choose to be put away in ghetto-like suburbs that were going to turn into social hotspots. But that is what happened, and we now know that this is what you get unless you are very very smart about your immigration policies (like Canada, or Switzerland). But it has progressed beyond that point...<br><br>I believe the middle classes are next. They're attacked from all sides. Globalisation is proletarianising the middle class and they could become very dangerous and produce leaders of fascist or xenophobic nationalist movements.<br><br>Ultimately liberal values are not sustainable without social democratic economics and assimilation of the immigrant/ethnic minorities into a common culture. This cannot be done without defeating neoliberal economics on the right and political correctness on the left.<br><br>There is a political philosopher in France called Alain Soral who has coined the term Left of Labour and Right of Values.<br><br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c2736848493466129973 title="comment permalink">1/18/14, 12:07 PM</a><br><br>

The panels may be currently available for under a dollar a watt (thanks to billion-dollar factories selling at a loss), but the installed price, around here, is still more like $4. And that's not including either the grid maintenance costs (for grid-tie) or storage costs (for off-grid systems). Of course, monetary cost is not the same as energy cost, but it's a good hint for the hard-to-measure energy costs, and also is crucial for viability in the real world. Here in Vermont they're arguing now on how to modify the "net metering" rules, but if PV was indeed viable on its own then they wouldn't need to still subsidize it in multiple ways (tax credits for installation, paying above retail rates for the power sent to the grid, etc).<br><br>It is interesting though how the labor prices vary wildly around the world, e.g, in a poor village in India the PV installation costs are presumably a lot lower. Which opens up a wider question: to what extent can one de-couple from the surrounding society in terms of the energy intensity of the lifestyles. After all, the money paid to the installers in a first-world country is then used to buy gasoline for a personal automobile, send kids to an overpriced and air conditioned college, overpay the local medical system, etc. I am typing this comment to be sent over an internet connection that offers far more bandwidth than I need, but I am paying for it as if I was using the bandwidth, thus I am subsidizing my neighbors' usage of real resources for frivolous purposes (such as watching cute cat videos).<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c8532904144908191141 title="comment permalink">1/18/14, 12:17 PM</a><br><br>

If you picture a flywheel made of granite, two stories tall, it will store a whole lot of energy even if it's turning very slowly.<br><br>One downside of flywheels is gyroscopic forces. Basically, the axis of a flywheel wants to point in the same absolute spatial direction -- to a very good approximation, it wants to point at whatever star it was pointed at when you spun it up. You can wrestle it around to point somewhere else, but it resists the movement by twisting it around 90 degrees from the torque you are applying. This puts stress on the bearings, and thus slows the flywheel down through friction.<br><br>Since the earth is rotating, putting a different star along the flywheel axis at every moment, your bearings get a lot of stress as the earth's motion tries to make the entire flywheel twist out of its bearings. One solution to this is to point the axis of the flywheel directly at the North Star. If you're at the equator, this will mean a horizontal flywheel axis, and at the poles, a vertical flywheel axis. Anywhere in between, you'll have your flywheel axis at a funky angle to the ground, which may or may not be usable.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c8344325200210954475 title="comment permalink">1/18/14, 1:37 PM</a><br><br>

One source for this lumber was the virgin redwood forests of coastal Mendocino County, a couple of hundred miles north. <br><br>I attended a historical talk, illustrated with photographs, about how the forest was logged. Imagine the size of a full grown coast redwood: as big around as a large round dining table and about six storeys tall. (Giant sequoias, which grow farther inland, are shorter and bigger around.) These were felled by hand, sawed by hand into segments, the segments dragged out by large teams of oxen, then floated downriver to sawmills.<br><br>Some of the logged over land was purchased by the federal government and later transferred to the State of California, which for decades has contracted out to a consortium of non-profit organizations to manage a public group campground on it. The second growth redwoods, a mere century old, are already forty or fifty feet tall. Redwoods grow fast.<br><br>When the feds owned the land, it was one of dozens of family camp grounds operated by the federal government as a New Deal service. Camp David, the President's retreat, was originally another such camp. The Mendocino Woodlands is the only surviving New Deal campground still being used as a public campground.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c1306622829280276208 title="comment permalink">1/18/14, 4:40 PM</a><br><br>

The documentary was about advances in forensic medicine made by the New York City police department. There was a scene in a circa 1930 laboratory of a scientist rotating a pair of test tubes in a hand cranked centrifuge. It bolted onto the table like the hand cranked meat grinder my mother owned. <br><br>To the person who is working on a pedal powered washing machine, good luck to you. When you've developed your design, see whether improvements can be made to the hand cranked mangle (set of rollers for squeezing water out of laundry) that was bolted to the top of 1920s era washing machine tubs. And please do what you can to make your device commercially available. I'll buy it when I move house.<br><br> Back in the appropriate-tech era, I read about someone trying to design a muscled-powered washing machine for Third World countries. I kept my eye out to see what became of it, but it seems to have vanished without a trace. I suppose it had too low a priority to get funding. <br><br>Next to indoor plumbing and sinks with drains, the single biggest labor saving device for Western ohouseholds in the past century and a half may have been the washing machine. Getting the dirt out of clothes and sheets by slapping them on a rock, rubbing them against a washboard, or agitating them by lifting wet laundry up and down, is tedious and takes a lot of upper body strength. <br><br>If a household were to have piped hot water, a greywater drain, a mechanically efficient muscle powered device to agitate the laundry, a mechanically efficient device to squeeze out the water, and a place to hang the laundry out to dry, laundry could be done in a couple of hours without powered automatic machines. As energy prices go up and incomes go down, a bolt-on crank washer connected to the kitchen or bathroom sink might be an attractive alternative to the laundromat.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c8095040846741818831 title="comment permalink">1/18/14, 5:15 PM</a><br><br>

I don't expect this to last longer than the next decade or so (heralding Peak Porn and Peak Cat Pictures) but the sheer volume of existing computer chips and other hardware makes me think that at least rudimentary computer technology could persist for well over a century.<br><br>In this day and age, electronic devices are subject to planned obsolescence with an expected lifetime in the 3-5 year range, but I suspect that this is largely because consumers would rather buy a new computer than repair their horribly outdated 4-year-old one. A single failure of a critical component is enough to cause people to discard an otherwise functional electronic device.<br><br>In a world where new electronics are prohibitively expensive and no better than the old ones, the incentives will shift toward maintaining computing devices for long periods of time, as well as toward cobbling together homemade computers from the trillions of electronic components that have already been manufactured (sifting through the broken ones to find the ones that work).

Now that's a name to conjure with -- a couple of the best books in my Naked Hippie Library are by him. <br><br>Robert, it's a sensible scheme, and the reason it won't get put into place is the same reason it wasn't put into place in 1945: control over the world's dominant currency gives too many advantages to whatever nation has it, and so nations with the power to impose their will on others inevitably impose their currency as well. <br><br>Stream, ouch. The advantage of natural latex from rubber trees is that you don't have to replant every single year, so the return on energy and resources is better. Doing without latex may turn out to be more viable for most uses. <br><br>Moshe, back before the grid reached rural areas, many households had radios anyway, powered by batteries which were usually charged by windpower. You had an A battery and a B battery, one to heat the tube emitters and one to provide operating voltage. It seems to have worked fairly well. At the same time, the Soviets were mass producing thermoelectric generators powered by a single kerosene lamp that kept radios powered all across Siberia, so the absence of grid power clearly isn't an insuperable obstacle. <br><br>Enrique, one thing that people on the rightward end of the spectrum tend to lose track of is that ethnic communities tend to be shredded in the course of a civilization's fall, and what comes out of the mess isn't a restoration of old ethnic communities, but the emergence of new ethnicities. Consider the post-Roman history of Britain, in which millennium-old tribal identities went away forever and survivors from all over Roman Britain, hanging onto survival in Wales and Cumbria, redefined themselves as "compatriots" -- that's what Cymry, "Welsh," literally means. A plausible future history of Europe might see southern and central Europe occupied by a völkerwanderung from the Middle East, while the descendants of all of today's European peoples -- concentrated, perhaps, in Scandinavia, the Alpine regions, and the mountainous parts of far western Europe -- redefining themselves as members of the same new national communities, irrespective of where their ancestors came from. <br><br>K!EF, fair enough. Please do keep studying it, and get to work practicing it; it's a skill worth knowing. As for the claims about Chernobyl, I hadn't heard those -- does anyone else reading these comments know more? <br><br>Joseph, nah, you misunderstand me. I'm not saying that the politicians are too stupid or deluded to take a sensible approach. I'm saying that coming to grips with our predicament involves such a massive reorientation of society, in the teeth of so many special interests and popular prejudices, that it would be political suicide for the politicos to make those choices. <br><br>Ian, that's harsh news. In your place, I admit I'd get out if I could. Still, dissensus rules!<br><br>Enrique, no, it's not going away, since middle class lifestyles these days depend on importing laborers who will work for sweatshop wages, thus forcing down prices and sustaining the fantasy of prosperity. I wonder how many people who talk about the problems with mass immigration would be willing to see the cost of everything they buy double, let's say, as the price of shutting the door? <br><br>Unknown, oxen work better in some contexts; horses and donkeys work better in others.

Still, I'm baffled by your claim about food preservation. Solar drying, root cellaring, pickling, fermentation, and many other methods of food preservation don't require cheap energy, unsustainable agricultural practices, or slavery, and there are plenty of books out there about low-tech methods like these. <br><br>Mkroberts, historical examples suggest that there's a lot to be gained by trying to get useful knowledge and skills through any approaching bottleneck; those societies where such an effort takes place generally have an easier time returning to stability and relative prosperity after the dark age than those that don't. <br><br>Cherokee, that's a great example of resilience vs. efficiency. Old and clunky beats new and fragile every time once conditions get rough...<br><br>Wall1059, you know, this is interesting. For a very long time, people who've wanted to dismiss what I was saying have almost inevitably turned either to cornucopian or to apocalyptic claims. Now, for the first time since this blog got under way, I'm starting to field a significant number of "sure, we're going to have to give up some things, but I think you're too pessimistic" dismissals. That suggests that the conversation may finally have gotten past denial and anger and is starting into bargaining. An excellent sign!<br><br>Compound F, well, I'm not a great fan of Russell or for that matter of his definition of liberalism! Still, you're right that my point of view falls into the otherwise unoccupied middle ground among several of the core political and cultural dichotomies of our time. <br><br>Sunseeker, energy payback time is not EROEI, because it doesn't include a share in the whole system needed to make a given energy technology fit into the broader economy and society. If those systems actually had a 20+:1 EROEI, people who installed them would be making money hand over fist, instead of having to depend on government subsidies and going broke when those get cut. <br><br>Croatoan, if that's the technology that appeals to you, by all means get going on it, and share what you learn. <br><br>Crow, you can do a certain amount of functional weather forecasting without computers in two ways. The first is to have some basic meteorological instruments, track the weather you get, and learn what tends to follow what in your area. The second, if there are at least a few hundred miles of settled country to the west of you, is to have a radio and find out what weather they're getting today -- that's fairly often what you'll have tomorrow, adjusted for local climate and topography. Beyond that, yes, an umbrella and some tolerance for weather's vagaries are good to have!<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c8440075374566440034 title="comment permalink">1/18/14, 10:42 PM</a><br><br>

As for grains, there I disagree -- remember that I'm expecting a great deal of population contraction, and there are sustainable ways to grow grain if you're not trying to do it at current scales. Native American corn-beans-squash culture comes to mind, as does East Asian wetland rice culture -- post-climate change, a lot of eastern North America might be good for rice paddies, for example. <br><br>Nestorian, understood. The problem from my side is that I've seen far too many people trying to use spirituality the way they would use a new electronic gizmo, as a lifestyle accessory that (as technologies generally do) requires no deep personal involvement, and the results have not been good. <br><br>Lunchista, are you learning how to do that? <br><br>Roger, my point is that historically, in the twilight years of big civilizations, the local warlord generally provides better service for less cost than the former imperial bureaucracy did. That's one of the reasons that warband culture so reliably mutates into feudalism, and why feudalism is so resilient and so successful until urbanization comes in. More on this as we proceed!<br><br>Joseph, excellent. That's exactly the point -- and the question that follows, then, is how technologies that don't rely on unicorn horn dust can compete with the unicorn industry. The answer? They can't, if we're talking about competition in economic terms; the post-unicorn technologies have to find constituencies that will preserve and transmit them for reasons other than economics. That's the issue I've been trying to address here, in a variety of ways. <br><br>Dave, if coal-to-liquids fuel was that cheap compared to petroleum, energy companies would be piling into CTL like nobody's business. That's not happening -- which shows that your reasoning's flawed. By the way, Allied bombing campaigns didn't succeed in crippling any other part of Germany's wartime economy -- production of new planes for the Luftwaffe, for example, increased steadily right up until the end of the war -- so you're going to have to come up with something better than Allied bombers to explain why CTL didn't keep the Wehrmacht fueled. The reason, of course, is the very low EROEI, which made CTL uneconomical even with vast amounts of slave labor to dig and mine the coal. South Africa's SASOL CTL scheme, which used a similar process, was just as uneconomical in practice -- it had to be propped up by large subsidies, and even so, never really worked well. <br><br>Marcello, no argument there. We'll be talking about the prospects for fascism in the deindustrial future in a couple of weeks. <br><br>Moshe, no argument there either. Electricity just isn't that economically viable unless you have extravagant amounts of fuel to burn to generate it, and don't have to worry about the losses. <br><br>Joseph, the problem with spark-gap is that it isn't limited to a single band -- it sprays radio waves across the spectrum. A slightly more complex design with a crystal for frequency regulation will give you a nice tight signal, which you can then control with a Morse code key. Is it Skype? No, but ham radio operators who are good at CW (Morse code transmission) routinely beat the pants off teenage texters in competitions to see who can get the most information through fastest.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c8080989255577715875 title="comment permalink">1/18/14, 11:04 PM</a><br><br>

Of course with a sixth of the population and a quarter of economic output Germany is a major player in Europe, but it is still to small to influence European politics without partners."</i><br><br>I read Deedl's words and I think of the American Right who bristle and cry whenever someone points out, in a negative manner, the American dominance of the globe. "WE ARE NOT AN EMPIRE! WE ARE NOT AN EMPIRE!"<br><br>Deedl, I am quite willing to grant that the German people and government are much better behaved than they have been at certain times in the past and that they have generally better habits than a good part of the rest of the world. I'll even grant that these habits are as much a part of their national character as they are a result of enforced discipline from the outside(a consequence of all the events from 1918 to the present time). But it is a whole lot easier to be thrifty, constructive, and productive when your nation is sitting on top at the output end of a wealth pump sucking on the rest of Europe.<br><br>Some time in 2012, at the same time Mr. Greer was writing about the fall of empires, I read a small blurb in the Wall Street Journal. The article was a middling article buried in a middle page of the B or C section of the paper so not anything alot of people would read or worry about but it carried obvious overtones for anyone willing to see. It was about the preferential treatment the ECB and smaller commercial banks were giving to German industry. Not an unreasonable thing in and of itself, for the normal reasons, but one curious part of the giveaways was that commercial banks in southern Europe were forced to accept a provision granting individual purchasers of German cars lower interest rates on the loans then they would get on purchases of locally sourced cars. Think about that for a moment and you'll see why it represents a flow of wealth out of southern Europe and into Germany. That kind of concession can only happen because of the political power expressed by an <i>empire</i>.<br><br>Mr. Greer---<i>"Cathy, that BBC piece is stunning. High carbon steel is what you need for really good knives, swords, and many classes of tools. I had no idea that was being made that long ago!

The techniques that made it are now lost but the archaeological evidence for it goes back to 300 BCE. While it probably wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the Japanese were the pre-eminent metal workers of pre-modern history, tamagahane isn't intrinsically a noteworthy steel. Japanese swords acquire their exceptional qualities and characteristics not from the steel but from the exceptional knowledge the Japanese steel workers have of forging technique. Wootz on the other hand is a very good steel. India probably had the pre-eminent metallurgists of the pre-modern period. One of the what-ifs discussed by blade weapon enthusiasts is what might have been if Japanese metal workers had been able to apply their fantastic knowledge of forging technique to that fantastic steel.<br><br>4096 limit reached...cont.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c2232283427876678137 title="comment permalink">1/19/14, 2:51 PM</a><br><br>

Some dams have a facility to purge build-up but most don't and even the ones that do are not 100% effective at clearing it. Wouldn't this silt represent a rich source of trace elements gathered from across vast distances and concentrated at a dam? While they would be completely inadequate for replenishing the soils of the industrial farm belt they could be mined for intensive small plot farming.

Easier because the truly effective things we do aren't horribly resource intensive or complicated, harder because getting there is basically going to require a reboot of the entire system and the slaughtering of numerous sacred cows which will probably end up angering almost every stakeholder. I'll try and keep it brief.<br><br>From my perspective, one big problem is that our reach exceeds our grasp. You probably imagine the purpose of having a healthcare system is to treat otherwise healthy individuals who come down with something or other, get the condition treated, and go along their merry way. This does indeed happen, but that doesn't cost a whole lot, because the interventions usually aren't that complicated and once someone gets better, they're better and no longer need us. What really gets expensive is keeping people who are never going to get better "alive" no matter the cost or outcome.<br><br>Healthcare is also expensive because of all the regulations that have to be followed and the crazy markups for drugs, medical equipment, etc. A night at the hospital didn't always cost a month's salary, but with all the documentation, staffing requirements, etc. it does. I haven't really come up with a valid thermodynamic reason that a new drug takes literally 4 orders of magnitude more expense to the drug company to make than the bottle of 400 generic Benadryl you can buy at Costco for $3.99. Whenever I open up a pack of light blue Prolene sutures, I like to wonder if they came off the same assembly line as the fishing line they look identical to and were shunted aside, labeled "for medical use", and marked up 4000% like the tins of "premium" meat in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle.<br><br>You mentioned the AMA monopoly, but really doctor's salaries are only a small fraction of healthcare expenses. At a rough guesstimate, a typical primary care doc probably throws around 30 times their salary in resources, counting support staff, prescriptions, imaging, referrals, etc. An ICU intensivist probably comes out to more like 100 times or more of their salary. We get paid a lot, but we're responsible for a lot, too.

I’m not disagreeing with you about it being broad, but there were many, many stations on the air using it.<br><br>A couple very good books about the beginnings of Amateur Radio and all that was done with spark:<br>200 Meters &amp; Down<br>The World of Ham Radio 1901-1950<br>Both are available from the ARRL.<br><br>Also, narrow band reception isn’t now and wasn’t then reserved for factory-built receivers, just look through the issues of QST and the ARRL Handbook up to even the 1970’s, lots of 2, 3 and 4 tube and transistor regenerative and even superhet receivers to be built from scratch.<br><br> My father built several receivers for CW work in the 1930’s by scrounging tubes from the local radio repair shop’s trash pile. The first new tube he bought came at a price, he painted his parents whole house to get the money to buy it. The Hams today build simple regenerative receivers and use them on the air for CW aren’t doing without “narrow-band” receivers. Yes, they’re not up to the performance of the $2000 factory rigs but they are very useful in the crowded band today. The idea that hams had to buy a factory-built receiver to get decent performance is false. Many times all they could afford was to build their own.<br><br>Examples<br>Tube regenerative<br>http://makearadio.com/tube/tube-radio-schematics.php<br><br>Transistor regenerative from 1968<br>https://www.arrl.org/files/file/Technology/tis/info/pdf/6803024.pdf<br><br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c4341830905185775885 title="comment permalink">1/19/14, 4:25 PM</a><br><br>

On the contrary, it seems to promote it. It is far too easy for a corrupt sheriff to control an election by a delicate balance of intimidation and favoritism when the electoral margin need be only a few hundred votes. And many in the electorate want a sheriff who will do them special favors; they don't actually want bind justice and fair-handed rule-of-law. As I say around here, if you want to find the dogfighters, cockfighters, and meth cookers, drive around the countryside in election season and look for the yard signs for the incumbent sheriff. This is by no means an unusual situation; as far as I can tell it is the norm in rural areas.<br><br>Any checks that exist on local law enforcement come down from the State and the Feds. The ballot box is less than ineffective at removing, or even limiting, corruption; instead, it rewards it. <br><br>Bottom line -- just stay away from the people who are involved in those activities. Make your own circle of friends who are just not connected to the world of local law enforcement or organized crime. If you need the law, and the sheriff doesn't know you very well, you will probably get reasonable response. Just be sure not to give him any means by which he can pressure you into his sphere (i.e. anything that is either a threat, or an opportunity to exert control). Clean (in a legal sense) and modest living are your best defenses against lawlessness; you just don't attract much attention that way, which is a good thing. <br><br>And, if someone did break into your place and take some of your stuff, odds are it was your own nephew. Really. Not kidding. Handle it inside the family. <br><br>And be REALLY judicious about what beds you jump in to. <br><br>I guess the short version -- sustainable law enforcement is about being a peaceful member of your community. You don't attract trouble, and you will get help if trouble finds you anyway. Don't expect much from your sheriff; ideally he will barely know your name.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c5352658079207051217 title="comment permalink">1/19/14, 11:11 PM</a><br><br>

I’d like to test the ‘duck weed’ that grows on our ponds and sloughs, thick enough you can pick it up from the water in handfuls. That might be a way to harvest the phosphorous without harvesting the mercury. As a soil scientist, I would love to test soils in a 100 mile radius of coal plants and compare with prevailing wind maps. But since I live just 20 miles from one such plant, I’m ‘afraid’ of what I would learn about my own soil. How would my organic farm stand up if we find we have high soil mercury levels?<br>I’m living in an area that has undergone great demographic lose (50%) since the 1980’s farm crisis. I am bearing witness to the decay of infrastructure. I’m literally watching buildings collapse all around- barns on long vacant farmsteads falling in, grand 3 story brick Main St. buildings collapsing since the roof could not economically be maintained, consolidated school districts leave lovely schools sitting vacant in every small town, lack of remaining people to tend to the basics of community- serving on boards, providing leadership, delivering the Meals on Wheels, 4-H clubs …). In other words, I’m living through and have a front row seat to the Long Descent. And like JMG has said, we are coping by ‘harvesting’ the remaining parts of that ‘glorious past’ to build a different future. The bricks from the lovely 3 story building that collapsed are being used to build a small one story building. We used the equipment from the closed schools to build a community kitchen in a vacant Main St. building so local farmers can process their foodstuffs—like a mini processing plant. So far have made hard apple cider, maple syrup, grape juices and jams, and more in the past few months. <br>Per JMG’s comment about weather forecasting, we can watch our pastured cattle increased hunger for hay. They seem to know another artic vortex is on the way and have ‘tucked in’ to the hay at a greater rate. I so love having a husband who knows his animals so well that he can read their behavior. <br>In terms of adapting to a limited future, I start with my everyday life. I mind my ‘wants’ and train myself to be absolutely happy with what I have. I also pass this onto my kids. Let’s celebrate that we are warm on this cold night! Huzzah! Our dinner prayers is “For what we have, let us be truly thankful!” Our family of 5 downsized our house size, refuse to make any house upgrades for aesthetics only reasons, and are careful to invest in things. This way of thinking is a cure for western civ malaise, in my opinion. There are always improvement projects- gardens, compost, to say nothing of the larger farm projects. And I do want to work beauty into our farm. <br>Of great interest, on a dangerously cold day, you can look at the various plans drawn up by North Dakota State University being in the 1920’s through the 1980’s for barns, cisterns, rammed earth tampers (1925), solar collectors (1970’s), vegetable storage and much more. This is a nice collection of the legacy of a public university that sought to serve the small and mid-sized farmers around them. Check out the Misc. for plans for community buildings (1920’s) that I still see on the landscape around me in the township halls dotting the landscape. http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/extension-aben/buildingplans <br>Wonderful list of skills to preserve from you JMG and all the readers. One thing I’m seeing lost is animal husbandry. There were 200+ dairy farmers in our county 50 years ago. Now there is one. So many children were once raised knowing much about animals health, reproduction, care, housing, etc… Now that will no longer be passed down. We lose this broad based set of skills at or peril.

I can think of one example in the UK of a transport system which enthusiastic hobbyists and holiday makers helped to preserve though the second half of the 20th century, when it was in danger of being abandoned thanks to increasing use of cars and lorries. The fact that this system has been preserved could help to mitigate some of the affects of declining oil supplies. This is a real world example of how enthusiastic hobbyists can help to keep technologies going,even though main stream society had no need of them at the time because of cheap and plentiful oil.<br><br>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries a vast network of canals was built throughout Britain which helped to facilitate the industrial revolution. The development of the railways in the 1840’s led to a decline in the use of canals. However there was still enough commercial goods being transported on the canal network to keep it goinguntil the second world war. The rise of motorized transport then led to a rapid decline in the use of canals. From an economic point of view the canals should have been abandoned and left to silt up. In the early 1960 there was pressure from governments and local authorities to do exactly this. However Britain is a nation that loves messing about in boats and the canals were increasingly taken over by holiday makers in motorized cruisers and narrow boats. This meant that the canal network remained economically viable and continued to be maintained. Many canal were abandoned around the 1950’s and 60’s. However many local group of hobbyists and enthusiasts went to great effort to bring many of these canals back into use and restored locks and viaducts, because they saw it as a vital part of our heritage. As a result of this country still has an extensive network of canals and has preserved the skills needed to maintain and operate them. There are according to Wiki 2200 miles of canals and navigable rivers in England and Wales. Many of them connected in a network that goes from London to Bristol, Liverppol and many parts of the North and Midlands. This country would also have the skills needed to bring back those canals that were abandoned back into use. Many of these canals were designed for boats that could be pulled by horses so we would have a transport system that could still be used even in the absence of fossil fuels. This network will be vital in the future when it starts to be reused for transporting commercial goods.<br><br><br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c8229331991811534418 title="comment permalink">1/20/14, 9:39 AM</a><br><br>

I have a cousin who is an attorney in a mid-sized Western town that still has a rural mindset. He is a strong Catholic, white male, small-town-raised...in short, you think he'd be a total right-wing Republican. And he might have been had he not done a stint in the City Prosecutor's office shortly after law school. He was APPALLED at the corruption of the law enforcement, so much so that to this day (20 years later), he still shudders about it. Said they would manufacture "evidence", look the other way (depending), use brute force when completely unwarranted, take bribes, offer bribes, etc. etc. <br><br>I'm all for smaller, more localized communities.

These are two VERY different questions - currently, we're pouring probably the majority of our energy into activities which actively undermine society's continuation. The EROEI threshold for that is obviously going to be much higher than what is required just to keep something resembling industrial civilization.<br><br>Note that this can cut two ways: it suggests that we could keep a technological civilization going with lower-grade energy sources; on the other hand, such a civilization is not going to much in the way of luxury, unless those luxuries are restricted to an elite few. So you could have a egalitarian semi-tech culture, but you could equally well (and most likely with current trends) wind up with a high tech feudalism. If you restrict the high-intensity luxuries to 0.1% of the population, you can likely keep going like that for as long as your prole class will put up with it.<br><br>Secondly, I want to question your claim that there is any real agreement about a minimum EROEI threshold for technological civilization. Clearly such a limit must exist. By history it's less than about 20:1 and by inspection it must be higher than 1:1. More precisely, it get's hard to say.<br><br>I find <a href=http://www.theoildrum.com/node/8625 rel=nofollow>this post</a> and the associated graph (the second one) very helpful in thinking about this question in particular. As the author points out, at the end of the day, what matters is net surplus energy. The graph in question shows the available surplus energy under a range of EROEI conditions. Two things jump right out:<br>The difference between a high (100+) EROEI and a moderate one (~15) isn't very much, compared to the difference between a moderate one and a low one (~5). There's a knee in the curve right around 8, after which life gets increasingly more difficult.<br><br>In terms of the EROEI of a particular energy source, the difference between EROEI of 12 and EROEI of 8 is very much a function of chosen boundary conditions. But on a system-wide basis, the difference in net surplus energy is quite large. So I don't think we can necessarily conclude that renewable technologies CAN'T sustain a technological civilization - the critical threshold is in the error bands of the various estimates involved. The real answer is a function of the actual EROEI of the energy source, but is also a function of the level of non-energy-producing activities your civilization is trying to sustain, and it's level of energy efficiency.<br><br>At least in the context of the built environment (my area of expertise), getting serious about efficiency (I mean, actually serious; not the current level of interest which has a ROI threshold of 2-3 years) could make the difference between crashing at EROEI 12, or sustaining at EROEI 6.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c2789199229867155088 title="comment permalink">1/20/14, 1:37 PM</a><br><br>

They’re known as MPPT (maximum power point tracking) and use a funky algorithm (they are not all the same, some are way smarter than others – in this case price is a reliable indicator) to convert volts and amps so as to achieve the highest possible charging voltage and current.<br><br>- Those same controllers achieve increased efficiency over older controllers during sunny, cooler weather when the PV panels output higher voltages. The older controllers are PWM (pulse width modulation) which are basically super-fast switching devices.<br><br>- The reason for the previous point is that during hot weather, the actual voltage and current generated from the PV panels declines as the surface temperatures of the panels increases. Remember the panels generate electricity with light - not heat. People often confuse this point. Heat actually reduces the energy generated.<br><br>The funny thing is that so many people love to think of massive PV arrays in deserts (I suspect because the land is not built on and therefore out of sight). However, this is very sub optimal conditions for PV power generation. Pretty amusing huh? Add in a reflective concentrator and you will actually further reduce output as heat will be even more concentrated on the PV panels.<br><br>The final point that they raised was that the controller I use, because it actually does less functions (ie. The newer designs have to do the super-fast switching but also DC to DC voltage step down), it doesn't get as hot. One conclusion that they came to was that in these conditions the PWM controllers were actually having lower losses than the alternative newer controllers. Interesting stuff.<br><br>I really respect the people on the renewable energy forum as some of them are years ahead of me in terms of hands on experience in all sorts of areas.<br><br>As to the winter performance of solar PV, all I can add is that my winters are a lot sunnier than Germany. Honestly, I sometimes feel like telling people, "install it and then we'll discuss how it works in the real world."<br><br>PS: Is this week a frack load of comments or what?

But, arguably, more egalitarian than the current U.S. And certainly more so than the European feudalism that followed the fall of Rome.<br><br>I would argue that it was precisely the removal of the Gothic and Hunnic war bands from their parent societies, being Romanized, then grafted over a Romano-Celtic underclass; combined with a memory of a civilization in which all power and land ownership devolved to a common overlord (Caesar) than made European feudalism what it was.

Instead, it is transferred as genetically derived emotion, which the left brain often interprets as spiritual. These emotions disengage rational thought whenever our genes perceive a threat to themselves or to their alleles, without our left brain even being aware of it.<br><br>All this is fleshed out in great detail, with many referenced studies, in “The Spirit in the Gene,” by Reg Morrison, which I highly recommend. There is an excellent summary of Morrison’s main points here:<br>http://regmorrison.edublogs.org/files/2012/06/gamblers-3-2fe1qvj.pdf<br><br>Here is one of Morrison’s concluding statements, which may not make complete sense until you read the link referenced above:<br><br>“The widespread acceptance of such credos as creationism, astrology and sustainable economic growth gives adequate warning that the fraction of the population capable of applying even the most basic rules of evidence to mystically derived information is so small as to be inconsequential. It means also that the most seductive and dangerous forms of mysticism, those that underpin racism and religious fundamentalism, are totally bullet proof. <br>By selectively preserving the mystics among our hominid ancestors evolution not only gave us the weapon that would catapult us from obsolescence to world domination, it seems also to have taken out a shrewd insurance against our overwhelming success. Only such a deliciously rewarding and tamper-proof device as mysticism could have prevented us from foreseeing the danger of overpopulation a long, long time ago.”<br><br>I suspect you can't make a living espousing Morrison's ideas (amply demonstrated by the fact that Morrison's book is out of print), as there is great resistance to the idea that we are genetically driven just like any other animal. So I understand that you must continue to emphasize near term preparation for the long descent. I just thought you would be interested.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c4141473437797400158 title="comment permalink">1/20/14, 8:04 PM</a><br><br>

Just noting what I have observed. I think often about the potential for these corrupt local sheriffs having more control than at present; not necessarily an inviting prospect. I can say that in the short run, in a crisis, all this goes out the window and the ol' boys (yes, every last one of them is male) do their jobs. So when the cars crash or the water is rising they are reliable.<br><br>The issues of corruption and selective enforcement mostly arise in the realms of organized crime. In my area at present, this takes the form of cock fighting, dog fighting, other gambling activities, a small amount of prostitution, and a lot of illegal drugs. Worth noting that these drugs are banned by the feds, not the local laws. I can't imagine in the absence of the federal ban that marijuana prohibition would survive a month here. It is only the threat of federal charges that keeps the pot growers and distributors under the thumb of the sheriff's office. <br><br>So you do mostly have a choice. If you don't engage in any of the fighting, gambling or prostitution, and you limit your recreational chemistry to what you can grow yourself, you can for the most part stay out of the way of the graft. <br><br>For the record, I vote in every local election. When I don't know the names on the ballot, I talk to trusted friends who have been here longer. Another thing about rural politics, the names on the ballot are not strangers. They are people you see around town and do business with; some will be folks you know quite well.

The Leclerc Nilus is missing several wooden frame parts, which I could fabricate in the wood shop, but I don't have exact dimensions. The Glimakra Ideal is missing the ratchet wheels, which I think are made of just wood, and which might be complicated to make. They cost $120 each from the company, so I was hoping to maybe swap one from the Leclerc (made of metal), cut away the part of the breast beam which it mounts on with a slot and wedge, and instead just screw it in and attach handles to the beam. Then maybe find an old circular saw blade and do the same thing for the other ratchet. But I have reticence cutting the loom, such a pretty piece of wooden furniture, not just a functional tool. If any readers have the ratchet wheels and they are willing to part with them, please contact me on the green wizard forums,<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c4620164885460883911 title="comment permalink">1/20/14, 11:37 PM</a><br><br>

Wellfare state in ruins and social democratic parties attacking working class political opinions with vehement rage seen only between fights of former brothers... Cain and Abel stuff indeed.

Added to 68 TWh of hydro there is 8 TWh wind and 140 TWh of biomass, mainly in the form of wood. Solar is hardly measurable, Most of this is with old technologies and not all those hyped break-through technologies. Of course, I still with your assessment that it will not be possible on a global scale to run industrial consumer society for 10 billion people on renewables.

Mind you, you've sidestepped nearly all the issues I've raised on this blog about the problems with renewables, but that's standard.

My first ham radio homebrew was a little two-transistor regenerative receiver, which promptly surprised me by bringing in a shortwave signal from Cuba -- I was in Seattle at the time -- with nothing more than a random-wire antenna strung around the ceiling of my bedroom.

Religion is the other that reliably works.

Yes, I wondered, then I did some reading and study. One of the things I learn from the history of ideas is that the sort of hardcore behavioral determinism you're pushing is a very popular belief system when people aren't comfortable with their own actions, usually because of a mismatch between those actions and their official values. It's always comforting to be able to blame your genes, or divine providence, or some other outside force for your own choices -- and it's not too hard to make a deterministic claim into a closed-loop argument that's immune from disproof. Equally, when people want a good excuse to blame other people for their actions, free will ideologies are popular, because then you can insist at the top of your lungs that it's their fault. <br><br>Step outside the world of self-justifying ideologies and it's tolerably clear that human beings, like all other living things, are partly constrained and partly free, and that it's possible to increase the scope of individual freedom to some extent by bringing biological and cultural automatisms into consciousness and subjecting them to the "strange loops" of reflective awareness. Of course that middle view doesn't support anybody's agenda of blame, so it tends to get neglected -- even though it's the only one that escapes self-contradiction. <br><br>Juhana, there again, you're not paying attention to the lessons of history. The ruling classes are among the very first to go up against the wall when a civilization tips over into decline, and once fossil fuels become a major energy sink, those warlords who figure out how best to do without them will be much more likely to survive and triumph over the ones that cling to them. <br><br>Nano, the military's been on this for something like a decade. It's just the civilian leadership that's clueless. <br><br>Gunnar, exactly. We could have done so much if we'd have kept going with the promising starts made in the 1970s! As it is, that's water over the dam, and what matters now is what can be done with the limited time we've got left. <br><br>Hugo, glad to hear it.

But you guys got Tokelau 100% solar powered - cool!)<br><br>The intent is for cities/counties (property tax collecting authorities) to help get more energy efficiency and/or renewables out there. Since many people (now) move every few years, many homeowners don't want to pay for efficiency/weatherization/renewables as a lump sum up front, because they figure they'll be moving before they get payback. And such things are still considered outré, so they fear they won't get their money back if they sell before payback.<br><br>Or they just lack the capital, either in truth or because the new SUV/mondo flat screen TV/designer kitchen got a higher priority.<br><br>So the local governments use their highly rated debt to get cheap money, and lend it to homeowners to do the upgrades/installs, then the homeowner pays the government agency back over typically 10 - 20 years.<br><br>When one buys electricity from the power company, they do the financing of the power plant under the covers, and the ratepayers indirectly pay back the utility company's creditors over time. But if an individual buys their own mini power plant (or a bunch of insulation/good windows/etc.), the individual must come up with the capital explicitly.

Once JMG agreed with my ideas, I spent most of December getting infrastructure, website design and hosting in place.<br><br>Now that is set up, we're adding content now. One thing that's taking some time, is that JMG's Green Wizardry book is copy written and so we can't just post section of it to the site. I'm having to completely rewrite the major ideas in my own word, with only small quotes from the ADR and JMG.<br><br>Given the high standard he maintains in his writing I have been working hard to live up to that, so its taking some time.<br><br>The new site is going to have a lot more information. Sections explaining the Long Descent, what the concept of Green wizardry is, as well a ongoing course of study being built by I hope everyone here.<br><br>We will still have the forum but updated, as well a blog section.

Energy efficiency is what I do for a living, more or less.<br><br>That said, in an economy as ornate as ours, there are plenty of things we do which make us <b>both</b> less efficient and less resilient. Glass box skyscrapers, for example, or our addiction to SUVs.<br><br>And that's precisely my point. I have no illusions that we can keep our current lifestyles down at EROEI of 10:1. There is a lot of waste in the system, but not enough to squeeze us down that far and still give us glass skyscrapers, SUVs and cheap air travel.<br>However, I'm pretty sure we could keep (more or less) our current <i>standard of living</i> - which is distinct from lifestyle - at those low EROEIs if we can be at all smart about our resource allocation (the probability of <b>that</b> does seem pretty low, but see below.) For example, personal automobile ownership is probably not possible at 8:1, but a high degree of personal mobility (at least local mobility) probably is. (Or we can keep 1% of the population in SUVs while everyone else walks, but that circumstance is probably not stable for more than a generation.)<br><br>Responding to Matt Mc: That is a very interesting link and I will have to study it at length. But in principle I agree with the assertion that there is a threshold of viability which is pretty low, and a (much higher) threshold of investment. Or, to put it another way, there's a threshold of viability for technological civilization, and another threshold of viability for modern capitalism (i.e. the investment threshold).<br>As we cross the higher threshold, the economic system will show increasing signs of stress. At some point, the only thing which will keep the system going in our inability to believe in alternatives. (It may be that we're at this point already.) In this view, our future as a technological species depends on how we react in the space between the investment threshold and the viability threshold. If we let the old system die, then maybe we can figure out a new approach. Or we can ride the old system right on down, past the real threshold of viability - at which point, technological civilization is in fact utterly doomed.<br><br>Based on my personal experience, this is really key. This breakdown of the old order will, hopefully, take with it a lot of our modern expectations and illusions. And that is key, from the point of view of technical sustainability. I can design a building - even a large, high occupancy commercial building - to remain comfortable in all kinds of weather, with very little energy use.<br>I cannot design such a building to operate effectively without the active participation of the occupants. Occupant behavior is central to the effectiveness of radically green buildings. Currently we expect the building to keep us comfortable without any mindfulness or involvement on our part, and THAT is the truly insurmountable design barrier. If during the breakdown we are able to let go of those expectations, a whole new vista of potential low-energy solutions will open up for us.<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c7296393164278746337 title="comment permalink">1/23/14, 5:51 PM</a><br><br>

I can quite understand, having done more than my share of 12-hour days in the recent past. <br><br>I sympathise as well: I used to be be involved in politics, and I sometimes found it incredibly frustrating that people just didn't seem to understand that there were really important things that needed doing to address social problems etc... Of course, other people had their own, usually more pressing, issues to be dealing with. <br><br>Perhaps you've done this, but I suspect you need to reconsider your marketing strategy. 'Marketing' is often taken to be a dirty word, but it isn't: it simply means identifying what people want, and responding to it.<br><br>In the case of the audience here at TAR, some readers are interested in the topics JMG covers, but aren't doing much about it in their own lives, or don't know where to start. They don't need the Green Wizards site - or at least, it wouldn't appear to be the most obvious destination. <br><br>Some are already deeply engaged and knowledgable, but their time is occupied actually getting things done; contributing to the Green Wizards site would actually consume time that could be used more effectively on their own efforts. <br><br>Others, like me, may have identified the skills they want to acquire, and in so doing have also identified the people we need to learn from IRL. As I mentioned before, the Green Wizards site is not useful as a knowledge source but neither are we knowledgable enough to contribute.<br><br>A handful have both the time and the knowledge to contribute meaningfully.<br><br>So what could you do? <br><br>Well, one way is comparatively cheap: identify bloggers who are learning relevant skills, or experts in these fields, and incorporate their RSS feeds into the site. This will take some setting up and curating, but is ultimately easier than having everything written freshly. There are lots of people in traditional crafts etc who have blogs of some kind or other, and people are more likely to write for themselves and people they know on their own blog than to write for strangers on another site.<br><br>Secondly, get yourself mentioned, or write guest posts, on related blogs that have a bigger audience. Our host has mentioned several times, I think, that his readership has been boosted after TAR was mentioned elsewhere, bringing in curious new readers. <br><br>You may also want to think about the look and feel of the GW site. At the moment, it's very bare-bones, which may work for TAR, but a lot of people will be more comfortable with photos and an attractive design. Having just visited it to take a look, you also need to sort out the hosting - the URL still contains "http://teresamcguffey.com/", so some settings are wrong somewhere.<br><br>Anyway, just a few thoughts that are meant to be helpful!<br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c222806013307514972 title="comment permalink">1/25/14, 11:59 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c1547418972091381448></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/16927729321817286956 rel=nofollow>nwlorax</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Dear Fellow Readers:<br><br>I don't respond often because well and truly, the Peak Oil Debate shaped all of my childhood and youth through college and reliving it is usually a no win subject. <br><br>I inhaled almost every issue of the AAPG (American Association of Petroleum Geologists) journal, from 1969-1984, edited one article of some import, and three important biomarker species of nanoplankton that differentiate between terrigenous and pelagic sedimentation are named after my sisters. I remember 1972 very clearly, because AAPG statisticians in the "7 Sisters" proved conclusively that many if not most of the small inner city children of the US will freeze to death if lead is removed from gasoline due to the need to divert heating oil into gasoline production. Obviously, this didn't happen. So, let me suggest a useful strategy for evaluating nonsense,or at least improbability applicable across many fields. <br><br>An enormous contribution to mathematics made c. 1935 was Benford's law. (Yes, someone else nailed it c. 1890, but Benford published.) Simply stated, it is possible to differentiate between nonsense and useful data sometimes-in some contexts-by looking at the digits. I mention this because so long as counting and differentiating things into groups is a useful skill, probability and statistics will be valuable. <br><br>Benford wrote before Eniac et al existed. In fact, an argument could be made that without the physical book that Benford looked at, noting which pages were more discoloured from use than others, his discovery could not have been so easily made. <br><br>Had Benford's work been applied to the (fill in the blank) financial crisis, said crisis would have been nipped in the bud by forensic accounting. At least I hope so. <br><br>It is possible to do very complex math without digital electronics. Until the early 1960's tide computers in the US (for all coastal areas) were mechanical. That's right, they used rooms filled with gears, offset cycloids and the like, and got the right answers which were then published. The electronic replacements for the tide computers copied the input and derived equations to make a virtual copy of this machine. <br><br>Seems to me that using a voice input system to ask a central database a simple question about adding two single digit numbers is not a triumph of technology, but of stupidity. A smarter machine system would respond at a much lower level of complexity and energy use by solving the problem directly or requiring the user to solve it. Back in the 1950's this was known as "Polymorphic Computing" and fell out of favor when memory became less of a constraining factor. <br><br>The right questions to unleash computational prowess on might be something like this--<br><br>What is lowest erg-consuming device or methodology that can perform operation/calculation X? (No cheating by introducing a brilliant mathematician who survives only on stuff grown on some offshore island.) <br><br>We should be looking at ways to design and implement such machines, recognizing that some processing is best done by humans. I can think of one failed Mars mission where the failure to maintain the Metric System in measurements cost ~$670 million dollars. <br><br>Some natural cycles are so long that we as a species haven't been keeping records long enough to notice these things. Given that modern Corporate Society is based on ignoring all information older than 90 days, seems to me there is some room for improvement in designing sustainable methods.<br><br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c1547418972091381448 title="comment permalink">1/27/14, 9:03 PM</a><br><br>

I enjoyed this post but I would like to add something. As you point out in your book, before we get to the ecotechnic future we will have to go through a scavenging phase, and this will involve reusing and recycling what we can, and this phase interests me, as its likely to directly affect me and my children. <br><br> I am a classic car enthusiast, Volkswagens in the main. What I like about old cars, is what I dislike about new cars, and that is their simplicity. An old VW is made of simple components, that doesn’t involve computers and printed circuit boards. It can be repaired using simple tools, and minimal technical knowledge or skill. It also has the ability to be patched up using what is available. I think moving forward, ‘products’ that are like this will be far more resilient in a scavenging phase. More modern cars may be more fuel efficient, but need computers and trained technicians to tell you what’s wrong with them when their computer components fail, which they frequently do. They demonstrate all the failings of “excessive complexity”. Older more simple technology will fair better in my opinion, than the latest technology. I can picture old cars providing good service until they are 100 years old with regular maintenance, whereas modern cars will simply be discarded. Cuba probably is the best example of how simple technology can be repaired indefinitely, patching up using whatever is around, to keep something going by owners and friends with a minimal skill set and tools.<br><br>“Excessive complexity” seems to me to sum up all that is wrong with modern day technology. It means to me that it is less resilient. Anything that has mechanical components instead of computer controlled ones, and simple electronics seems more desirable to me. There are some exceptions. I think PV panels will work. But they don’t have any moving components to wear out so they are relatively simple and have a long life span. The inverter will be the weak point however. <br><br>So over the next 50 years or so we may witness more use of what are considered to be now ‘old’ technologies resurfacing, because they are capable of being maintained by the average joe, in a world where simplicity, and resilience is key. <br><br>Regards<br>K<br><br><br><a href=seven-sustainable-technologies.html#c7434575496372343516 title="comment permalink">2/14/14, 1:49 AM</a><br><br>
