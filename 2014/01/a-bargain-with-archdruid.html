My anomalous position as a writer and speaker on the future of industrial society who holds down a day job as an archdruid has its share of drawbacks, no question, but it also has significant advantages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of the most important of those is that I don’t have to worry about maintaining a reputation as a serious public figure. That may not sound like an advantage, but believe me, it is one.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Most of the other leading figures in the peak oil scene have at least some claim to respectability, and that pins them down in subtle and no-so-subtle ways. Like it or not, they have to know that being right about peak oil means that they might just pick up the phone one of these days and field an invitation to testify before a Senate subcommittee or a worried panel of long-range planners from the Pentagon. The possibility of being yanked out of their current role as social critics and being called on to tell a failing industrial society how it can save itself has got to hover in front of them in the night now and then. Such reflections tend to inspire a craving for consensus, or at least for neatly labeled positions within the accepted parameters of the peak oil scene. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I can only assume that’s what lies behind the tempest in an oil barrel that’s rocked the peak oil end of the blogosphere in recent weeks, following the publication of an essay by Permaculture guru David Holmgren titled <a href=http://holmgren.com.au/crash-demand/ >Crash on Demand</a>. Holmgren’s piece was quite a sensible one, suggesting that we’re past the point that a smooth transition to green tech is possible and that some kind of Plan B is therefore needed. It included some passages, though, suggesting that the best way to deal with the future immediately ahead might be to trigger a global financial crash.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>If just ten per cent of the world’s population stopped using fossil fuels, he noted, that might be enough to bring the whole system down all at once. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That proposal got a flurry of responses, but only a few—<a href=http://cluborlov.blogspot.com/2014/01/david-holmgrens-crash-on-demand.html>Dmitry Orlov’s</a>, predictably, was one of those few—noted the chasm that yawns between Holmgren’s modest proposal and the world we actually inhabit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s all very well to talk about ten per cent of the population withdrawing from the global economy, but the fact of the matter is that it’ll be a cold day in Beelzebub’s back yard before even ten per cent of self-proclaimed green activists actively embrace such a project ,to the extent of making more than the most modest changes in their own livestyles—and let’s not even talk about how likely it is that anybody at all outside the culturally isolated fringe scene that contains today’s green subcultures will even hear of Holmgren’s call to arms. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, David Holmgren is a very smart man, and I’m quite sure he’s well aware of all this. <a href=http://integralpermaculture.wordpress.com/2014/01/19/what-is-david-holmgren-really-telling-us/ >An essay by David MacLeod</a> pointed out that the steps Holmgren’s proposed to bring down industrial society are what he’s been encouraging people to do all along.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It occurs to me that he may simply have decided to try another way to get people to do what we all know we need to do anyway: give up the hopelessly unsustainable lifestyles currently provided us by the contemporary industrial system, downsize our desires as well as our carbon footprints, and somehow learn to get by on the kind of energy and resource basis that most other human beings throughout history have considered normal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse; as far as I can tell, Holmgren’s essay hasn’t inspired any sudden rush on the part of permaculturists and peak oil activists to ditch their Priuses in the hopes of sticking it to the Man. Instead, it veered off into debates about whether and how “we” (meaning, apparently, the writers and readers of peak oil blogs) could in fact crash the global economy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There was a flurry of talk about how violence shouldn’t be considered, and that in turn triggered a surge of people babbling earnestly about how we need not to rule out the use of violence against the system. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably necessary to say a few words about that here. Effective violence of any kind is a skill, a difficult and demanding one, and effective political violence against an established government is among the most difficult and demanding kinds. I’m sorry if this offends anybody’s sense of entitlement, but it’s not simply a matter of throwing a tantrum so loud that Daddy has to listen to you, you know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To force a government to do your bidding by means of violence, you have to be more competent at violence than the government is, and the notion that the middle-class intellectuals who do most of the talking in the peak oil scene can outdo the US government in the use of violence would be hilarious if the likely consequences of that delusion weren’t so ghastly. This is not a game for dabblers; people get thrown into prison for decades, dumped into unmarked graves, or vaporized by missiles launched from drones for trying to do what the people in these discussions were chattering about so blandly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, I have to wonder how many of the people who were so free with their online talk about violence against the system stopped to remember that every word of those conversations is now in an NSA data file, along with the names and identifying details of everybody involved. The radicals I knew in my younger days had a catchphrase that’s apposite here: “The only people that go around publicly advocating political violence are idiots and <i>agents provocateurs</i>. Which one are you?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, in that distant realm we call the real world, the hastily patched walls of peak oil denial are once again cracking under the strain of hard reality. The Royal Society—yes, <i>that</i> Royal Society—has just published a <a href=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/site/2014/2006.xhtml>volume of its Philosophical Transactions devoted to peak oil</a>; they take it seriously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Word has also slipped into the media that in December, a select group of American and British military, business, and political figures <a href=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/jan/17/peak-oil-oilandgascompanies>held a conference on peak oil</a>; they also take it seriously. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, air is leaking out of the fracking bubble as firms lose money, the foreign investors whose wallets have been the main target of the operation are backing away, and the cheerleading of the media is sounding more and more like the attempts to boost housing prices around the beginning of 2008. The latest data point? Longtime peak oil researcher Jean Laherrere, who (let us not forget) successfully predicted the 2005 peak in conventional oil production well in advance, used the same modeling techniques to <a href=http://peakoilbarrel.com/oil-peak-north-dakota-montana-2/ >predict future production from the Bakken Shale</a>. His call? A production peak in the fall of this year, with steep declines after that. He’s the latest to join the chorus of warnings that the fracking bubble is merely one more overblown financial scam moving inexorably toward a massive bust. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of course we’ve been here before. Every few years, the mass media starts to talk about peak oil, proponents of business as usual look nervous, and those in the peak oil scene who are inexperienced enough not to remember the last few cycles of the same process start talking about the prospects of imminent victory. (Yes, I made that mistake a while back; I think we all have.) Then the walls of denial get patched up again, the mass media scurries back to some comforting fairy tale about ethanol, wind power, biodiesel, fracking or what have you; the proponents of business as usual go back to their normal blustering, and peak oil activists who got overenthusiastic about predictions of imminent triumph end up with egg on their faces. That’s standard for any social movement trying to bring about an unwelcome but necessary change in society. Each time around the cycle, more people get the message, and a movement smart enough to capitalize on the waves of media interest can grow until it starts having a significant influence on society as a whole. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That final step can arrive on various time scales; a successful movement for change can see its viewpoint filter gradually into the collective conversation, or there can be a sudden break, after which the movement can still be denounced but can no longer be ignored. Glance back through the last few centuries and it’s easy to find examples of either kind, not to mention every point between those two ends of the spectrum. I’m far from sure if there’s a way to tell how peak oil activism will play out, but my hunch is that it may be closer to the sudden-break end of the spectrum than otherwise. What lies behind that hunch isn’t anything so sturdy as a headline or a new study; rather, it’s something subtle—a shift in tone in the denunciations that <i>The Archdruid Report</i> fields each week. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I don’t know if other bloggers share this experience, but I’ve found that internet trolls are a remarkably subtle gauge of the mass imagination. There are some trolls who only show up when a post of mine is about to go viral, and others whose tirades reliably forecast the new themes of peak oil denial three or four months in advance. When some bit of high-tech vaporware is about to be ballyhooed as the miracle that’s going to save us all, or some apocalyptic fantasy is about to become the new reason why it’s okay to keep your middle class lifestyle since we’re all going to die soon anyway, I usually hear about it first from trolls who can’t wait to let me know just how wrong I am. It’s an interesting fringe benefit of a blogger’s job, and it’s alerted me more than once to trends worth watching. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It so happens that in recent weeks, some of the criticisms I’ve fielded have struck a distinctly new note. I still get the classic cornucopians who insist I’m babbling pessimistic nonsense and of course we’ll all be just fine, just as I still get the apocalypse fanboys who insist that I’m ignoring the fact that the doom du jour is sure to annihilate us all, but I’m now seeing a third position—that of course it’s a crisis and we can’t just go on the way we’ve been living, a lot of things will have to change, but if we do X and Y and Z, we can keep some of the benefits of industrial society going, and I’m being too pessimistic when I suggest that no, we can’t. Maybe everyone else in the peak oil scene has been getting these all along, but they’re new to my comments page, and they have a tone that sets them apart from the others. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To be precise, it sounds like bargaining. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I don’t imagine that anyone in the peak oil scene has missed the discussions of Elisabeth K<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>ü</span>bler-Ross’ five stages of coming to terms with impending death—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance—and their application to the not dissimilar experience of facing up to the death of the industrial age. Many of us can look back on our own transits through the five stages, and I’ve long since lost track of the times I’ve heard people at a peak oil event roll their eyes and mutter the name of one of the stages to whomever is sitting next to them. For the most part, though, it’s been a matter of individuals going through their own confrontations with the death of progress at their own pace. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Maybe this is still what’s happening, but I wonder. For a very long time, even among peak oil activists, the prevailing mood was still one of denial—we can solve this, whether the solution consists of solar panels, thorium reactors, revitalized communities, permacultured forest gardens, supposedly imminent great turnings of one sort or another, or what have you. After the 2008-2009 crash, that shifted to a mood of anger, and furious denunciations of “the 1%” and an assortment of more familiar supervillains became much more common on peak oil forums than they had been. The rise of apocalypse fandom has arguably been driven by this same stage of anger—suicidal fantasies very often get their force from unresolved rage turned inwards, after all, and it’s likely that the habit of projecting daydreams of mass extermination onto the future is rooted in the same murky emotional soil.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If that’s indeed what’s been happening, then bargaining is the next stage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If so, this is good news, because unlike the two stages before it or the one that follows, the stage of bargaining can have practical benefits. If a dying person hits that stage and decides to give up habits that make her condition worse, for example, the result may be an improved quality of life during her final months; if the bargain includes making big donations to charity, the patient may not benefit much from it but the charity and the people it helps certainly will. People under the stress of impending death try to strike bargains that range all the way from the inspiring to the absurd, though, and whether something constructive comes out of it depends on whether the bargain involves choices that will actually do some good. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If this stage is like the ones the peak oil scene seems to have transited so far, we can expect to see a flurry of earnest blog posts and comments over the next few years seeking reassurance in a manner peculiar to the internet—that is, by proclaiming something as absolute fact, then looking around nervously to see if anyone else agrees. This time, instead of proclaiming that this or that or the other is sure to save us, or out to get us, or certain to kill us all, they’ll be insisting that this or that or the other will be an acceptable sacrifice to the gods of petroleum depletion and climate change, sufficient to persuade those otherwise implacable powers to leave us untouched. The writers will be looking for applause and approval, and if that I think their offering might do some good, I’m willing to meet them halfway. In fact, I’ll even suggest things that I’m sure to applaud, so they don’t even have to guess.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
First is <b>conservation</b>. That’s the missing piece in most proposals for dealing with peak oil. The chasm into which so many well-intentioned projects have tumbled over the last decade is that nothing available to us can support the raw extravagance of energy and resource consumption we’re used to, once cheap abundant fossil fuels aren’t there any more, so—ahem—<i>we have to use less</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Too much talk about using less in recent years, though, has been limited to urging energy and resource abstinence as a badge of moral purity, and—well, let’s just say that abstinence education did about as much good there as it does in any other context. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The things that played the largest role in hammering down US energy consumption in the 1970s energy crisis were unromantic but effective techniques such as insulation, weatherstripping, and the like, all of which allow a smaller amount of energy to do the work previously done by more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Similar initiatives were tried out in business and industry, with good results; expanding public transit and passenger rail did the same thing in a different context, and so on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All of these are essential parts of any serious response to the end of cheap energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>If your proposed bargain makes conservation the core of your response to fossil fuel and resource depletion, in other words, you’ll face no criticism from me. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Second is <b>decentralization</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of the things that makes potential failures in today’s large-scale industrial infrastructures so threatening is that so many people are dependent on single systems. Too many recent green-energy projects have tried to head further down the same dangerous slope, making whole continents dependent on a handful of pipelines, power grids, or what have you. In an age of declining energy and resource availability, coupled with a rising tide of crises, the way to ensure resilience and stability is to decentralize intead: to make each locality able to meet as many of its own needs as possible, so that troubles in one area don’t automatically propagate to others, and an area that suffers a systems failure can receive help from nearby places where everything still works. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here again, this involves proven techniques, and extends across a very broad range of human needs. Policies that encourage local victory gardens, truck farms, and other food production became standard practice in the great wars of the 20th century precisely because they took some of the strain off<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>overburdened economies and food-distribution systems. Home production of goods and services for home use has long played a similar role. For that matter, transferring electrical power and other utilities and the less urgent functions of government to regional and local bodies instead of doing them on the national level will have parallel benefits in an age of retrenchment and crisis. Put decentralization into your bargain, and I’ll applaud enthusiastically.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Third is <b>rehumanization</b>. That’s an unfamiliar word for a concept that will soon be central to meaningful economic policy throughout the developed world. Industrial societies are currently beset with two massive problems:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>high energy costs, on the one hand, and high unemployment on the other. Both problems can be solved at a single stroke by replacing energy-hungry machines with human workers. Rehumanizing the economy—hiring people to do jobs rather than installing machines to do them—requires removing and reversing a galaxy of perverse incentives favoring automation at the expense of employment, and this will need to be done while maintaining wages and benefits at levels that won’t push additional costs onto government or the community. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The benefits here aren’t limited to mere energy cost savings. Every economic activity that can be done by human beings rather than machinery is freed from the constant risk of being whipsawed by energy prices, held hostage by resource nationalism, and battered in dozens of other ways by the consequences of energy and resource depletion. That applies to paid employment, but it also applies to the production of goods and services in the household economy, which has also been curtailed by perverse incentives, and needs to be revived and supported by sensible new policies. A rehumanized economy is a resilient economy for another reason, too:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the most effective way to maximize economic stability is to provide ample employment at adequate wages for the workforce, whose paychecks fund the purchases that keep the economy going. Make rehumanization an important part of your plan to save the world and I won’t be the only one cheering. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those are my proposals, then: conservation, decentralization, rehumanization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those readers who are looking for applause for their efforts at collective bargaining with the forces driving industrial society toward its destiny now know how to get it here. I’d like to ask you to step out of the room for the next paragraph, though, as I have a few things to say to those who aren’t at the bargaining stage just now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
(Are they gone?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now listen closely while I whisper:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>none of the things I’ve just suggested will save industrial civilization.</i> You know that, of course, and so do I.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That said, any steps in the direction of conservation, decentralization, and rehumanization that get taken will make the descent less disruptive and increase the chances that communities, localities, and whole regions may be able to escape the worst impacts of the industrial system’s unraveling. That’s worth doing, and if it takes their panicked efforts to bargain with an implacable fate to get those things under way, I’m good with that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Got it? Okay, we can call them back into the room.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style='font-family: Times; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode"; mso-fareast-language: #00FF; mso-font-kerning: .5pt'>Ahem. So there you have it; if you want to bargain with the archdruid, those are the terms I’ll accept. For whatever it’s worth, those are also the policies I’d propose to a Senate subcommittee or a worried panel of long-range planners from the Pentagon if I were asked to testify to some such body,. Of course that’s not going to happen; archdruids can draw up proposals on the basis of what might actually work, instead of worrying about the current consensus in or out of the peak oil scene, because nobody considers archdruids to be serious public figures. That may not sound like an advantage, but believe me, it is one. </span></div>

I could not believe my eyes. Apparently the reasoning of the response went along the lines of, David's wrong because we’re going to have a fast crash, so it doesn't matter anyway.<br><br>A poorer civilisation (either resources or energy) didn't even cross the authors mind, unless of course it was used to prop up the argument proposing a fast collapse scenario.<br><br>Anyway, a deep breath later and I too came to the conclusion that the response was just words and it was the real world responses that were of importance.<br><br>I understand that once a civilisation has exceeded its resource base and carrying capacity, then without new inputs, it must conserve to maintain business as usual or it will contract. The concept isn't rocket science, but few are willing to accept a hands on response to the situation. Whilst still other people believe that people and the authorities will sit on their behinds and do nothing in the face of any sort of crisis.<br><br>Anyway, ranting aside, this week coming up promises not a single day below 30 degrees Celsius. Did I mention that winter was 2 degrees Celsius above the long term average, but here's the kicker: Summer has been just below 3 degrees Celsius above the long term average.

It can't simply be reformed; it must be scrapped.<br><br>I also point out that voluntary scrapping is out of the question. The Earth Liberation Front isn't going to lead a revolution; they're basically glorified vandals for a cause. As described in the Oscar nominated documentary "If a Tree Falls," they were also the subjects of the largest domestic terrorism investigation U.S. history and many if not most of them are now in prison.<br><br>Consequently, there are two ways to get a new system, build an alternative system and hope that people abandon the old one for the new one on their own, or wait (patiently) for the old system to collapse of its own weight. Some of the organic food people have been trying the former, in particular Joel Salatin. Even he recognizes how difficult that is, as one of his books proclaims "Everything I Want to do is Illegal." The latter seems to be the position of people like you, Kunstler, and Ran Prieur. Unfortunately, the key word is patiently, and Kunstler comes off sometimes like the hungry vulture saying "Patience my foot!" while Prieur has given up on the system falling apart during his lifetime. You, at least, have maintained some perspective about the process.<br><br>Also, you're doing both. Not only are you waiting for collapse, you are advocating building the alternative system so that when people can no longer depend on the current way of doing things they have someplace to go. Other than the early adopters, they certainly won't do it without a major breaking of their change resistance, such as price signals and underemployment.<br><br>Finally, even the environmental economists, who agree with you and others that sustainability, resource depletion, and pollution are central problems but think that the system is reformable, can get behind your criteria for a bargain. Conservation has been recognized as the number one way to prolong a resource and is much more effective than increasing supply. Decentralization has also been getting attention for the past few decades, but requires more effort and has more resistance from entrenched interests. Finally, rehumanization is one that runs against the cult of progress. That's the one that Salatin and the rest of the alternative food production people have been butting their heads against for decades. It's the most difficult and will continue to be long after the cult of progress has become a cargo cult.<br><br><a href=#c5387571283044496612 title="comment permalink">1/29/14, 8:57 PM</a><br><br>

The book mzde me realise that you can do this quite easily and non-violently in four simple steps: 1. go to Brazil, 2. collect as many SALB spores as you can, 3. go to South-East Asia, and 4. infect as many rubber plantations as you can.<br>Takes some planning, but it's feasible within a month or two. A few years later, industrial society will have a very serious problem and acute problem.<br><br>As if it needed more of those...<br><br>This idea has made my mind more quiet in two ways: I now feel that if I should ever become convinced that a fast crash would be a good idea, I could just go out and try to create one (well not anymore now, talked about it on teh webz - duh!). Plus, if people start boring me by arguing in that direction, I have now thought of a way to say 'Well quit yabbering and go have your crash, if you must'.<br><br>I sort of imagine it would be interesting to see people suddenly switching their position and start arguing against (this particular way of) bringing down the System.<br><br><a href=#c5636563312353069415 title="comment permalink">1/29/14, 9:06 PM</a><br><br>

The things that leap to mind as I read the opening of this essay. <br><br>There's no Schadenfreude to be had in a global financial crash, no matter how tempting it might be to think so. It's all Schaden without the Freude. The actions that will be taken in response to it will be designed to salvage what is left for the powerful, leaving the rest of us even more destitute. It encourages panic, not well-thought out change. Besides, why try to trigger it by some scheme that has no chance of succeeding? It'll happen on its own. It always does. <br><br>So then it's on to old-fashioned anarchy,is it? Throwing bombs and monkey wrenches into the system? Again, why bother? It'll come down regardless in its own manner and time. But there's a more fundamental thing here. Violent uprising will happen when "the system" reaches a point that enough people are in bad enough circumstances that they feel it is literally worth dying in the effort to fight against it. And I mean dying horribly, mangled, bloodied, burning, in agony. And worth inflicting that same thing on others, who are no more "guilty" than you are yourself. Until that seems to large numbers of people like a reasonable risk, forget about your armed uprisings. <br><br>And then when we reach this point...? Well, thanks to Bareorge Obusha's long war we have raised a generation of young men who have experience with guerilla combat, making do with resources on hand, and homemade explosives. By and large these young men are not active in peak oil and other "green" circles. Their interests lie elsewhere. So who might they decide to label as "enemy" and who as "friend?" Not really clear at this point. And not being idiots, they are not gonna tell us in advance. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c6731094456270178908 title="comment permalink">1/29/14, 9:17 PM</a><br><br>

I have to wonder, if we are really in such an energy boom, why did one cold spell suddenly give us a major propane shortage? And an aside about this "Polar Vortex" nonsense. The news media have somehow sold us on the idea that we were the victims of something exceptional and unprecedented, "The Polar Vortex," I guess to make us feel better about our inability to cope with it. Well to this, I say, "pllllllllt." The "polar vortex" is a quasi-permanent feature of the Earth's atmosphere -- actually two of them, one at each pole. Same for every other planet that has an atmosphere. What we experienced was a "sudden stratospheric warming" event, a.k.a. an SSW. This happens when the polar vortex *weakens*, breaks up into a jumble of smaller vortices, and lets the cold air it previously had neatly corralled in the polar region spil out into the lower latitudes. So we did not experience a "polar vortex," we actually experienced a breakdown of the polar vortex. AND, it is in no way anything unusual. A SSW happens in the northern hemisphere in slightly more than half of our winters. Got that? Every other year, even a bit more. And the severity of this particular cold outbreak overall has been on the order of a 3-10 year recurrence interval. It's not remotely on par with the Great Freeze of 1985, when real (not made-up "wind-chill") temperatures went below minus 20F at stations as far south as Tennessee and Kentucky.<br><br>Sorry about the meteorological rant, but it has a purpose. I have to think that we need to convince ourselves that this was something exceptional, because we were barely able to deal with it. It's not possible that it was a run-of-the-mill climate deviation yet it stressed our power grid and fuel supplies perilously close to the breaking point. Because that would suggest that we are weak and vulnerable. Which we can't be.<br><br>So the "return" of peak oil after the Bakken goes bust... that is just scary no matter how inevitable it is or wherever you stand ideologically. It hits you in your wallet, sure, and in your stomach, your access to health care, your livelihood. It hasn't been fun, and it's not gonna get fun.

Here's how the Royal Society <a href=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/372/2006/20130179.full rel=nofollow>puts it</a>:<br><br><i>Based upon current evidence [...], we estimate that around 11–15 mb per day of non-conventional liquids production could be achieved in the next 20 years at costs similar to or higher than today’s ‘marginal barrel’ at approximately $90–120 per barrel (figure 16). This would justify the IEA projection (figure 15), but only if crude oil production remains on a plateau over that period and NGL production expands as anticipated. If crude oil production falls, then total liquids production seems likely to fall as well, leading to significant price increases and potentially serious impacts on the global economy.<br><br>In combination, the papers provide a sobering picture of the challenges ahead. Most authors accept that conventional oil resources are at an advanced stage of depletion and that liquid fuels will become more expensive and increasingly scarce. The tight oil ‘revolution’ has provided some short-term relief, but seems unlikely to make a significant difference in the longer term. Even with a more sanguine view of global supply prospects, the large scale, capital intensity, long lead times and constrained potential of the various mitigation options point to the need for a coordinated response.</i><br><br>So, we have a long and leisurely walk down Hubbert's Peak ahead of us, with a decade (give or take) until the enormity of how many resources we have depleted becomes apparent.

The advantages gained through rehumanization, though, aren't limited to resilience; it's also a matter of shifting from concentrated nonrenewable energy sources to more diffuse and more renewable ones, since human beings are fueled by the latter rather than by the former. <a href=../../2010/04/twilight-of-machine.html rel=nofollow>This blast from the past</a> might help put that into perspective a bit. <br><br>Babylon, glad to hear it. If you run into a press gang, you might take this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBdywzKD2Jw" rel=nofollow>piece of traditional Irish advice</a>. <br><br>Grebulocities, okay, I'm impressed. If <i>Forbes</i> is starting to let honest talk about fracking into print, we're getting very close to crunch time.<br><br>Richard, the price of land will go down when people stop trying to use it as a store of abstract value -- which is to say, when enough of the current accumulation of imaginary wealth evaporates that the value of land consists of what can be done with it, rather than how much one can (theoretically) get from selling it. That's going to have to wait a bit yet -- though not indefinitely. <br><br>Cherokee, good heavens, don't waste good lemon cider on the keyboard! I strongly encourage drinking something of lower quality when reading the kind of nonsense you mention. ;-)<br><br>Flagg, that's an interesting question. I suspect a lot of people in the serious-figure end of the peak scene prefer to avoid being associated with him; for my part, I'm not so burdened, since archdruids are taken no more seriously than astrologers. <br><br>Ken, thank you. <br><br>Raymond, an excellent point. <br><br>Luke, I don't think they're hired flacks, no -- my guess is that trollomancy works because trolls don't think, they just spout whatever stirs their emotions, and so reflect the rock-bottom lowest common denominator of collective consciousness. <br><br>Bill, it's a brand new coinage. I've been fishing for a term for the deautomation revolution that'll be shaping the next century or so of economics, and finally found one I prefer. <br><br>Hector, understood, but the paradigm I'm using has a couple of crucial dimensions that yours lacks. On the one hand, we can't stop the industrial age from ending, any more than a terminally ill patient can stop dying; it's of vital importance, it seems to me, to acknowledge the limits of our ability to change what's happening, and avoid the kind of fantasies of entitlement that lead so many people these days to insist that we can just imagine whatever future we want, and then get it. <br><br>The other dimension is in some ways subtler. The corrosive sort of pseudo-positive thinking tha Barbara Ehrenreich dissected in her recent book <i>Bright-sided</i> likes to insist that grief, like other difficult emotions, is a bad thing that (at most) should be put to some therapeutic purpose and then replaced with smiley-face feelings. Even in the best of times, that's shallow, and when things are genuinely painful and hard, it can be hugely damaging. It's crucial, it seems to me, to allow ourselves to grieve over what is being lost, and what is going to be lost, in the very harsh future ahead of us. It's not enough to mentally decide what to do and then do it; rather, it's by facing the grief, the bitterness, and the terror, accepting them as necessary parts of life, and going on, that we can gain the courage and other nonrational strengths we're going to need to tackle this mess.<br><br><a href=#c2132408392021446474 title="comment permalink">1/29/14, 10:16 PM</a><br><br>

The backpedaling is a sight to behold. <br><br>Bill, good. The claim that "we" can cause a vast financial crash is simply a way of redirecting the entire issue into the same sort of daydream territory that balding middle-aged men inhabit when they imagine themselves with rock-star charisma and an 18-year-old poptart clinging to each arm.

I have also found a more spiritual calling to Buddhism thanks to you and your writings! I have turned a career towards Biochemistry( diminishing marginal returns) to a more grounded focus in Forestry with the natural flows of sunlight. I want to thank you for a wonderful past year and half of eye opening and life changing experiences reading your blog. I feel as if I have developed "The Eye of the Archdruid." Which as with all powerful things, both a curse and a blessing.<br> In my time and experience I feel I have developed a complementary picture of continuing deindustrial future. There are two issues which I feel are of great importance, that are only occasionally touched upon in this blog (and perhaps for good reason?). <br><br><b>Violence, Competition and the Spectre of Forceful coercion.</b> <br><br> Of course you acknowledge the most explicitly violent of the four riders. However, I would like to better understand how local vacuums of power contributed to personal and group level security and freedom? How do the warlords of a broken country rise to power? A good wizard had to have a good understanding of battlefield tactics in medieval times so it follows, shouldn't a modern green wizard not also have an understanding of risk, self defense and weapons knowledge? If Argentina or other countries, farther down the per capita energy curve, can tell us anything it is that robberies, kidnappings, extortion and many other crimes may become quite common.<br><br><b> The massive problem of systemic health issues</b><br><br>Soon after the peak of classic lowland Maya civilization the populace became afflicted with a variety of health conditions. One of them being Porotic-Hyperstosis from Anemia. Long before the fields of maize withered and died due to a combination of depleted soils and drought, the Mayan diet shifted from diverse to very narrow as agriculture intensified from swidden methods to more intensive raised beds. This led to only a few poor nutrient content crops available to the Mayan people.<br> The obvious parallel is the epidemic of diabetes, heart disease and cancer in America, perpetuated by an increasingly fragile diet of intensely processed carbohydrates loaded with added sugar and preservatives. More and more poor Americans are turning to cheap soy, corn and wheat products mixed with vegetable oil and sugar for their daily nutrition. The stealth inflation in the declining quality of food has riddled modern Americans with too many once rare conditions to count. Depression and mental health issues, autoimmune diseases and other multi-factored diet related illnesses will make it much more difficult for many people to live a retro lifestyle that requires a fair amount of hard mental and physical work in harsh and unforgiving elements. A rising tide of plain batshit crazy people are being held back by a crumbling system of prescription anti-depressants, painkillers and other psychotropics.<br> If the future is here but is simply not evenly distributed, does it look like the worst parts of inner cities and small towns?

I have long regard you, Richard Heinberg, and Nicole Foss as the three best commentators overall in the Peak Oil pantheon. However, I must say that I have been disappointed to see Richard gingerly step away from some of the more radical and controversial opinions he gave in his early "Party's Over." <br><br>The single most noteworthy example of this is his quietly backing away from musings in that book about who he thought was really responsible for 9/11. But I think the shift I am referring to in his recent writings is both deeper, more subtle, and more pervasive. And it's disheartening to see him no longer fully speak his mind.<br><br>As for Nicole, I don't know whether she has any aspirations to conventional respectability; but I do think we are FINALLY in the very early stages of the catastrophic world financial/debt-bubble collapse that she, following the Pythagorean math-based wave theorists at elliotwave.com, Robert Prechter's outfit, has been predicting as imminent for some years now. <br><br>The timing problem, as I see it, is principally due to Prechter's dogmatic allegiance to the idea that stock market movements COMPLETELY lack exogenous moving causes. In a recent issue of ELLIOT WAVE THEORIST (November, I believe), he both affirmed this dogma once more, while complaining about its contradictory opposite in practically the next paragraph - to wit, that the Fed's quantitative easing has completely distorted market movements. <br><br>But what is he complaining about here other than QE as an exogenous market mover? If he were only to let go of his dogma and to integrate the reality of some measure of exogenous causality into the Elliot Wave picture, then I think the Elliot Wave types would enjoy their not infrequently remarkably accurate financial predictions far more often than they do now. <br><br>(This applies to Peak Oil too, by the way: Prechter scoffs at it, and thus also dismisses it, by way of corollary, as a potential exogenous cause impacting market movements.)<br><br><a href=#c8472305897502030105 title="comment permalink">1/30/14, 4:55 AM</a><br><br>

Mostly because that guardian article isn't the only one I've seen about high-level government meetings on this topic. <br><br>My project is a digital newspaper called View on the Ground. <br>View On The Ground - An open source intelligence co-operative of researchers and writers. We track global patterns concerning political, economic, environmental, and social instability and how they affect you locally. Our purpose is to inform, educate, and train those of you who want to become more engaged and effective citizens in your community.<br>(http://viewontheground.com/) <br><br>If you go to that link it'll be pretty obvious that they website isn't ready, but we've starting putting material up. Read the "about us" section to get a better idea of what we're doing!<br><br>Anyway, I hope that this project will be helpful to all of you. I'll keep chipping away at it.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Varun<br><br><a href=#c4653997945051541376 title="comment permalink">1/30/14, 7:25 AM</a><br><br>

It’s behind a paywall, but here it is if anyone here has a subscription to the Wall Street Journal and missed it. If you don’t have a subscription, you may want to go to your local library and see if they have a copy or access to an online database like ProQuest. It’s well worth taking the time to read.<br><br>http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303277704579348332283819314?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303277704579348332283819314.html<br><br>In fact, in today’s WSJ, there is a report that Exxon Mobil’s profits and stock prices have been declining due to their inability to maintain production levels even with heroic efforts to replace existing reserves. I am reminded of that GE ad that someone shared last in the discussion thread for last week’s essay. They commented that it seemed to them that the ad was a subtle attempt to prepare the masses for the reality of Peak Oil. I suspect that articles like the one I just cited represent a similar effort aimed at the business community and the corporate elites. The harsh truth is that no amount of wishful thinking, fracking, deep sea drilling, strip mining in Alberta or alt.energy (to borrow a term from Kunstler) is going to replace the now-ending cheap energy bubble, while “drill, baby, drill” is just another lullaby that serves no useful purpose except to lull the herd to sleep. The fact that the corporate mass media and news agencies like the Wall Street Journal are starting to let the cat out of the bag is telling, even if they aren’t yet willing to use the dreaded P.O. word.<br><br><a href=#c1918851226427864427 title="comment permalink">1/30/14, 8:33 AM</a><br><br>

Doctrine is just a narrative though, should not get in the way of action.<br><br>The thing I love about your coinage above all others is that it throws into sharp relief the relationship between the individual and "the economy."<br><br>"The economy" is nothing more or less than the exchange of social and material capital, and this is a fractal definition such that no matter what context we delineate, global, local, national, household, political, etc., the fundamental nature remains the same.<br><br>So what is it to rehumanize the economy? It is to move more of one's interactions in the exchange of material and social capital from machine to human. <br><br>The environmental movement has lost on two fronts.<br>One is the delegation/deferral of personal responsibility to the abstract realm of entities and systems such that one's input into the system is the support one gives to a political party, and it is to that political entity the responsibility falls to change the system according to the individual's wishes. The problem with this is that political action is but a minor and relatively insignificant percentage of one's actual activity in the economy, even for the most dedicated. <br><br>When politics fail, the individual is left without hope and feels powerless. The problem is not with politics, it is with the mindset that conceives of democracy/politics into a value rather than see it as a finely tuned instrument or tool with specific and appropriate applications. The environmental movement defines and describes problems away from the individual, its principles have little application to personal context.<br><br>Rehumanize cuts right to the heart of the matter. So what is it to rehumanize the economy? Go through a checkout line rather than a self-checkout terminal. Read a book rather than a web page. Call a friend out of the blue and chat rather than go online. Bike rather than drive. Walk rather than bike. Talk rather than email. Where you have the choice, no matter what your context, push for interaction with humans rather than machines. <br>Grow your own lettuce rather than let the machines grow and harvest it for you.<br><br>All those actions one takes in the day amounts to their role in the economy, the idea of improving the ratio of human:machine interaction at any point is a direct, applicable action everyone can take to rehumanize their personal economy.<br> <br>At an individual level, we all have the power to rehumanize our personal economy.<br><br>Good work, JMG!<br><br><br><br><a href=#c4515215181746619648 title="comment permalink">1/30/14, 8:55 AM</a><br><br>

I find it reassuring when I'm already following your suggestions.<br><br>Speaking of which, since the start of this new year, I've moved out of my very fancy suburb to a communal house out on the edge of town. It's the type of neighborhood that when I tell my coworkers where I live now, they look at me like I've suggested vacationing in Syria. We heat only with wood, grow our own food and poultry on the half acre the house sits on, and even compost our poop. It's been quite the change. With no TV, I find I spend much more time reading. I play music rather than listening to it (I've taken up the fiddle after 40). With another year, I hope to transition from my tech job to the much less lucrative, and much more enjoyable blacksmithing trade I now spend my weekends building. I now bike the 9 miles to work rather than drive. And while I'd admit I'm fresh to this new lifestyle, I have to say I've never been happier. It's easy to say that, but the emotion behind it are hard to convey over this medium. I don't think I would have got here voluntarily without you. Without your writing, and your blog. Thank you. I realize what I'm doing isn't going to really change anything of the future we face.

Would you tax automation and give tax breaks to those who employ humans rather than machines? <br><br>I also think that one reason for the ever-increasing automation is that as a culture, we (and I mean the industrial world as a whole) worship technology as if it were some sort of deity. A small data point. I recently read that Australia has declared war on sharks. (Or rather: it has decided to escalate its war against them.) From now on, they plan to preventatively kill any shark that comes close to a beach (within one kilometer, if I recall correctly). The reason for this is that in the past two years, 7 people have been killed in shark attacks. For comparison, I offer the fact that for the past few decades, over one thousand people have died in car attacks (I mean, traffic accidents) in Australia each year. But for some reason, no country in the world has passed laws allowing any car that comes within a mile of a human settlement to have its tires gunned down, and something tells me that no such laws will be passed any time soon. I'm saying that we, industrialized humans, are willing to sacrifice thousands of our fellow human beings to our machines each year, but sacrificing even just a handful of us to large predators is seen as completely unacceptable. <br><br>Please don't get me wrong, I have no desire whatsoever to be eaten by shark. At the same time, I quite frankly don't see why being killed in a car crash is any better than being killed by a shark. Furthermore, people who are not willing to take even the slightest risk of being killed by a shark need only refrain from swimming in the ocean, whereas if you wanted to eliminate all risk of being killed by a car, you would pretty much be required never to leaving the house. Now, I'm sure that proponents of the war on sharks would say that cars are far more important to human well being than sharks are. But then, that pretty much proves my point, doesn't it? <br><br>To go back to the topic of this week's post: if you want to rehumanize, you're not just up against "objective" cost-saving interests, you're also up against a mythology that worships machines. You might as well tell devout Hindus to eat their cows.<br><br><a href=#c5345195958347505443 title="comment permalink">1/30/14, 11:24 AM</a><br><br>

I personally think there are more people somewhat aware of the energy situation than Orlov cites (believe it or not, folks, not everyone follows blogs) but the odds are that most of them are at least somewhat already pulled out of the most damaging parts of the economy. Greatly lessens their impact.<br><br>OK, I guess I'm rambling, too.

Thanks for the clear headed analysis, and realistic assessment of the sustainability/unsustainability situation. Two notes, unrelated to each other but related, possibly, to the post.<br>1. I read Brian Czech's bit on how "climate change is the wrong issue for environmental activists", and would agree that "Economic Growth" is a more substantial and useful topic to be active about. I see peak resources and climate change as two sides of one monster (growth). Further it seems the rehumanizing, decentralization, conservation steps would apply well to climate issues as well as peak oil issues. Question: Do you see any parallels in the general awareness of the climate scene to what you describe in this post as a possible shift toward bargaining? If these issues are moving along a cultural trajectory, is there any likelihood that worship of the great god Growth might be widely targeted to usher in a more comprehensive and integrated strategy to make the future less miserable?<br>2. Something you may enjoy checking out - siriusdisclosure - I think its a dot org. even more interesting the movie sirius (there seem to be a number of two hour sections on youtube, I have only watched a couple hours). The aspect of this documentation (its a bunch of "credible" witness testimony to UFO sightings/crashes - all military/scientist/engineer types) that I think you will find interesting is specifically this line of reasoning a. interstellar travel is occuring b. The technology to do this is based on physics beyond our current comprehension but involves something that Stephen Greer (I assume not a relative of yours) who is the honcho in charge of the website and movie calls "free energy" (basically claiming there is a way to tap the "energy of the vacuum") c. "they" (whoever the conspirators are) have managed to get their hands on this technology. d. "They" are hiding it from society because "they" are benefiting from our current fossil fuel use e. if this techonology could be generally accessed our problems of sustainability would be essentially solved.<br>As "credible" as the witnesses seem, and even having myself witnessed something that was sure UFO like at one point when I was younger, I would say I am agnostic on the reality value of the content of this site and movie. What is more interesting to me (though I will guess I could be wildly off base) is that this is excellent evidence of a real conspiracy regarding energy: On the one hand, if these witnesses are who they say they are, and are being fully truthful, the allegations about "free energy" might really be accurate. On the other hand if the witnesses themselves are somehow a hoax (which I wouldn't put out of the realm of possibility), then there is the question of who and why any person or organization would want to perpetrate a hoax that claims "free energy" exists. <br>I can't really wrap my head around it, but really think you might enjoy poking into the subject given your interest in peak oil and the belief systems surrounding it, not to mention science fiction. <br><br><br><a href=#c3998107285528031025 title="comment permalink">1/30/14, 12:07 PM</a><br><br>

Fortunately, I have those posts already scheduled. Stay tuned!<br><br>Joy, that's a reasonable strategy. <br><br>Philip, nah, that comes further along the process. First you introduce the appealing label; then you wait until the other side drags out the pejorative label, give them a little while to give it some currency, and hijack it. From then on you play a good cop-bad cop routine in which the people making moderate proposals use the appealing label, and those making extreme proposals use the pejorative -- except when you flip it around to mess with the other side's heads -- and you get the opposition so flummoxed about fighting those awful Luddites that they're willing to compromise, over and over again, with the advocates of rehumanization. Didn't your momma teach you <i>nuthin'</i> about metapolitical strategy? <br><br>Das Monde, it never fails to fascinate me that so many people on the blogosphere insist on blaming "globalization elites" (or whatever other scapegoats they prefer) for the normal working out of the early stages of decline and fall.

And I'm not even a christian! Suppose you heat your house with wood, and decide you want to rehumanize your firewood production by coppicing it using hand tools (rather than gasoline-powered chain saws). Unless you have already designed or modified your house so that it makes maximum use out of every precious BTU, you will find your project a dismal failure. Fossil-fuel based firewood is very cheap, dollarwise, per BTU. In fact it is the cheapest source of energy for home heating in these parts. So you can just chuck another log in the stove whenever you like. Not so with homegrown hand-harvested. Each log is precious, and if you aren't set up to get the most benefit out of every one, you are doomed. But... if your household does not eventually convert over so that it can function without fossil-fuel-harvested firewood, in the long run it is even more doomed.<br><br><a href=#c846694858474542514 title="comment permalink">1/30/14, 2:13 PM</a><br><br>

The total number of people in the green end of things who will actually cash out their savings, pay off their debts, and stop buying products from big retail chains, as opposed to talking earnestly about these things, is small enough that any big round of layoffs has more impact -- and you'll notice that none of those have brought the system down.

As for a profession, the thing to keep in mind is this: nobody is going to prosper during these times as someone else's employee. The notion of being hired by somebody for a job is <i>so</i> twentieth century! You need to find out what good or service you can provide, or learn to provide, that the people in your community and area value highly enough that they'll pay for it even in hard times. No, I don't have any more exact prescription than that, because it depends on your talents and the needs and wants of the locals. <br><br>Karl, funny.

But when I'm focused on the bargaining stage, this is how I'm thinking - and I know it's far more silly than rational, but here it is:<br><br>Could we just "go back" a hundred years to the beginning of the 20th century, when fossil fuel energy use was far less per capita than today? My grandparents were children then and they seemed to have survived pretty well.... Ah, but fossil fuels then were much cheaper than today and there were far fewer people. And besides, fossil fuel extraction and distribution is totally different today and won't be able to scale down to a fraction of today's consumption. Oh yea: burning fossil fuels has become quite dangerous to the planet's climate.<br><br>OK, well what about 150 years ago, before crude oil was even used? Maybe, but there were far fewer people then - maybe 30 million in the US. And a substantial majority worked as farmers or in endeavors supporting farming. No modern sanitation - drink from the river, well or lake and hope for the best. Pee outside or in the chamber pot and use an outhouse. Can I have toilet paper? My bargain - Ok, if Abe Lincoln could live that way, maybe I could too (or my kids - I'm old now). And can I have a modern recycling toilet like a Clivus Multrum? No? Just asking...<br><br>So I convince myself - lacking much proof or even logic - that assuming the earth experiences a Malthusian human population die off and we end with maybe 10 - 25 percent of current population, could we still have aspirin, anesthesia, a few antibiotics if they still work, some sterile techniques in medicine, some means of treating river/lake water to kill off dangerous bacteria, maybe a little bit of electricity and lighting if I'm very good? A hand cranked generator like in WWII?<br><br>And then I realize: This is me asking some imaginary Santa Claus to perform a feat of magic and provide me and my family a "guaranteed" future - one where we don't die of starvation or epidemic and end up (our descendants, anyway) as Jefferson's small farmers or shop keepers. <br><br>And lastly I realize: There's no guarantees. I have to start somewhere, right where I am. I have to begin to conserve more, drive less, walk/bike more, waste less, repair instead of immediately replace, use less electricity, fly only when no alternative is possible (which means no more than once or twice a year to visit family). That won't be nearly enough, but it's a start and better than nothing at all. I have to talk to people about this without seeming preachy or especially political.

Very reliably, too, it's only when they grasp that nothing is going to make the predicament go away that they stop clinging to miracles that someone else will supposedly provide them, and begin to grapple with what they, themselves, in their own lives, need to do. <br><br>I suppose, if you want an alternative paradigm, one that fits my experience more closely would be drawn from alcoholism and other addictions. Until your drunkard admits he really, truly does have a problem, nothing is going to change. The hard collision with peak oil reality I'm trying to foster here is a way of waking up to the fact that the problem is real, short of "hitting bottom" -- because the bottom in question is a long, long way down. <br><br>Luckymortal, I think it was Mark Twain who pointed out that a village can't prosper by having everyone pay to have somebody else in the village do their laundry. In the same way, the military industrial complex can't thrive all on its own; it functions solely as a way to make sure that those nations currently on top of the global economy stay there, and get access to ample resources. If the resources aren't there, none of that matters -- and the current military industrial complex, I'd suggest, is far too dependent on lavish energy and resource use to survive long into a deindustrial world.

They are quoted as saying “The only people that go around publicly advocating political violence are idiots and agents provocateurs. Which one are you?” First I must stress that his sort of talk is very counter productive to effective provocateuring and needs to be addressed as soon as it rears its ugly head. Nothing is more poisonous than the truth. I trust the friends of your youth did some jail time for their peaceful radical activities. <br><br>Now to address the flaw in their argument: The question “Which one are you?” implies a dichotomy. “... idiots and agents provocateurs” suggests no dichotomy. The question does not fit the premise. Applying your own recommendations with respect to dichotomies,we must look for a third way. We must turn the dichotomy into a trichotomy so to speak. Is is not possible to advocate violent and be both an idiot and an agent provocateur? I humbly submit this was more generally the case. But things have changed! These things evolve. We learn from our mistakes. Its not the 60/70s anymore.<br><br>Now (NSA please note just in case you forget whose side I'm on ... this is an occupational hazard), as an agent provocateur I do not advocate violence. Nooo! No, no, no ... that is old school. This just provokes an over reaction of excessive jail terms (10 years for $20,000 damage to an SUV anyone?), invasions (wait, when did those stop so as to start again?), torture (hmm, again), indiscriminate murder (well), and extrajudicial executions (well sort of new in their public nature). I think all parties can agree that in the end this does nobody any good. And it doesn't save the world.<br><br>No, I think we can all learn from the school motto of a character from a race of cowards in the Doctor Who episode, “The God Complex”, that reads, “Resistance is Exhausting”. That's new school. These are pearls of wisdom from an unlikely source. Anyone trying to destroy the system by vandalism, maiming people, or killing them needs to be less energetic and altruistic. I know, I know, saving the world is all very attractive but, like so much else in our industrial culture, its really just another luxuriant extravagance. We will all have more pressing matters to attend to soon enough when we have less luxury and so are less extravagant. Save your energy. Conserve. When the urge to get off the couch to save the world by some violent act propels you upright, resist and lie down again until the feeling goes away. If you must be energetic, grow some food for yourself by using your own muscles (decentralize and re humanize farming). These are radical suggestions! <br><br>David Holmgren got it right, and so do you JMG. I expect you all will be seeing some jail time for your radical activities. So will I of course. If an agent doesn't do a little time he loses his credibility. The difference is I'll get out discretely and very early. You fellas? I'm not so sure.<br><br>Great Post. Keep up the provocateuring! Maybe I can get you a deal to lessen your time. We'll talk. You're doing great work for the cause. The Castle has noticed your efforts.<br><br>P.S. Did I not say some time ago that “they” (the elite ... you know, the people who run things) already know about Peak Oil.

The very short form is that since we no longer have the time or the resources to build a sustainable technic society, and the one we have is tearing itself to shreds around us, we're going to go through the normal process of decline and fall, ending in a period several centuries long in which advanced technologies survive only in enclaves, or in the form of documents and relics from which technologies can later be reconstituted. (The technical term for such a period, as I suspect you know, is "dark age.")<br><br>On the far side of that period, there's every reason to hope that much more sustainable technic societies can be established. One of the high priorities for our time is thus getting as many sustainable technologies into as many hands as possible, and into enduring forms, so that the ecotechnic societies of the future have plenty to work with. The hope that we could skip the dark age and make it straight to sustainable technic societies, though, went whistling down the wind many years ago. At this point, again, we don't have the resources or the time to do that. That's what I've been trying to say all along, btw.<br><br>Hal, I wasn't just talking about Nicole -- as I'm sure you know, there's a whole subculture of peak oil bloggers who keep repeating the same failed predictions of imminent crash year after weary year. As for pulling out of the economy, well, if Holmgren's latest gets a few more people to do that, it's a good thing. <br><br>VIS, the UFO phenomenon was mostly invented by the US military as a cover story for ordinary aerospace tests. (I can't be the only person who's noticed, for example, that those black triangle UFOs came in right about the time the Air Force started testing its first stealth aircraft, which look like what?) If there's a new flurry of UFO sightings being announced by the usual credible witnesses, that means that there's something new being tested, which is not exactly a surprise. If you'd like to read more about this, I'd encourage you to pick up a copy of <a href="http://www.llewellyn.com/product.php?ean=9780738713199" rel=nofollow>my book on the subject</a> and see what you think. <br><br>Jason, the idea of dumping trolls into a recycle bin has its appeal!<br><br>Jeff, thanks for the links. This bears very close watching. <br><br>Jphilip, the computer industry has been insisting for my entire lifetime that artificial intelligences as smart as or smarter than human beings will be made in just another few years. They've been wrong as reliably as the fusion researchers. With regard to the differential sustainability of humans and machines, I'd encourage you to read <a href=../../2010/04/twilight-of-machine.html rel=nofollow>the post I cited earlier</a>; it's a much more complex matter than it looks. <br><br>Bike Trog, get some old books (pre-1980) on winter camping and the like; they very often have patterns that show you how to make your own snowshoes.

Still, it's a useful addition to the language; y'all might be interested to know that in Pittsburgh, they say "yinz" (a contraction of "you 'uns") for the same purpose.<br><br>Duncan, remember that efficiency always needs to face the question "efficient for what?" Conservation measures of the sort I mentioned, such as insulation, use more materials so that there can be less energy consumed -- thus your energy efficiency is being bought at the price of less material efficiency. There are always tradeoffs, and always ways in which an efficiency in one place involves a lack of resilience either there or somewhere else in the whole system; the goal is to put your vulnerabilities in places where they're least likely to clobber you. <br><br>As for cooperatives, I'm sorry to say that in my experience I haven't noticed any difference between them and other businesses. <br><br>Ric, exactly.

I agree with your basic analysis though I'm not as certain as you seem to be: I'm not convinced that it is "too late" in any absolute sense; but I'm also not certain that is was NOT already too late the first time this whole thing came around in the 70's. Some of the critical elements are very long in timescale and just not well understood. (This most obviously includes climate change, but also impacts associated with shifts in the nitrogen cycle and long-term ecological impacts of land use decisions.) Without question, though, if any such transition was or is possible, it's much harder now than it would have been 40 years ago.<br><br>That said, I have to take issue with your framing of our societal prospects relative to when we start to respond. You have said in this post and elsewhere that we had a window of opportunity to transition to an ecotechnic civilization, and that window is now closed.<br><br>I assert that it is still physically possible, albeit unlikely, for us to make such a transition. It's possible, because we still spend about 90% of our resources on frivolous things which we could give up without ceasing to be an industrial or technological civilization, and because we waste a tremendous amount of resource chasing small marginal improvements in short-term gain. If we gave that up, we'd have plenty of resource - even now - for the things that matter (e.g. infrastructure).<br>It's unlikely, because it would require a whole lot of rich and powerful people (including most of what's left of the middle class - who are rich and powerful by global standards) to get a clue and make dramatic changes which would be scary and destabilizing and feel like sacrifice.<br><br>But here's the thing: that same statement could have been made equally well in the 70's, or the 50's, or at any time at least in this century. We never at any time had the resources to sustain the arc of development we were on; conversely, we could have stepped off that arc any time that a sufficient number of the rich and powerful decided that they wanted to.<br><br>Now it's much harder: more people would have to make that choice, and the technical challenges we face would be greater, with less room for error. But it's a difference of nature, not kind. We have never had the possibility of transitioning to an ecotechnic civilization without the buy-in of a critical mass of economically enfranchised people. That was true 40 years ago, and it's still true now. But your framing of the issue suggests that we have cross some kind of absolute threshold, and I just don't see the evidence of that.<br><br><a href=#c6293018489445835038 title="comment permalink">1/30/14, 5:46 PM</a><br><br>

Now <i>that's</i> kinky.<br><br>GreenEngineer, I'd encourage you to revisit the Hirsch Report. Their finding was that preparations for the peak of conventional oil production had to begin at least 20 years before the peak arrived in order to avoid traumatic impacts. The irony, of course, was that the report was published in 2005, the year that world conventional petroleum production peaked. Thus a strong case can be made that we are, in fact, well past a decisive threshold, and the resources and time no longer allow us (even if political, economic, and other real-world factors didn't get in the way, which of course they do) to undergo transition rather than collapse. <br><br>I'd also wonder what the point is of insisting that, well, yes, political and economic factors don't actually permit a transition to happen in the real world, but in theory, it's still possible!

Another way to put it is that what has prevented, what is preventing and will prevent a reasonably smooth transition to an Ecotechnic civilization is culture, society and politics; not technical impossibility.

I wonder, though, if feudalism wouldn’t be a better approach than rehumanizing. Consider taking on servants or workers as dependents (a fealty relationship) rather than employees. One of the profligate aspects of the industrial age the will have to end, the notion of a mobile workforce. Of course, in widespread use, this approach would approach removing people from the money economy. . <br><br>@ The Primitive 9:26 am,<br><br>You said, <em>" I realize what I'm doing isn't going to really change anything of the future we face. "</em> I think what you are doing is basic, fundamental change. <br><br>Raising children is how we transmit our culture, our values, practices, routines, and character, into the future. Where you are and what you are doing establishes a cultural background, examples of character, and craftsmanship that cannot help but impact those that see and interact with you -- and how they raise their children. You cannot help but impact the future, unless you huddle in a solitary cave.<br><br>Bravo.<br><br><br>@ Betsy 10:32 AM <br><br>You said <em>"I'd like to add a fourth tool: voluntary population reduction. . ."</em><br><br>I absolutely reject this argument. It has never worked -- except to make things worse. <br><br>The foremost means of communicating values to the future is raising children. Stop raising children, and your voice dies with you. Those that disagree with you will raise their children, with a proportionately larger voice in what happens next.<br><br>I think we can learn to live in a resilient manner that makes one better adapted to raise our children to flourish in whatever comes next.<br><br>@ GreenEngineer 11:46 AM <br>You said <em>"OK, JMG, what exactly do you mean by "save industrial civilization"?. . does "industrial civilization" mean that non-muscle energy sources are still generally available. ."</em><br><br>I think of the end of the industrial age as losing daily access to things made or produced more than 3 miles away. Some things will be lost forever, others available weekly, monthly, annually. The means of communication will fall to scavenging and lack of repair, as will the energy grid, and most all transport systems. <br><br>But unless we forget about sanitation engineering and health standards, we shouldn't face a shorter life span. With closer family and community interaction (and fewer banal distractions from mass media and <em>electronic</em> social networking, we needn't fear being less content, either. It won't be easy getting there -- change is measured in pain, after all, hence the grief components.<br><br>@ Bike Trog 12:48 PM,<br>You said... <em>"One problem of winter conservation is how to get around on snow and ice without a car."</em> Two thoughts. First, you are still thinking of a mobile civilization, that you need transportation to get to (remote) shopping, employment, and home. Second, walking still works, for the most part. As do oxen, mules, ponies, goat and dog carts, and rickshaws (the rehumanizing approach ;-)<br><br>Henry Ford demonstrated parallel counter-rotating screw-finned barrels on his tractor and Model A, on snow, grass, and dirt. The videos on the internet (I lost the location) show quite the ATV.<br><br>@ Derv, One of the tough parts of talking about efficiency, is failing to define what resources you intend to conserve. Making efficient use of my time while working doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with efficiency in growing tomatoes in my garden, writing blog posts, or feeding hungry people – or efficient conversion of man hours to cash flow at Monsanto.<br><br>@ Duncan 2:56 PM, You said... <em>". . distinction between energy efficiency and energy conservation . . "</em>. For me, energy conservation is to use no more of the resource, energy, than is needed. Energy efficiency is accomplishing a given task using as little resource, energy, as possible. Efficiency presumes keeping the same objective. Conservation does not, considering all demands on the resource.<br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c3052104625534594505 title="comment permalink">1/30/14, 9:36 PM</a><br><br>

Lets assume you are right, the great decline comes and in a few centuries we will be back to medieval feudalism or anarchie whatever you envision. <br><br>Will there ever grow a new civilization on this substrate? I think history shows, that this always is an option that can happen. If you think that this is in principle possible, then on which resources will this civilization be build, since fossil fuels are gone? what are the key technologies this civilization has to master to make use of their resource base?<br><br>The question now is, can we skip the dark ages? can we today make the transition to the civilization that masters the art of sustainability? <br><br>I agree totally with your three key features of implementation. Especially food is a key resource that has to be produced locally with higher human input. The next key is housing. This has also to be implemented with local resources and low energy needs for maintaining the internal temperature. <br><br>Of couse we will have to drop a lot of transportation of both goods and persons. There is little potential in energy efficiency, so there will be a reduction. And of course we will drop a lot of now known technologies concerning combustion engines. <br><br>What we want drop is the technological complex of electricity and information technology. It is a tool to powerful. And the resource input is small compared with other things we do today. Hardware can be produced quite decentralized, as long as you stick to the interfaces and software a the greatest example of a good produced by human labor and distributet in as many copies as you want with almost no additional input. <br><br>Call the result whatever you want, i would still call it an industrial society, since it still would be a society based on science and technology. <br><br>Besides that it is of course always convenient to argue with a very prolonged decline, since the far distant future is something none of us will ever see. So it is easy to make claims that can not be proven or disproven in anyones lifetime ;) Isn't the prolonged decline a doomsters bargaining approach?<br><br><a href=#c8541153176779904271 title="comment permalink">1/31/14, 4:00 AM</a><br><br>

I believe this is much related to what my 4-part comment would address. Since you already seem to be spiralling in on it I may be able to say it more succinctly.<br><br>Forget "destiny" and determinism. Imagine the future as a "possbility space" that is defined by the distribution of energy, matter, and very importantly: trust. <br><br>Now this is not a "homogeneous grey blob". And the current state of it is also not terribly important. The first and second derivative of time (how it changed form last week or last year to today - and how this change is different from the change seen in the previous year - cf Jared Diamond).<br><br>Now two concepts become very important: self ordered criticality (SOC) and percolation.<br><br>SOC is so to say what makes the "climate and weather patterns" of human activity reinforce themselves. This leads to remarkably stable configurations ("the system"), especially with highly capital intensive activities. <br>Less so with things like digital communication or narratives (because appeal is enough for multiplication). Of course mass media, google, etc. are in the SOC game as well and do their part - but until recently the economics of the imaginary world were not in their favor. Now google is probably trying the corner the market of the imaginary world (cf Luckymortal).<br><br>The narratives of the world equal a catalyst for trust and are immensely important. Trust has a very real effect on the material world. It largely determines how your get from "possibility state A" to "possibility state B" if it is at all physically possible. It can also allow a system to be pushed in the direction of a desired state that it may not be physically able to achieve (and maintain cognitive dissonance when there). <br><br>Narratives increase or decrease the resistance of societies to do certain things (overcome gradients, activation energies). Control of narratives is just as important as energy and matter for maintaining the SOC state. Wearing ties, corporate HR departments, taking on "responsibility", rigging quarterlies, "ponzi schemes", deciding to comment or troll, agree or disagree openly, you name it. <br>Ultimately you need to figure out how to make certain narratives appear or disappear effectively. What JMG is doing in my perception is to snipe at large cognitive dissonance bubbles with a bb gun. <br><br>--cont.--<br><br><a href=#c2211905464302893101 title="comment permalink">1/31/14, 4:02 AM</a><br><br>

Percolation (or flipping point) reached. Forest fires are another example. This is going on all the time and is a totally underrated phenomenon because it is not easily analytically described. <br>Also looking at individual snapshots or big pictures doesn't help much. For this you need to identify "canaries in the coal mine" (maybe troll comment tones) and watch them develop.<br>However a large portion of the world (and to a degree rehumanizers and their social ecosystem) such as developing nations, or mafias of the world are mostly off google's radar. So there's a problem. Especially when changes happen in the matter/energy dimension google used to be fairly blind to it. (Now they bought this thermostat company...)<br><br>The other problem is "global weirding". Freak (but not new) events such Katrina or the Arab "spring". When those happen on a non-localized dimension they may not be contained in time. Gangnam style was to "the (digital) system" as the moon landing was to the mil ind complex. I have talked to bilionaires about this, and they are thoroughly not amused. Of course it wasn't so scary as it happened in their partners sandbox, but it sure illustrated a business model for youtube.<br><br>I believe these people with (subjectively) much to lose are very aware that the "global weirding" is just a change in power ratios (current system to possible alternatives) and also where that is headed. What they lack is a business model that will make them come out on top (or close) after the flip in narratives. Give that to them you have trilions at you beck. And I wouldn't be surprised if it eventually comes down to the deal that JMG proposes. It's a poker game though. It may have to wait until the mil ind complex is disillusioned and the cards are on the table.

They seem to harbor a steadfast belief that those in the armed forces agree with them, by and large, and would not interfere. Needless to say I think it lunacy.<br><br>But it is troubling when even steady, well spoken guys you know and trust tell you that the divides are too deep to be bridged. That it is simply a matter of time until the nation is split up. <br><br>All that aside, I have to say that when national policy such as trade, immigration, industrial policy, etc are being used as weapons by one group against another we have reached a point of danger. Vital trust in institutions is replaced with a trust that they system is going to put the thumb screws to you. <br><br>In the end fairness does matter. We've made things far worse than they needed to be just simply by having one segment of the population declare economic war on another. It has been so long since I heard a politician speak of national self sufficiency that I cannot remember it. <br><br>@ Green Engineer: I must confess that I am sort of the opposite of a "green" engineer. I make my living in the engine business.

There is also a ~chance~ that what John has laid out is nowhere and noway a worst case. <br><br>Energy is SO vital to our lifestyle, shoot, any lifestyle, that the implications of even a moderately increasing long term cost for it are huge. And, of the many types of energy, that portion used for transportation are THE most vital. <br><br>And even if we had sufficient energy other than petro that we could readily lay hands on for an eternity it is a monumental task to shift a suburban, segmented society like ours into something more efficient that runs on this other source. The costs associated with such a change are massive and daunting. <br><br>We like to talk about fiction and sci-fi at times around here and one passage that keeps running through my brain is from "World War Z". Where the head of the agency tasked with getting the US on a war footing said "Ours was a postindustrial or service-based economy, so complex and highly specialized that each individual could only function within the confines of its narrow, compartmentalized structure. You should have seen some of the “careers” listed on our first employment census; everyone was some version of an “executive,” a “representative,” an “analyst,” or a “consultant,” all perfectly suited to the prewar world, but all totally inadequate for the present crisis...." <br><br>As a hands in the mud engineer I just cannot get that out of my head when I think of the future. The way we allowed ourselves to believe that we could offshore and outsource vital skills w/o consequence is one of the most breathtaking blunders I have seen in my lifetime. <br><br>Will<br><br><a href=#c1000519372452266248 title="comment permalink">1/31/14, 6:52 AM</a><br><br>

More relevantly, I believe that the first step to solving a problem is to correctly understand the problem. Most of the time that we spend collectively problem-solving, we're either looking at the wrong problem (usually a symptom rather than a cause) or we're misunderstanding the problem.<br><br>@BradK: I like your definition of the "end of industrial civilization". The three miles is arbitrary, of course - it could be 5, it could be 20. But it's not 100.<br><br>@JMG: I'd argue that my position (which can be mistaken for that of a technocornucopian, but is not) is actually what you want to see: technical professionals acknowledging the that predominant challenge of our age is not primarily a technical problem.<br><br>Specifically, my position has been that we already have all the technology we need to make the transition to an ecotechnic future, if we choose to value such a future over our short-term convenience.<br>Conversely, we will NEVER develop technology sufficient to continue with business as usual. In the absence of a cultural shift, technological civilization will fail.<br><br>In that context, worrying about whether we are past the "point of no return" (whatever that means) seems kind of useless. Insisting that that's the case, if it drives people away from internalizing that key insight, is counterproductive at best.<br><br>Having this perspective lets me differentiate worthwhile projects (ones that will create resilient infrastructure) from worthless ones.<br>It also lets me act to change perspectives. I work for one of the best green HVAC firms in the country, but my colleagues are technocornucopians. Over the course of the last five years, I've slowly been helping them shift their perspective; if this process is effective, it will hopefully help direct the work our firm does into more worthwhile directions.<br><br>I am familiar with the Hirsch report. But I think that he underestimates our flexibility and adaptability. We'd need 20 years lead time to avoid disruptions - and lo, the disruptions are here. Remember that in 2005 most people though that $100/bbl oil would kill global capitalism all by itself. Disruptions are one thing - the cascade failure of technological civilization is quite another.<br><br>In any case, I'm still curious to hear you address my question about your framing of our prospects now vs in the 70's. The barrier, then and now, was cultural change.

I'd point to your experience in New York City to suggest that it's not the cooperative form but the local culture that's the deciding factor. <br><br>GreenEngineer, no, I don't see you as a technocornucopian. You're in the middle of the bargaining process I discussed in this post, trying to find some set of actions that will allow some semblance of modern industrial civilization to continue in the face of its predicament. To my mind, the critical point that you're missing is that technology does not exist in a vacuum, and no, cultural change isn't the only barrier we face. The problem, as I've tried to point out (and as Hirsch and the original <i>Limits to Growth</i> study also pointed out), is that building the necessary infrastructure for a sustainable society involves very large investments of energy, resources, labor, and time; maintaining the infrastructure that supports industrial society as it now exists also requires very large inputs of all those same things; and at a certain pointy along the curve of decline, a society no longer has enough of those things to do both. <br><br>The example I've used in the past draws from Jared Diamond's essay on the Easter Island collapse. At a certain point along the curve of deforestation, the Easter Islanders will have had too few trees to (a) keep manufacturing the seagoing canoes they needed to feed themselves, and (b) allow the trees to reproduce themselves at a rate that would avoid the complete deforestation of the island. At that point they had precisely two choices: leave the remaining trees and starve today, or cut down the trees, build the canoes, and starve later on. All other choices had already been foreclosed by their previous actions. <br><br>My assertion is that we've passed the same point in our own curve of decline. It's not just political and social factors that are preventing a buildout of resilient infrastructure sufficient to preserve some aspects of industrial society; all but a trickle of our available wealth is tied up in trying to maintain the current system, and it's failing. Diverting enough to matter would bring the whole thing crashing down, which is why it won't be done or even attempted. <br><br>It's very easy, and very comforting, to cling to narratives of salvation at the eleventh hour, but as I commented to RPC above, that can serve as an excuse to avoid the necessary steps that will get something through the mess immediately ahead. I discussed that temptation in <a href=../../2007/08/twelfth-hour.html rel=nofollow>this post quite a few years ago</a>, and in many posts since that time. Mind you, I expect that for the next half dozen years or so, you'll have any number of people enthusiastically agreeing with you, and no doubt all manner of impressive plans will be drafted to show how we really could, even now, pull out of the descent. That those plans will never be enacted, because the spare resources no longer exist to enact them, is just one of life's ironies. Meanwhile, when you get through that and through the depression that follows, I'll be waiting for you, and at that point we'll see what we can do together.<br><br><a href=#c285352130436692412 title="comment permalink">1/31/14, 12:35 PM</a><br><br>

Small households usually have to outsource or automate nearly everything, from maintenance of the house to child and elder care to, in many cases, preparing meals. A larger household (centralized, ironically, on the smallest scale) is better able to become an economically productive entity in an otherwise decentralized system. But also has present-day benefits, which is why extended households have never completely gone away in the U.S. Many immigrants to the U.S. manage their first decade or two that way, for instance.<br><br>Members of my generation and my parents' were eager enough to move away from <i>their</i> parents at the first opportunity, but at the other end of that stick, I've known few if any who have greatly enjoyed empty-nest life, especially when solitary care of an infirm spouse entered the equation. At the same time, mortgages and rents consume a huge portion of young people's incomes and energy.<br><br>This does, however, benefit of purveyors of numerous ad-driven "convenience" products and services. Perhaps that helps explain why, in the media:<br><br>- Young adults who live with their parents are portrayed as pathetic.<br>- Elders who need one of their children to care for them at home are portrayed as intolerably burdensome.<br>- Children spending time in the company of adults other than their parents is portrayed as sinister and dangerous.<br>- Older relatives (parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts) and their friends are portrayed as unlikable in various ways (prudish, bigoted, strange, etc.)<br>- The benefits small households do provide (privacy, escape from disliked in-laws, "peace and quiet") are extolled to the high heavens.<br><br>Besides the inherent physical economies of extended households (sharing shelter, tools, and fixtures), there are significant present-day tax advantages. Transactions within the household (informal exchange of cooking, child care, teaching, nursing, home maintenance, community participation, etc. for room, board, shared recreation, and gifts) are either non taxable or difficult to collect taxes on, compared with the same transactions with outsiders using cash.<br><br>That suggests that if a large number of people in the U.S. entered into extended household living arrangements by choice, it would be at least as subversive as Holmgren's scenario, as well as more practical in both short and long time frames. Of course, like Holmgren's prescription, it's not going to happen on any such scale, until driven by immediate need. However, it's an area were changing the narrative might help.<br><br>(Do I walk this walk? Only partially. Instead of a full-time job with half my earnings going toward rent or a mortgage, I'm self-half-employed and live rent-free in a family-owned (mortgage-free) house, in informal exchange for spending weeks at a time as needed assisting my mother and other relatives spread across several states, which my lack of full-time commitments gives me the freedom to do. We'd all be better off if we were all under one roof, but as things are so far, I can't decide that for them. That's an example of why changing the narrative could be important.)<br><br><a href=#c6310810004911764376 title="comment permalink">1/31/14, 12:59 PM</a><br><br>

I've been through the depression and through the bargaining. My decision has been to work the problem as best I can; unlike (statistically speaking) most people, I'm in a position to influence the design of infrastructure both directly through my work and indirectly by influencing the thinking of other professionals.<br><br>I've examined the evidence for a certain crash, and I'm just not convinced. I can't say you are wrong, but I also can't say you are right. The error bars on my mental model are too big.<br><br>Certainly I understand how civilizations can undergo metabolic failure (of which catabolic collapse is a part), but I also know that all the historical examples of this phenomena are much simpler than the system we have now. Not that complexity begets security - quite the opposite, if anything - but it does make the system pretty illegible. You and I can both predict what will happen if society stays its current course, but I don't think either of us have more than heuristics to work with in terms of what is possible were the system to change course in response to a cultural shift.<br><br>What I do know, directly from my work on buildings and infrastructure, is that we are "wasting" far more energy and resources than most people (even you, I suspect) can appreciate.<br>I put "wasting" in quotes because it's not just a question of efficiency - that alone will not get us there, and will tend to compromise resilience. It's about what we choose to spend our resources on in the first place: The vast majority of our activities as a culture, including many of more most energy intensive ones, do nothing whatsoever to contribute to human welfare - they mainly exist to support one aspect or another of our collective delusions, or to aggrandize particularly powerful individuals.<br><br>Put it another way: The biggest difference between an energy-efficient building and a standard energy hog building (or worse, a "green" energy hog building) is in occupant behavior and expectations, not technology. That's my professional opinion and experience as a senior HVAC engineer who has won awards for his green building designs, so you can take that for whatever you think it's worth.<br><br>Your own writing on catabolic collapse describes the dynamic whereby a complex society undergoes partial collapse, and thus is able to maintain itself at a lower level of complexity which fits its new resource base. You have asserted that we cannot hope to follow that path, because our resource base is eroding too fast.<br><br>This is all basically correct and I agree in principle. But I think that you misestimate just how much resource could potentially be freed up in such a "shedding event". We do have a resource base which is not depleting. We're not doing much to access it, but its there if we're willing to make the investment. (Granted, if the EROEI of wind is actually 2, then we're done. Might as well give up now. But that's one study; other disagree. I don't think we have anything like the final word on what is possible in this arena.) If we shed enough overhead, and we don't insist on diverting the resources thus available to further efforts to maintain our illusion, we could make those investments.<br>That's why the fundamental barrier is social perspectives and cultural priorities, not resources or technology.<br><br><a href=#c6350711293728350686 title="comment permalink">1/31/14, 1:26 PM</a><br><br>

Those alleged economies are often the result of replacing human beings with machines with high embodied energy and copious energy consumption. The centralized, scaled up system, is less resilient, and, in a time of change, climatic, social, and economic, resilience has economic value. Ask those businesses destroyed by hurricanes Sandy and Katrina. So, we have to ask about Derv's specific "efficiency" goals. One hundred 20 acre farms producing food by labor intensive organic practices will produce more food, more economic value, and use less fossil fuel than the same 2000 acre farm producing corn and soybeans by one farmer and his family.<br><br>I must say, also, that your comment moderation gives the comments a civil tone that I much appreciate.<br><br><a href=#c4842171636742633492 title="comment permalink">1/31/14, 2:42 PM</a><br><br>

Not to mention the ethanol and carbon capture bubbles...<br><br>There is quite a prophetic theme on surveillance and data-mining, a concept of futures markets within the intelligence community on individuals and ideas, complete with virtual market agents etc. I wonder though if the degree of control that the powers that be expect through this is not also subject to diminishing returns, and may constitute yet another bubble - because one may gather and collate information but to translate that into control you have to do something with it, so it isn't a magic bullet in the absence of real power of action, which will depend on the usual political and economic factors.<br><br>Personally now, I reckon I'm somewhere around the depression stage, I'm not sure what the next step is for me personally, and the awareness that the way things are organised now has no long-term future, and there are no easy and neat fixes, but also that I don't expect a sudden collapse and probably early death, seems only to lead me into increasing doubt.<br><br><a href=#c7229442406418765670 title="comment permalink">1/31/14, 3:02 PM</a><br><br>

Next Tuesday are Minnesota political party caucuses and I'll be convening an Independence Party caucus which traditionally has 4-8 people who show up from diverse backgrounds, but what common ground can we find more than complaining?<br><br>I did a google search for old archdruid blogs on "membership" and found one 4 years ago:<br>http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2010/01/last-weeks-archdruid-report-post-on.html<br><br>I belonged to a Toastmaster club that was good practice for public speaking skills, and also attended a local rotory club meeting, nearly all retired men, more of a social lunch club, and their tasks seemed pretty tame - planning fundraisers for a local park athletics upgrades, and awarding scholarship funds.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_International<br><br>Your old blog talked about Freemasons and its protective structures for members, something "unprogressive" in the modern world of individual freedom, but offers some hope for decentralization. <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemason<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oddfellows<br><br>It also reminds me of the long conservative arguments "charity starts at home" and against "progressive" arguments that centralization of power and redistribution of wealth as a good way to express charity.<br><br>Decentralization reminds me Churchill's war cry "I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat" which inspired people to common cause survival, until the danger was over, and then he was out.<br><br>So there's a game of competition, and decentralization or relocalization don't stand on equal footing when progressives want to pass everything onto the experts to optimize.<br><br>I keep going back to the idea of a local currency, dollar-hours, as containing a bridge - where "noneconomic" activity (local organization work that can see local needs) can be given some value. Local currencies make no sense if you have a $200,000 mortgage, but if you're debt-free and living in a church basement rent-free, you can afford to pay attention to a different level of human need.<br><br>At least that's the "good side" to explore to me as we slip down from "full employment" ideals of monetary relationships in all things of infinite economic growth.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c6919943044107693568 title="comment permalink">1/31/14, 8:16 PM</a><br><br>

I thought Nine Mile Indiana was heaven - why would anybody leave? Well, because they could, because of cheap gas. In Spring o''67, tornadoes ripped down barns and homes across Indiana. Amish folk were all rebuilt in 6 months - everything. They just got together and did it. Two years later and more, Gentiles were still waiting for Federal Disaster Relief Money. which is to say, it was a matter of culture, what was the meaning of community? For lots of small farmers, cheap gas meant they couldn't afford to keep draft horses anymore. They had to get big or get out. Millions of small farmers got out because of cheap gas, after WW 2. It was a disaster - fatal - for small farms. Now that cheap gas is ending, is it also a disaster, or a blessing?

Whenever I find myself getting depressed about the world in general, I find it helpful to bring it all back to me and focus on what it is I am doing and not what it is everyone else is doing - and the room for improvement, in my case, is still vast! If you truly want to effect change, the best way is by example. (Even my own sometimes unfortunate example of, "don't do it this way!") <br><br>JMG I'm going to disagree with your comment to Betsy that moral arguments for abstinence... are the least successful ways to motivate change, given that moral arguments for abstinance are actually the ONLY effective way to motivate change. I just read a wonderful book a few weeks ago (the name escapes me, unfortunately... I've read a lot of books in the last few weeks) that details exactly how communities worldwide have managed to deal with their unsustainable birth rates. Not all dealt with abstinence, but all dealt with changing the morals (or mores) of the culture at hand - the most stunning example was Iran which, in the space of a single generation, managed to drop its birthrate from around 7 children per woman to less than 2 today. (Today they're worried they're not making enough warriors and are trying to figure out how to raise the rate again). Of particular note was Japan, where women shared that once they had one (or sometimes two) child/children, they simply quit having sex with their husbands. The reason this is important is that once people accept a moral reason for change to occur, that change can happen relatively fast. (Of course, I think you realize this as well and were likely referring to individual moral arguments, not widely accepted cultural ones.)<br><br>This has significance when it comes to consumption. Were we in America, for example, ever to accept that lowering consumption rates was a moral goal, I think we would do it quickly, in much the same way people planted victory gardens in WWII. That, of course, is me being hopeful (which as a pessimist, doesn't happen very often). It's possible that we can only come through with flying colors in the short term (such as in the Good Samaritans in Atlanta's "zombie apocalypse") but when the challenge is for a lifetime, we will be less able - or willing - to comply. <br><br>I am looking forward to your future post regarding where our young, disaffected, potentially violent males with military training will be gathering with trepidation. I am afraid my own "last, best place" of North Idaho might feature on your list, given our somewhat substantial population of people carrying an awful large load of anger. I continue to work not just on pulling that mote out of my own eye, but in promoting community resilience efforts, because I love the people in my small town. But I do sometimes wonder what this place will look like when it becomes clear that we're not ever going to find ourselves coming back up out of this downward slide. Of course, our President made a point in his State of the Union to talk about how we're almost energy independent now and the future looks bright... so maybe I'm wrong. Or more likely, maybe we will never have someone with a powerful bully pulpit who's willing to rally the people to more realistic behavior in time to make any difference at all.<br><br><a href=#c8702486959840071733 title="comment permalink">1/31/14, 11:29 PM</a><br><br>

Just thought I'd check because I do try and provide links to weather statistics where possible. The numbers are in and they're not good...<br><br>I hadn't read about the calls to violence. It is sort of an absurd call, because people forget to interpret motivations and/or learn from history.<br><br>Firstly, during the Great Depression - at least here - there weren't great violent uprisings. Most people were grateful for any and all assistance they received. Why don't people get that?<br><br>Secondly, about violence, what people tend to conveniently forget in their race to fantasy is that most people have families. People are generally unlikely to leave their families - this includes both military and civilians - to their fates whilst they go forth pursuing violent uprisings. People loudly spruiking such nonsense have generally been watching too many action films.<br><br>Now, the young, impressionable and unemployed are something else to be reckoned with entirely.

First place to start is from the place where people live, from homes of the human beings. There are many refitting possibilities for old, sturdy buildings or energy-saving options for the new ones, as you JMG already know. As my friends are building this kind of solutions to earn their living and I am somewhat involved there also, it has been nice to see sane conversation methods making some progress. <br><br>Personally I have seen that such mundane things as double windows, double roofing and having thick insulation turning more porous outwards (brick wall inside and thick mesh plastering over gyproc slabs outside) reduces energy bills dramatically. If living space is designed to be open space warmed by gigantic hearth baking oven in the middle, much of the warmth is conserved. Double roofing with felt roof below and tile or plate roof above is plainly amazing with preventing heat escaping through top of the house - it's most vulnerable spot by far. Raised wood floor over gravel bed with ventilation both horizontal and vertical offering capillary break against moisture seals the deal. It makes your home sturdy and durable, with no build-in "self-destruction" triggers of current, totally insane fake-luxury building trend. <br><br>Water gets warmed inside boilers attached to ovens in the kitchen and the sauna. Surface water piping with some vents to permit breaks when regulations permit, so that when water freezes inside the plumbing during service failures (more common occurrence nowadays than before)you don't suffer such a huge water damages. <br><br>It is actually relatively "cheap" to build low-energy house here in the subarctic region. You just have to be ready to live in somewhat smaller space with somewhat more homework. Not a bad deal, I suppose. As global infrastructure unravels slowly but steadily around us, it is better to be poor in warm house with warm water available than in cold one. There are different shades of being poor, after all.<br><br><a href=#c3893093107235880590 title="comment permalink">2/1/14, 1:31 AM</a><br><br>

You'll notice that I don't discuss that in this blog, either, for similar reasons. <br><br>Tranquillity, the claim that moral arguments for abstinence are the only effective way to motivate change is, if I may be frank, absurd. Perhaps you'd like to look up the rates of teen pregnancy in those parts of the US that rely on abstinence-based education, compared to those that use less moralizing approaches to sex education. (Hint: where moral exhortations to abstinence are used, rates of premarital sex and teen pregnancy are <i>much</i> higher.) <br><br>The Japanese and Iranian experiences are much better explained by economic factors. The habit of telling people "You ought to do this because it's right" produces a nice warm glow of moral self-righteousness in those who use it, but it only motivates those people who already agree with you -- thus (for example) the total failure of pacifism and voluntary population reduction, two movements that have relied almost entirely on that approach. <br><br>Cherokee, we came close to violent insurgency here in the US during the last Great Depression; in the months before Roosevelt's inauguration in 1933, farmers in the Midwest were blockading roads and engaging in violence against banks and county governments who were trying to foreclose on mortgaged farms. Roosevelt's drastic (and arguably illegal, but effective) actions in the first hundred days of his presidency took the wind out of that, but if Hoover had gotten back in, it could have become very ugly very fast. <br><br>Sunseeker, I'd put the $199 into something more useful! I noted it only because it shows that peak oil is slipping past the barriers of denial again. (PS: Please read the note above the comments field about how comments need to be relevant to the current week's post. If you want to do a hostile review of one of my books, by all means post it to a blog of your own or some other online forum.) <br><br>Juhana, watch that spell-checker -- "conservation" and "conversation" aren't the same thing in English! That said, no argument at all with your comment; it's crucial to remember that it's possible to be poor in relative comfort and security. <br><br>Jphilip, not at all -- the computer industry has a long record of promising grandiose achievements in the near future and then not following through. That's where I got the term "vaporware," after all. With regard to HAL and Rosie, half a dozen Rosies may require more slumgullion but they don't have the extremely demanding requirements HAL does; as for HAL chugging along for centuries, er, I take it you don't have much experience with how fast industrial machines tend to wear out. <br><br>Latefall, thanks for the pgp anecdote! As for my assertion that beggaring the middle class is a stabilizing influence on the system, it's simply an extension of what was done to the working class a few decades earlier -- which, you'll notice, didn't have any of the dire consequences your model might predict. If you've got a system that can no longer meet all the demands placed on it, demand destruction is the logical response, and so long as you don't chuck everyone out the door at once, your middle and former middle class populations will be too busy competing with each other for the declining supply of middle class jobs to organize any kind of effective counterpressure. So far, it's working very well -- just as it did when the working classes were thrown under the bus in the 1970s and 1980s.<br><br><a href=#c8495091290286820037 title="comment permalink">2/1/14, 8:38 AM</a><br><br>

If I had been drinking lemon cider I'd have lost my laptop. A meme that deserves to spread.<br><br>I think I've been through the K-R stages over the last 15 years, until now I feel a kind of weary resignation, combined with the cynical and selfish hope that things will not fall apart terminally during my lifetime (another 20 years to go if I'm lucky, er, unlucky?). I try to enjoy the good things about modern civ in moderation (even though "moderation" by modern standards seems like shameless wallowing); and I try to separate myself incrementally from the long supply lines from the industrial core.<br><br>This year we expand the garden and greenhouse a bit, and next year probably we put in a big rainwater catchment tank (while huge plastic tanks are still available and affordable). In the meantime I confess I enjoy watching a classic movie or a BBC nature documentary on the modest-sized flatscreen, in the lovely warmth from our modern, efficient wood stove. We don't take air travel vacations like most of our peers; we drive our small truck very few miles per year; but we do motor and sail around in small boats in the summer. The fact that our lifestyle feels relatively frugal illuminates the monstrous profligacy that is now the norm! My clothes come from the thrift store, and all our electronics is obtained as refurbs; but I still buy grapefruit. I'm bargaining, temporising, with the rate of decay; as the old saying goes about being over 40, it's all about managing the decline.<br><br>But underneath it all, to be honest, I'm still grieving for the false promises that were made to me in my youth, that bright shiny star trek future I was told was on the way; and I fear, I deeply fear, the possible onset of barbarism close to home. I know all too well that industrialism has always practised brutality and barbarism on its extractive periphery of course, that's what we call "colonialism". But I would rather be ruled by distant warlords in Ottawa than local, unpleasantly present and personal warlords from the nearest town. Not because it's morally better -- there's not much to choose between 'em -- big mafia vs little mafia -- but because it's less scary for me personally. That doesn't give me a great inflated opinion of myself, but it's the truth.<br><br>Some days I can take the long historical view and say, well, species rise and species fall. Civilisations likewise, but faster. We just happen to be alive "on the cusp of decline" as a previous poster mentioned. We don't get to pick when we're born, so this is what we're stuck with; and the process, the predicament, has been with us as long as we've been human. It may be that this great global folly we call industrial civ was baked in back at the Toba Bottleneck, when the few surviving hominids got such a head start after the thaw. Maybe the opposable thumb was the start of all our troubles. Or maybe it was language. Who knows?<br><br>In the here and now, in the day to day -- well, I keep working on local food security for my little island. I get to know my neighbours. I experiment with food plants. We do what we can, what we have the courage and energy for, what seems worth doing at the time, and wait to see what happens next. I am not the biggest fan of CS Lewis, but I make an exception for the Screwtape Letters :-) one of the best insights in it, iirc, is that the thing worth praying for is not to be delivered from all misfortune, but to have the resilience of spirit to retain one's dignity and values in the face of misfortune. I no longer hope for any salvation for industrial civ -- I hope for salvage instead, for the ability and courage to save something from the bouncing rubble.<br><br><a href=#c108840341165792532 title="comment permalink">2/1/14, 1:22 PM</a><br><br>

In the shortest term, consumption is the realistic target. But since, in the long run, it is investment that generates new wealth, the balance needs to be regained as soon as possible. Only new wealth will bring down the mountain of debt that is burdening individuals and countries (...) Overall consumption will grow across the planet following new investment and new jobs. However, continuing with the current pattern of globalization without drastically reducing energy and materials consumption in our ways of living and producing would require seven planets.<br><br>Paradoxically, this environmental constraint may yet be the saving factor for inducing massive innovation, sustaining economic growth, while also shifting consumption away from unsustainable lifestyles. There is an enormous wealth creating potential in facilitating a major overhaul of most products and production methods and a redesign of consumption patterns to stress quality, durability, low energy consumption, low or no emissions, recyclability, upgradeability etc."<br><br>***<br>My comment: Being (partly) an economist myself, I'd say it is very crucial with different messages but sharing the same content. Without doubt, if enacted, it would require all heads and all hands available - Just as in previous boom times we've had in history. In the current state of affairs, we instead tell people we're too poor to let them work, and the poorer we get, the less we can afford to work..<br><br><a href=#c4382097022926982068 title="comment permalink">2/1/14, 7:13 PM</a><br><br>

It takes a lot of energy to lift water up that head. As a comparison, the 20m lift (which is a bit more than half your lift) from the reserve water tank here takes about 1kWh for 6,000 litres. The house pump draws half that amount again and honestly, if I had to I could walk the water up the small incline in buckets.<br><br>Down Under we use rainwater tanks (as you may have seen in the video). Just as an observation, if the ground water table is that low, then I'd suggest that your trees may also be water stressed? I'd be interested in your thoughts on the matter. I don't really know but that is a deep well and it sounds sort of risky as you are dependent on electrical infrastructure.<br><br>The old timers here used to have windmills here which pumped water up to header tanks for cattle whenever the wind blew. Pity it also lifted the salt layer in the soils.<br><br>I'm well aware that in some parts of this country, over drawing of aquifers for irrigation has lowered their levels even in recent times.

I tend to think GE argument presents legitimate uncertainty and I take GE at their word when they insist they are not 'bargaining'.

Although 'culture' can change, the way that type of change change happens is complicated, not fully understood and can't be insisted upon or directed with any degree of confidence.

We've given this a great deal of thought. The island we live on, for the most part, has an aquifer that floats on top of intruding salt water; well depth is pretty well equal to elevation. There are a couple of odd, geologically isolated exceptions; one property 2 miles North of us is right by the bay and yet has a 200 ft deep well. Well use is common here (as you say), in the Pacific Northwest it works fine. Our aquifer is recharged by the annual rain.<br><br>We use the water for the garden half the year as well as household use. We drink rainwater that we collect in a 55 gal. plastic barrel then filter. We are still building our tiny cabin (280 sq. ft.), but after it is done I want to save enough to solarize just the well with PV. A half or quarter H.P. DC pump with a gallon a minute capacity running only during daylight would give us adequate flow. No batteries, no inverter, only a couple of relays. But, should electricity from the mains become unavailable or unaffordable, _and_ we hadn't been able to afford the PV and pump, we would have to build a larger rainwater catchment. I'd probably build it as you do in Australia, concrete block, plastered inside and about 20K gal. capacity. We'd need more catchment area, and probably some smaller pumps to move the water around. But it's doable, our neighbors well is the same depth as ours, they used a hand pump for their first two years; we could hand pump rainwater if we had to.<br><br> Our trees are quite healthy, though not as big as on the West side of the Olympic Peninsula, in the Hoh Rainforest. We are in the rain shadow of the Olympics here and only get 24" a year. So far, it's been enough. Our well drillers log shows alternating layers of sand, gravel and clay. Water frequently "ponds" on the intermediate clay layers, so the trees don't have to reach 125 ft. to reach water. Our uphill neighbors inherited a 20' deep hand dug pioneer's well on their land. It has water in it year round, but acts more as a cistern and is easily overdrawn. They collect rain in two 2400 gal. plastic tanks.<br><br> I'd considered wind pumps as well as wind turbines for electric power. Our wind patterns are not reliable enough though. Lots in winter storms, little the rest of the year, and our site is too far below the ridge top. There is a fellow on Guemes Island, about 40 miles North of us who has wind turbines and solar PV. He lives on a flat, open island, Dutch landscape :) But has power year round from his system. Name is Ian Woofenden, and he writes for Home Power magazine.<br><br> Sea level rise will eventually put our well out of business, but there's no telling when. I'd guess as soon as 20 years, as long as a century. Hence my interest in cisterns. <br><br>"in some parts of this country, over drawing of aquifers for irrigation has lowered their levels even in recent times." {Snip!} "water scarcity would be a limiting factor to both population and agriculture here."<br><br>In the U.S. that's happening in the Ogallala Aquifer under Texas and Oklahoma, leftover from the last glaciation, I think. They're drawing it down with diesel pumps. At some point the falling water table will meet rising diesel costs. One farm at a time, the area will revert to dry land ranching with a consequential loss of food production and jobs.<br><br>Glenn<br><br>in the Bramblepatch<br>Marrowstone Island<br>Salish Sea<br>Cascadia<br><br><a href=#c3701019096813312007 title="comment permalink">2/2/14, 12:21 PM</a><br><br>

It's all over but the cryin'.<br><br>With all due respect to JMG (and President Eisenhower), I'm not so sure that the military industrial complex is a single thing. It looks to me that the industrial half of the complex - the manufacturing industries that formerly employed millions of well paid American workers who in turn paid the taxes that funded US military expenditures - is now on Chinese soil under the defacto control of the Chinese elite in Beijing and within easy reach of the Chinese military. And how long can the military half of the complex exist without the financial and physical capacity of the industrial half? <br><br>Productive capacity that was offshored to China by American CEOs for the purpose of filling their own pockets presumably could be converted, at least in part, to production of arms and munitions for the Chinese military in the event of war. And buck an hour Chinese workers slaving away in those factories don't pay taxes in the US.<br><br>The American managerial class interpreted "shareholder value" to mean that anything goes in service of their own monetary interest. The long and the short is that American CEOs, bandying this "shareholder value" absurdity, stripped their own country's physical and financial war-making capacity and delivered it to a giant, increasingly aggressive and historically aggrieved adversary. <br><br>Boneheaded or what? Is it just me or does anyone else see a huge national security problem? Has the US military brass pondered this? I wonder if the Chinese brass isn't just thunderstruck that all these industries just fell out of the sky. <br><br>As an aside, IMO this debacle by itself is proof that the "best and the brightest" don't go into business, notwithstanding the baloney propagated by Wall Street and Ivy League biz schools. <br><br>While we're finger pointing, it wasn't just money-men. American politicians too, in the triumphalist afterglow of the implosion of the USSR, the collapse of the Iron Curtain, the abandonment of communist certitudes by the Chinese ruling class, thought that if a little free enterprise was good then a whole lot more was better. Let the CEO's have at it!<br><br>But, as Latefall says, what's gone is gone. The question is what to do now. Maybe we shouldn't be worrying so much about the US M-I-C but rather their successors, the Chinese M-I-C.<br><br><a href=#c2298635342061436492 title="comment permalink">2/2/14, 1:29 PM</a><br><br>

I've come to assume you already know everything about everything.<br><br>Yes, that's entirely unreasonable. ;-)<br><br>I'm toying with the concept that Marxism extended American Capitalism. I know very little about Marx -- I'm a typical American in that -- but I've heard it said often that he predicted the self-immolation of capitalism, and if the RS article is accurate, he had it pretty dead-on. The problem is, he thought it would end a lot sooner than it did, and the critics say that means he got it all wrong and was an idiot: after all, growth capitalism and Progress go hand-in-hand, world without end, Amen.<br><br>What caught my attention in the RS article was the fact -- which I didn't know -- that progressive income tax is part of the Communist Manifesto, and that it influenced the adoption of progressive taxation in the US and elsewhere. If that's so -- and it seems plausible, the Manifesto was penned in 1848, and the first income tax in the US was in 1862 -- then given the strong position Marxism had in the US in the early 1900's, I wouldn't be surprised if a LOT of the New Deal came straight out of Marx. Covertly, of course: people do that when they "borrow" from tainted sources, kind of like a cat scraping sand over their business. I just don't know enough about Marxism or the history of the New Deal to know.<br><br>It would explain the rabid hate-affair that the political and religious right has with the New Deal, which seems otherwise inexplicable.<br><br>A bit of Marxism in the American system might have been just enough to stabilize capitalism for the half-century from the 1930's to the 1980's, e.g. the 70-90% tax on high income. Once the 1980's started rolling back the New Deal, normal self-immolating habits of capitalism would have reasserted themselves, and that certainly seems to be what I've lived through.<br><br>The irony of that, if true, and if we were not already drowning in irony, would be just too delicious.<br><br>I'm neither convinced enough of this tenuous hypothesis, nor interested enough in Marxism, to follow up on it. I don't see any particular hope in Marxism at this point -- it isn't going to "save capitalism", or our industrial society. Nor do I see it playing any real role in the long descent. I have better ways to waste time.<br><br>But you have commented negatively about a return of Marxism, and I was curious to know how you think that will play out.<br><br><a href=#c4058903115175968544 title="comment permalink">2/2/14, 2:43 PM</a><br><br>

There were quite a few back then who had issues with the mainstream lifestyle (thought it doomed and even evil) and "dropped out" to form what was to be a better way. As we all know, the commune movement fizzled out, with many of the participants eventually moving back into mainstream life, some with vengeance for the material possessions they had previously forsaken.<br><br>My take away lesson from that experience is that it is hard, maybe impossible, to keep people in a less comfortable, alternative lifestyle, as long as the mainstream lifestyle still seems to be viable. Yes there will be the devout few who are willing to give up the comforts, but most won't. Not until the illusions of the mainstream dream become all too obviously exposed.<br><br>I think the same dynamic is at work today with the PO community. It is a hard sell to give up your car, airplane travel, and all the other modern conveniences when those around you are not. Even if you know intellectually that it cannot last, and may even be morally wrong to continue using these things. <br><br>Instead of giving up our cars we drive hybrids or use bio fuels; we use recycled toilet paper; and adopt a slew of other compromises that dance around the problems we know are out there. But it will not be until all those conveniences are yanked away from us that collectively we accept what we have known and start looking for permanent alternatives.<br><br>I am thankful to you and the other PO commentators, for keeping the message out there (as unpopular as it may be at times). It will have an effect, I believe, but not as soon as would be desired. In the mean time, we each can do what we can to plan for a future.<br><br> <br><br><br><br><a href=#c3198799936552025241 title="comment permalink">2/2/14, 4:21 PM</a><br><br>

The understanding that we are using up the planets resources at a unsustainable rate doesn't really seem to be a hard sell there. It's when you try and link that with the lifestyles to which we have all become accustomed, rather than some corporate conspiracy to clear fell the Amazon for no good reason, that things get dicey. The idea that we can have an economic boom which simultaneously bring the third world up to our standard of living and simultaneously leads to more sustainable exploitation of scarce resources seems absurd to me. It brings to mind Jesus's parable about serving two masters. You can't serve both exponential growth and the sustainable use of scarce resources. Those who successful traverse the long descent are quite likely going to have to realize that accomplishing certain goals make the accomplishment of others impossible and that they will have to choose which ones are most important to them.<br><br><a href=#c8645176063088509914 title="comment permalink">2/2/14, 6:13 PM</a><br><br>

When I use it, if my daughters happen to be visiting, they ask for a turn. If all I had was a regular yard, that would be all I own, but we've got some meadow and so we also use a mower.<br>****************<br>Having just come back from a weekend at work, I was quite surprised that in the break room, while the TV was on and a blurb came on the news about how America is now the biggest oil and gas producer in the world, a guy turned to me and spoke about how we're going to run out of oil! A bit later, since I was reading Jared Diamond's Collapse, a woman asked me what it was about and I talked a bit about Easter Island, she also said, well, that is like our situation, and we're using up all the oil and we're going to run out! I was rather floored as I don't consider my coworkers in general or either of those two particularly likely to be aware of that sort of thing. Actually, it was just a couple of months ago that same woman crowed that America is going to become energy independent (she had heard some shale gas propaganda).<br><br>I'm finding the human situation depressing. Would be funny if not so tragic. Easter Island is surely a strange episode in the human annals. A people so isolated they may have forgotten that there was a world out there. How much did their complete lack of perspective blind them to the foolishness of their actions? Alone among the Polynesian peoples, they got into cremating the dead. This takes a lot of wood. They had a priesthood and an elite. Other than survival and ceremonies and such, what was there to do? Why, statue building. There were hundreds, all getting bigger as the centuries wore on, with platforms involving millions and billions of pounds of rocks. Until they no longer had ropes or wood to slide them on. They devolved into cannibalism and rage, ultimately pushing over their rivals statues and breaking them deliberately until none were left standing.<br>Yes, Easter Island is depressing, and a long descent perhaps is also depressing because what they had was a long, long descent. Less and less food and variety of food, fewer animals, no trees, fewer plants, poorer health. And, several other south sea islands were also experiencing erosion and were partially deforested. All those islands have been inhabited for somewhat more or less than one thousand years. Would they eventually all have reached the same state? At least on Easter Island, there were a few survivors, but on Mangareva and its two tiny trading partners, all died.<br>So Diamond points out that earth, also, is an island, isolated in the sea of space. It becomes a question of whether we can slowly deplete the earth or whether earth can fight back by knocking our population back far enough to recover. If I hope for a fast collapse, this is why.<br><br>Until recently, I was hoping for some free, clean energy, read about Tesla and others, and I do think it possible. After all, there is much we don't know about physics. But now I think that would be a curse. We haven't the wisdom to handle it; we haven't used wisdom in handling the one we have now, and giving more power to the unwise only allows them to do greater mischief.<br>That was the reason given by the alchemists for keeping their secrets.<br><br><a href=#c7187759843600969571 title="comment permalink">2/2/14, 8:16 PM</a><br><br>

As for the rulers it is a bit different.<br>On the other hand we have a long history of initiated from the top preparations, likt the Petr the Great reforms to catch up with European technology, or the communist's industrialization and Stalin's preparation for the second world war. So as soon as it becomes an accepted fact among western elites that the peak oil is the reality I'd expect that our rulers will fast catch up to it and begin some preparations. And general public will have no say in it, may be it would resist a bit, but not much. <br><br>Concerning the preparations, I can't know whether they are concious or not. Some of them, for sure, are dictated by geography and resources. And looking at part of them I wonder whether someone at the top understands what is going on.<br><br>I'll try to compile a short list.<br><br>1. Everything possible is done to extend the existing energy sources: Arctic exploration for oil and gas, nuclear stations building, gasification of countryside (I mean pipe gasification). There is also special prises equal to Nobel prize in money for scientific discoveries in the energy field.<br><br>2. Infrastructure that is built can easily last without oil. Cities are small, because it is too cold and central heating is economically viable. Villages are mostly gasified. Public transport can bring me to any part of a million people city in an hour. I have three shops, 4 schools in 10 minutes walk, and it is cimilar everywhere in Russia.<br>New electrified railroads are built, the old are well-maintained, IMO it is due to weather and our culture, as we cannot build automobile roads that last more than 5 years without big holes in them.<br><br>3. People are well able to look for themselves. Almost everyone has an organic garden outside of the city. Anyone who is older than 18 has experience in gardening, though it strted to change about 13 years ago.<br>This tradition comes from USSR, when the shops were empty and people had to grow and conserve a significant part of their food.<br><br>4. A push for conservation is recently initiated by the goverment, though I think it is due to high energy prices on the export market, and they want to make more money. Anyway the net result is that people have to conserve energy more.<br><br>5. There is no significant believe in high-tech as we are quite below the rest of the world in it. On the other hand we have pretty solid basic tech.<br><br>6. The population is not oversized. In 1812 Russia population was 40 millions, nowadays it is only 140 millions and growing slowly. We had several population reductions in the last century.<br>Carrying capacity is about 500 millions.<br><br>7. Add the fact that Russia NEVER lived better than now and has a potential to grow and solid military to protect itself.<br><br>I even can't tell what we can do more to make the transition to post industrial world more smooth. The only question for me what it will look like here. Is it possible to retain some electricity by using hydro? What about computers? <br>But all this question will become actual in 40 years or more. <br><br>Best regards<br>Alexey<br><br><a href=#c6932477561814216276 title="comment permalink">2/3/14, 8:27 AM</a><br><br>

There are benefits--fewer resources towards housing, etc. There are also downsides: One adult family member firmly believes in climate change and peak oil, but also believes there is no point in making any change unless it is government mandated for all. Another adult family member believes that whatever the future may hold, it would be morally wrong to deny the youngest generation any modern opportunities. The third adult family member believes that science and technology will overcome all. I'm adult number four. The younger generation, of course, sides with adults #2 and #3, because gardening, chopping wood, and livestock are work, though their opinions count for little, being children, but I'm still out-numbered 3-1.

It might be me, it might be imagination, but I feel like <br><br>crashing through open doors in discussions with many people like this lately. It feels almost scary. I have a couple of people in big accounting, big insurance, engineering, and research turn quite a bit recently.<br><br>I am still very much bargaining though - and I really only come up with lots of possible transition techs. I think that is some degree due to the fact that I spent most of my time in increasingly large and expensive cities. <br><br>I think I like to overthink things ;). Like GreenEngineer, I am not yet decided. My vision of the future consists mostly of error bars and only very, very oil. I am more than a little torn on the question of industrial civ. I have been on the fringes of LENR, I have friends in hot fusion, used to be in high end (nano)materials, worked with big and small industry, flew around and lived on different continents. At least I never had a car. And in private life I try to watch my footprint (regenerative home electricity, minimal meat, cycling, banking coop, buying used, lubricating dry bikes, advertising for green wizards, etc.) . But I have a couple of friends who opted out with all but their small toe. I'm not sure I want to trade place (yet). I do respect these people as I often am on their end of the spectrum in my work environment - and know what an emotional uphill battle this is in most cases. And many of the "opt outs" have more brains and pluck than me. This also tells me where this show is heading... and what to expect if "they do think of something". <br><br>At the moment though it feels like there's still the "inverse Kickstarter" logic at play. When you betray the narrative you get a kick in the gut and not a pad on the shoulder. Often the new company can make up for that, but it is currently not enough of an incentive for me. (Also because I can enjoy it here (with some nagging guilt) without having to commit - thanks to all you).<br><br>Now I am thinking seriously of ways to fix that, and if ever 1/5 random persons don't ridicule this outright - I may decide it is time to jump. <br><br>I think most people here agree that the problem is as much technical as it is social/psychological. Trying to fix one part only won't keep it from crashing, it may not even be a good idea. It may be time for LESS and more mud, sweat, and tears...<br><br><a href=#c4306483378267034091 title="comment permalink">2/3/14, 1:19 PM</a><br><br>

Nuclear power <br>The popular narrative about Chernobyl in the Germany used to be:<br>"Ah those simple Russians! What would you expect when you give peasants and communists real power..." I assume this was largely driven by the psychological need to belittle their technology as to feel somewhat more safe in view of their superior military capability.<br><br>After the end of the Cold War of course no one saw a need to amend the narrative.<br><br>When Fukushima happened it was different. I had opportunity to get lots of fresh rationalizations when distributed a good portion of all the greenpeace flyers I had "raided" (another story) on that Saturday. Already the third person I met was memorable: A dude who looked more than a little shady from a mainstream perspective (slightly soiled, smell of alcohol, long hair, matching female companion). I like to make a point of involving these people as well, and in my experience if you go in a little up-beat and try to be natural, it is more fun than the average. So I start talking and after half a sentence this guy really pulls together and says: "Well you know this can't happen here, don't you? It is impossible! We don't have tsunamis and earthquakes. And I know this for sure - I am technician in the nuclear power plant!" I was flabbergasted. The river it is built on does often jumps the banks and floods parts of the metropolis. And of course nothing could ever, ever go wrong in Germany (keywords: Elbmarsch leukemia cluster).<br>Anyway, after a while enough (and the right) Germans decided that the Japanese were more like them, and not like those Russians.<br><br>The Russians may not have been doing things responsibly at all times, I agree - BUT: they sure were capable. They were actually in the process of working on safety procedures while it happened. I only learned that a few weeks ago. Now my impression is that they were desperate, not wantonly negligent (maybe both).<br>And where does that put us if we ramp up production at a breakneck rate? Why do I keep getting these unreflected "Nuclear is only so expensive because of all the regulations!" comments from people? <br><br>Then there's the waste storage and central energy mafopoly issues that aren't minor (or unrelated). I recently heard of the "subduction zone waste fix" does anyone have pointers on that? It sounds appealing but I'm sceptical.<br><br><a href=#c6417723455274190163 title="comment permalink">2/3/14, 2:29 PM</a><br><br>

It is only distributed unevenly." I would like to add: "It also sneaks up on you from behind". <br>While I was still sceptically pondering JMGs nuclear wasteland scenarios - and more than half didn't want to believe it - I was living in one. Granted it can be worse and more clearly cut results, but I imagine when people "live closer to earth (and cooling water)" it will be worse.<br><br>How much can we trust that they will setup some fund to fix the problems AFTER the money stops flowing - if we can't get more then a "recursive tomorrow" and denial out of them today?<br><br><br>And one more on "They will think of something":<br>They did think of something: 2008, GS, the best and the brightest...<br>Oh, you wanna double the bet and do one more very last round?

Take my lathe, for example. It consists of some 300 lb. of mostly iron pieces, not much different from what you can see in a museum of 19th century machinery. But it's ordinarily operated on electricity, instead of a power shaft in the ceiling (which in turn could be run from a steam engine or water wheel). Without the electricity, it can be cranked by hand at perhaps 2-10% of its nominal productivity. But if I had to manufacture any of the items that a lathe can do, without the big chunks of iron, I just can't imagine it. Cutting a thread on a bolt? Cutting a thread to make a tap for threading the hole that a bolt goes into? Turning a shaft to hold a gear to make a clock? Turning a roller to wring out clothes? Before I tried any of those with hand tools, I'd try to rebuild the lathe. I suppose that we may have pockets of industry around sites with hydro or wind power, or plentiful sunshine. The rest of us will probably be busy with agriculture farther up the watershed. Or cranking rehumanized machinery with carbohydrate fueled "motors".<br><br>(By the way, it's an "old school" hobby shop here, without digital measuring devices or computerized control.)<br><br>I'll still need a bit of lubricating oil from time to time to keep the iron gears from wearing down. Maybe I can lube it with refined animal fat?<br><br>It might be the same way with transistors (or TUBES, if you must). An island of semiconductor technology could provide parts for a large area. (I've recently acquired a small book: "Instruments of Amplification" which describes several ways to amplify electrical signals with devices constructed from household materials. Not to be too critical of an earnest effort, but I'm mildly disappointed with it.)<br><br><a href=#c3479702356708111455 title="comment permalink">2/3/14, 6:27 PM</a><br><br>

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to make it brief, so here goes!<br><br>The idea of rehumanization as you present it makes sense when it's a voluntary and limited response to the need to create employment.<br><br>My observation is that the upslope of the fossil fuel revolution permitted a generally higher standard of living for inhabitants of industrial society, first through mechanization (replacement of raw human and animal power with mechanical power) then automation (replacement of semi-skilled labour with artificially skilled mechanized power). A fringe benefit was the decrease in infant mortality and increase in crop yields, yielding a ballooning human population.<br><br>At the same time, government and industry fostered an educational system that produced a suitable consumer/work force, first at a level adequate to follow instructions in the factory, later at a level adequate to participate in a knowledge/information/consumption economy - without being educated enough to recognize the trap and formulate a possibly revolutionary or violent response to the manipulation.<br><br>The end result is a planet stuffed with too many people, with too few practical skills, to all find meaningful and well-paying-enough employment to support themselves and their families. Not just in a western-lifestyle level of comfort, but a hand-to-mouth not-going-to-starve-this-winter level of survival.<br><br>I fear the reality for a majority of the erstwhile middle-class folk who are now watching the American Dream spiral down the drain will be something akin to a medieval peasant's existence - hard work from sun-up to sundown, little in the way of food or fun, and most of one's life spent within a few kilometres of the hovel they call home.<br><br>I think too many in the Peak Oil/Transition/Resilience community envision post-industrial life to be a bucolic eco-farming holiday, where free from the drudgery of commuting, working in a cubicle, and wasting weekends shopping at Wal-Mart, they'll stroll out to the garden, pick a few cucumbers and tomatoes, wash 'em up for lunch and spend the afternoon tinkering with a ham radio. <br><br>Once we're well and truly sliding down the far side of the fossil fuel slope, and all that automation and mechanization starts to fail, or ends up reserved for the wealthy who can still afford it, there are going to be an awful lof of surplus people with not much to offer beyond the strength of their backs.<br><br>Of course, that will play well when globalization runs out of fuel (literally, once the freighters can no longer move goods from China to markets in the west), as it will give governments and industry a ready supply of cheap, pliant labour to till the farms, sweep the streets and carry the paving stones.<br><br>That's supposing enough materials to feed, clothe and shelter can be found or reclaimed - even if there are plenty of willing workers available to perform the scut work needed to replace the present output of mechanization and automation, will there be anything for them to work with?<br><br>It's been said that modern democracy is also a by-product of the industrial revolution - how far will civil liberties stretch once the choice between feeding one's family and starvation is a simple surrender of the right to vote?<br><br>I hope I am wrong, but I'm pretty pragmatic about basic human nature. Just look around at some of the less industrialized corners of the world - that could be the future our grand-children will inherit.<br><br>So I'll challenge you to rebut my rather bleak take on rehumanization in a future post - how can we maintain democracy and civil rights in a world with too few resources and too many people?<br><br><a href=#c8230143871284237181 title="comment permalink">2/3/14, 10:51 PM</a><br><br>

I keep thinking that it's winter, and I DO have the time, but this winter, like last winter, is simply not working out that way.<br><br>Yet I'll reiterate that moral arguments are the only arguments that work and what's fascinating about recent research is how moral arguments have been reframed in order to be effective. Understand that these arguments in the U.S. do not work currently because they're framed from a moral viewpoint (the Christian right) that does not reflect the moral viewpoint of the society as a whole. What is fascinating about population reduction measures in the world at large is how different cultures have managed to reframe the argument so that population reduction actually matches moral values already held by the population at large. And that's an amazing insight we (the U.S.) could learn from... because no one wants someone else's morality shoved down their throat. This is obviously something you're already aware of, given some of your insights on this blog over the past few years, most recently in encouraging an effort to use "fracking" as a curse word.<br><br>@Cherokee (Chris)... you are absolutely correct in what you say. I can't go into details about my own situation (I'm a writer, and I've promised my children not to write publicly about things they might not approve), but let's just say I'm 51 with no uterus, and my children put me at replacement level. (That's only if you count the children I gave birth to - I don't. I have a vast "expanded" family I claim as children, including several I did not birth nor raise.) Had I been more in tune with reality during my childbearing years, I probably wouldn't have had ANY children. That said, not having children (for women) requires ready access to birth control or abortion, given that abstinence requires a compliant partner. And all three of those require a culture that values at least one of the three. Which brings me back to the observation that some cultures today have managed to expand their mores to include one or more of those, in ways I find fascinating. (By the way... we have had a mild winter so far, for the most part, where I live, though currently temps are about 3 degrees F outside with wind chills up to 25 below. But last summer, while nowhere near your temps, we had several weeks of over 100 degrees, which is really not normal. I feel for your situation. What do you do to keep your chickens cool?)<br><br>JMG, I love history and tend to think of myself as fairly analytical ... and one of your statements just blew me out of the water - that America was founded by religious fanatics, which effects the structure of our culture. That's a bit of a "well, duh," statement, yet I have struggled with understanding how fanatical our country has become. Of course, it has always been that way, but for some reason I had blinders to that fact. Sometimes my own ignorance just amazes me.<br><br>Finally... let's hear it for multi-generational living. Both my mother and my oldest living brother live with me, and my oldest daughter and I are trying to figure out how she and her family can live on this property as well. Given the benefits, it has always surprised me how few people with the immediate ability to do this choose not to.<br><br>Trish<br><br><a href=#c1312243908650684250 title="comment permalink">2/4/14, 4:55 PM</a><br><br>

Given the speed of decline I expect, anything more drastic than that shouldn't be necessary in my lifetime. <br><br>Joseph, my take is that America borrowed its stabilizing measures from a slightly different kind of socialism -- the kind with "national" tacked in front of it. More on this in an upcoming post...<br><br>Steve, true enough. That's one of the reasons I'm suggesting that people focus on getting through the learning curve on useful skills right now; it's easier to talk people into doing that. <br><br>Dltrammel, please do ask everyone to post something here as well as on the forum!<br><br>Dagnarus, there's a difference between bargaining as an attempt to evade mortality -- "Look, I'll give up cigarettes if that'll make her recover" -- and the process of adjusting to reality after you've accepted it -- "she's dead, I don't think I'll ever stop grieving, but I still have the rest of my life to live; what should I do with it?"<br><br>Alexey, I have no doubt the Russian people will survive; they always do. There's a reason why I had Russia be one of the few European countries that wasn't conquered by the Arabs in my future-history novel <i>Star's Reach</i>! The question in my mind is whether enough will be done soon enough to maintain any kind of industrial system well into the stage of scarcity industrialism, and to my mind, that's an open question.<br><br><a href=#c2658862755239349867 title="comment permalink">2/4/14, 7:37 PM</a><br><br>

Dissensus rules...<br><br>Philip, the best I'm hoping to achieve is the preservation of the ideas of democracy, and maybe some communities that practice it, as we go tobogganing down the slope of the Long Descent. That's a question I'll be dealing with in a future series of posts, though. <br><br>Joseph, got it. <br><br>Marian, er, if you want a response it's a good idea to include your email address in a not-for-posting comment, or to put something through to post so I can respond to it here.

(Hint: not enough to make a measurable blip in the statistics.) How many wars have been stopped by moral appeals? I could go on at quite some length with further examples. As a means of shaping human behavior, moral appeals are pitifully weak, because -- as I commented earlier -- they only work with people who already agree with you. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c1808996881344051235 title="comment permalink">2/4/14, 7:47 PM</a><br><br>

I could not understand how she could possibly have used so much electricity."</em><br><br>Oh, consider a couple of space heaters, left to run day and night. Consider an electric hot water heater or two, set as high as it will go so the twice-a-week washing and daily dishwasher loads will be "sparkling clean". The house might be larger than needed, and unused rooms left heated. There might be lots of gorgeous windows, without adequate thought to heat loss. Consider the roof might be supersized, and not necessarily well insulated. And there goes the electricity bill. Buying an expensive house doesn't mean the builder didn't cut lots of corners.<br><br>When I lived in Aurora, CO, the previous owner had installed a Glow-Core heated water loop -- a common "furnace" using butane in the garage, piping water to both the central heat and water tank to maintain needed temps. The chimney was common garden variety PVC, about 1 1/2 inch, schedule 40. I filled the tank a couple times a year, maybe $700 a winter -- and my neighbors were running $400-$500 a month in similar all-electric ranch style homes.<br><br>@ Roger 1:29,<br><br>You said <em>"Productive capacity that was offshored to China by American CEOs for the purpose of filling their own pockets . ."</em><br><br>I think there are two sides to every story. At one point, the US government was subsidizing work pushed over to China to "improve relations" between the countries -- to put enough money in Chinese pockets that they would buy whatever American goods might still be made here. The other thought that occurs to me, is that the US government has systematically penalized American businesses for doing business here, with taxes and punitive regulations, including minimum wage, ObamaCare (ClusterCare?), zoning, and other issues, to satisfy special interests.<br><br>Then there are the labor unions, striving mightily to make sure they scavenge all they can from whatever business the employer conducts. Which, again, punishes the employer/corporation for doing business in America. <br><br>I have a web client wanting a particular tool made, relatively low tech -- but no one will step up to make it here. He wants 1,000 units, and no one can afford to tool up to make it, or fit it into a large manufacturing setup for that small a run. We lost a *lot* of skills and ability to work. Everything is now "toxic", and over-regulated -- and much of our workforce has been laid off so long few of the workers are actually available any longer.<br><br>As for corporate officers lining their pockets -- most make a bonus for any venture they kick off. If American communities and workforces could be counted on to meet promised performance and cost goals, hey, those same officers would be making their money putting Americans to work. With our courts, our plethora of attorneys and litigating special interests, our labor unions and other meddlers, I don't see a big reason to blame anyone for looking around for a better answer.<br><br>The fact that we need work and paid workers doesn't matter much if employers don't see us as an attractive and reliable potential workforce, in a regulatorily and economically stable and reliable business environment.<br><br><a href=#c5333503747588598588 title="comment permalink">2/4/14, 11:36 PM</a><br><br>

I have gone through overwhelming personal grief in my life, but not about our industrial base. For the latter I just got scared when I thought that supply lines could wither away, and what that could mean for looking after people. But I have memories of being an infant in a war zone in WWII, and how people managed to pull together, and get the weak to pull as well. And decent key men and women took over the rules and made them work. I do not envy our parents their responsibility, but they did alright.<br><br>And I am rather keen on rails (smile) to run cargo on - from canal to canal if necessary. Back in the day early coal was taken out of the Durham coalfield (England) on wooden rails before there were steam engines. Mining on the grand scale was not as it turns out a good idea, but stand back a bit, trade and different bulk cargoes can secure a lot of villages and small towns if they get their act together.<br><br>best<br>Phil<br>PS Like Alan, I had my moment of clarity and used to make a joke of it just after President Carter was taken off-line. I formed the opinion that there was no possible way a majority of the world’s people could become North Americans, whether or not they aspired to that condition. I used the phrase “the globe would go pop”. It was similarly ludicrous to pretend that resources could remotely extend that far.<br>PPS I finally gave up smoking when our son was born. (I should have done it earlier – we had already a 3 year old daughter). And that was a thoroughly educational experience and still is. And the point was that preventing harm to his lungs was the ‘click’ point that got through to my simple-minded inner person(s).<br><br><br><a href=#c4033792147609493498 title="comment permalink">2/5/14, 2:39 AM</a><br><br>

Stay tuned!<br><br>Jeff, glad to hear it. <br><br>Alan, interesting. I certainly don't intend to dissuade you from your chosen strategy -- here as elsewhere, I remain convinced that dissensus is the best hope we've got -- but as I'm sure you've noticed, I'm focusing on a different mode of mitigation, starting with the individual. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, as I see it, we're talking about the art of persuasion -- one person trying to convince another to do, or not do, something in particular. Moral appeals are attempts at persuasion that amount to "Do this because it's morally right." If you and the person you're trying to persuade share a strong religious faith, that has serious force, because then it generally translates as "Do this because otherwise God will hurl you into the flames of eternal damnation." If you and the person you're trying to persuade have strongly held values in common, then it still has some force, because it amounts to "Do this because then you'll feel really good about yourself." If you and the person you're trying to convince don't have strong religious or ethical beliefs in common, though, a moral appeal amounts to "Do this because I think you should," and that's the weakest possible argument. <br><br>I should probably do a post about this one of these days. What I call Yotta language -- "yotta do this, yotta do that" -- is as common as mule poop alongside an old-time canal these days, and considerably less useful. <br><br>Phil, I adore rail travel. I would love to see a massive program of rebuilding railroads all over the US, passenger service to every town, the whole nine yards. I'm also pretty sure that the US no longer has access to the resources for such a program, or even a much smaller one, and the political will to do anything at all went missing in action in 1982 or so and has never been seen since. That's why I focus on what individuals, families, and local communities can do for themselves, with what they have on hand, right now. <br><br>Marcello, no question, it would be difficult. A mad dictator might be able to pull the thing off, and so would a mass religious movement; still, the door's not utterly closed everywhere in the world. Mind you, I think the chances are somewhere between miniscule and subatomic, but that's another matter.<br><br><a href=#c2876523117893057266 title="comment permalink">2/5/14, 11:57 AM</a><br><br>

Tranquility, I would be very, very interested if you would post links to the research you mentioned.<br><br>My own take on behaviour is that it is large shaped by our physical context, to a lesser extent by our social systems and almost not at all by conscious control. I give a handy diagram in this article.<br><br><a href=http://www.smallanddeliciouslife.com/compassionate_systems/ rel=nofollow>Compassionate Systems</a><br><br>However, I recently began wondering about morality again. Haidt uses the metaphor of the elephant and the rider. The rider has a few small tools to try to leverage against the elephant, as does our conscious mind with our massively more powerful subconscious. <br><br>So, morality fails because we can't expect it to alter the 99% of our behaviour. But what if it is the right tool to steer the elephant? This gives us morality based social systems such as medicare, welfare and workplace safety codes. These only work because they have become the system--they would abjectly fail if they were enacted on a highly-attention-demanding case-by-case basis.<br><br>I think most of the big problems we face today are moral problems; they are different possible reactions to a situation. Oil is not the problem, our reaction to the constraint of oil is the problem. I would prefer to react in a way that leaves room for a healthy ecosphere and greater equity between humans--but that is a moral choice. Others may choose to react with armies, and I think that is a moral choice as well.<br><br>Now, as JMG points out, there is a high failure rate--just look at the rate of pregnancies out of wedlock for Catholics and Mormons. But I wonder if this is a case of confusing the planes, as JMG might say.<br><br>So, science is good to answer one question and spirituality is good to answer another, and you should never confuse the two. I am bending my brain trying to understand if there are problems that must be treated as moral problems because they <i>are</i> moral problems.<br><br><a href=#c2553126790353458958 title="comment permalink">2/5/14, 1:15 PM</a><br><br>
