<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week’s discussion of failed predictions in the peak oil movement inevitably touched on the latest round of claims that the world as we know it is going to come to a full stop sometime very soon. That was inevitable partly because these claims account for a fairly large fraction of the predictions made by peak oil writers each year, and partly because those same claims flop so reliably. Still, there’s another factor, which is that this sort of apocalypse fandom has become increasingly popular of late—as well as increasingly detached from the world the rest of us inhabit. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Late last year, for example, I was contacted by a person who claimed to be a media professional and wanted to consult with me about an apocalypse-themed video he was preparing to make. As I think most of my readers know, I make my living as a writer, editor, and occasional consultant, and so—as one professional to another—my wife, who is also my business manager, sent him back a polite note asking what sort of time commitment he was interested in and how much he was offering to pay. We got back a tirade accusing me of being too cheap to save the world, followed not long thereafter by another email in which he insisted that he couldn’t afford to pay anyone because his project would inevitably be the least popular video in history; after all, he claimed, nobody wants to hear about how the world as we know it is about to crash into ruin. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was when I sat back on the couch and very nearly laughed myself into hiccups, because there’s nothing Americans like better than a good loud prediction of imminent doom. From Jonathan Edwards’ famous 1741 sermon “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” right through to today’s zombie apocalypse craze, a good number of the biggest pop-culture phenomena in American history have focused on the end of the world in one way or another. A first-rate example is the 2012 furore, which turned a nonexistent Mayan prophecy of doom into one of the most successful media cash cows in recent times. I can testify from personal experience that toward the end of the last decade, every publisher I know of with a presence in the New Age market was soliciting 2012-themed books from all their regular authors because that was the hottest market going. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The 2012 prophecy may have been a predictive failure, in other words, but it was a whopping financial success. With that in mind, among other things, I predicted shortly after December 21, 2012 that a new date for the end of everything would soon be selected, and would promptly attract the same enthusiasm as its predecessor. As noted in <a href=../../2013/05/the-pleasures-of-extinction.html>a post last May</a>, that was one of my more successful predictions; the new date is 2030, and it’s already picking up the same eager attention that made 2012 such a lucrative gimmick. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the great innovations of the runup to 2012, which will probably continue to shape apocalyptic fads for some time to come, is that you don’t actually have to propose a specific mechanism of doom; all you need is a date. The architect of the 2012 phenomenon, the late Jose Arguelles, seems to have been the marketing genius who first realized this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His 1984 book <i>The Mayan Factor</i>, which launched the furore on its way, insisted that something really, truly amazing was going to happen on December 21, 2012, without offering more than vague hints about what that amazing event might be. Those who piled onto the bandwagon he set in motion more than made up for Arguelles’ reticence, coming up with a flurry of predictions about what was going to happen on that day. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It didn’t matter that most of these predictions contradicted one another, and none of them rested on any logic more solid than, hey, we know something amazing is going to happen on that day, so here’s some speculation, with or without cherrypicked data, about what the amazing event might be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The pileup of predictions, all by itself, made the date itself sound more convincing to a great many people. Far from incidentally, it also offered believers a convenient source of shelter from skepticism:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>if a nonbeliever succeeded in disproving a hundred different claims about what was supposed to happen on the big day, a hundred and first claim would inevitably pop up as soon as he turned his back, so that the believers could keep on believing that the world as we know it was indeed going to end as scheduled. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same logic is already being deployed with equal verve on behalf of a 2030 doomsday. So far, without making any particular effort to find them, I’ve fielded claims that on or by that year, global warming will spin out of control, driving humanity into extinction; oceanic acidification will kill off all the phytoplankton, crashing oxygen levels in the atmosphere and driving humanity into extinction; the supervolcano underneath Yellowstone Park will erupt, plunging the planet into a volcanic winter and driving humanity into extinction; an asteroid will come spinning out of space and driving humanity into extinction, and so on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I haven’t yet seen anyone proclaim that 2030 will see the Earth swallowed whole by a gigantic space walrus with photon flippers, but no doubt it’s simply a matter of time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course it’s possible to raise hard questions about each of these claims—well, in fact, it’s more than possible, it’s easy, since none of them rely on more than a few fringe studies on the far end of scientific opinion, if that, and most of them quietly ignore the fact that greenhouse-gas spikes, oceanic acidification, and nearly everything else but the aforementioned space walrus have occurred before in the planet’s history without producing the results that are being expected from them this time around. I’ll be taking the time to raise some of those questions, and offer some answers for them grounded in solid science, in a series of posts I’ll start later this year. Still, fans and promoters of the 2030 fad have nothing to fear from such exercises; like the legendary hydra, a good apocalypse fad can sprout additional heads at will to replace those that are chopped off by critics. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus it’s pretty much baked into the cake at this point that 2030 will be the new 2012, and that we can count on another sixteen years of increasingly overheated claims clustering around that date before it, too, slips by and a new date has to be found.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>We’ll be discussing the trajectory of the resulting furore from time to time on this blog, if only because there’s a certain wry amusement to be gained from watching people make epic fools of themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, the point I want to raise this week is a little different. Granted that apocalypse fandom is an enduring feature of American pop culture, that very few people ever lost money or failed to attract an audience by insisting that the end is nigh, that a huge and well-oiled marketing machine lost its cash cow when 2012 passed without incident and thus has every reason to pile into the next apocalypse fad with redoubled enthusiasm: even so, why should fantasies of imminent doom attract so much larger an audience now than ever before, and play so much more central a role in the contemporary imagination of the future? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are, as I see it, at least four factors involved. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first is a habit of collective thought I spent much of last year discussing—the widespread popular conviction, amounting to religious faith, that today’s industrial civilization is an unstoppable juggernaut that will keep rolling onwards forever unless some even more gargantuan catastrophe mashes it flat to the dust. That conviction, as I’ve noted in previous posts, is not confined to those who are cheering the march of progress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Plenty of people who claim that they hate industrial civilization and all its works are as convinced as any cornucopian that it’s certain to keep moving along its current trajectory, until it finally vanishes on the horizon of whatever grand or dreadful destiny it’s supposed to have this week. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As a heretic and a dissenter from<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>that secular faith, I’ve repeatedly watched otherwise thoughtful people engage in the most spectacular mental backflips to avoid noticing that perpetual progress and overnight annihilation aren’t the only possible futures for the modern industrial world. What’s more, a great many people seem to be getting more fervent in their faith in progress, not less so, as the onward march of progress just mentioned shows increasing signs of grinding to a halt. That’s a common feature in social psychology; it’s precisely when a popular belief system starts failing to explain everyday experiences that people get most passionate about treating it as unquestionable fact and shouting down those who challenge it. Believing that our civilization and our species will be gone by 2030 feeds into this, since that belief makes it much easier to brush aside the uncomfortable awareness that progress is over and faith in industrial society’s omnipotence has turned out to be utterly misplaced. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s one reason why apocalyptic fantasies are so popular these days. A second reason, which I’ve also discussed at some length in this blog, is the role such fantasies have in justifying inaction, when action involves significant personal costs. One of the hard facts of our present predicament is that the steps that have to be taken to get ready for the future bearing down on us all require letting go of the privileges and perquisites that most Americans consider theirs by right. A few years ago, I coined the acronym LESS—Less Energy, Stuff, and Stimulation—to summarize the changes that we’re all going to have to make as things proceed, and began pointing out that any response to our predicament that doesn’t start with using LESS simply isn’t serious. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m pleased to say that a certain fraction of my readers have taken that advice seriously, and tackled the uncomfortable job of downsizing their dependence on the absurd amounts of energy, stuff, and artificial stimulation that are involved in an ordinary American lifestyle these days. I’m equally pleased to say that an even larger number of people who don’t read <i>The Archdruid Report</i> and don’t know me from Hu Gadarn’s off ox have gotten to work doing the same thing. Those people are going to be in a much better position not merely to weather the crises ahead, but to help their loved ones, friends and neighbors do the same thing, and potentially also contribute to the preservation of the more useful achievements of the last few centuries. Still, it’s hard work, and it also requires a willingness to step outside the conventional wisdom of our society, which claims to be open to new and innovative ideas but in practice tolerates only endless rehashings of the same old notions.<i><i> </i></i></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Inevitably, a good many people who sense the necessity of change won’t act on that awareness because they realize the personal costs involved. Fantasies of imminent doom provide an escape hatch from the resulting cognitive dissonance. If the world is going to crash into ruin soon anyway, the reasoning runs, it’s easy to excuse further wallowing in the benefits the American system currently gives to its more privileged inmates, and any remaining sense that something is wrong can be redirected onto whatever cataclysm du jour the true believer in apocalypse happens to fancy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Believing that the end is nigh thus allows people to have their planet and eat it too—or, more to the point, to convince themselves that they can keep on chomping away on what’s left of the planet for just a little while longer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The third factor, which relates to the second one, unfolds from the historical tragedy of the Baby Boom generation, which is massively overrepresented in apocalypse fandom just now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The Boomers were among the most idealistic generations in US history, but they were also far and away the most privileged, and the conflict between those two influences has defined much of their trajectory through time. Starting when the Sixties youth culture crashed and burned, the Boomers have repeatedly faced forced choices between their ideals and their privileges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Each time, the majority of Boomers—there have always been noble exceptions—chose to cling to their privileges, and then spent the next decade or so insisting at the top of their lungs that their ideals hadn’t been compromised by that choice. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus the early 1970s were enlivened by the loud insistence of former hippies, as they cut their hair and donned office clothing to take up the corporate jobs they’d vowed never to accept, that they were going to change the system from within. (Even at the time, that was generally recognized as a copout, but it was a convenient one and saw plenty of use.) By the 1980s, many of these same former hippies were quietly voting for Ronald Reagan and his allies because the financial benefits of Reagan’s borrow-and-spend policies were just too tempting to pass up, though they insisted all the while that they would put part of the windfall into worthy causes. Rinse and repeat, and today you’ve got people who used to be in the environmental movement pimping for nuclear power and GMOs, because the conserver lifestyles they were praising to the skies forty years ago have become unthinkable for them today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One consequence of these repeated evasions has been an ongoing drumbeat of books and other media proclaiming as loudly as possible that that the Baby Boom generation would change the world just by existing, without having to accept the hard work and sacrifices that changing the world actually entails. From 1972’s <i>The Greening of America</i> right on down to the present, this sort of literature has been lucrative and lavishly praised, but the great change never quite got around to happening and, as the Boomers head step by step toward history’s exit door, there’s no reason to think it ever will. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Perhaps the saddest of all these works came from the once-fiery pen of the late Theodore Roszak, whose 1969 book <i>The Making of a Counter Culture</i> played a significant role in shaping the Boomer generation’s self-image. His last book, <i>The Making of an Elder Culture</i>, expressed a wistful hope that once the Boomers retired, they would finally get around to fulfilling the expectations he’d loaded on them all those years ago. Of course they haven’t, and they won’t, because doing so would put their pensions and comfortable retirements at risk. <i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, that’s why the Age of Aquarius turned out to be a flash in the pan:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Let’s change the system, but keep the privileges we get from it” reliably works out in practice to “Let’s not change the system.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The expectation of imminent apocalypse is the despairing counterpoint to the literature just described. Instead of insisting that the world would shortly become Utopia (and no action on the part of Boomers is needed to cause this), it insists that the world will shortly become the opposite of Utopia (and no action on the part of Boomers is capable of preventing this). This serves the purpose of legitimizing inaction at a time when action would involve serious personal costs, but there’s more to it than that; it also feeds into the Boomer habit of insisting on the cosmic importance of their own experiences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just as normal adolescent unruliness got redefined in Boomer eyes as a revolution that was going to change the world, the ordinary experience of approaching mortality is being redefined as the end of everything—after all, the universe can’t just go on existing after the Boomers are gone, can it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It’s thus surely no accident that 2030 is about the time the middle of the Baby Boom generation will be approaching the end of its statistically likely lifespan. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The three factors just listed all have a major role in fostering the apocalypse fandom that plays so large a part in today’s popular culture and collective imagination. Still, I’ve come to think that a fourth factor may actually be the most significant of all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To grasp that fourth factor, I’d like to encourage my readers to engage in a brief thought experiment. Most people these days have noticed that for the last decade or so, each passing year has seen a broad worsening of conditions on a great many fronts. Here in America, certainly, jobs are becoming scarcer, and decent jobs with decent pay scarcer still, while costs for education, health care, and scores of other basic social goods are climbing steadily out of reach of an ever-larger fraction of the population.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>State and local governments are becoming less and less able to provide even essential services, while the federal government sinks ever further into partisan gridlock and bureaucratic paralysis, punctuated by outbursts of ineffectual violence flung petulantly outward at an ever more hostile world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The human and financial toll of natural disasters keeps going up while the capacity to do anything about the consequences keeps going down—and all the while, resource depletion and environmental disruption impose a rising toll on every human activity. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the shape of the recent past. The thought experiment I’d like to recommend to my readers is to imagine that things just keep going the same way, year after year, decade after decade, without any of the breakthroughs or breakdowns in which so many of us like to put our faith. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Imagine a future in which all the trends I’ve just sketched out just keep on getting worse, a tunnel growing slowly darker without any light at the far end—not even the lamp of an oncoming train. More to the point, imagine that this is <i>your</i> future: that you, personally, will have to meet ever-increasing costs with an income that has less purchasing power each year; that you will spend each year you still have left as an employee hoping that it won’t be your job’s turn to go away forever, until that finally happens; that you will have to figure out how to cope as health care and dozens of other basic goods and services stop being available at a price you can afford, or at any price at all; that you will spend the rest of your life in the conditions I’ve just sketched out, and know as you die that the challenges waiting for your grandchildren will be quite a bit worse than the ones you faced. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve found that most people these days, asked to imagine such a future, will flatly refuse to do it, and get furiously angry if pressed on the topic. I want to encourage my readers to push past that reaction, though, and take a few minutes to imagine themselves, in detail, spending the rest of their lives in the conditions I’ve just outlined. Those who do that will realize something about apocalyptic fantasies that most believers in such fantasies never mention: even the gaudiest earth-splattering cataclysm is less frightening than the future I’ve described—and the future I’ve described, or one very like it, is where current trends driven by current choices are taking us at their own implacable pace. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
My guess is that that’s the most important factor behind the popularity of apocalyptic thinking these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>After so many promised breakthroughs have failed to materialize, cataclysmic mass death is the one option many people can still believe in that’s less frightening than the future toward which we’re actually headed, and which our choices and actions are helping to create. I suggest that this, more than anything else, is why 2030 is going to be the next 2012, why promoters of the it’s-all-over-in-2030 fad will find huge and eager audiences for their sales pitches, and why some other date will take 2030’s place in short order once the promised catastrophes fail to appear on schedule and the future nobody wants to think about continues to take shape around them. </div>

Though I am trying (despite the shouting screaming and general nuttiness around me) with the help of at least some people who have grasped our predicament and of course with the help of the weekly archdruid report.<br><br>That reminds me, its now just over a year since I started reading this blog. You have provided me with many astounding insights, many slaps in the face and many rather uncomfortable realities and of course many exciting realities too. I can only hope the direction I am learning off the Archdruid reports takes me somewhere useful. (if it hasn't already, at least partially as a result of reading this blog i have pulled out of fulltime academic education and reduced to part time while I figure out where else I can go with my life).<br><br>Being the children of the baby boomers we too are not encouraged to look too closely into our predicament. Instead, for the most part, we are loaded with student debt until it kills us (literally in some cases), while various media commentators decry the 'lazy, overprivilaged, its all about me generation' *ahem- projection much* because of course we are expected to do the same things as our parents- even when the jobs and money aren't available.<br><br>Anyway, that's my few solemn words from the younger generation. Good day to you all.<br><br>P.S: I am not American btw, I am a New Zealander.

First, on your prior supposition that the price of gas would fall as the economy grinds down, I have assumed that the military would requisition the remaining oil for themselves, so as to maintain "order" and their power.<br>Along with that is my nervousness about the trend toward oppression from our government. The idea is that they will suffer from overshoot and become ineffective, but can we count on that? What if they retain all the fuel for themselves they need?<br><br>When I ponder the probabilities of fast collapse versus slow collapse, I note that we live in a highly complex interdependent system that is therefore very brittle and it could domino, perhaps even from a natural disaster like a large solar flare as a big contribution, although that scenario also would make the govt less effective.<br><br>As for your thought experiment, I find that an optimistic scenario that I am preparing to deal with. I've been working toward greater self sufficiency, but recent life events have pushed me to go quite a bit faster. Now, I'm really thinking hard about how far I can go in disengaging from the need for a job and money. I don't expect to be completely free of it of course, but the fact is that my fears of losing that source gives me anxiety, and the thought of being poorer but more independent beckons me like a bell of freedom.<br><br><a href=#c1514195554492751092 title="comment permalink">1/8/14, 8:31 PM</a><br><br>

I would think something more concrete, like either 2029 or 2036, when the asteroid Apophis, aptly named after an Egyptian deity of destruction, would fly close enough to Earth to have a chance of colliding. Your explanation, though, makes sense given the narcissism of the Boomers.

Last month, Robert Krulwich at NPR turned Diamond's reading of Easter Island on its head in "What Happened On Easter Island — A New (Even Scarier) Scenario." His thesis was that the introduced rats slowly ravaged the island's endemic ecosystem. While that happened, the natives just muddled on through until they eventually were building gardens with rocks that caught the moisture that the trees had and then ate the rats, as there wasn't much else for meat, as all the rest of the animals had gone extinct with the rest of the original forest. Meanwhile, the people endured, worshiping their gods and coveting status objects in the midst of their ruin of an environment.<br><br>Krulwich found this alternative even more frightening.

Your earlier series on these themes really helped me break out of my attachment to the apocalypse fantasy of environmental doom. My attachment also highlighted another point you've made, though; when we look around at the very real destruction and environmental calamity around us, we don't have narratives OTHER than either doom or technology. Coming up with some new stories is so essential right now. I think this is one of the reasons your writing is so provocative. If we SEE climate change happening...then we MUST be headed for doom, right?! If we don't believe that we're headed for annihilation, then you MUST be denying climate change, right?! Any other story just does not compute.<br><br>Thanks to your earlier series, I was able to clear the veil of the fantasy and start to see the reality around me. Power rates increasing, transportation costs increasing, a new fuel surcharge on our local ferry system. At the same time, housing values are declining, which means taxes will rise to cover the budgets. Infrastructure costs go up, even while silly consumer goods get cheaper. Our central bank governor (Canada) recently publicly voiced the concerned mumblings about deflation that have been ciculating in the backrooms. He said so far we're only experiencing the "good" deflation(!) of retailers deeply discounting prices. No word on why they might be doing that and what that might mean for their businesses! <br><br>Meanwhile, our local shellfish industry is suffering because seed stock for our oysters can't grow in our acidified inlets, and all of us are experiencing weather patterns that are raising anxiety levels...<br><br>In other words, there is no "future" apocalypse. We're living it NOW. Perhaps in slow motion.<br><br>In a conversation with a friend last year, we walked ourselves through the usual scenarios of "what can we do?" In the end, we came to, well, if things get really bad where we are, we do what all people have done since the beginning of time: move, as refugees, to wherever there might be hope, with whatever we can carry, and potentially die along the way.<br><br>In other words, we will behave as millions TODAY are already behaving. I think you're on to something with our privileged, "but WE'RE special!" thinking also contributing to the "going out with a bang" dream...<br><br><a href=#c808530484741219739 title="comment permalink">1/8/14, 8:35 PM</a><br><br>

I can't help but feel that the last two answer directly a few questions I recently posed to you, though I'm sure it's just that I ask the same questions as everyone else. I may not always reply, but I still read every week and dwell on what you cover (and I'm sure you are waiting by your keyboard with bated breath to hear what I have to say, no doubt!).<br><br>I certainly agree on the psychological attraction of apocalypse, especially when framed as it was in your fourth point. The idea of just "all the things decline forever" is troubling to the very heart of our culture. It basically undoes the narrative of America which, as far as I know, has been the same since the 16th century.<br><br>We were a land unexplored, with hidden riches to be found. Then we were the place where you could start over, then a city upon a hill, then a new experiment in human governance, then the men destined to rule the continent, then the place where the poor could become rich, then the heart of progress and industry, then the empirical heir to Rome and the UK, and on and on. The bright, shining future toward which we are inevitably fated to reach has changed, but the motion has not. Unlike every other major American cultural shift, you aren't changing the promised land; you're denying the journey.<br><br>That won't be accepted. I'm sure you know that. Perhaps that's the driving force behind a second religiosity; the narrative of empire fails materially, and so transforms into something new (which is also old).<br><br>I must admit that my personal view of the future lies somewhere between your fourth point here and the apocalypse narrative. Besides the purely religious notion I hold to of an inevitable end (a product of faith and not extrapolation of current forces), I don't foresee an extinction of mankind, nor a zombie apocalypse, nor anything else. The decline for the average person will continue unfailingly until we reach some new, simpler equilibrium.<br><br>Nevertheless the hiccups along the way are, I think, going to be perhaps more severe than at least the "softest" form of catabolic collapse. I don't think the cognitive dissonance now in play will go quietly into that good night. How can people who resolutely believe, even define themselves, by the myth of progress accept perpetual regress? They will break, even if only to fulfill their own (second-worst) fears of apocalypse.<br><br>And I think it will spread. As you've noted before, my generation (Millennial, or whatever less stupid label people care to use) has nothing to gain by sustaining the status quo. We want to see the world burn, or at least a reset, because we don't want to pay for the Boomers' twenty years of elderly windsurfing while we struggle to feed our kids. <br><br>We see that progress ain't happening, and I can't help feel that if things get much worse, our generation will snap, and people will start dying, and it won't stay here or there but rage across the entire West. We've seen the French riots, the British backlash to tuition hikes, Occupy, the Arab Spring, and much else besides, and these are just the first hiccups of something larger.<br><br>It's not the apocalypse. But it won't be slow suffering either, after that. It'll be blood and rapid decline. The only hope of avoiding it, I'd think, is the forecasted second religiosity. Give our generation something to believe in, and we just might stick it out. Just my two cents. Apologies, as always, for length!<br><br><a href=#c6310534582306128773 title="comment permalink">1/8/14, 9:10 PM</a><br><br>

I have been since I was rather young. I even got myself (for a time) into the zombie apocalypse camp. I believe that your use of the word "fantasy" sums it up nicely. It has been my experience that most people who subscribe to the zombie apocalypse scenario, which has evolved into a metaphor for sudden collapse, see it as a fantasy in which they get to live out their hollywood dreams of shooting people and not having to answer to some moralistic entity for it. Nowadays, in the survivalist scene, individuals who are unprepared for sudden collapse and who seek to take your carefully hoarded goods are called "zombies" which implies a rather sinister fate for such folks at the hands of those more prepared. I suspect I could write a paper on the concept. Be that as it may, it is an easy fantasy to find yourself in. We live in a culture of limited or non-existent social justice, war, unreason and power allocated to people who do not have our best interests in mind in any way. Those that do are drummed out of the corridors of political power rather efficiently if they get elected at all. People like the idea of a zombie apocalypse or a falling meteor or a sudden collapse of any kind because it also feeds the idea that they can take more immediate control over their own lives when a secular authority no longer prevents them from living their fantasy of a large farm and a trusty assault rifle, even if that life is difficult and fraught with danger. There is also what you mentioned in that people can use impending doom as an excuse not to have to stand in front of the Tiananmen Square Tanks of progress who will stop for no protestor. In their version of events, as essentially pointed out by yourself if I am interpreting correctly, there is no need to stand in front of those tanks when you can just let them run out of gas on their own? I have often found that people want to join their voice to large scale social justice causes without actually doing anything in their communities for much the same reason. In the end, when the cause fails to gain ground, they need not be held personally responsible for the failure where at a local level they might be pointed out as being another ring leader in a failed philosophical coup de tat. All of this of course going back to what you have been saying for some time, cognitive dissonance. Is it wrong to tell believers in infinite progress that they will only be correct if we get the aliens to begin trading technologies with us? I am sure they could use Preservative filled frozen dinners and Microwaves for those long space/inter-dimensional journeys in return for whatever powers their spacecraft...<br><br><a href=#c6068172253766588915 title="comment permalink">1/8/14, 9:30 PM</a><br><br>

I think Guy, if he indeed was the source I am thinking of, would likely say that it is not a hard and fast date or year but rather a rough estimate (-10 years + 20 years?) around which things might be rapidly accelerating as far as climate change and its impact goes. This is based on extrapolations and predictions of possible temperature increases from now till then based on various scientific sources. Although the earth has gone through rapid swings in average temperature in the distant past, it was not loaded with 7 billion humans entirely dependent on a efficient but non-robust technology-based system. although extinction (zero humans left) is highly unlikely, a large scale die-off is not out of the question in this century and possibly within the first 50 years.

Those living in Greece or Syria would certainly understand that the world has come to an abrupt end, at least their part in it. Meanwhile, countries around the world teeter on the edge of a knife: what will happen when China's massive, interconnected debts are recognized as un-collectible? China as a nation could break up into warring states, with famines, disease epidemics and banditry ... as occurred during the 19th and early 20th century. Nothing new has to be invented particular to China, only for it to revert to its past; and the Chinese can discover for themselves how edible gigantic concrete towers, steel mills and shipyards are. <br><br>So too, Japan, which could be rendered largely uninhabitable by another large earthquake: with 51 reactors lurking like ticking time bombs and thousands of tons of nuclear fuel -- much of it plutonium -- the outright chance of a catastrophic event is greater than nil. Neither is the chance of a nuclear exchange, if not between the now-aggressively militaristic US and some other nation but between over-populated India and Pakistan, France and England ... who share over a thousand years of enmity ... between Israel and any number of countries, Russian and Europe.<br><br>Or perhaps all of them, we are mad and in our sense of lost 'prosperity' there is the urge to collective suicide: every fifty years of so half the human race is seized by the uncontrollable urge to murder the other half. <br><br>Don't forget, the world's food supply depends on a few varieties of seed stock, a gift from the agriculture corporations: a few each of corn, fewer than ten; rice, wheat, soybeans, potatoes, yams, cassava; all are vulnerable to rusts and fungi or, in the instance of cassava, vulnerable to a devastating and incurable plant virus. <br><br>We are ten meals away from civil war and worse ... there are a lot of moving parts to our modern world, anything wrong can happen.

Taleb interprets this as an attempt to mitigate the downside and retain the upside.

Over the last year one of the big shifts in my thinking is coming to appreciate how slow the decent can be, from a non dramatic day to day perspective, yet fast it can be at the same time, from the perspective of "wow, this would have been easy 3 years ago!"<br><br>From experience with people, I have seen how far some people have fallen. Its tragic, but many people are already starting to fall into tragic tail spins. Having grown up going to 12 step meetings, I know well how sometimes one pulls out before rockbottom, but also that it is never a sure thing, little can be done to enable such a recovery from the outside, and the side effects of how people stop one destructive pattern in their life can start another pattern. This will become more visible as the ability to maintain the appearance of functionality becomes harder for individuals. I now know families that don't even pretend to be okay, lots of nihilism, drug abuse debilitating otherwise capable people, financial ruin, legal, and health issues crushing individuals. Basic cost of living, even if it stays the same, is unsustainable for most. This is what I have seen that makes it clear, even with no downward bumps the future is very difficult and dangerous. <br><br>Danger is one of the important aspects of our future blindness. Danger is something our culture teaches little about how to live with, other than "stay away!". But this advice is not useful, because there is too much danger, soon to be even more. A superbug could get me anytime and there is little I can do about it. I can be prudent and develop good habits to avoid infection, and I have made modest progress in that, but it is a danger which I can only mitigate, and only to a degree. This danger and many others are likely to keep growing. Medical costs mean that many conditions my elders would have treated are to me something that should they come I will have to face them directly, and growing up safe I don't know how I would bear such an encounter from experience. Death our culture can grasp at because we are mortal, but danger I think is much more challenging because we have to live with it, it is uncertain while death is very certain.<br><br><a href=#c5982309589525159507 title="comment permalink">1/8/14, 9:56 PM</a><br><br>

Especially stories about events that seem like a surefire end of the world, but in fact these great events become just another, perhaps brutal, part of business as usual, the stories of this kind from my upbringing have a big effect on me. Tolkien is the best western example I can think of, in it heroes face deep danger, a situation very nearly hopeless. The fellowship's mission was nearly suicidal, for there was little rational hope 9 could bypass the armies of Mordor, but that mattered little because trying anything was better than waiting for Sauron to crush the world. Even if there were no path to victory, the heroes would still choose the long defeat over the short. 20th century Japaneses culture has many examples which influenced me, their lived experience since WWII was very different, and important perspectives have arrisen from that differene. The video games I was raised on were crazy, but a few decent stories were given to me in my youth through them. Only one example: Final Fantasy 6 had [SPOILER alert] the "end of the world" in the middle of the game . The characters failed to prevent the civilization from entering a brutal dark age, but they had to carry on and do what they could for the world that kept on going, even after the beautiful villages became slums, they still needed heroes to do what they could. [End Spoiler] Then I have read Nausicca of the Valley of the Wind, here humanity has endured untold generations of brutal decline and warfare since the collapse of Technological Civilization, and the very prospects of any given tribes chance of survival are bleak beyond another couple centuries, but Nausicca consistently does what her heart tells her is right for world and the many she loves, even at great pain, danger, and sacrifice. Her compassion and courage are so deep in her. Good hero stories feature courage and faith, even if hopes are few and modest and dangers are many and great.<br><br>Good stories are important, when we think about something alot it soaks into our whole being. So many heroes my age mates were raised on were nothing but the glorification of the thrills of power. Of course we have had so much reason to be lustful for such a feeling. This is a hazard. Better to focus on heroes whose goodness is not predicated on their power, but on something deeper. This is why I think Star's Reach is a good story too, much of what is powerful about each character follows from what is good about them. <br><br>Uncertainty is the most certain companion for our future, what we as individuals and communities will have to face, and may even be crushed by, are unpredictable in detail. I do little things, and mostly use LESS each year, but have far to go, and I know that terrible tests I may not pass could be around the corner soon, but I do hope to pass some of these terrible challenges, for each time I have passed tests of courage in the past it did good things to me, who I was. I focus alot of loving life in all of its beauty and brutality, because without love, at least a little bitty bit, life becomes something too unnerving. Something I have seen in the confessions and eyes of a few people, something which few can endure long except at terrible cost to self and often to others.<br><br><a href=#c1573451689608167814 title="comment permalink">1/8/14, 9:56 PM</a><br><br>

However, it is interesting to note that children of baby boomers (or the equivalent) in other countries have a very different narrative. My parents were 'baby boomers' of a young independent India struggling (and still is) to educate and feed its people, and to rebuild what has aptly been clarified as "highly developed [society] in an advanced state of decay".<br><br>That Asian baby boomer generation, at least those lucky enough to be born into middle class families and have instilled in them intense ambition to claim the lavish lifestyles of the non-deserving western baby boomers, mostly took (or tried) to succeed on other shores. I am the continuing product of such ambition and the inheritor of the desire to finally reach what my parents' or grandparents', in a holistic sense, were deprived of.<br><br>To most of my generation your effective experiment outlining the trajectory of the future leads to a sort of existential crisis that needs to be addressed head on. Yes, we have the capability (and even training) to get what our parents wanted, but for what? To only fight it out in a newly decaying society with no upswing to hope for.<br><br>It is an interesting predicament with many imaginative solutions.

There will be doom and gloom in the land when people don't have Baby Boomers to kick around anymore!<br><br>Back in another millennium I read Too Scared to Cry: <i>Psychic Trauma in Childhood</i> by Lenore Terr.<br><br>From Publishers Weekly<br><br>Terr, child psychiatrist at the University of California School of Medicine in San Francisco, explores the dire effects of childhood trauma, defined here as "a single overwhelming experience or a series of overwhelming ordeals." She focuses on the 1976 abduction of a group of children in Chowchilla, a California farm town, who were seized from a bus as they were returning from day camp. The author, who interviewed the victims soon after their release from the abandoned rock quarry where they were buried, and who continues to make periodic assessments of the children, analyzes their attendant losses in cognitive and emotive function. Expanding on her Chowchilla research, Terr discusses post-traumatic behavior patterns she discerns in the works of writers such as Poe, Hawthorne and Stephen King, and in the films of Ingmar Bergman. Written in an anecdotal format, the book is penetrating and illuminating. <br><br>http://www.amazon.com/Too-Scared-To-Cry-Childhood/dp/0465086446<br><br>The details have faded in my mind, but I was taken with the loss of cognitive function. The children clung to "magical reasoning." I tend to revisit the notion whenever I hear stories about poor school performance in the inner cities where almost every child knows of another child who has been murdered by gunfire--or has seen a child murdered by gunfire. You want to talk about apocalyptic thinking: most young men in the inner cities don't expect to live past their twenties. And I've watched that Gansta mentality spread through music and video into mainstream culture...<br><br>In the last year, however, I've been thinking more and more about a connection between trauma, PTSD, whatever you want to call it, and our predilection for apocalyptic fantasy. A thousand years later, you can read <i>A.D. 1000: A World on the Brink of Apocalypse</i>, by Richard Erdoes with an amused sense of superiority:<br><br>"It is the onej(sic)-thousandth year of Christianity. The end of the millennium is fast approaching, and with it the nightmare visions of Armageddon and the Apocalypse. Europe is wracked by war, famine, carnage,and pestilence. Madness plagues the continent.<br><br>"Tracing the career of briliant visionary Pope Sylvester II, Richard Erdoes has composed a vivid tapestry of a century frighteningly similar to our present one. This chilling historical account holds up a darkling mirror."<br><br>http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/110754.A_D_1000<br><br>Erdoes quotes accounts of strange manifestations in the sky, of thunder out of nowhere, showers of rocks, and thick fogs that terrified people... Except, that I found out by accident that those events may have been linked to a devastating volcano in Iceland in the mid 900's. Maybe I don't have room for amused superiority anymore... There was an huge eruption in 1783 that killed 10,000 people in Iceland and another 100,000 people across Northern Europe. I haven't gone looking yet for apocalyptic fantasies in Europe a generation later, but I wouldn't be at all surprised to something around 1820. Feel free look for correlations.<br><br>In 2030, the Hurricane Katrina generation will be in their mid-forties. They had the Apocalypse dropped right in their living rooms night after night when they were kids, and they are ripe for any crazy prediction you want to put out there. They've already seen it! They've seen Hurricane Sandy. They've seen the Deepwater Horizon spill. They've seen a dozen or more mass school shootings. They've seen mountain top coal removal and fire coming out of water faucets. The Apocalypse is already in their backpacks! How could it not be just around the corner?<br><br><br><a href=#c198903770626736222 title="comment permalink">1/8/14, 11:49 PM</a><br><br>

It relies also quite heavily on the second point developed by John Michael, but with a slight pinch of my own salt. <br><br>While I admit not paying close attention to the last apocalyptic movies, I have as a side effect of my job, the dubious pleasure to be reliably the one toward who people in my surrounding turn when the question of imminent doom by asteroid impact arises. In those scenarios the end that, from my experience, trumps the total extinction of the human race is the belief that it will be hard, tough, terrible, but it will bring out the hero in all of us. We won't have any choice left but to be Good and then at least Do the Right Thing. <br> <br>Now, imagine some weird Joe, that has a bad habit. Say he drinks too much. He is not an alcoholic, but every evening he likes to enjoy one or two glasses. It relaxes him. With time, he has come to suspect that his habit is getting bad. He awakes in the morning with a tongue like an old carpet, and some mornings when he wonders what he had for dinner, it takes him a moment to remember. Sometimes fuzzily, and once or twice not at all. That scared him, and he thought that he should stop drinking for a while, to purge his system. Yet, he is really convinced that he is in control. It is not that he doesn't see the problem, but he has all these reasons that tell him how the problem is not really a problem in the end. <br>Time passes, and while things don't really get worse, the idea that he should stop becomes more and more present. Not in his day thoughts, of course. And definitely not in the evening, when he is tired and needs to relax. But now almost every morning he has this thought that he should stop for a while. <br> <br>He is even aware of the fact that every time he decides to do something in the morning and forgets in the evening it hurts his will. It makes him weaker. <br> <br>This weird Joe, who is probably alien to most of you, this weird Joe might very well end up having some apocalypse fantasies to get him out of his habit. <br><br>The second point developed would manifest as the fantasy to be hit by a bus. He would have it in very bad mornings, when the day ahead looks gloom. "At least, it will all be over." <br>But he will also have an other fantasy, one that comes even more often. The fantasy that a visit to the doctor that would diagnose a terrible illness, would shake him and force him to take the step he is failing to take so far. <br><br>In other times, this weird Joe would probably have turned to a priest, to a god, for help. But he has no god, he has no one to turn to. Of course this weird Joe is completely hypothetical, but in this thought experiment his apocalyptic fantasies are actually a call for help to the blind material universe. <br>But this has probably no bearing what so ever with what is actually going on with 2030. Now, I have to figure out why it is that I wanted to write this here... <br> <br>I have recently been told that irony is not, as I though, a leafless vegetable. But I am not sure I believe it. <br> <br>Seb<br><br><a href=#c3622357747399399669 title="comment permalink">1/9/14, 12:43 AM</a><br><br>

Thus they have a tendency towards faith in apocalyptic fantasies. A future of decline is unthinkable to such a mindset.<br><br>However, I expect that the baby boomers will reap what they sow. A culture of greed and debt that they have nurtured to their own ends will be the seeds of their own undoing.<br><br>As a disclaimer, I have no inheritance forthcoming as my actions have already caused me to be shut out of any family will. I always thought that such threats were telling in themselves anyway.<br><br>My grandfather was a very wealthy and connected person and before he died I told him I did not expect to wait around on dead men's money. Mind you, he delivered on that as the randy old coot gave it all to his new family anyway!<br><br>So as an outsider, I can see the baby boomers here in Australia have captured the lion’s share of wealth in this country.<br><br>To have done this wealth heist means that they have simply set themselves up as targets for raids on their assets in the future. It seems obvious to me that such accumulation strategies are inevitably self-defeating. <br><br>I can already see such raids on assets happening, but of course no one mentions this in polite company, but it's happening alright.<br><br>Those raids look like actions like putting oldies in the cheapest nursing homes possible so as to maintain their asset base when they eventually die. I'm not judging those actions either as I can well understand the difficulties faced by mine and even younger generations. Something will eventually have to give. That is what decline looks like.<br><br>Sustainability has to include sharing and maintenance of abundance, otherwise people in western cultures get a bit grumpy and start working out ways to game the system for their own benefit.<br><br>The whole 2030 date must have arisen because of the Limits to growth study which someone, somewhere must have taken note of? I can almost hear their thought processes: This sounds like a definitive date for sure, lets latch onto it. Shame they hadn't read the book.<br><br>Meanwhile, here I just keep throwing my resources into building top soil, diversity and infrastructure. There really is no other game in town.<br><br>PS: I was angry about all of this matter over a decade ago, however I channelled that anger into gaining clearer insights and motivation for actions on the ground. It hasn't been an easy ride at all.<br><br>PPS: I'm about to score two days of 40 degrees Celsius weather this upcoming week. Not good.

Yikes.<br><br>I can maybe add a little bit as one of society's designated "trained professionals" in motivating the public to make personal lifestyle changes. The pressure to put on a happy face as you tilt at that windmill for the 1000th time is probably the main reason for the justified cliche of doctors all being tired, jaded cynics. I marvel at how you continue to do it on a voluntary basis so regularly. You must not be quite right in the head, it's really the only explanation. :)<br><br>I liken our current predicament to diabetes. It's weird, I know all the lines about fixing it with lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, but at some point I think I stopped believing it was possible, because I just never saw it happen. I eventually started to feel like a parrot, rehearsing the same canned speech over and over again without really believing in any of it anymore. Might as well just start everyone on meds since they'll need them anyway. If anything the worst prognostic factor is probably when the patient is horrified at the very idea of meds and think they'll beat it with willpower. More often than not they'll just learn to avoid doctors until they have end stage renal disease or something.<br><br>I can easily picture one lady who did pull it off, though. I gave the canned speech, but somehow she pulled it off. I wish I could say how it happened to help people faithfully reproduce it, but truthfully I feel like she mostly makes for an inspiring anecdote when I see people in a similar situation. I guess the right factors were there, a strong will, a supportive partner, a lack of denial about her condition, and regular follow-up.<br><br>On the other hand, I've seen lots of people quit smoking, with or without help from me. It usually takes several tries and lapses are common, but it does happen on a somewhat regular basis. Unlike the essential cause for despair of diabetes, there is some cause for hope. I wonder why that is. My best guess it really just requires making the one right decision, no matter how frequently the urge comes up. That's something the human mind can easily wrap around and get motivated about. Diabetes is more pervasive, you have to keep making the right decisions on more than one axis, over and over again. I imagine most people just give up and figure they'd rather deal with the consequences if they can admit them at all.<br><br>That's kinda where we wound up as a society. Like smoking, we were able to give up DDT, CFC's, etc. The really pervasive stuff I have less hope about, as seemingly do you.<br><br>How do you keep doing this? Is it the satisfaction about the vanishingly small amount of people who actually do make the sweeping changes, like my patient who beat diabetes? I have to say as nice as that is, I honestly can't see that being enough motivation, week after week. Once you discount that warm inner glow one gets from being the Only Sane Man, which most likely got old a really long time ago, I imagine it gets a rather poor emotional return on emotional investment.<br><br><a href=#c7780850140864879736 title="comment permalink">1/9/14, 2:14 AM</a><br><br>

It is an interesting exercise that I can recommend to all. <br><br>And it is not that terrible either! One can either imagine to live miserably and die miserably or one can decide to imagine a different future where although there will be less energy, stuff and stimulation as JMG puts it succinctly, life can be just as interesting. <br><br>After all what we are asked to do, is to rethink and recreate a new civilisation for where we live. That's an exhilarating perspective I find. Anyone of us can actually contribute towards imagining a new civilisation within the physical constraints of decline and work for it to come about. <br><br>It is really about reworking our own inner worlds and changing our expectations. Once this is underway, our focus changes and our actions also change in accordance. <br><br>In my limited experience I find that going to bed early, waking up early, growing vegetables, composting green wastes, buying less stuff, eating less, reading more books, favouring home cooked food over fast foods, building human relationships and trying to follow some spiritual path (any!) all together help mightily to face the gradual collapse of our civilisation. <br><br>Indeed I wish you all a Happy New Civilisation! <br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c8082169187600463509 title="comment permalink">1/9/14, 2:49 AM</a><br><br>

It's taken me to unexpected places: tomorrow morning I'll be boarding a plane and moving to live in Russia, where I hope to learn from people who've already experienced collapse.<br><br>Meanwhile, here in the UK, there are odd snippets of news surfacing which suggest that the message of decline and collapse is being understand in more and more circles. In one issue alone of the right-wing newspaper <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> (albeit for British values of 'right wing', which in US terms are perhaps more like the 'traditional conservatism' whose disappearance in the US you've noted), I saw two very interesting articles:<br><br>- <a href=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8653919/Growing-popularity-of-log-burning-stoves-fuels-rise-in-timber-thefts.html rel=nofollow>Growing popularity of log-burning stoves fuels rise in timber thefts</a>.

That's one of the consequences of the "it just keeps getting worse" future I outlined in this post. Do you recognize the difference between that and the "We'll all be dead by 2030" fantasy I'm discussing in the post? <br><br>Onething, okay, but then why bring in the prediction of declining oil prices? <br><br>Steve, thanks for a good example of the mentality of "if you pile up enough worst case scenarios, that <i>proves</i> we're all going to die by date X!" Not so; life is going to get a lot harder for a lot of people, as it's already done in Greece, Syria, etc., but that's simply a reversion to normal history after the brief interval of fossil-fueled prosperity. <br><br>Alchemyguy, exactly. Stoicism isn't about not having emotions; it's about not letting your emotions, or anything else, own you. <br><br>Ray, excellent! You get this morning's gold star. In some future posts, I'll be talking about stories that might help make sense of the future we're facing. As for the distinction between death and danger, that's crucial -- a case could probably be made, in fact, that apocalypse fandom is in large part an attempt by people who have no tolerance for uncertainty to impose certainty on a future of high risk. <br><br>Compound F, have you noticed that Stoneleigh's been predicting over and over again that this is the year that debt deflation is going to bring the world to a sudden stop -- and that she's been wrong year after year? No, that doesn't mean that it's got to happen one of these days; it means that she's forgotten that money is simply a system of abstract tokens subject to manipulation in a dizzying variety of ways. We've already seen in the case of Japan that it's possible to strike a rough balance between deflationary conditions and inflationary money policy, and keep that balance in place for decades on end; the same thing is being done elsewhere, including in the US, and the result is a slow grinding decline rather than an apocalyptic crunch. As, by the way, I've predicted repeatedly...<br><br>Mark, if you're a Catholic, I highly recommend those exercises; I'm sure you can find a Jesuit to help you work with them. <br><br>Jason, I hope that attitude's common on your side of the pond! It may help you avoid some very ugly events. <br><br>Ruben, I've tried to be as clear as possible about climate change in previous posts. Is it happening? Of course. Is it largely caused by human activity? Of course. Is it a linear process? No. Thomas Friedman landed a rare hit when he pointed out that what we're facing is "global weirding" rather than global warming, an increased range of extremes on all ends of the weather machine. That's going to cause disasters in some places and land benefits in others -- during the last post-ice age warm period, for example, it rained regularly in the Sahara. I'll discuss all this in more detail as we proceed. As for your latter point, though -- that people will think the apocalypse has arrived if they can't pick up JoJos at the local supermarket -- no argument there!<br><br>YJV, this is why I don't try to make predictions for the whole world. It's a big planet, and cultural forces and factors vary dramatically from one part of it to another. <br><br>Sophie, nah, the Boomers aren't even irreplaceable as punching bags. Many thanks for the comments on the psychology of trauma -- that's a worthwhile point, especially as we'll be facing traumas in the future that will make Katrina look mild. <br><br>KL, the last thing I'd assume is that anybody but a few random Stoics will act according to reason!<br><br><a href=#c1921520141003767208 title="comment permalink">1/9/14, 6:20 AM</a><br><br>

Fear of this scenario is, I believe, what motivates some people to try to go the extra mile so as to get something positive done.<br><br>One book I found very informative which describes how a powerful person (Obama) dropped the ball and made the nightmare scenario more likely, is the 2011 publication Confidence Men by Ron Suskind. The book describes in detail how both the health care industry and the financial industry turned the need for reform, which a special alignment of the stars had (maybe) made possible in 2009, into a confirmation of the status quo. The book contents that it didn’t have to turn out this way, but because of Obama’s action or inaction, it did. <br><br>As a result my guess is Obama will not end up as the fifth head at Mount Rushmore. The author had amazing connections with numerous insiders in the process (many of whom he quotes). The book is a marvelous yarn. <br><br>I read about Confidence Men in David Stockman’s recent polemic, The Great Deformation, which is the only economic history I’ve seen which spells out how the money printing by the Federal Reserve in the 1960s and 1970s turned things that cost a nickel or a dime in my youth into items costing a dollar or more.

As for irony, nah, it's a necessary nutrient -- aren't you supposed to worry about whether there's enough irony in your diet? <br><br>Cherokee, you may well be right about the origins of the 2030 date in <i>Limits to Growth</i> -- that's so often the way such things get started. <br><br>Mkroberts, it's important not to fixate on a single number -- what matters with climate, and more generally, is the state of the whole system, and in particular the way the whole system responds to rates of change. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Hector, do you ever get people who respond to a diabetes diagnosis by saying "Oh well, I'm certain to die a horrible death now, nothing I can do about it," and use that as an excuse to keep on with their existing lifestyle? That's what I think is happening here. <br><br>Karim, true enough. Try telling people that here in America, though, and they'll start jabbering about how we're all going to be dead by 2030 anyway, so why bother? <br><br>Freebooter, it started out that way -- trying to scare people into doing what you want them to do by threatening them with the end of the world goes back a long way in American culture. The problem with that strategy is that nobody buys it any more, and so your narrative promptly gets taken over by what I've termed apocalypse fandom, the people -- and there are a lot of them -- who have various personal reasons to want to pretend that they don't have to live with the consequences of their own actions. That's where we are with the climate change narrative, and unless something shifts in a big way, banging away on the "death by climate" drum is just going to feed the fad. <br><br>Bogatyr, that's interesting -- thanks for the data points! Best of luck with your relocation. <br><br>Richard, nicely summarized. <br><br>Russ, thank you! <br><br>Ursachi, of course -- people in eastern Europe haven't had the luxury of being unrealistic about history.

Therefore she made careful preparations for the expected disaster and laid aside large stores of food, water etc. However after New Year 2000 arrived without any problems she expressed a great sense of disappointment. She had found that the contemplation of the expected disaster and all the preparations she was making for it, had filled her with a kind of excitement and given her a sense of purpose in her life. The person who left the comment thought that her attitude was highly irrational. Now I would agree that her attitude was irrational. However I can really understand what she was feeling and know where she is coming from. It is easy for forget that life in a modern industrial bourgeois society can be really boring. Spending most of your life working in a boring office in order to pay off a mortgage and buy ever increasing amounts of consumer gadgets is an existence that is devoid of purpose, meaning, adventure or excitement. Such an existence is safe and comfortable, and I am well aware that if I was a starving peasant slaving all hours to scrape a meager living, it would seem like paradise. However human beings need more than just comfort and security. We need meaning, purpose and excitement in our lives. I am sure that this is one of the reasons why so many millions throughout Europe were jubilant at the prospect of going to war in 1914 and looked on it as just a wonderful adventure. They had no idea at the time what modern industrial warfare was like. I note that there is a part of me that also gets excited whenever a war starts. I am not alone in having this kind of excitement. Look at all the millions who get a vicarious excitement from watching people being killed in film and on the TV. Human beings crave drama and excitement. <br><br>I am well aware that an hour spent in the cellar of a burnt out house while bombs fall around me would cure me of any such excitement. There is also a large part of me that hates war and all the legalized destruction and murder it brings in its wake. I know enough of history to know that nothing good can come of it. However human beings are often filled with emotions and feeling that are completely contradictory. We have this image that comes from the enlightenment that man/woman is a rational creature. It is easy to forget that underneath this veneer of rational thought there is a whole world of contradictory feeling and emotions that can exert an influence over the way we think. If we are not aware of this, then these feelings and emotions can easily become the monsters from the Id, as they were called in that film the Forbidden Planet. I am sure that this longing for excitement and purpose is one of the factors behind this desire for apocalypse and cataclysm. I am afraid that your concept of a long decent is rather tedious and boring and does not fulfill our need for drama and excitement. If someone was to make an action movie out of your book the “Long Decent” it would be a real box office flop. It would be so boring. Such a response is irrational, but it is vital to remember that human beings do have a streak of irrationality in them.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c2420633101366139033 title="comment permalink">1/9/14, 6:38 AM</a><br><br>

I was recently reading Norman Cohn’s “The Pursuit of the Millennium”. This is a book about the eschatological pursuit of the millennium in medieval societies. There were mass movements of people who were obsessed with the idea that they were living in the last days when the old world would be destroyed and a new heaven on earth would appear with a second coming of Christ. They often thought that this would be brought about by exterminating the sinners such as the rich, clergy, Jews etc. Mr Cohn notes that this kind of millennial movement did not normally take place in traditional peasant societies, where there was a kind of community and people had a place. Such societies may rebel against their masters, but these rebellions where not of a millennial nature, and tended to have down to earth aims such as removing unjust taxes. Mr Cohn noticed that millennium movements tended to take place in societies that had large populations of people who were alienated and rootless and had little stake in their society. This would often occur in areas with expanding towns that had large poverty stricken populations who were not part of the guilds, had lost their connection with the land and former peasant communities and who had very insecure jobs. <br><br>It does strike me that that there are some similarities between this medieval fascination with the apocalypse and our modern obsession with this. A modern bourgeois society may be comfortably off in economic term, but it can also be quite rootless, alienated and lacking in any connection with a community or the land. While modern bourgeois societies remain economically secure such obsessions with the apocalypse may only remain fantasies. However when such societies are disturbed by the shocks of poverty, war etc they can easily get caught up in the same kind of dangerous millennial movements that shook the Middle Ages. In the pursuit of a new heaven on earth, these movements can lead to the extermination of millions. We have already seen this with Communism and Nazism in the 20th century. Both of these movements were fundamentally millennial in their outlook. In the near future there are going to be millions of disenfranchised urban poor who could be caught up in such movements. Such a process is not inevitable. Britain, America and France maintained their democratic institutions in the 1930’s even though they were in the throes of the great depression.<br><br><a href=#c7578319486779280684 title="comment permalink">1/9/14, 6:39 AM</a><br><br>

If you think about it we have had a number of apocalypses in our lifetimes. There was an apocalypse’s in Rawanda in the in the mid 1990’s and Cambodia in the mid 1970’s which cost the lives of millions. There were some major apocalypses during the Second World War. As we go down the reverse slope of peak oil these Armageddon’s will become more frequent and are more likely to occur somewhere near you. However these Armageddon’s are likely to be localized. Even if they occur on a continental scale, they are unlikely to wipe out civilization across the whole globe. There are scenarios where civilization could be wiped out on a global scale such a large asteroid, a super volcano or an all out nuclear war between superpowers. We did come uncomfortably close to the last scenario during the cold war. However the odds are that we are unlikely to see such scenario’s in our lifetimes. If there is a nuclear war it is more likely to be a small exchange of war heads rather than an all out nuclear war. Our civilization will decline, but it is more likely to be a slow death by a thousand cuts than a bullet to the head. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c47688257363181703 title="comment permalink">1/9/14, 7:23 AM</a><br><br>

Setting a specific date (such as a year 2030) in the future for some grand apocalyptic event (e.g. NTE) is nonsense but great for business. On the other hand there are many degrees and shades of gray between that and the other end of the spectrum (e.g. it will take centuries or millennia for things to play out). I think you may be engaging in the same kind of binary thinking you have mentioned in the past. What I was getting at was that a date like 2030 can be used as an indicator of the rate of decline. It is essentially saying that we are much closer to large scale effects than a date of 2100 or 2200 etc. One way to think of it is as a probability distribution that may have a peak at 2030 but is broad and highly asymmetric (toward longer times). Of course the estimate for the peak date of this distribution is itself part of a secondary distribution. The kind of apocalyptic fantasies you speak of essentially replace the distribution with an almost/essentially infinitely sharp delta function centered at 2030 and even the probability of the time/year is 1.<br><br><a href=#c3542799743976266592 title="comment permalink">1/9/14, 9:20 AM</a><br><br>

Of course the predicted apocalypse had nothing whatsoever to do with actual Mayan beliefs, but at least there was some source for the date. As far as I can tell, there's nothing similar to back up 2030, which will make it easier to say "Oh well I guess we were off by a bit" when that year actually rolls around. <br><br>About zombies and survivalists. What I have actually seen first-hand when sudden stress strikes an American community (flood, tornado, hurricane, etc.) is that once the debris stops flying and the waters recede, people immediately pull together, look for who needs help and who has resources to offer, and take care of things. I suspect that in an episode of acute food scarcity (about the only thing the average survivalist is actually prepared for), if someone were to open fire on those who were going without, the community might collectively string him up from the nearest tree. And during a period of quasi-permanent food scarcity, that same survivalist would likely starve alone in his bunker after his provisions ran out, having been shunned and exiled by the larger community for his antisocial behavior. Who is going to want to share their hard-earned meager crops, forage, and game with someone who sat atop his own hoard with his guns, not participating at all in the work to get some sort of subsistence food production going?<br><br>And a final note more relevant to last weeks post, JMG...

I think a good way to get an idea of how people might react when they lose their belief in our current society is to look at places like Detroit, which has been in steady decline for quite a while longer than most American cities and where you would therefore expect the belief in both progress and collapse to be the most tenuous. In other words, the rust belt might be a good approximation for how the rest of the country will look in 20 - 30 years (and who knows how bad places like Detroit will be by then)<br><br>I have a (somewhat unrelated) question, by the way: what do you think will be the criteria that separates the 'useful' innovations that we keep maintaining in a post-industrial society from the ones that we will ultimately decide to scrap?

Incidentally, I saw a PBS documentary about the Mayan calendar around Christmas-time 2012 that noted the big upheaval around the 2030-2032 period as well. It was called 2012: The True Mayan Prophecy. It is not filled with spectacle, nor doom, nor unfulfillable promises. I think, for what it's worth, there is a recognition of the need to place the complexity of the real world into some mythology that people can understand. And indeed, for those who are capable of being the Bard, telling the stories, this is very important. Getting out of pure abstraction, into a story: the story leaves enough flexibility to allow every individual to interpret to their own circumstances, while still giving everyone a common understanding.<br><br>Apocalypse stories, or transcendence stories (Star Trek, Star Wars, the Secret, the quantum physics-based "you make your own reality" hocus pocus) have drawbacks in a time of the barbarism of reflection, in which the abstraction process tries to force the world into simple binaries - transcendence or annihilation. People have too much time sitting around trying to figure everything out, thinking thinking thinking, not much living. Me included. In reality, though it can't fit in language, we all experience the bliss of transcendence - sometimes - and we will all experience the annihilating apocalypse. In between is life, and it doesn't really fit into words - but what's more, in can be really quite a painful struggle to keep trying to fit the real world into the words. It takes some recognition of language/mind's limits, and turn that function off, as much as can, and be where we are now.<br><br>A personal synchronicity: as personal care-giver to 98-year old former nuclear physicist, and before that, adopted boy raised on a Western Kansas farm; each night to help him get to sleep, I read from books about the frontier life. Most recently, I've been reading a story to him called Cabin on Trouble Creek, by Jean van Leeuwen; about two boys left in the forest of Ohio 1803 to fend for themselves until the family arrives from Pennsylvania. <br><br>Why is that a synchronicity for me? Let each reader perhaps interpret the story according to their own experience. But to me, it is as though 2012 (or 2000, or whatever) can be imagined as a point of reflection. As a point of passing through the looking glass. On one side, the past, was growth, away from that old frontier history. On the other side, a long story of return to that old way, sort of. The difference is, it's like a mirror image and everything is in reverse. Instead of (effectively) empty frontier land, it's a crowded space - and it's filled with all the old conceptions of growth, prosperity, etc. It is a kind of bizarro-frontier world.<br><br><a href=#c1837505958224525617 title="comment permalink">1/9/14, 9:59 AM</a><br><br>

More to the point, imagine that this is your future: that you, personally, will have to meet ever-increasing costs with an income that has less purchasing power each year; that you will spend each year you still have left as an employee hoping that it won’t be your job’s turn to go away forever, until that finally happens; that you will have to figure out how to cope as health care and dozens of other basic goods and services stop being available at a price you can afford, or at any price at all; that you will spend the rest of your life in the conditions I’ve just sketched out, and know as you die that the challenges waiting for your grandchildren will be quite a bit worse than the ones you faced.”<br><br>I won’t attempt to speak to any other apocalyptic fantasy but one does need to be addressed. I recall one commentator insisting global warming would never be a problem as peak-oil would cut consumption to such an extent that GHG levels would never approach a danger point much less start feedbacks exacerbating the problem. The basis for the current “revolution” in oil &amp; gas recovery is an old technology that found a new application due to advancing geological technology. This outcome was evident to many who worked in the O&amp;G business as far back as the 1960’s. That is why large oil companies were in a land rush in the early 1970’s to acquire at lease in kerogen bearing shale ground in Utah and Colorado – I was taking leases on that ground. At the time those companies said this land could be brought into production if the price of oil would stabilize at $60-$65 barrel – 1974 dollars. That didn’t happen but 40+ years later the price stabilized at $100+ and now that land is being seriously considered for exploitation. <br><br>The commentator apparently did not know these details as he seemed to fall into the trap that conventional oil production was the only alternative and surely - as it proved to be – said production would fall precipitously, prices would rapidly escalate, the economy would collapse, GHG’s would fall and we would be saved from global warming. This neatly supported his postulation that the collapsing economy - which it is - supported his notion of a stair-stepped decline and collapse. The theory of and a decline is proving valid but the potential impact of environmental degradation seems to be put-off as a “disruption” rather than a potential catalyst for a rapid collapse - I am reminded of profile of Bardi’s “Seneca Cliff” at this point.<br><br>It is convenient to disregard – deny - the rapidly expanding body of evidence supporting the some of the direst of global warming consequences. As evidence accumulates the most severe of predictions are working their way into the mainstream of thinking. The outcome of our planetary experiment will not happen in a day or week but the time frame suggested is in historic terms “the blink of an eye.” Yes, lots of ill-considered climate mediation will be attempted with nasty unforeseen side effects, we will increase our use of fossil fuels, the financiers will make lots of money, yet more fiat money will pipe-line to the 1% and climate degradation will further accelerate. Unfortunately none of this seems to set well with the span of time needed to fulfill the theory of a stepped decline and collapse. <br><br>It is easy to dismiss McPherson or increasingly others, such as Hansen, who have a dour take on climatic change. The process they describe is not rapid as it would take decades as feed-back thresholds are progressively breached. Is this an apocalypse? That depends on the definition of your timing but from the standpoint of humanity it is fair to say it is an apocalypse or more gently “a darkening tunnel.” <br><br>Keep up the good work, it is stimulating reading.<br><br><br><a href=#c1226840591579626552 title="comment permalink">1/9/14, 11:43 AM</a><br><br>

It is amazing, isn’t it, that one has to walk people through these logical threads slowly and repeatedly, to get them past their denial? I’ve stopped trying with my suburban friends and family, but I’m thinking of “adopting” the young family next door, who say they are totally into permaculture, but do nothing about it – they have land and time… I’m gonna learn about how to teach those who have a million excuses. ;-)<br><br><i>The thought experiment I’d like to recommend to my readers is to imagine that things just keep going the same way, year after year, decade after decade, without any of the breakthroughs or breakdowns in which so many of us like to put our faith…Those who do that will realize something about apocalyptic fantasies that most believers in such fantasies never mention: even the gaudiest earth-splattering cataclysm is less frightening than the future I’ve described.</i><br><br>Thanks to your other writings, I have been doing this one for a while… it <b>is</b> a very different image than any of the popular collapses, and, as you say, it’s more frightening in many ways. And one of the reasons is that such a future means an endless need to make hard decisions, any one of which might suddenly make things much worse – and then the “blame” will feel like it’s yours. And part of the yearning for cataclysm is that it lets us off the hook in so many ways – if you’ve ever been in crisis, you know how some things just get very simple – you response to the emergency and let everything else go… not like the slow implosion when you have to pay attention to everything because it’s all so finely balanced…as I simplify (and as I see systems breaking down, just as you describe), I struggle to avoid major anxiety: I hate knowing that I’ve made a bad decision, or that I simply wasn’t physically able to respond to a mini-crisis, and so the repairs will be more costly… but one mental “change” that is helping is for me to drop that semi-automatic perception that struggle means “I’ve failed” – our Boomer culture really has fallen into the assumption that “doing it right” means it’s easy, smooth sailing (with enough money and few enough morals, of course). To tell myself that struggle (or a certain amount of constant effort) is normal in life is to change an old perception, and to give myself permission to do my best and accept that many things will be hard, anyway.<br><br>But a simpler life can be a very interesting, fun life: I built a top bar bee hive yesterday (3/4’s done); I’m taking a drop spindle spinning workshop Saturday, and as I type this I’m drinking some of my berry wine made this summer.<br><br><a href=#c8701131405215215076 title="comment permalink">1/9/14, 3:35 PM</a><br><br>

Romero was once quoted as saying that the "artistic" inspiration for his first zombie film "Night of the living dead" was that he believed we were becoming such a consumer culture that eventually we would consume ourselves, something I have found, after a fashion, as being a theme of your blog as well. This is a point he attempted to hammer home in some of his more recent films that worked less on subtlety and more on shock value with mixed results. To me, this is a great metaphor for the long decline although the "zombies" already walk among us in Big Box stores and Fast Food joints. I have a feeling that cognitive dissonance is well in play...people cannot imagine a change that isn't sudden because our gratification in this culture is also very sudden. Most everything you want is at the nearest retailer. Our culture has become, in my opinion, very impatient and the popularity of zombies is a reflection of that impatience in the sense that most people want a sudden collapse because it frees them from the rules they have been socialized to operate around. For a time I was an administrator on a zombie themed social networking site and constantly read through the forums. One of the common themes was "You have to be more careful about humans than zombies" which would almost always devolve into "If anyone comes near me I'll kill them." One thing I can say about the internet is that on forums where few people really know each other you get to see the underbelly a bit more clearly. When that forum is primarily predisposed to an incredibly violent (and also incredibly farcical)apocalyptic scenario, all sorts of vitriol rolls out about what happens to people. Most of it is childish bragging and things learned from watching too many action films but this is what fuels those expectations...everyone gets to be the Alpha and nobody better cross them...chilling fare indeed.<br><br><a href=#c3752335642893190636 title="comment permalink">1/9/14, 7:49 PM</a><br><br>

"<br><br>Yeah, that's common and actually my favorite rebuttal, because it's so handily shot down and turned into a teaching moment.<br><br>Death by diabetes is actually a rather slow, grinding, miserable affair that takes years. You'll just generally feel miserable all the time, have wounds that won't heal, be more prone to infection, possibly have a heart attack or stroke that more than likely won't actually kill you but won't do anything for your quality of life, quite possibly get a few amputations, and finally spend the last years of your life going to dialysis for 4 hours 3 times a week. One of the most astounding things about modern medicine is just how long we can keep diabetics alive.

In fact, I would be surprised if human numbers are anything other than what the United Nations growth curve shows, based on simple extrapolation and statistical analysis.<br><br> [see http://www.worldometers.info/].<br><br>However, in every other respect I agree with Michael Ruppert's concerns and his analysis.I just happen to believe that the feces will hit the fan a bit later, as predicted by Jorgen Randers in his book "2052".<br><br>In addition I believe that there will be a massive die-off of human beings at some point during this century but that it is far from clear that all of humanity will be obliterated from the face of the earth. By 2100 there may be less than a billion people around. That's more or less what James Lovelock predicted.<br><br>Nuclear power is a tragic boondoggle, and Ruppert's analysis is spot-on. When industrial civilization declines to the point where it is no longer feasible to run the electric pumps which circulate and cool the water which holds spent fuel rods, we are in deep trouble. And that's just the beginning of the tragedy.<br><br>Human global population is exploding right now, and as a result we are destroying the biosphere at an accelerating pace. We are in the middle of the 6th mass extinction. By the time global human population starts to crash later this century, the world will be a changed place, with far less biodiversity, massive displacements due to climate change and a natural resource base that has been all but destroyed. The future is bleak. However, we still don't know if we're done as a species. Each individual is wise to follow their conscience. If possible, drop out of the destructive fossil fuel based economy, or else try to live as simply as possible within it. What else can we do? <br><br>Both Michael Ruppert and Guy MacPherson are very intelligent men. Both are prone to apocalyptic thinking. As you mentioned, MacPherson is a scientist and ought to know better. Ruppert is not scientifically trained but he's a thorough researcher and journalist. Both men have a substantial following, paticularly on facebook.<br><br>I noticed that MacPherson does not give many specific mechanisms for his near term human extinction scenario, other than just catastrophic global warming. Hence I decided to list the most notable mechanisms for the die-off that seems to be inevitable later this century.

So, I'll add a fifth factor: if your friends are talking "this tomorrow's apocalypse" (TTA), chances are you'll want to find out what all the fuss is about. So you buy a book (or just click on a link), which is a signal to the bookseller, the publishers, and the authors that books (ads) can be sold on the topic. Note that this factor can be just as effective even if no one is seriously concerned about TTA. It's behavior that shapes commerce, not belief.<br><br>Consider also another social factor. If I'm the first in my social group to discover TTA, I have a topic for conversation. "Have you heard...?" is a popular pastime. Whatever novelty comes along, to introduce your social group to it shows that you are alert and potentially interesting to socialize with.

There's a little bit of truth to it, in that specialization of labor allows goods to be produced efficiently, but the main flaw is that it runs into a paradox: an economist will claim in one breath that we need to spend (to maintain jobs) but that we also need to save (to allow investment). In fact, what we need to do is live with efficiency, regardless of how this affects the counting of currency units. Removing insulation from our homes would boost GDP, as we pay extra for heat (especially relevant this week). Buying and driving big, heavy, expensive vehicles boosts GDP, too.

The fast-crash issue is actually a little different -- the reason Dmitry and David Korowicz are wrong is not that they've bought into a set of religious fantasies with the serial numbers filed off, as the apocalypticists have, but that they've failed to pay adequate attention to the way that systems in the real world respond to sudden crises with negative feedback loops; thus they're waiting for a fast crash that isn't happening, and missing the slower declines already under way. <br><br>Phil, the US is a Third World nation that happens to be much richer than most, so comparisons with Colombia are quite appropriate. Still, my point about the potential for domestic insurgency here is a little more complex than that, and will require a post or two of its own down the road. <br><br>LatheChuck, that's another good point. As for professional sports, you got me there -- it doesn't make the least sense to me either. <br><br>Sunseeker, indeed I have. As for the placebo effect, that makes perfect sense of my own experience -- as a practicing mage, I make use of the placebo effect all the time. If the medical profession knew how to use symbolism and ritual drama, they'd be able to get even better results!<br><br><a href=#c4101293288216904716 title="comment permalink">1/10/14, 12:04 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not a physicist or an engineer; my academic background is in the history of ideas, and so I tend to leave the number crunching to those who have the relevant background and whose predictions match real world experience; I distrust claims that we can have a comfortable industrial future powered by nuclear or renewable sources precisely because, in the real world, neither seems to be able to operate except as a subsidy magnet -- and the real wealth needed to maintain such subsidies is exactly what we can't expect to have as fossil fuels sunset out.<br><br>Alphonse, if it takes more energy to extract kerogen than you get from burning it, it's not an energy source, it's an energy sink.

This is the first time I'm writing a comment.<br><br>Funny that you mention Seneca, I read him 20 years ago. I'm doing exactly what he recommends, playing end times. That translates into sitting at home, having only a little rapeseed oil light burning, computer and stereo off. I don't even own a TV to turn off. It's quite dark, but hey, that just makes the night more nightly. I'm just sitting there, enjoying the silence, thinking, staring at the Futhark I made myself, drinking tea, or just doing nothing - taking a break from the daily sensory overload of our time. The mind calms down and becomes clearer, something many overloaded people are lacking, considering the continually lowering attention span of average people.<br><br>That's an idea I'd like to contribute: approach times of LESS playfully. This way, it is easier to examine what we actually can afford in the long run. Like children do in their games. Do you remember when some pieces of bark and a big puddle made a ship fleet that sailed the oceans? They were more gorgeous than the radio controlled ship models some adults are playing with because they are just little ships while a child's mind builds up a world. As any magician knows...<br><br>There's all kind of thinking about how we will survive with LESS. I want to encourage you of thinking how we will have fun with LESS. What will we play when gaming computers go out of feasibilty? Well, pen &amp; paper rolegames with friends. Classics like chess or backgammon.<br><br>I don't agree that the tunnel is all dark. It is dimly lit - it's just that our eyes are still flashed, rendering us blind. There is so much useless consumption we can (and will) refrain from before things get really hard.<br><br>I don't have a car, my old Dutch bicycle is enough and gives me physical exercise, sparing me fitness clubs. I don't have air conditioning. I don't use aircraft for making holidays - why would I, I'd still sit on my own back at the other end of the world. I don't need new electronic gadgets every year because I'm planning carefully what I buy so that I can use it for a long time, e.g. computers typically for 10 years.<br><br>That's why I'm rich - not because I have so much money, but because I have so few wishes. When friends ask what they can give me e.g. as birthday present, I answer "your time", because that's what I appreciate and can't buy.<br><br>LESS, you say. But just as more wealth doesn't mean more happiness, LESS of it doesn't mean suffering, at least as long as the Maslow Pyramid's basics are met.<br><br>On a side note, I am a believer in progress. Though not in the sense of technology, that's coming to a halt due to lacking resources. But in a spiritual way, we can evolve. We can learn. We can become. It doesn't matter whether there's a limit to our mind because the amount of what we can understand is limited by our lifetime anyway.<br><br>And you are contributing to this kind of progress, JMG. Every week. Thank you!<br><br>It was you that pointed me e.g. to reading Spengler, and if any English speaker here complains that he is hard to read, be assured that this isn't the translator's fault. It is the same in German, his use of language is complex. I am very good at reading, plus that German is my native language, and yet, I didn't manage more than 30 pages per day.<br><br>Anyway, the depth of his thoughts is astonishing, and reading such a book means happiness for me, in a way.<br><br>P.S.: The captchas are really a pain. When I'm lucky, I need at ten times before both words are readable, or 20 if I'm not lucky. With bad luck, it can become 30, and then it becomes completely unreadable with blobs. The audio version is even worse and so unusable that it is pointless for visually impaired persons anyway.<br><br><a href=#c8457163550371086337 title="comment permalink">1/10/14, 3:07 PM</a><br><br>

I’ve known a few diabetics who have gone through most of their lives without needing insulin injections because they took good care of themselves, watched what they ate, exercised regularly and so on. This is good advice for people in general, and used to be considered conventional wisdom (those who are interested may want to go back and read the Archdruid’s essay on Jack Lalanne and the Physical Culture movement), but it seems to have been largely forgotten since modern mass consumer societies tend to reduce much of the population to the status of lazy, complacent, overfed herd animals with oversized entitlement mentalities. <br><br>I have also known a much larger number of diabetics who suffer from serious complications because they won’t take proper care of themselves and continue leading a self-indulgent and sedentary lifestyle even though they know better. This is even more tragic since one of the reasons why chronic diseases like diabetes are so common is because the mass consumer society and mass media promote these sorts of unhealthy lifestyle choices. Many (but certainly not all) of those who develop diabetes do so as a result of decades of unhealthy lifestyle choices coming home to roost. Sad to say, but this will be a major source of Darwinian selection in the decades to come.<br><br>Still, we all have choices to make.

I agree that a lot of people are hoping for a fast crash or NTE because it means not having to deal with the messy consequences of our collective choices. If we are all going to die in the near future no matter what we do, what does it matter? It's a form of escapism. It's also a form of abject cowardice, to say the least. Rather, I admire the heroic attitude portrayed in the Lord of the Rings, in the ancient epics and in the writings of pulp authors like Robert E. Howard and Michael Moorcock, in which people fight against the odds and try to do the right thing because it is the right thing to do, and don’t worry too much about whether they are likely to succeed. They fight the good fight, even though they know they will probably lose, because it is the right thing to do. <br><br>http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/01/blood-of-earth-or-pulp-nonfiction.html<br><br>It’s that sort of heroic attitude that built the great cultures, nations, empires and civilizations of the past, and I have nothing but contempt for the pathetic whiners who pray for NTE or think that Jesus/the Space Brothers/whatever will bail them out because they don’t want to have to deal with consequences of their society’s bad choices and think they can’t live without the luxuries and conveniences that most of us have become accustomed to. <br><br><br><a href=#c458923021015718831 title="comment permalink">1/10/14, 3:17 PM</a><br><br>

The concern is that if Israel has to comply with UN laws on asylum seekers and refugees, they will be swamped with huge numbers of non-Jewish immigrants from alien cultures.

Based on Juhana’s recommendation, I recently read “Generation Identity”, and I think Markus Willinger is correct when he argues that the triumph of the 60’s generation was a catastrophe for Western civilization, and one that needs to be fought by the young peoples of Europe, North America and elsewhere if they wish for themselves and their descendents to have a future.<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ims4r1fCExY<br><br>As for the bit about the difference between the Carthaginians and the Baby Boomers, Juhana nailed that one right on the head.

The piece by Dmitry I mentioned lays out a clear best case scenario in the first paragraph in which there is a sudden massive die-off but a few survivors with “sufficient social cohesion and cultural wealth” (i.e. the righteous remnant) survives. Then it goes on to give reasons why this may be too optimistic (nuclear meltdowns, ocean death, etc.) When I read this piece it’s hard for me to see any real difference between what Dmitry and Guy are saying.

Some of his first memories are seeking shelter from bombs dropped by allied bombers; after the war, he often went to bed hungry and froze in winter because the house couldn't be heated and his clothes and shoes had holes. Still, his family was moderately wealthy so he never starved. But he recounted how one of his schoolmates ate the covers of his schoolbooks because he was hungry. Only in the 1950s did conditions slowly improve and the Wirtschaftswunder (economic miracle) did not come about until the 1960s. This was the decade when it became common for middle class people to own cars, televisions and similar goods, a process that was mostly completed at the end of the 1980s.<br><br>So, in contrast to the US, most people alive today are not members or children of a generation that grew up in privilege, but rather the exact opposite. Famine, poverty and even war are still part of the collective consciousness - if not from direct experience, then from vivid stories told by parents or grandparents.

At least here in the US, these things cost no more than $5, containing a PV panel, rechargeable battery, and an LED lamp. Though they're intended to be driven into the soil, you can let it soak up the sun during the day, then bring it inside to light your table at night. <br><br>Some of these units have special batteries permanently wired in, but others take standard AA (or AAA) -size cells. These are better, because you may be able to use the charged cells for other purposes (such as radio), and you can replace the cells when they can no longer hold the charge. The PV panel should last much longer than the NiCd or NiMH "storage" batteries.<br><br>LED lights won't set your home on fire, either. Burning down your house is a very inefficient use of construction materials and labor.<br><br><br><a href=#c2117479305085562799 title="comment permalink">1/11/14, 11:35 AM</a><br><br>

Granted, this means only little light, but in turn also little consumption. If it is constructed as swim light with oil upon water, there is no danger of burning the house because the flame just goes out if the oil is empty and the wick draws water. It can't flip to the side like an exhausted candle.<br><br>As for solar driven battery things, they are only available as long as the whole oil-driven industrial infrastructure is there, and in that case, I could as well use the ordinary power plug in the wall. In past articles, JMG pointed out that we are facing deindustrialisation. This means: no batteries to stock the sunlight, rendering the long life expectancy of solar panels useless for this purpose. Besides, it's cloudy winter here where I'm living, solar energy doesn't work even today.<br><br>I've done quite some research on the technology of lighting in history, and my reasoning: after deindustrialisation, we will be roughly in the same situation as people were before it (or worse, I know). Oil lamps have been in use for millennia, there are lots of pieces left over from Ancient Rome. They were driven with low-grade olive oil.<br><br>Since olive trees don't grow here, this leaves only rapeseed and sunflower. Rapeseed is fine because it was available centuries ago precisely for this purpose, and so it will be in the future - though of course not even nearly in the quantity required to run today's mass motorisation.<br><br>A side note for religion: one of the points of the Church was, as JMG pointed out, that they could run despite Rome's economic collapse because they were not being driven by profit. My own research mentioned above led me conclude that in the long and dark winters, these churches must have been islands of light. People must have come to the churches, found light, and got their mood up. Today, we label this as light therapy, but back then, it was certainly a religious experience for them.<br><br>I think this will be an important point in the decades, or maybe centuries to come, with respect to the second religiosity.<br><br><br>@ Hamish: Just look what happens if you just slap the car of the average car-owner with your flat hand, not even causing any damage. They react as if you had hit themselves. They don't own their cars, their cars own them.

The US birthrate stayed low until WWII ended, because most adult males were in the armed services and separated from their wives and sweethearts.<br><br>After a brief postwar recession, the USA enjoyed a long period of economic expansion fueled by several factors: pent up demand for consumer goods that had been rationed during wartime; the national agricultural and industrial base had not been destroyed by the war; large domestic supplies of oil and coal; continued high military spending; social policies and taxation that distributed wealth to all classes except the very poor. The result was that many people could afford to marry young and have a lot of children. They did. The needs of these large families for housing, consumer goods and education further stimulated the economy in a positive feedback loop.<br><br>The Baby Boom generation, counted from 1946 to 1960 or later, was much larger than the generations that immediately preceded it and followed it. As it gets older, it has been compared to a rat being swallowed and digested by a python (the entire US population). <br><br>It is the combination of being a large population of roughly the same age, economic expansion and physical security for over a decade during its youth that molded the outlook of the Baby Boomers.

I'm also reading McPherson's work in the light of at least some of his earlier work -- for example, his claim less than a decade ago that by 2013 there would be no more cars on the road because all the fuel would have run out.

Last time we had such a conjunction was in 1988 around the time of the dissolution of the Eastern bloc. The last opposition was around 2008 almost collapsing capitalism. In a very simple extrapolation I take it that conjunctions of these two planets mark dissolution of "left wing" ideas/powers/movements and oppostions of these two planets cause or mark dissolution or disturbances of right wing powers.<br><br>The opposition of 1965-1966 is an obvious example of left wing power disturbing the power of the right wing. The conjunction of 1942 is at the peak of Nazi expansion. 1920 Opposition was Russian Civil War with bolsheviks coming out on top. 1897 conjunction was Gilded Age with low social progress. <br><br>Saturn represents conservatism and Uranus radicalism with new ideas. <br><br>The approaching square of the two planets is in 2020-2022 and corresponds to the next conjunction in 2020 of jupiter and saturn so marks some instability similar to early 60s, early 80s and early 2000s and early 40s. Lots of factors always at play here but really there are only so many planets. <br><br>This marks a social mood. Mid phase jupiter-Saturn(1970/1990/2010) is quite liberal and conjunction 1940/1960/1980/2000/2020/2040 is conservative. <br><br>So conjunction of saturn and uranus 2032 and opposition of jupiter saturn in 2030 mark oppsite influnces. The first is against the left and the second is pro-left. So maybe these will cancel one another. But as we have seen in 1990 Russia blew up despite relatively same planetary influences. Maybe China will be in for this treatment next time(internal collapse or similar) although you can hardly call what they have "communism" except nominally.<br><br>I hope mundane astrology is an accptable comment. World end predictions are only good when discussing the long term future of the solar system as a whole or when scientists discuss possibility of methane hydrates going out of control. Nuke problems early 60s and 80s and WWII early 40s gave people similar feelings however. I am sure first half of next decade will give similar surprises for us and then we will all calm down again(From early 60s Beatles "Hard Day's Night" to mild "Let it Be, Let it Be". Same trend seen in early 80s new wave to ca. 1990 in music, etc.)<br><br>So a focus on cycles avoids end of world clap-trap and inevitably lands in mundane astrology territory or other cyclical historical analytical techniques whose authors you have often discussed.<br><br>Still, hype makes money. Maybe someone has a good idea for an ETOWAWKI book ca. 2030. Getting rich quick as a bad author would save the pain of a bad conscience at any rate.<br><br><a href=#c5209606955502308051 title="comment permalink">1/12/14, 4:17 AM</a><br><br>

Though I am not sure exactly what it is a picture of. I see two state changes -- one in the late 1970s, and one in 2008. The "business cycle" is evident and reasonable well-behaved through 2008, but starting around 1978 you see a big sustained bubble in employment that peaked in the 1990s. Then, the last 5-6 years are an unprecedented flat period, and the first recession that did not turn around in to a recovery pretty sharply. You could say that what changed in the late 70s was that women entered the work force en masse; but the economy still came up with jobs for them!

It would work for sure, I just never thought of doing that. In fact jerusalem artichokes (for example) do form blocks of vegetables inside these systems on their own.<br><br>However, if you look at how nature grows edible plants in a natural environment then you'll notice straight away that they are in what appears to our eyes to be a random collection.<br><br>By the way, did you check out the lists of useful and edible plants in the article?<br><br>Nice, neat vegetable gardens are efficient, but inevitably their yields decrease over time as the soil is strip mined due to the lack of plant and animal diversity (think Irish potato famine). Yes, before people skewer me for that example, please remember that of the hundreds of potato species available from South Amercia, the Irish at the time selected just two and both were susceptible to blight. The sheer volume, spread and lack of diversity of those plants made easy pickings for the blight too.<br><br>Nice and neat are however easy to pick from for humans, but this also just makes it less confusing for pests (birds, insects, diseases etc) to pick from as well. They want lunch too.<br><br>There are few, if any free lunches in nature, it just depends when the bill becomes payable.<br><br>The other thing that comes to mind is how do you tell a flower or herb from a flowering vegetable? Seriously, I let all of the vegetables here go to flower and seed. I ask you, why would a plant grown for flowers be any different from a flowering vegetable? Flowering carrots for example support many beneficial insects that happily consume other problem insects and thus brings the system closer to balance. It's complex.<br><br>My gut feel is that people spend a lot of time trying to break larger things down into smaller categories of understanding.

This isn't the place for a play by play, but the outcome is that many ideologies whose stated function was to redistribute wealth at the time used a very elegant trope to their end. "There is plenty to go around, if we just work together." is the conditional form, the declarative form is "We are all in this together!"<br><br>It is a powerful move, and very adaptive to the era which bore it. It functioned in several of the popular moral systems of the time, and it matched with the appearances of the time and the myth of progress with some simple tailoring. It provided a very important rallying point for people contending to adjust the distribution of the Imperial spoils, which was very important at the time, as poor distribution was a hazard to the system's smooth functions, and the humanitarian cost of most distribution systems features lots of not strictly necessary human tragedies and death.<br><br>The two forms are important, the conditional form has a bit of reason to it, following from an assumption to a conclusion. Given plenty to go around, if we can collaborate with the distribution and work together we can end . It is an 'iffy' conditional, but at least it states the key 'if'. A stated 'if' can be thought about.<br><br>"We are all in this together, against death and tragedy." Is an unspoken axiom which appears in many many ideologies today. Suppose a certain Arch Druid were to posit "There is not plentiful wealth to end human tragedies and deaths." A reaction resembling the form "If there isn't enough to prevent human tragedies, then all of us together will die tragically." is not surprising in the least.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c2320079144214377706 title="comment permalink">1/13/14, 9:01 AM</a><br><br>

As a member of a younger generation, and a man who generally keeps my finger on the pulses of many groups, I feel strongly that the hot embers of hostility felt by my age mates toward our elders is certainly something that should not have fuel poured over it. On the other hand maybe I just don't have a strong enough stomach to shoot fish in a barrel. Which is what critiquing mainstream baby boomers amounts to. As a member of a generation, millennial, comparably dysfunctional in terms of having been brought up with a baseline for reality which is completely dysfunctional, it doesn't take much imagination to understand the very real inner challenges the baby boomers have had in trying to overcome their upbringing; on the other hand, the depths of the consequences from what has come to pass merit a serious polemic. A similar polemic could be fielded against much of my generation, and a number of my yet unvanquished habits, but my generation has the advantage, in terms of overcoming our upbringing, of some very through schooling at Hard Knocks University. <br><br>I attend a Men's Group of upper middle class liberal Christian baby boomers. They are the cliché of every critique of their generation which could be launched, and they lived in positions of great power, and used their privileged on their on things which to them seem completely reasonable and normal, even to their perspective morally courageous. They tell war stories about the triumph of their political reforms, and the way that Obama fulfills the prophecy of their people. Though they seem to me in a permanent adolescents, lovable scamps with little ill will, but friendly intentions alone do not make a good man.<br><br>Greer was fairly careful to note that there were "noble exceptions" to the generalization that boomers chose privilege over ideals, there is a real danger that those types of qualifications, which are essential, drop from the conversation as the heat of the youths discomfort increases.<br><br>As for the 1% thing, dude, that sounds like projection. Just as their are noble boomers, their are noble ultra powerful, though in both cases they maybe rare. And consider how the 99% over history is filled with many a variety of deep depravity. The various non ruling classes can contain some real monsters, its just that on an individual basis they don't get as many opportunities to frack the big seams. Lower class people cannot blame white, blue, and no collar vices on the machinations of Rulers. Rulers aren't that skillful, doubly so today's 1%.<br><br><a href=#c7046111402948171769 title="comment permalink">1/13/14, 2:14 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not sure if I will regret it. Don't I have to plan some pathways to get around? <br><br>It seems like a good idea to get a few of each vegetable started, mix them up, and then in a couple of weeks do it all over again, so that you have a younger set and not all things ripening at once. On the other hand, some things grow slowly, and you don't want to wait to long, such as tomatoes and squash.<br><br>I'm wondering if I do that perhaps it won't be necessary to carefully rotate crops, as they'll mimic a natural landscape.<br><br>However, about the strip mining, I don't really see that my proposed method would really change that? Isn't that what compost, manure and perhaps kelp are for?<br>I'm not sure I understand what you mean about the difference between a flowering vegetable and a flowering flower. I'm pretty well obsessed with my flower garden. I'm told lilies are delicious, but haven't tried them yet. We do make tea out of the bee balm after it stops flowering. It's quite delicious. Vegetable plants do flower, but mostly are smaller. Tomatoes make tiny flowers. Squashes and such make bigger ones, but low to the ground. These, you have to let flower. An herb like basil, you want to pinch off the flowers until late in the season, or it will stop making the delicious leaves. Are you suggesting I view my vegetables as a flower garden, or plant flowers among them? <br>I find that a bit funny - I have a small lawn surrounded by flowers like fox gloves, irises, day lilies, and gladiolus.

Whatever it was, it cleared the way for the huge expansion of the labor force and the mass movement of women in to it. As I mentioned before, it can't have just been because women started working; had their not actually been more jobs available they really would have just been taking jobs from men and total employment would have stayed the same. But that's not what happened. <br><br>Relevant to one primary topic of this blog, I wondered if that overall trend might track oil production per capita But that peaked , both globally and domestically, in the 1970s. It was declining while the job market was exploding. So that is a no-go.<br><br>Another thing that happened in the late 1970 was the conversion of the U.S. dollar to a pure fiat currency. This enabled the creation of massive amounts of imaginary wealth. But, wealth does not create jobs unless it is tied to meaningful economic activity, which this imaginary wealth generally is not. <br><br>This brings me to my final thought, globalization and the wealth pump. The boom in jobs may well coincide with a real ramping up of the U.S's imperial wealth pump via "free trade" arrangements. If this is what drove the boom, interesting that it is no longer working. Maybe the WTO pushed it too far and the wealth pump started flowing the other way? I'm not sure what economic metrics to look at to evaluate that part of the puzzle.<br><br><a href=#c837085001253472803 title="comment permalink">1/13/14, 9:45 PM</a><br><br>

One reason why the generational cycle is clear in the U.S. and not so clear elsewhere is that the U.S. has been blessedly free of the kind of disasters that disrupt the cycle, the major exception being the Civil War.<br><br>I thought JMG has been reasonably clear that he’s sticking to the U.S., where he has experience, rather than trying to talk about the rest of the world.<br><br>@YJV<br><br>I’m not sure I’d classify any theory of history as science, so having mainstream historians call something they don’t like a “pseudo-science” is a bit rich. As I commented to Fidelius just above this, generations don’t synchronize across countries or cultures, so I find your comment about the upcoming generations in the East being a Prophet generation interesting. Here in the U.S., the Millenials are a Civic/Hero generation, and are showing all the signs of a non-jelled Civic/Hero generation. Whether they’ll actually jell and do something useful? Only time will tell.<br><br>In any case, three of the four generation types reject most of what their Prophet ancestors stood for. The only one that doesn’t is the one that follows the Civic/Hero generations: that type of generation is more interested in bringing the benefits to the people who got left out.<br><br>@Ed Boyle<br><br>I think you’re over-analyzing it. Saturn benefits people and systems that do the hard, thankless work of doing whatever it is right, without falling into delusions and building jury-rigged structures on the shifting sand. Uranus represents changes, but as far as I can tell it doesn’t have a preference about what changes or what direction the change is going to go. When the two get together structures that aren’t sound are challenged and tend to fall apart. This contrasts with Saturn and Neptune, where unsound structures just vanish without your noticing, leading to Wile Coyote moments - the ones where he realizes he’s run off a cliff, looks down and then starts falling.<br><br>@JMG, others<br><br>The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes six, that is, SIX, different “unemployment rates,” labeled U1 to U6. The headline rate, which is the one you see in the main-stream media, is U2. If you want to understand actual unemployment, you need to ignore the headline rate and do a deeper dive into the statistics. Flailing at the headline rate as being inaccurate is, as far as I’m concerned, a mug’s game. Of course it’s inaccurate. It’s a preliminary estimate - not all the data is in yet, and that’s why they publish other rates.<br><br>The participation rate is a good one to keep an eye on: it’s the rate at which working-age people are actually working regardless of whether they want to work, and it’s not at all healthy. You won’t see this discussed in the MSM, though, to any great extent.<br><br>@Bill Pullam.<br><br>I also check with sources, and I don’t trust Wikipedia as the final work when I have access to the actual scholars.<br><br>@JMG on Strauss and Howe<br><br>I agree that they aren’t all that good as a theory of history in general. Where they shine, in my opinion, is in tying together generational archetypes with the feel of historical eras. Beyond that, they’re pretty useless. That’s why I pulled them in for a discussion of the Boomers, who aren’t all that different from the preceding Prophet generations in their ideological certainty. As far as I’m concerned, blaming the Boomers for being ideological and trying to stuff it down everyone else’s throat is about as meaningful as blaming a wolf for being a carnivore.<br><br>For anything else in the historical cycle, elsewhere is a good place to look.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c1767788002270031937 title="comment permalink">1/14/14, 7:09 AM</a><br><br>

I have actually heard a fair bit of discussion of this in the mainstream media, especially in the context of explaining why the drops in the "unemployment rate" are not necessarily "good." I get my mainstream news mostly from NPR, being a broadcast-TV-free household. But I'd imagine it has gotten coverage in the conservative cable news also, since it feeds well into the narrative of Obama destroying America. <br><br>Much was said lately in the media that work force participation has dropped to levels unseen since the early 1980s. So I looked up a graph of the data from 1950 to the present. I don't have it in front of me so I am speaking from memory, but it was just a few days ago. <br><br>As I recall, the participation rate for men has been dropping continuously from 1950 to the present, boom or bust. It was extremely high, like 95%, at the start. I suspect (have no data to support this, but I expect others do) that a major contributor to this drop has been inreasing longevity and more widespread retirement. In 1950 men retired at 65, if ever, and died at 69, so there was not a whole lot of gap in there. Work participation by women rose steadily from something like 20% up to well over 50%, then began to tail off in the last 5 years. The rate of decline for men did slacken during the 90s boom years (while the rate for women was peaking), and then the male decline accelerated after the turn of the milllenium. But the curves for men and women are both surprisingly smooth, without the big business-cycle ups and downs shown by that jobs versus population graph. And the present-day participation, widely viewed as alarming, is still miles above where it was in the 1950s, an economic boom time.<br><br>I have to wonder if reduced workforce participation is really a bad thing. I think it is more likely to be an appropriate and intelligent response to a contracting economy. It seems likely it will be the key to reestablishing the household economy, and larger community economy, that long comprised the foundation for societies and on top of which the commercial economy rested.<br><br><a href=#c7842160435224776812 title="comment permalink">1/14/14, 1:38 PM</a><br><br>
