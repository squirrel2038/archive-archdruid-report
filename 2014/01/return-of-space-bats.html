"Some seventeen notable empires rose in the Middle Period of Earth. These were the Afternoon Cultures. All but one are unimportant to this narrative, and there is little need to speak of them save to say that none of them lasted for less than a millennium, none for more than ten; that each extracted such secrets and obtained such comforts as its nature (and the nature of the Universe) enabled it to find; and that each fell back from the Universe in confusion, dwindled, and died.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The last of them left its name written in the stars, but no-one who came later could read it. More important, perhaps, it built enduringly despite its failing strength—leaving certain technologies that, for good or ill, retained their properties of operation for well over a thousand years. And more important still, it <i>was</i> the last of the Afternoon Cultures, and was followed by evening, and by Viriconium.”<br>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those are the opening lines of <i>The Pastel City</i> by M. John Harrison, one of the fixtures of my arguably misspent youth. I pulled it down from my shelf of old paperbacks the other day, for the first time in years, and spent part of an evening rereading it. There were several reasons for that. Partly it was a fit of nostalgia; partly, I’ve finished all but the last minor edits on
<i>Star’s Reach</i>, my post-peak oil SF novel, preparatory to placing it with a publisher, and was thinking back on some of the other fictional explorations of the coming deindustrial future I’ve read; partly—well, there’s a practical reason, but we’ll get to that a little later on in this post. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There were any number of books like it back in the day, mass-market SF paperbacks with gaudy covers ringing variations on a handful of familiar themes. You could almost describe <i>The Pastel City</i>
as an example of what used to be called the sword and sorcery genre, one of the standard modes of 1970s fantasy, except that there isn’t any sorcery. The weird powers and monstrous enemies against which tegeus-Cromis the swordsman and his motley allies do battle are surviving relics of advanced technology, and the deserts of rust and the windblown ruins through which they pursue their fairly standard heroic quest are the remnants of an industrial society a millennium dead. In a real sense, it belongs to a genre of its own, which I suppose ought to be called postindustrial fantasy.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I first read it in the bleak little apartment where my father lived, in a down-at-the-heels Seattle suburb. Not long before, just as soon as he finished paying her way through college, my mother dumped my father like a sack of old clothes, and followed through on the metaphor by taking him to the cleaners in the divorce settlement. He took what refuge he could find in model airplanes, jigsaw puzzles, and science fiction novels, and I used to catch a bus north from my mother’s house to spend weekends with him. His apartment was a short walk from the library, which was one blessing, and close to a hobby shop where I could fritter away my allowance on spacecraft models, which was another; still, many of the best hours I recall from those days were spent curled up on his secondhand couch, reading the volumes of science fiction he’d bring home from the little bookstore six blocks away. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<i>The Pastel City</i> was one of those. I recall vividly the first time I read it, because it’s the book that first suggested to me that an industrial society could crumble away to ruins without benefit of apocalyptic fireworks and be succeeded by simpler societies. What was more, the last Afternoon Culture was simply backstory, no more immediately relevant to tegeus-Cromis and his friends than the fall of Rome is to you and me, and the wastelands, the marshes gone brackish with metallic salts, the dead and half-drowned city called Thing Fifty, and most of the other relics of that vanished time were just part of the landscape. It was easy for me, as I sat there on the couch, to imagine the wreckage of today’s world forming the background for adventures a thousand years in our own future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I was curled up on the same couch when I first read
<i>Davy</i> by Edgar Pangborn. He’s mostly forgotten these days, but Pangborn’s was a name to conjure with in the more literate end of the science fiction scene of the 1960s and 1970s, and <i>Davy</i> was much of the reason why. It’s a coming-of-age story—shall be literary and call it a <i>Bildungsroman</i>?—that goes on the same Platonic ideal of a bookshelf as <i>Tom Jones</i> and <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, except that it takes place about five centuries from now in what’s left of northeastern North America. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Pangborn’s future history is as precise as it is uncomfortably plausible. There was a nuclear war, which killed a lot of people, and an epidemic among the survivors, which killed a lot more. Rising sea levels driven by global warming—yes, Pangborn was already onto that in 1964—flooded the lowlands. Stick in time’s oven and bake for centuries, and you’ve got a world of neofeudal statelets with more or less medieval subsistence economies clinging to the threadbare rhetoric of an earlier day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Here’s Davy’s description of his world: “Katskil is a kingdom. Nuin is a commonwealth, with a hereditary presidency of absolute powers. Levannon is a kingdom, but governed by a Board of Trade. Lomeda and the other Low Countries are ecclesiastical states, the boss panjandrum being called a Prince Cardinal. Rhode, Vairmant, and Penn are republics; Conicut’s a kingdom; Bershar is mostly a mess. But they’re all great democracies, and I hope this will grow clearer to you one day when the ocean is less wet.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those ecclesiastical states aren’t Christian, by the way, but they might as well be. Pangborn was gay, and thus got an extra helping of the hypocrisy and intolerance that characterize American Christianity in its worst moods; he was accordingly an atheist; and his Holy Murcan Church was partly a parody of the mainstream American churches of his time, partly the standard atheist caricature of the medieval Catholic church, and partly a counterblast against Walter M. Miller’s <i>A Canticle for Leibowitz</i>, with its portrayal of Catholicism as a force for good in a future dark age America. Those of my readers who are atheists will enjoy that side of <i>Davy</i>; those who aren’t may find Pangborn’s bouts of religion-bashing annoying, or if they’ve heard the same talking points often enough elsewhere, simply dull. Fortunately there’s plenty more in
<i>Davy</i> that makes it worth the read anyway.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Brilliant though it was, <i>Davy</i> still followed the conventions of the then-thriving postapocalyptic genre and didn’t quite manage, as <i>The Pastel City</i> did, to think its way right out from under the myth of progress and stop seeing history as a straight line that always leads back to us. Pangborn thus needed, or thought he needed, the
<i>diabolus ex machina</i> of a nuclear war to bring Old Time crashing down. I forgave him that because his nuclear war wasn’t the usual canned Hollywood death-fantasy, just a bunch of cities being blasted to rubble, a lot of corpses, and high rates of sterility and birth defects among the descendants of the survivors, followed by normal decline and recovery. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Pangborn’s own summary is typically succinct: “barbarism, not actually ‘like’ Fifth Century Europe because history can’t repeat itself that way, but just as dark. Here and there enclaves where some of the valuable bits of the old culture survived. In some places, primitive savagery in its varied forms; and monarchies, petty states, baronies, whatever. Then through many centuries, a gradual recovery toward some other peak of some other kind of civilization. Without the resources squandered by the 20th Century.” That’s from <i>Still I Persist In Wondering</i>, an anthology of short stories set in the same future as <i>Davy</i>, as <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>were two other novels of his, <i>The Judgment of Eve</i> and <i>The Company of Glory</i>. Yes, I read all of them, many times; those of my readers who followed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Star’s Reach</i> and pick up Pangborn’s tales will doubtless catch the deliberate homages I put in my story, and probably some influences I didn’t intend that sneaked in anyway. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The third book I want to mention here didn’t come to my attention until long after the secondhand couch went out of my life, but it came at another bleak time. That was the autumn of 1982, toward the end of my first unsuccessful pass through college, and right about the time it was becoming painfully clear that the great leap toward a sustainable future through appropriate technology, in which I planned on making my career, wasn’t going to happen after all. Those were the years when the Reagan administration’s gutting of grant money for every kind of green initiative was really starting to hit home, and attempts to mobilize any kind of support for those initiatives were slamming face first into the simple fact that most Americans wanted to cling to their cozy lifestyles even if that meant flushing their grandchildren’s future down the drain. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Somewhere in the middle of that autumn, under a hard gray sky, I went for a long and random walk in the grimy end of downtown Bellingham, Washington, down past old canneries and retail buildings that used to serve the working waterfront when there still was one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Somewhere in there was a shop selling girlie mags—this was before the internet, when those who liked pictures of people with their clothes off had to go buy them from a store—and out in front, for no reason I was ever able to figure out, was a tray of non-erotic used paperbacks for 50 cents each. I had a dollar to spare; I stopped to look through them, and that’s how I found <i>The Masters of Solitude</i> by Marvin Kaye and Parke Godwin. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If <i>The Pastel City</i> is sword and sorcery without the sorcery, <i>The Masters of Solitude</i> might best be described as a post-apocalyptic novel without the apocalypse. It’s a three-handed poker game of a story set maybe two thousand years<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>from now in the eastern United States. From Karli in the south to Wengen in the north runs Coven country, a tribal realm following a faith and a culture descended from today’s Wicca. Off in what’s now western Pennsylvania are the Kriss, who worship a dead god. To the east, the urban enclave that extends from Boston down to Washington DC is simply the City, its people maintaining high technology with solar power, living for centuries by way of advanced organ-transplant techniques, sealing out the rest with an electronic barrier that shreds minds. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Long ago things were different; everyone in the world of
<i>The Masters of Solitude</i> remembers that, however dimly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then the land was invaded and conquered by another people, the Jings, who left their name and some of their genetics and then faded from history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Out of the ordinary chaos of a fallen civilization, the ordinary process of reorganization and cultural coalescence birthed new societies drawing in various ways on the legacies of the past. It’s history the way it actually happens, the normal rise and fall of nations and cultures, and it’s in the course of their ordinary history, the Covens, the Kriss, and the City stumble toward a confrontation that will shatter them all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There were other books that could go into a list of postindustrial fantasy classics, of course, and I may talk about some of them another day. Still, the question I suspect a fair number of my readers are wondering is why any of this matters. Modern industrial civilization is beginning to pick up speed along a trajectory of decline and fall that differs from the ones we’ve just discussed in that it’s not safely confined to the realm of imaginative fiction. Is there any point in reading about imaginary societies that fell back from the Universe, dwindled, and died, when ours is doing that right now? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As it happens, I think there is. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Most of what’s kept people in today’s industrial world from coming to grips with the shape and scale of our predicament is precisely the inability to imagine a future that’s actually different from the present. Francis Fukuyama’s proclamation of the end of history may have been a masterpiece of unintentional comedy—I certainly read it in that light—but it spoke for an attitude that has deep roots all through contemporary culture. Nor is that attitude limited to the cornucopians who can’t imagine any future that isn’t a linear continuation of the present; what is it that gives the contemporary cult of apocalypse fandom its popularity, after all, but a conviction that the only alternative to a future just like the present<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>is quite precisely no future at all? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It would be pleasant if human beings were so constituted that this odd myopia of the imagination could be overcome by the simple expedient of pointing out all the reasons why it makes no sense, or by noting how consistently predictions made on that basis turn out to be abject flops. Unfortunately, that doesn’t happen to be the case. My regular readers will long since have noticed how easily believers in a business-as-usual future brush aside such issues as though nobody ever mentioned them at all, and keep on insisting that of course we can keep an industrial system running indefinitely because, well, because we <i>can</i>, just you watch!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The only thing I can think of that compares with this is the acrobatic ingenuity with which believers in imminent apocalypse keep on coming up with new reasons why this week’s prediction of mass death must be true when all previous examples have turned out dead wrong. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What underlies both of these curious phenomena, and a great many other oddities of contemporary culture, is simply that the basic building blocks of human thinking aren’t facts or logical relationships, but stories. The narratives we know are the patterns by which we make sense of the world; when the facts or the testimony of logic don’t fit one narrative, and we have a selection of other narratives to hand, we can compare one story to another and find the one that’s the best fit to experience. That process of comparison is at the heart of logic and science, and provides a necessary check on the normal tendency of the human mind to get stuck on a single story even when it stops making sense. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As I pointed out here <a href=../../2006/05/knowing-only-one-story.html>in the earliest days of this blog</a>, though, that check doesn’t work if you only have one story handy—if, for example, the story of onward and upward progress forever is the only story about the future you know. Then it doesn’t matter how badly the story explains the facts on the ground, or how many gross violations of logic are needed to explain away the mismatches: given a choice between a failed narrative and no narrative at all, most people will cling to the one they have no matter how badly it fits. That’s the game in which both the cornucopians and the apocalypse fans are engaged; the only difference between them, really, is that believers in apocalypse have decided that the way to make the story of progress make sense is to insist that we’re about to reach the part of it that says “The End.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The one way out of that trap is to learn more stories—not simply rehashes of the same plot with different names slapped on the characters, mind you, but completely different narrative structures that, applied to the same facts and logical relationships, yield different predictions. That’s what I got from the three novels I’ve discussed in this post. All three were fictions, to be sure, but all three were about that nebulous place we call the future, and all three gave me narratives I could compare with the narrative of progress to see which made the better fit to the facts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>I’ve met enough other people who’ve had similar experiences that I’ve come to think of fiction about the future as a powerful tool for getting outside the trap of knowing just one story, and thus coming to grips with the failure of that story and the need to understand the future ahead of us in very different ways. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All of which brings me to the practical dimension of this week’s post. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A few weeks ago, I fielded an email from the proprietor of the small publishing house that released <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2012/10/on-sale-after-oil-sf-visions-of-post.html>After Oil: SF Visions of a Post-Petroleum Future</a>, the anthology of stories that came out of the peak oil fiction contest I held here in 2011 and 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was pleased to report that sales have been modest but steady—contributors should expect a statement and royalty check shortly—and asked about whether I was perhaps interested in putting together a second anthology along the same lines. (He also expressed a definite interest in hearing from writers who have novels on peak oil-related themes and are looking for a place to publish them; those of my readers who fall into this category—I know you’re out there—will want to check out the <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/p/submissions_14.html>submissions requirements</a> page on the Founders House website.)</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m certainly game for a second story contest, and for editing a second anthology; given the torrent of creativity that the last contest called forth, I don’t expect to have any trouble fielding an abundance of good stories from this blog’s readers, either, so the contest is on. The requirements are the same as before: </div>
<ul style="text-align: left">
<li>Stories should be between 2500 and 7500 words in length; </li>
<li>They should be entirely the work of their author or authors, and should not borrow characters or setting from someone else’s work;</li>
<li>They should be in English, with correct spelling, grammar and punctuation; </li>
<li>They should be stories—narratives with a plot and characters—and not simply a guided tour of some corner of the future as the author imagines it; </li>
<li>They should be set in our future, not in an alternate history or on some other planet;</li>
<li>They should be works of realistic fiction or science fiction, not magical or supernatural fantasy—that is, the setting and story should follow the laws of nature as those are presently understood;</li>
<li>They should deal directly with the impact of peak oil, and the limits to growth in general, on the future; and as before,</li>
<li>They must not rely on <a href=../../2011/09/invasion-of-space-bats.html>“alien space bats”</a>—that is, <i>dei ex machina</i> inserted to allow humanity to dodge the consequences of the limits to growth. (Aspiring authors might want to read the whole “Alien Space Bats” post for a more detailed explanation of what I mean here.) </li>
</ul>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That is to say, the stories that will find a place in the second anthology, like those that populated the first, will feature human beings like you and me, coping with the aftermath of the industrial age in a world that could reasonably be our future, and living lives that are challenging, interesting, and maybe even appealing in that setting. I’d like to make an additional suggestion this time around: don’t settle for your<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>ordinary, common or garden variety postpetroleum future. Make it plausible, make it logical, but make it
<i>different</i>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style='font-family: Times; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode"; mso-fareast-language: #00FF; mso-font-kerning: .5pt'>The mechanics are also the same as before. Write your story and post it to the internet—if you don’t have a blog, you can get one for free from <a href=http://www.blogspot.com/ >Blogspot</a> or <a href=http://wordpress.com/ >Wordpress</a>. Post a link to it in the comments section of this blog. Yes, you can write more than one story, and yes, that will increase your chances of making the cut. The contest ends at the beginning of May, so get typing; for reasons I’ll discuss in next week’s post, we may just be entering into a window of opportunity in which new visions of the future could have a significant impact, and it might as well be your vision, dear reader, that helps make that happen.</span></div>

The Pastel City was a mainstay of my late-childhood; I read it repeatedly, and its phrases are etched into my brain like chunks of Tolkien, Auden, Conan Doyle, Eliot... Nothing else that MJH ever wrote had for me the same resonance. "Tegeus-Cromis, who fancied himself a better poet than a swordsman..." ah yes. Maybe time to re-read!<br><br>Davy was on my early reading list too; and Masters of Solitude blew me away on first reading. It's a pleasure to be reminded of these good books (2 out of 3 still on my shelves, ragged with age and use). <br><br>In the genre I'd also recommend Strange Cargo and other novels by J Barlough -- they chronicle the doings of a reduced, but thriving civilisation isolated in the Pacific Northwest during a new (but not excessively severe) Ice Age. What happened to the rest of North America is somewhat obscure, but the locals are getting on with their lives using sail, steam, and woolly mammoths for transport. Charming hommage-a-Dickens stuff.<br><br>Another view of a grimy and slowly shrinking future is found in Lee Killough's underrated future police-procedurals -- Doppelganger Gambit, Spider Play, and I think Dragon's Teeth. They showed us a future with some high-tech gizmos to wow us... but most people ride bikes, hardly anyone can afford a hovercar, grass grows in the under-maintained streets, and people are lining up to escape the malfunctioning and impoverished societies of Earth by taking a one-way trip on a colony ship. The colony ships, of course, are pure fantasy; but the bicycles, the roommate hassles (housing is expensive and hard to come by), the conflicts between an intensely intrusive government with surveillance technology to spare and rebel citizens who resist assimilation... it's all pretty real.<br><br>Honourable mention also to Bruce Sterling for his Decline Fiction works such as Heavy Weather and Distraction (the latter is an absolute hoot!). I think Margaret Atwood deserves a nod for The Year of the Flood and Oryx and Crake, though these are more about the end of homo sapiens and our replacement with something less destructive... OK enough for one night, I'll have to scan my shelves and see what more we can find in the Decline&amp;FallSoWhat section.<br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c6356827367511594866 title="comment permalink">1/22/14, 9:53 PM</a><br><br>

In a real sense, it belongs to a genre of its own, which I suppose ought to be called postindustrial fantasy."<br><br>Oh, that's an interesting name for a genre that didn't have one before. I like it, enough so to add three other works to your list.<br><br>First, "Star Man's Son" by Andre Norton. It was a standard post-apocalyptic adventure, set 300 years after a nuclear war, but it really read more like a fantasy adventure. That was a common trait of Norton's. She really had a great talent for weird settings with fantasy elements, but she placed a lot of her fiction out in space, so it was classified as science fiction.<br><br>Second, "Hiero's Journey" by Sterling Lanier, set millennia after another nuclear war. It has all the elements of a fantasy heroic quest, but each of the fantastic features are all explained scientifically. Also, it was published after The Club of Rome, and the author took the conclusions of that study to heart, setting the nuclear war as a one over resources once they peaked and began to run out. He also incorporated global warming, as the story takes place around what is now the great lakes, but has become a tropical forest around an inland sea.<br><br>Finally, I have some foreign media, the Japanese cartoon (anime) "Scrapped Princess." It starts off like a high fantasy, but the truth behind the facade peeks out early with the spell circles looking like semiconductor circuit diagrams. It turns out that the magic comes from nanotechnology and AIs. Oh, and the space bats appear, but they set people back to medieval technology instead of allowing humanity to continue advancing technologically. They decided that humans were too much of a threat.<br><br>As for the science fiction contest, I'm interested.<br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c4780458145655114143 title="comment permalink">1/22/14, 10:05 PM</a><br><br>

Most often, if you think you're not following a narrative, it's because you're not aware of the narrative you're following -- and in that case it's usually some wretched bit of pop culture that's slipped in without your noticing it. In my experience it works much better to have a wealth of stories, and learn how to play with them freely in full awareness of what you're doing. <br><br>DeAnander, delighted to hear it! I haven't read either Barlough or Killough -- I dropped current SF pretty much completely when cuberpunk came in; I was living in Seattle in those days, and had to deal with far too much hacker-and-slacker culture to want to get it warmed over in my SF, thanks.

That election was a major turning point, and decades of reflection upon it has made me despair that it could have turned out any differently, not like the 2000 election.

The future is not a given thing, it is something that can be influenced by us. So stories are not only about what may happen in the future, it is also about what we will make happen in the future. <br><br>Take the doomsday preppers and their story of civilizational failure: They expect a future of civilization decaying and losing the ability to provide for the people in shared specialized and interdependend work. So they withdraw to their homes and learn to provide for themselves. With this behaviour they make their story happen since they withdraw from the shared specialized and interdependen work system. They don't prepare for a given future, they make their very future and since they only know one story, this is the story they make happen. <br><br>I think all of your readers got your point that there will be no star trek future and there will be no apocalytic end to our civilzation that is worth a hollyood movie. As you said in you older post, knowing many stories is wisdom, and the long decline you are proposing is - as i think - just one possible future. <br><br>Shouldn't we stop talking about what is not going to happen and start acting to make things happen? Shouldn't we find as many possible stories to our future that are doable within our physical realms? And then choose the one that has the most appeal and make it happen?<br><br>The interesting story in the world of tomorrow is not the US, and it is also not Europe, the interesting story is about India and China. Not as political entities, but as civilizational entities. For many millennia those were in terms of technology, population and production the civilizational centers of the world. Read Jared Diamonds "Germs, Guns and Steel" to understand why. Their current growth is no surprise, since they just catch up towards their natural position among the planets civilizations. <br><br>The last decades they tried to copy the american story of progress. But now they reach a point where they realize that this story does not fit for them. Physical and ecologic boundaries together with the setting american sun make this story less appealing. But while the americans only have the story of progress in an infinite world, since this is their national experience, the old civilizations of asia have many other stories to tell. And unlike the american politicians, who just care about keeping what they have within the current system, there are leaders who are willing to shape and design a future. <br><br>Civilization is something that is hard to undo. Switching from an urban specialized lifestyle to the one of subsistent farming is as long a way as the other direction. So once you have a specialized workforce, you are locked and forced to stick to that, so civilization has a lot of momentum. The same is true for technology. Once you forgot the old traditional means to solve a certain problem and adopted the new technology for it, you have to stick to that, this can be bad, because this technology may have drawbacks, but it adds a lot to civilizational momentum. Additonally you also have cultural momentum. A civilization that is divided in castes is inherently specialized and interdependend. It is wired into the cultural software. The same is true for a civilization, whose major philosophy is about harmonie and putting oneself behind the others. <br><br>In our western centric worldview we always talk about mycenae and rome. Rising and falling civilizations are the story we know. Long declines or apocalyptic endings are just subsets of the story of rise and fall. The cultures along the great asian rivers tell a story of civilzation just muddling along history, having highs and lows. This may not appeal hollywood, but maybe ot appeals to the normal people living their normal lifes. <br><br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c2146083504381230097 title="comment permalink">1/22/14, 11:49 PM</a><br><br>

He did a three hour talk, similar to this 10 minute clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lwkyqFB-34<br><br>Among the story I told, which is interesting in itself, I highlighted the chart which the then Congressman felt was the most important chart of his presentation, to these fellows, in how the oil production trend line lagged but followed the oil discovery trendline upwards. Found here: http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=peak+oil+charts&amp;qpvt=peak+oil+charts&amp;FORM=IGRE#view=detail&amp;id=67E3545CC0CF61BD99C93F2DF8D8C1D7CCA9F6BD&amp;selectedIndex=189<br><br>I traced an imaginary chart on the table, their eyes widened as they followed my slow movements, with the thought of the implcations of oil production following discoveries downward. I cut them off from the end of the world idea right there by telling them such. <br><br>They understood less oil supply meeting a growing demand means higher prices. But they couldn't quite understand that a barrel of oil is worth 23,000 hours of human labor.<br><br>Then I said, $20 a gallon for gas is still a cheap price. And people are still going to buy it. Afterall, would you (meaning these fellows) walk all the way here to Manitowoc, or would you rather have bought $40 worth of gas and drive the 25 miles to get here and go back? Would you load up a donkey cart with stuff, or would gas buy gas and drive it here?<br><br>I had them all the way, nodding their heads and such, until we finished up with nothing left to do but pay the bill. Then the Senator's brother said, "they will think of something"!<br><br>Funny in contrast, our Wisconsin Governor was in high progressive form last night, giving a most positive speech.

If we do it unconsciously the transitions can be painful, because we try to hold on to the story as the facts change or as we realize that the story was always wrong, which most stories are to some degree or other. <br><br>I'm only in my early 50s, but I've lived through lots of interesting narratives already, within the overarching narrative of the peaking of industrial civilization: the social changes of the 1960s (which in the UK included the fading of the British Empire and the breakdown of class deference), the stagnation of the 70s, the "recovery" of the 80s, the supposed triumph of globalism and the American model at the close of the century, the beginnings of decline, the crisis of the last few years, etc. And those are just the big themes that reflected my sources and the way I saw the world. Lots of shorter stories within that, relationships and jobs and prosperity all coming and going. All swirling around. <br><br>I suppose the key is to enjoy the ride and not take it too seriously. But it does help to know that you are on a ride in the first place. Reading fiction can really help in that regard. Growing up in the Europe probably helped too - hard not to notice all those ruins lying around. It also helped that my father as a boy was living in Shanghai in 1937 and saw how quickly the lights could go out on certain social arrangements.

Some had some apocalyptic nuclear war or disaster bring down the world, some simply degenerated into some form of dictatorships, some wasted themselves in civil war, but the message was always clear: no civilization can last indefinitely, nor are people predisposed to survive in grinding poverty indefinitely.<br>Coincidentally, in the past couple of years, particularly since the discovery of the Staffordshire Hoard, historians have revisited the whole idea that a savage, primitive tribe called the Anglo-Saxons "conquered" England, because there is no real archaeological evidence for this. What the evidence (both on the ground and in the DNA) says is that an influx of immigrants and mercenaries arrived after the legions left, the centralized Roman government weakened and international trade broke down. This gave rise to mostly self-sufficient (and violently competitive) local tribes who created a new culture with astounding art and metalwork, but, sadly, no contemporary written records.<br>Similar reinterpretations across Europe produce a different view of the "dark ages" as being a time of beautiful architecture, exquisite arts, and not quite the scrabbling-in-the-dirt-constantly-surrounded-by-violent-bands-of-barbarians story that has been received history.<br>While many back-to-the-land groups failed when the romanticized rural life turned out to be very exhausting, hard work, a newer generation, with more realistic expectations, has been taking to rural life, taking full advantage of all agricultural knowledge gained in the past 200 years. <br>Put together, I think that the deindustrial future, while "hard" compared to our current luxurious lifestyle, might not be quite so harsh, bleak, and apocalyptic.<br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c3672847870954533620 title="comment permalink">1/23/14, 5:39 AM</a><br><br>

I think that your idea of needing more than one story is so true. At present our media, and our academic and government establishments are completely dominated by neoliberal ideas of free market capitalism. It is difficult for concerns about peak oil and resource constraints to get any kind of hearing in this kind of environment because it just does not fit in with this world view. I think that one of the reasons that concerns about resource constraints were able to get a hearing in the 1970’s, is due to the fact that marxism/socialism still had a strong voice and provided an alternative way of thinking to free market capitalism. Now I am not a fan of many aspects of marxism/socialism and am fully aware that they are ideologies of progress, and took little or no account of resource constraints or the environment. However I think that the fact that there was an alternative way of thinking in the 1970’s, helped to create a space where concerns about resource constraints could be heard. I think that this helps to demonstrate the point that you are making.<br><br><br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c4866091795963958053 title="comment permalink">1/23/14, 6:49 AM</a><br><br>

Still, all that's gone whistling down the wind of might-have-beens...<br><br>KL, delighted to hear it. <br><br>Deedl, er, I'd encourage you to pursue a closer study of Asian history, which has seen plenty of collapses and dark ages -- my theory of catabolic collapse, in fact, was largely shaped by extensive reading about the rise and fall of Chinese dynasties and how that mapped onto cycles of collapse and renewal. (I read Diamond's book years ago, by the way.) I certainly grant that right now, the rising Asian powers have a much longer historical perspective than what we have in place of leadership in the US; it remains to be seen how much help that'll give them in navigating the challenges of the near future.<br><br>Grebulocities, there weren't a lot of submissions for the Krampus challenge, I'm sorry to say -- which probably means nothing more than that my readership includes more talented writers than it does engineers and technologists. (No surprises there.) As far as timelines are concerned, that's wide open: near future, far future, so far in the future that our entire civilization is a matter of faintly remembered legends, take your pick.<br><br>Abelardsnazz, <i>Engine Summer</i> by John Crowley would definitely have gone on the list if I'd read it early enough, and so would two of his other novels, <i>Beasts</i> and <i>Little, Big</i> -- a brilliant writer, and his futures ring true to me. <br><br>Hadashi, I hadn't even thought of that! Thanks for the blast from the past. <br><br>Freebooter, a nicely developed metaphor. I trust you'll be applying that same skill with prose to a story for the contest!<br><br>Richard, ah, yes, the holy mantra of the One True Faith: "They'll think of something." Can I encourage all my readers to poke fun at that idiotic utterance in as many forums as possible? <br><br>Yupped, exactly. <br><br>Ando, my guess is we'll be hearing that mantra a great deal, in increasing tones of panic, in the months and years to come. "They'll think of something" is this culture's one and only story, after all. <br><br>Olduvai, no, it needs to be a self-contained short story. By all means set it in the same future and story line as your novels, though; there must be some bit of backstory or series of events off to one side of the main plot that can be told in short story form.<br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c4250201292534601396 title="comment permalink">1/23/14, 7:37 AM</a><br><br>

He began by talking about PIs or government officials tracking down business executives who, to avoid prosecution or for other reasons, decided to chuck it all, disappear and "start a new life." JK had training as a social scientist and somewhere he obtained facts and figures on this kind of thing. The statistics aparently showed overwhelmingly that it was actually pretty easy to track these people down (remember, this is before the internet, NSA, etc.), because they were incapable of actually changing their habits and way of life, and this always gave them away. JK proceeded to discuss the importance of literature, as a means of having alternate stories for one's life and to foster the imagination necessary to actually - in this case - escape one's past and to truly embark upon "a new life." <br><br>Those who have read JK's novels will readily appreciate how and why he had this "take" on literature, and on the subject matter he presented. Given JK's personal history, he was in deadly earnest about this - at one level, it was truly life or death. <br><br>Off topic, but a response you made to a reader of the last post about climate change mentioned that your own environs were a good place to "ride out the storm," so to speak. I am fairly new to the blog so pardon me asking, but have you ever discussed the process or grounds for the decision you made to locate where you live?<br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c7641403099213606649 title="comment permalink">1/23/14, 9:35 AM</a><br><br>

I was at the time busy with wwoofing through California, and my attempt at fiction only made it to a first draft before life forced my interest else where.<br><br>That draft was important though I never shared it with another soul. In it my own fantasies about tiny utopias in a collapsing world showed themselves in a form just distant enough from my own life plans that I could see them for what they were. Tolkien made some comment once about the suspension of disbelief being insufficient it must be "drawn and quartered" I believe he said. Seeing my own fantasies projected forward 90 some years I went back to read that draft a few months after I wrote it, and suddenly realized my own vision for responding to collapse didn't pass the test of suspending, let alone drawing and quartering, disbelief. Maybe as a more skillful writer I could have made it work, but the fact was that many things about my own hubris looked back from those pages.<br><br>Recently my way of earning money has left me with the occasional morning hour of freedom and I started a novel. Looking at the FHP site I will have to increase productivity by a couple pages a week to have time enough to edit the work into something I would feel comfortable submitting. But regardless, future fiction has helped me think and helped me as a communicator. So thank you.<br><br>I am going to try writing a short story in the world I have build around the novel. First thing though I need to reread some prose older than I to get in frame of mind. Thank you again for these prompts to cultivate the creative side of the mind.

The story is one of building tension between the US and Canada based upon natural gas resources in the Canadian Arctic. The US has suffered through a harsh winter and require access to the gas. Canada is trying to determine its requirements before agreeing to export any while the new Prime Minister is bedeviled by an unknown group that has begun bombing a newly-constructed pipeline. The President provides an 'ultimatum' to the PM that unfettered access be granted to the States within 48 hours or economic sanctions will be placed upon the country. The Canadian government rejects the ultimatum and the book ends with the States about to embark upon a military take-over of Canada.

I know a surprisingly large number of people who "gave up on fiction" who, on reflection, realized that fiction gave up on them -- that the cultural changes reflected in their favorite form of fiction left them cold, and that a different way of telling stories still has something to offer. <br><br>Olduvai, by all means -- and of course you're far from the only Canadian who reads this blog, so it's on topic. ;-)<br><br>Moshe, no, that's next week.

That latter was certainly my experience.<br><br>Henry, that is to say, you've got the standard set of Hollywood fast-collapse cliches stapled behind your eyeballs. Most people do, and until they realize that that's what's shaping their thoughts, they keep on dragging out those imaginary hordes of starving zombies, and never notice that I'm talking about the kind of decline and fall that happens in the real world -- that is, a slow, grinding, slogging decline, where people are too busy struggling to get by to turn out for roving-mob duty. As for climate change, I get asked that about once every two weeks, despite the fact that I've been talking about climate change since this blog first got under way. Go have a look at the archives if you want to see what I have to say. <br><br>Anna, I'm delighted to hear it.

I missed out on the last one. The timing is amazing since I started writing something (in my head, so far) day before yesterday. It just suddenly unfolded in my mind, as my inspiration usually does and I thought "Heck!I wish I had thought of this back when Mr. Greer was having his writing contest." I've been wondering whether I should bother to put in on paper and now I have an answer. So far, though, I fear it falls too much into the "tour" category and needs more plot, although it takes place in a single day which I like. I suppose there will have to be some sort of a flashback which would fit in easily.<br><br>It is set quite a few hundred years into the future (5 or 6?). Most people in this region live in small subsistence communities called Cyrcles that are a mix of NeoPagan commune, late Medieval village, and Native tribal culture. The 6 or 8 almost totally low tech Cyrcles in the area live in a philosophically conflicted relationship with the Village which is a small mercantile community with some small scale industry powered by water wheels. The villagers also send boats up and down the river to trade with other mercantile settlements on the river. One of the challenges to give it more of a plot is that it takes place in a simple bucolic world where time, as much as they still pay attention to it, moves very slowly and drama and adventure are very rare occurrences.<br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c6925812848061834930 title="comment permalink">1/23/14, 9:05 PM</a><br><br>

In that case you're obviously not going to be writing an adventure story, but that's not required; if you read the first anthology, you'll have noticed that the themes of stories included such things as an old man coming to terms with death, a young woman learning to garden, and a slide rule being passed down through three generations -- not exactly adventure-story fodder! You've got a setting that's a good source of emotional and psychological conflict; all you need now is a character or two who are caught in the middle of the pressures dividing Cyrcles from Village -- if at all possible in a way that doesn't admit simplistic right/wrong value judgments or easy answers -- and show how they either resolve the conflict or are defeated in their efforts to do so. (The first is drama, the second is tragedy.) Let the working out of the conflict become the lens through which the reader sees the Cyrcles, the Village, and the strengths and flaws and local color of each side, and you've got a solid story.<br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c2620978200499131972 title="comment permalink">1/23/14, 9:38 PM</a><br><br>

I wasn't going to elaborate on it, but seeing as others have on theirs, I'd be interested on your feedback.<br><br>The general thrust of the story is about a semi-feudal town built around a post-crash religious order, whose code is more centered on preserving a sustainable lifestyle than anything else. There's more to it than that - for instance, they closely guard and control a small coal source - but I won't run off on it here. A young friar very close to swearing his oaths is caught with an old economics textbook in his possession, which is an offense potentially worthy of expulsion. I considered making the author Krugman, but have decided that there's no real need to ruffle feathers. Anyway, he and the abbot have a discussion about it, about the history of the order, and much else besides.<br><br>I'm considering making it a two part story, with the second section being about these same people dealing with the discovery of their coal by outsiders. It would allow for more conflict and tension and provide some opportunity for colorful characters, but would be somewhat less contemplative than the first section.

And so I've long thought that what is crucially important in our perilous times is a 'picture' of feasible and appealing alternative ways of living...that, hopefully, resonate with our deepest, truest yearnings (which scientific research tells us are peace, cooperation, sharing, laughter, presence, etc).

But supposing it may be useful to some storytellers, if it is permitted I'll mention a couple of possible middle-to-far future technologies that might appeal to the more fancifully inclined (like myself), that could conceivably feature in tales of the future, and which have not to my knowledge been otherwise explored on this blog. <br><br>Not so many posts back JMG mentioned the possibility of aerostat cities potentially figuring at some remote point in future history. The possibility is, I think, real - but perhaps not by the means that the novels of Jules Verne and other souces of steampunk imagination might condition us to think of. No expensive difficult-to-obtain helium or massive furnaces producing hot air are necessary. Bucky Fuller worked out decades ago that if you build a light-weight transparently skinned sphere half a mile in diameter or larger, and the sun's heat raises its interior temperature by as little as one degree Fahrenheit above the temperature of the air outside (which will certainly happen with a transparent structure), the sphere will lift off the ground and float in the sky. A few thousand people and their goods inside would not suffice to hold it down. What happens when the sun goes down I don't know. Whether to keep a floating cloud city tethered or let it drift freely through the world's airspace might have political as well as practical implications. <br><br>The technology implied would probably include advanced alloys with an excellent strength-to-weight ratio (for a framework) and transparent plant-based plastics possessing high tensile strength. Or so I imagine. Others may come up with other approaches. <br><br>The other possibility is already a reality. I'm speaking of the future of high-speed sailing. There are sailboats that go fifty miles an hour, wind permitting, or even faster. These boats go faster than the wind that drives them. In a future without engines where the quickest way to travel overland is on a galloping horse, it seems to me quite likely that military powers, for example, are going to be very interested in vessels that go five or seven times faster than the rest. The technology may be difficult to obtain or produce in a deindustrial future - again, high strength alloys and other light weight high-performance materials are involved - but significant military advantages tend to get high priority. High-ranking passengers - heads of state, wealthy individuals, etc. - might prefer this mode of transport too. Anyone interested in learning more can try as search terms "foil sailing," "l'hydroptere" or "vestas sail rocket," for starters. <br><br>What the quality of life will be like in a deindustrial future - the sort of thing writers have to consider - is surely much deeper than the appeal of any techno-toys. To speak truth, thinking about it depresses me. For I know that I will not live to see any brighter future, whatever high civilizations may eventually come to be.<br><br>To follow up on a topic mentioned in last week's post, my most likely math-related project is an astrolabe. The sextant may be beyond my technical skills, but the plate of an astrolabe with its stereographic projection of the stars is, I think, manageable, and a good starting point. My preferred book arts printing technology is silkscreen, which may even suffice for the production of such a plate. The equipment is light weight and the materials relatively inexpensive. I also like lithography, but that requires a heavy expensive press. <br><br>For thermal solar tech, it's parabolic dishes, and secondarily Fresnel mirrors. Not the most practical perhaps, but have an art-related obsession with them.<br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c6623220543237397866 title="comment permalink">1/24/14, 12:55 AM</a><br><br>

Reality is far more complex and nuanced.<br><br>So I read "non-fiction" to try to learn about reality. <br><br>But then I started to see through to the craft of writing "non-fiction". I started to see how the sausage was made when I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boomerang-Travels-New-Third-World/dp/0393343448/ref=la_B000APZ33E_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390580515&amp;sr=1-4" rel=nofollow>Boomerang by Michael Lewis</a>. I started to see how the author imposed a simple but appealing narratives on a complex situations. Then he would impose a secondary narratives for entertainment value. One example was how men in Iceland tend to bash into each other. I do not think this author was writing things that were untrue. But he provided a very edited and simplified version of reality. I think his efforts to impose a simple narrative on these event were a deliberate part of his craft though. In the end I found his writing to be as formulaic as a James Bond movie. <br><br>I do not think all authors of non-fiction are as conscious of imposing a narrative on top of the facts. But these authors are human so it is bound to happen. Non-fiction is also limited by the capabilities of the author.<br><br>I now read a mixture of fiction and non-fiction. I now read a fair amount of stuff written before I was born. At least the narratives that are imposed on the writing are a bit different.<br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c8743433278974306076 title="comment permalink">1/24/14, 8:43 AM</a><br><br>

If you mean that the myth of progress is somehow hardwired into human brains, er, you might want to consider the fact that the modern myth of progress was invented out of whole cloth about three hundred years ago, and before then most people in the western world believed that the world naturally declined and got worse over time. <br><br>DeAnander, interesting. I missed that one. <br><br>Derv, now that sounds like a story that could fit very well in a post-peak oil anthology! In your place, I'd weave the two parts together -- have the discovery of the coal by outsiders happening as this little internal problem (a novice caught with a Bad Book) also has to be dealt with by the harried abbot. <br><br>Unknown, it's not the notion of powers-that-be -- if you've read this blog for any length of time, you'll know that the existence of power centers and elite groups is part of my analysis; it's the insistence that whatever's wrong with the world is being deliberately caused by evil elites that I find risible. <br><br>Kevin, you might want to find a copy of James Evans' excellent book <i>The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy</i>, which has detailed directions for making and using an astrolabe, among many other good things. <br><br>Phitio, no, nobody's mentioned it yet. Thanks for the suggestion!<br><br>Pintada, there's nothing draconian about the moderation here; you have to prove that you're not a spambot, and then your comment gets put in my queue and is put through as soon as I can read it and make sure that it's not obscene, libelous, or trying to pitch some product to my readers. Your post doesn't go up until I've read it, precisely to keep the spammers and trolls at bay -- yes, that means that there's sometimes a delay. <br><br>Mark, excellent! Yes, every nonfiction book also has a plot and tells a story; it was when I figured that out that I finally started producing nonfiction that publishers would snap up. For that matter, any use of language -- <i>any</i> use of language -- either presents or presupposes a narrative. We think with stories as inevitably as we eat with mouths or walk with feet...<br><br>Robert, sorry to hear about the train wreck; that's got to suck. I hope you'll consider a submission to the new Space Bats contest!<br><br>Cathy, no, I'm not going to concern myself at all with who got published in the previous anthology; I'm going to take the stories submitted to the contest, sort out which dozen or so will make the best anthology, do the necessary editing and call it good. Thus I'd encourage you to get writing!<br><br>Moshe, partly Cold War, partly the world of alternative systems of political economy that the Cold War obliterated -- Le Guin's world of Anarres is governed by what was standard early 20th century anarchosyndicalism, and it's one of the best things about her story that she shows the flaws and repressive dimensions in that system, while contrasting it to the much worse systems on Urras.

My first comment in a while, but I've been reading along with appreciation.<br><br>Last time, my Space Bats entry foundered upon the fourth bullet point. Count me in for another try.<br><br>Speaking of narratives, there was a GE television commercial that ran during (American) football games this past season, that might as well have been made to illustrate your points about the prevalence and increasing volume of (as you put it in the Forward to Green Wizardry) "soothing narratives of the future" and progress-myth imagery. The starship Enterprise overcomes oil depletion, with help from GE. Really! It can be viewed here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QMO1SZ0-is<br><br>For those who can't or don't want to watch a video, the ad depicts the Enterprise (the ship model and bridge set from the recent reboot movies, and a crew of supporting characters because Kirk and Spock would have been too expensive). The ship is caught in the gravitational pull of some unnamed space anomaly. The usual crisis scene is going on on the bridge, with flashing lights and alarms and dire warnings on the view screen. "I can't get her to warp... Losing thrusters... I need more power," the helmsman says. "Gimme more power!" A computer voice at the science officer's station intones, "Located: GE Deep-Sea Fuel Technology" that works "to help discover and maximize resources in extreme conditions." A floating computer graphic shows what seems to be the actual GE product being advertised, an incomprehensible metal block of pressure-sealed industrial machinery. The science officer merges the floating image of the machine with a floating image of the Enterprise. The result: the Enterprise is powered up to "Warp speed!" The helmsman says "Let's get out of here" and shoves a Big Silver Lever forward on his control panel, and the ship zooms away from the hazard.<br><br>Never mind the silliness of powering a spaceship in space with deep-sea oil well equipment (or rather, pictures of that equipment -- talk about ephemeralization!). What should be the overt message -- that GE's technology is so "intelligent" that it can even teach the Enterprise a thing or two -- is so obscure that it's become mere subtext. What might have been the subtext, if it weren't so blatant that we have to call it the overt message, is that GE's latest 25-ton barrel-bottom-scraper is going to rescue the economy/future (the Enterprise) from stagnation (being trapped in the gravity field), or perhaps apocalypse (being pulled into the space anomaly), and restore progress (warp speed).<br><br>Someone at GE now thinks that it's necessary, or beneficial, to tell people this, in this way. What used to be "We bring good things to light" has become "We'll pull you out of that black hole."<br><br>To top it off, I can't help thinking that the ad probably isn't actually very soothing for anyone. In order to make its point, the ad has to start out depicting a deadly emergency and link it narratively to energy exploration. I wonder if that's the part that will stick with people, which would be quite the spell-backfire (unless that was the intent all along)... <br><br>Anyhow, such is the state of the culture into which you're encouraging us to cast our stories. I look forward to next week's discussion of how the window of opportunity you speak of emerges.<br><br>For myself, a few weeks ago I took my wife's bafflement over the ad -- since its existence makes no sense without comprehension of the matters discussed here -- as an opportunity to tell her what this blog I've been reading for two years now is really about. That's another story for another comment.<br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c530381145342843673 title="comment permalink">1/24/14, 2:43 PM</a><br><br>

Most people don't realize that most of the so called advances in sailboat rig design has been a result of improved materials technology and the availability of auxilliary motors and cheap fossil fuel.

And How Things Should Be is the central question and struggle of politics. It is also, I’d argue, an inherently liberal genre (its many conservative practitioners notwithstanding), in that it sees the status quo as contingent, a historical accident, whereas conservatism holds it to be inevitable, natural, and therefore just.

It wasn't until I read some of the comments that I realized how long it's been since I've read science fiction. I still love it, but won't routinely pick it up anymore... I think it must have been buying too many poor quality books that led me to this point.<br><br>In the fantasy genre, I'd like to put in a plug for the Sword of Shannara. I read that one while still a teenager and loved it. It's a typical hero's journey that only hints it's set in a distant future of our own, but I particularly liked the discovery, at the end, of what the "magic" actually was in the sword that was carried. I suspect that the magic revealed might appeal to you, as well. (I don't want to spoil it for anyone who might not have read it.)<br><br>@Phitio... I quite enjoyed the first Hunger Games novel. When I read fiction, I tend to fully buy in to the bargain and, for the time I'm reading, the characters and their world are real to me. So I love any book that breaks into a series format, so I can go back and revisit my "friends." Nonetheless, I really think that story would have been much more powerful had it ended with the first book. Think about it... Horrible world, plucky protagonist manages to beat the odds through wit and intelligence, only to find out that, guess what?... you've just placed yourself into even hotter water. :0)<br><br>Finally, John Michael... you get MY gold star for best sentence of the week, and that's quite an honor as you beat Hesiod out for the honor.

Interesting you should mention proas, which I've been reading up on lately. What's noteworthy I think is that they were twice as fast as the imperial European vessels even though they were built with considerably more primitive technology - lashing, not nailing, dugouts not carvel construction. They suggest that it's the design concept that counts most, not the metallurgical quality of your fastenings or access to hempen fiber. <br><br>Marcello, ocean-going boats are also at the mercy of weather, and additionally at that of potentially dangerous tides, currents and waves, which airborne craft aren't. Yet this didn't stop oceanic exploration. People have circumnavigated the globe in balloons without even any steering gear. That would seem to demonstrate that though there are risks, they're not insuperable. <br><br>Admittedly, the America's Cup boats don't make a good example. They're basically just hopped-up Hobie cats. But l'Hydroptere, one of the boats I mentioned, is a robust ocean-going yacht that has sailed all around the Atlantic and is probably capable of circumnavigating without much difficulty. <br><br>Radio clearly will be most useful, if preserved. But by itself it can't scope out the activities of an enemy armada. That would take a sea-going scout, preferably equipped with radio (or maybe a dirigible with same?). <br><br>I guess my general point here is: let's not be over anxious to constrain the imaginations of science fictionists. Just because we're on the cusp of a dark age doesn't mean our descendants will be forever in its shadow. Ten thousand years hence may be long enough for some variant of the scientific method to be reinvented or rediscovered several times over, by as many different cultures. We don't know what our remote descendants will be getting up to. We can be pretty sure they won't have access to high octane fuels or petroleum-based plastics, and they'll probably bitterly resent the nuclear poisons we're leaving behind for them. But we don't know what their values will be. Just because we think that a given technique or project is too unfeasible or improbable for any possible future society doesn't mean that they will agree with us. If we were to project our values or expectations onto the past, we might conclude that no pre-industrial society would ever consider doing anything as economically unviable or insanely extravagant as, say, building gigantic complexes of colossal stone pyramids. And in the case of most societies we would be right; but there are some very noteworthy exceptions. The far future is to us an unknown territory and we don't know what our posterity will find there; except, of course, that it won't include huge deposits of cheap abundant fossil fuels. <br><br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c1644520887208645907 title="comment permalink">1/25/14, 3:57 PM</a><br><br>

In my experience, most people in today's industrial world think about the future as much as they think about the sun burning out, which is to say, not at all. They're not aware of our predicament's existence, let alone its shape and scale. And their "imagination" is limited to simple pondering (i.e. making decisions among a set of available choices, such as which clothes to wear to work tomorrow).<br><br>I'm not talking about City Planners here, or anyone else whose job involves thinking about the future of the general populace. I'm referring to the typical middle class citizen in industrialized society (and I think that the "typical citizen" is a crucial focal point because I believe that their thoughts, desires, and actions are accurately reflected in the elected politicians who represent them).<br><br>It doesn't depress me to think of the relative hardships of a future low-energy world; what depresses me is the inability of today's average person to think about that coming world. I say "inability" but that encompasses unwillingness, fear, disinterestedness, and whatever other reason that is currently preventing people from talking about where we're heading.<br><br>I keep hoping that society will experience the same sort of "Aha!" moment that I experienced in my first year of college physics: a few days after receiving a miserable 32 percent on my first mid-term test, some kind of brilliant revelation hit me while doing homework in my room. In that moment, all the formulas and equations that had previously baffled me suddenly -- and miraculously -- made crystal-clear sense, and everything that had seemed difficult immediately became ridiculously easy... and I went on to achieve a grade of 90 percent in Physics 101. Could something similar happen to society as a whole regarding the long descent ahead of us?<br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c5836803113698670549 title="comment permalink">1/25/14, 5:28 PM</a><br><br>

To judge by the comments of ancient philosophers, that's always been the case. This is why it's so important to get a different narrative out there; people don't think about the future because the myth of progress tells them "the future you're going to see will be just like the present, but with a few more nifty toys." Give people stories that explain why that's not happening, and isn't going to happen, and some of them may just manage to make the leap. <br><br>Karl, good call.

A young friar very close to swearing his oaths is caught with an old economics textbook in his possession, which is an offense potentially worthy of expulsion. I considered making the author Krugman, but have decided that there's no real need to ruffle feathers.

If memory serves there were many posts with rabid followers from both parties, they agreed to a debate (broadcast online for a fee, which I did not watch) and came out vigorously talking past each other. I got the impression from reviews and follow-up posts that the two main participants didn't even agree on the definitions of the words "inflation" or "deflation."<br><br>It reminded me of the old joke about debates between American communists being so fierce because the stakes were so low.

The Pocono mountains where I spent summers as a child - like the Rhode Island woods - are filled with the remains of old farms and houses, tanneries, quarries and forgotten cemeteries. You may feel like you are walking in the forest primeval, but then you notice a few scraggling branches of lilac and an elderly apple tree. Poke around and you are certain to find the foundations of a cellar overgrown. Obviously, these abandoned places could be folded into the story of Progress, but for me they never were.

Fiction is not my forte, but like any muscle, if it isn't exercised it doesn't improve!<br><br>I've been chucking around - over the past couple of days in my head - ideas for stories and think that I've settled on one providing a possible second religiosity. No teasers though.<br><br>It has been an awkward week of both wins and losses. Sort of like life really. <br><br>The new pump, sprinklers and taps worked a treat. The second hand stainless steel (why would people sell these things for little to no return?) fire shutters were installed over the shed windows in a custom built (solar powered welding of course!) frame. Tidy work. <br><br>Then one of my bee hives swarmed yesterday - we think - because the colony was a bit weak and the wax moths were attacking the frames. I (with local instruction) captured the swarm this morning, but it doesn't look good for the colony, and I just don't have enough experience to tell how it will end up. <br><br>Which, brings me to my real whinge. Living here is sort of like doing an apprenticeship by trial and error. I have local people to ask and turn to for help - like with the bees this morning, but it would be far easier to learn all of this stuff from a master/s of living this way. Sure books are very helpful, but sometimes you need people to hold your hand and guide you through the processes and tell it like it is. Pity they just don't seem to be around, anywhere. This lack of general skills seems to be a real systemic weakness to me and it makes me worried for the future. Everyone seems to just know a bit of this and a bit of that, but not many people can bring a broader perspective to the fore.<br><br>Anyway, I've been putting the place into drought mode so have been working quite long days sorting the various systems here. There is another heatwave coming through this week:<br><br><a href=http://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/australias-south-set-to-roast-in-extreme-heat-again/26549 rel=nofollow>Australia's south set to roast in extreme heat again</a><br><br>Pah! What's going on? Nothing annoys me more than global warming/weirding deniers. They should spend the summer here and they'd be singing a different tune for sure.<br><br>The Aboriginals had it right when they consistently described European cultures as that of a plunderer culture and I reckon that culture will continue doing this plunderer activity right up to the last breath. I’m really working hard towards building a level of abundance here that is difficult for the untrained to understand, but easy for those that know, to live with.<br><br>Yours grumpily,<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c8746833159366144382 title="comment permalink">1/27/14, 1:16 AM</a><br><br>

You might be right about fiction abandoning me rather than the other way around.<br><br>I did remember that I've read one work of fiction that I liked that I think counts as post-peak fiction: Starhawk's The Fifth Sacred Thing. Believable situation, believable characters and conflicts, and well written enough to keep my attention. The ending was perhaps a bit forced but I can overlook that. It was possible though improbable.<br><br>Thanks for your comment to btidwell. That will help me understand how to construct a story. I'm still not promising a submission, but I will play around with the possibility after I've read After Oil.<br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c4376992010202155844 title="comment permalink">1/27/14, 1:39 PM</a><br><br>

That essay feels even more relevant today than back then. It has been an interesting and enjoyable journey over the years.<br><br>The temperature here reached 40 degrees Celsius in the shade today. As I'm about 5 weeks out from the summer solstice the heat only seemed to peak about 5pm and the chooks are now in bed just before 9pm as dusk is settling in earlier.<br><br>Acclimatisation is a strange process because I worked outside in the shade until about 3pm, not realising it was about 35 degrees. I was even thinking about how nice the cool breeze was.<br><br>I suspect living with air conditioning further detaches people from nature (disclaimer - there is none here). It is surprising just how resilient people can be if the changes come upon them at a pace dictated by nature.<br><br>I recorded a video update here this evening and will hopefully get to upload it tomorrow for anyone interested in what's going on at the farm here.<br><br>At the back of my mind a short article is also forming on the topic of collapse. Recently, I had cause to be much annoyed by two back and forth articles on the subject. It is not that they weren't well written or literate, it just somehow - from a position of having been through three (and still in the third) record breaking heat waves within twelve months - I found the arguments, almost spurious in that they were about something other than what the written words were purported to be about. Decline is a gritty subject that will sooner or later impact everyone and perhaps it deserves that sort of blunt delivery of spelling out the obvious without getting bogged down in the predictions? Dunno, but it is on the to do list.<br><br>PS: A new bird turned up here today, the yellow tufted honeyeater and I spotted it hanging off agapanthus flowers supping on the nectar.

Kelley</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I'm certain that exposure to ruins in youth has a serious effect on one's ability to easily consider not-progress. In my conversations with poorly educated, apathetic underemployed retail workers on both coasts (near Seattle and now in rural Maine), I have found those in Maine FAR more willing to accept the fact of decline. I think much of it has to do with the fact that like the Rust Belt, Maine's economy *has collapsed*, in fact several times with the first coming long before there was a maine, or an America for that matter. Timber, ice, granite, grain, cod, lobster, timber again, land, tourism, and now shrimp - all of these have declined either in demand or straight-up resource collapsed and pulled the rug out from under Maine's economy. People here are sometimes more willing to accept collapse because it happened to their family almost in living memory. Being surrounded by collapsing barns, abandoned farmhouses, fields gone to forest for lack of grazing, and shuttered factories priced for a song and still not selling doesn't hurt either. Old stone walls and overgrown root cellars are a standing hazard in the woods around here - I can think of three just on the public land within a mile of where I'm sitting now. It helps to have visual aids when discussing decline, and maine is full of them.<br><br>Janet - you're not alone. If you haven't already, please join us at the greenwizards forums.

Hmm. Maybe with a broken fiddle, too...<br>With only limited comment space, much must be elided.<br>My point was the "Dark Ages" seems to me like Religion of Progress Apocalyptic Collapse fantasies mapped onto the past.<br>The High Middle Ages, while producing those magnificent cathedrals, was also a time of continual warfare between powerful nobles and most people lived in poor straits.<br>The Renaissance produced a burst of learning, art, literature, gorgeous architecture, even as the city-states of Italy were constantly at war and most people lived very simple lives.<br>According to archaeological and historical evidence, between 100 &amp; 410, the Roman Army (which continually fought small border wars over the 500 years the Empire existed) came to depend on those same barbarian mercenaries, who eventually received land grants to settle their people, became small time local chieftains taking over from the dissolving centralized Roman government, sometimes revolting, eventually creating quarrelsome, independent polities who did not live in monumental stone cities. (And most people lived on small farms subject to occasional raids and violent rebellions and yet another Roman civil war.)<br>Yet the Visigoths built beautiful churches in Spain, Theodoric produced his Mausoleum, Charlemagne was able to build the Palatine Chapel in response to the Alhambra -- which all happened between 475 and 800. (Oh, and people also build forts and walled towns for protection.)<br>Funny that, while this population suffered in abject poverty subject to continual attacks by Savage Barbarian Raiders(TM), the people around the North Sea still developed enough wealth and complexity to support artisans who produced the grave-goods of Sutton Hoo and the pieces found in the Staffordshire Hoard, the exquisitely carved Gokstad longship. Central Europeans had artisans who found time and resources to create exquisite reliquaries, chalices, and church fittings using stones that were mined in Afghanistan and crucible steel from the Volga. (Oh, yeah, and most people lived on farms and had trouble making ends meet.)<br><br>I cannot write fiction worth spit, but I can see the future unfolding now, as the street-gangs take over the abandoned and decaying inner-cities and pockets of immigrants create new sub cultures, fusion art from multiple sources, very different from the degenerating mainstream art world. The people are having trouble making ends meet, and you might not like the graffiti, but that's what it is. Meanwhile, the Chairmen and Board members and Vice-Presidents of Corporations that are now building skyscrapers and vying for more control of land and resources protected by private security armies might as well become the next version of the Dux and Comes and Cynings who carved Europe into micro-states for a thousand years; Jennel Cobey might well be Veep Cobey of the House of Exon.<br><br><a href=return-of-space-bats.html#c3740215211395737016 title="comment permalink">1/29/14, 6:57 AM</a><br><br>
