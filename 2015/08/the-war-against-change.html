<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week’s post explored the way that the Democratic party over the last four decades has abandoned any claim to offer voters a better future, and has settled for offering them a future that’s not quite as bad as the one the Republicans have in mind. That momentous shift can be described in many ways, but the most useful of them, to my mind, is one that I didn’t bring up last week: the Democrats have become America’s conservative party. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yes, I know. That’s not something you’re supposed to say in today’s America, where “conservative” and “liberal” have become meaningless vocal sounds linked with the greedy demands of each party’s assortment of pressure groups and the plaintive cries of its own flotilla of captive constituencies. Still, back in the day when those words still meant something, “conservative” meant exactly what the word sounds like: a political stance that focuses on conserving some existing state of affairs, which liberals and radicals want to replace with some different state of affairs. Conservative politicians and parties—again, back when the word meant something—used to defend existing political arrangements against attempts to change them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s exactly what the Democratic Party has been doing for decades now. What it’s trying to preserve, of course, is the welfare-state system of the New Deal of the 1930s and the Great Society programs of the 1960s—or, more precisely, the fragments of that system that still survive. That’s the status quo that the Democrats are attempting to hold in place. The consequences of that conservative mission are unfolding around us in any number of ways, but the one that comes to mind just now is the current status of presidential candidate Bernard Sanders as a lightning rod for an all too familiar delusion of the wing of the Democratic party that still considers itself to be on the left. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The reason Sanders comes to mind so readily just now is that last week’s post attracted an odd response from some of its readers. In the course of that post—which was not, by the way, on the subject of the American presidential race—I happened to mention three out of the twenty-odd candidates currently in the running. Somehow I didn’t get taken to task by supporters of Michael O’Malley, Ted Cruz, Jesse Ventura, or any of the other candidates I didn’t mention, with one exception: supporters of Sanders came out of the woodwork to denounce me for not discussing their candidate, as though he had some kind of inalienable right to air time in a blog post that, again, was not about the election. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I found the whole business a source of wry amusement, but it also made two points that are relevant to this week’s post. On the one hand, what makes Sanders’ talking points stand out among those of his rivals is that he isn’t simply talking about maintaining the status quo; his proposals include steps that would restore a few of the elements of the welfare state that have been dismantled over the last four decades. That’s the extent of his radicalism—and of course it speaks reams about the state of the Democratic party more generally that so modest, even timid, a proposal is fielding shrieks of outrage from the political establishment just now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second point, and to my mind the more interesting of the two, is the way that Sanders’ campaign has rekindled the same messianic fantasies that clustered around Bill Clinton and Barack Obama in their first presidential runs. I remember rather too clearly the vehement proclamations by diehard liberals in 1992 that putting Clinton in office would surely undo all the wrongs of the Reagan and Bush I eras; I hope none of my readers have forgotten the identical fantasies that gathered around Barack Obama in 2008. We can apparently expect another helping of them this time around, with Sanders as the beneficiary, and no doubt those of us who respond to them with anything short of blind enthusiasm will be denounced just as heatedly this time, too. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It bears remembering that despite those fantasies, Bill Clinton spent eight years in the White House following Ronald Reagan’s playbook nearly to the letter, and Barack Obama has so far spent his two terms doing a really inspired imitation of the third and fourth terms of George W. Bush. If by some combination of sheer luck and hard campaigning, Bernie Sanders becomes the next president of the United States, it’s a safe bet that the starry-eyed leftists who helped put him into office will once again get to spend four or eight years trying to pretend that their candidate isn’t busy betraying all of the overheated expectations that helped put him into office. As Karl Marx suggested in one of his essays, if history repeats itself, the first time is tragedy but the second is generally farce; he didn’t mention what the third time around was like, but we may just get to find out. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The fact that this particular fantasy has so tight a grip on the imagination of the Democratic party’s leftward wing is also worth studying. There are many ways that a faction whose interests are being ignored by the rest of its party, and by the political system in general, can change that state of affairs. Unquestioning faith that this or that leader will do the job for them is not generally a useful strategy under such conditions, though, especially when that faith takes the place of any more practical activity. History has some very unwelcome things to say, for that matter, about the dream of political salvation by some great leader; so far it seems limited to certain groups on the notional left of the electorate, but if it spreads more widely, we could be looking at the first stirrings of the passions and fantasies that could bring about a <a href=../../2014/02/fascism-and-future-part-three-weimar.html>new American fascism</a>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, just as the Democratic party in recent decades has morphed into America’s conservative party, the Republicans have become its progressive party. That’s another thing you’re not supposed to say in today’s America, because of the bizarre paralogic that surrounds the concept of progress in our collective discourse. What the word “progress” means, as I hope at least some of my readers happen to remember, is continuing further in the direction we’re already going—and that’s all it means. To most Americans today, though, the actual meaning of the word has long since been obscured behind a burden of vague emotion that treats “progressive” as a synonym for “good.” Notice that this implies the very odd belief that the direction in which we’re going is good, and can never be anything other than good.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For the last forty years, mind you, America has been moving steadily along an easily defined trajectory. We’ve moved step by step toward more political and economic inequality, more political corruption, more impoverishment for those outside the narrowing circles of wealth and privilege, more malign neglect toward the national infrastructure, and more environmental disruption, along with a steady decline in literacy and a rolling collapse in public health, among other grim trends. These are the ways in which we’ve been progressing, and that’s the sense in which the GOP counts as America’s current progressive party: the policies being proposed by GOP candidates will push those same changes even further than they’ve already gone, resulting in more inequality, corruption, impoverishment, and so on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So the 2016 election is shaping up to be a contest between one set of candidates who basically want to maintain the wretchedly unsatisfactory conditions facing the American people today, and another set who want to make those conditions worse, with one outlier on the Democratic side who says he wants to turn the clock back to 1976 or so, and one outlier on the Republican side who apparently wants to fast forward things to the era of charismatic dictators we can probably expect in the not too distant future. It’s not too hard to see why so many people looking at this spectacle aren’t exactly seized with enthusiasm for any of the options being presented to them by the existing political order. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The question that interests me most about all this is the one I tried to raise last week—why, in the face of so many obvious dysfunctions, are so many people in and out of the political arena frozen into a set of beliefs that convince them that the only possibilities available to us involve either staying exactly where we are or going further along the route that’s landed us in this mess? No doubt a good many things have contributed to that bizarre mental fixation, but there’s one factor that may not have received the attention it deserves: the remarkable dominance of a particular narrative in the most imaginative fiction and mass media of our time. As far as I know, nobody’s given that narrative a name yet, so I’ll exercise that prerogative and call it The War Against Change. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You know that story inside and out. There’s a place called Middle-Earth, or the Hogwarts School of Wizardry, or what have you—the name doesn’t matter, the story’s the same in every case. All of a sudden this place is threatened by an evil being named Sauron, or Voldemort, or—well, you can fill in the blanks for yourself. Did I mention that this evil being is evil? Yes, in fact, he’s evilly evil out of sheer evil evilness, without any motive other than the one just named. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>What that evilness amounts to in practice, though, is that he wants to <i>change things</i>. Of course the change is inevitably portrayed in the worst possible light, but what it usually comes down to is that the people who currently run things will lose their positions of power, and will be replaced by the bad guy and his minions—any resemblance to the rhetoric surrounding US presidential elections is doubtless coincidental. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
But wait!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Before the bad guy and his evil minions can <i>change things</i>, a plucky band of heroes goes swinging into action to stop his evil scheme, and of course they succeed in the nick of time. The bad guy gets the stuffing pounded out of him, the people who are supposed to run things keep running things, everything settles down just the way it was before he showed up. Change is stopped in its tracks, and all of the characters who matter breathe a big sigh of relief and live happily ever after, or until filming starts on the sequel, take your pick. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course that’s a very simplified version of The War Against Change. In the hands of a really capable author, and we’ll get to one of those in a minute, that story can quite readily yield great literature. Even so, it’s a very curious sort of narrative to be as popular as it is, especially for a society that claims to be in love with change and novelty. The War Against Change takes place in a world in which everything’s going along just the way things are supposed to be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The bad guy shows up and tries to <i>change things</i>, he gets clobbered by the good guys, and then everything goes on just the way it was. Are there, ahem, problems with the way things are run? Might <i>changing things</i> be a good idea, if the right things are changed?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Does the bad guy and his evil minions possibly even have motives other than sheer evilly evil evilness for wanting to <i>change things</i>?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s not part of the narrative. At most, one or more of the individuals who are running things may be problematic, and have to be pushed aside by our plucky band of heroes so they can get on with the business of bashing the bad guy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It happens now and then, in fact, that authors telling the story of The War Against Change go out of their way to make fun of the possibility that anyone might reasonably object to the established order of things. Did anyone else among my readers feel vaguely sick while reading the Harry Potter saga, when they encountered Rowling’s rather shrill mockery of Hermione whatsername’s campaign on behalf of the house elves? To me, at least, it was rather too reminiscent of “No, no, our darkies <i>love </i>their Massa!”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s actually a side issue, though. The core of the narrative is that the goal of the good guys, the goal that <i>defines</i> them as good guys, is to make sure that nothing changes. That becomes a source of tremendous if unintentional irony in the kind of imaginative fiction that brings imagery from mythology and legend into a contemporary setting. I’m thinking here, as one example out of many, of a series of five children’s novels—<i>The Dark Is Rising </i>sequence by Susan Cooper—the first four of which were among the delights of my childhood. You have two groups of magical beings, the Light and the Dark—yes, it’s pretty Manichean—who are duking it out in present-day Britain. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Dark, as you’ve all probably figured out already, is trying to <i>change things</i>, and the Light is doing the plucky hero routine and trying to stop them. That’s all the Light does; it doesn’t, heaven help us, do anything about the many other things that a bunch of magical beings might conceivably want to fix in 1970s Britain. The Light has no agenda of its own at all; it’s there to stop the Dark from <i>changing things</i>, and that’s it. Mind you, the stories are packed full of splendid, magical stuff, the sort of thing that’s guaranteed to win the heart and feed the imagination of any child stuck in the dark heart of American suburbia, as I was at the time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then came the fifth book, <i>Silver on the Tree</i>, which was published in 1977.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Light and the Dark finally had their ultimate cataclysmic showdown, the Dark is prevented from <i>changing things</i>...and once that’s settled, the Light packs its bags and heads off into the sunset, leaving the protagonists sitting there in present-day Britain with all the magic gone for good. I loathed the book. So did a lot of other people—I’ve never yet heard it discussed without terms like “wretchedly disappointing” being bandied around—but I suspect the miserable ending was inescapable, given the frame into which the story had already been fixed. Cooper had committed herself to telling the story of The War Against Change, and it was probably impossible for her to imagine any other ending. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Now of course there’s a reason why this particular narrative took on so overwhelming a role in the imaginative fiction and media of the late twentieth century, and that reason is the force of nature known as J.R.R. Tolkien. I’m by no means sure how many of my readers who weren’t alive in the 1960s and 1970s have any idea how immense an impact Tolkien’s sprawling trilogy <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> had on the popular imagination of that era, at a time when buttons saying "Frodo Lives!" and "Go Go Gandalf" were everywhere and every reasonably hip bookstore sold posters with the vaguely psychedelic front cover art of the first Ballantine paperback edition of <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>. In the formative years of the Boomer generation, Tolkien’s was a name to conjure with. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What makes this really odd, all things considered, is that Tolkien himself was a political reactionary who opposed nearly everything his youthful fans supported. The Boomers who were out there trying to change the system in the Sixties were simultaneously glorifying a novel that celebrates war, monarchy, feudal hierarchy, and traditional gender roles, and includes an irritable swipe at the social welfare program of post-World War Two Britain—that’s what Lotho Sackville-Baggins’ government of the Shire amounts to, with its “gatherers” and “sharers.” When Tolkien put together his grand epic of The War Against Change, he knew exactly what he was doing; when the youth culture of the Sixties adopted him as their patron saint—much to his horror, by the way—I’m not at all sure the same thing could be said about them.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What sets <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> apart from common or garden variety versions of The War Against Change, in fact, is precisely Tolkien’s own remarkably clear understanding of what he was trying to do, and how that strategy tends to play out in the real world. The Lord of the Rings gets much of its power and pathos precisely because its heroes fought The War Against Change knowing that even if they won, they would lose; the best they could do is put a brake on the pace of change and keep the last dim legacies of the Elder Days for a little longer before they faded away forever. Tolkien nourished his literary sense on Beowulf and the Norse sagas, with their brooding sense of doom’s inevitability, and on traditional Christian theology, with its promise of hope beyond the circles of the world, and managed to play these two against each other brilliantly—but then Tolkien, as a reactionary, understood what it was like to keep fighting for something even though he knew that the entire momentum of history was against him. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Does all this seem galaxies away from the crass political realities with which this week’s post began? Think again, dear reader. Listen to the rhetoric of the candidates as they scramble for their party’s nomination—well, except for Hillary Clinton, who’s too busy declaiming “I am so ready to lead!” at the nearest available mirror—and you’ll hear The War Against Change endlessly rehashed. What do the Republican candidates promise? Why, to save America from the evil Democrats, who want to <i>change things</i>. What do the Democratic candidates promise? To save America from the evil Republicans, ditto. Pick a pressure group, any pressure group, and the further in from the fringes they are, the more likely they are to frame their rhetoric in terms of The War Against Change, too. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve noted before, for that matter, the weird divergence between the eagerness of the mainstream to talk about anthropogenic global warming and their utter unwillingness to talk about peak oil and other forms of resource depletion. There are several massive factors behind that, but I’ve come to think that one of the most important is that you can frame the climate change narrative in terms of The War Against Change—we must keep the evil polluters from <i>changing things</i>!—but you can’t do that with peak oil. The end of the age of cheap abundant energy means that things have to change, not because the motiveless malignity of some cackling villain would have it so, but because the world no longer contains the resources that would be needed to keep things going the way they’ve gone so far. </div>
<br>
That said, if it’s going to be necessary to <i>change things</i>—and it is—then it’s time to start thinking about options for the future that don’t consist of maintaining a miserably unsatisfactory status quo or continuing along a trajectory that’s clearly headed toward something even worse. The first step in making change is imagining change, and the first step in imagining change is recognizing that “more of the same” isn’t going to cut it. Next week, I plan on taking some of the ideas I’ve floated here in recent months, and putting them together in a deliberately unconventional way. </div>

I am actually getting tired of all the people claiming salvation or doom is right around the corner. Could we not just have gradual, managed change to some realistic goals, like reducing carbon emissions, a managed and structured down-scaling of the economy back to something that is sustainable in the long run. (Even if that down-scaling would take us to 1890s type of scale)<br><br>I happened upon a recent translation of the speeches of Adolf Hitler with English subtitles. In my days growing up in the 70s, I only ever saw footage of him screaming in German on television, and I had no idea growing up of what he was actually saying. (I am no fan of Hitler) <br><br>https://youtu.be/78dr1szEwSs<br><br>It was very interesting, in the sense that he actually has his audience laughing and giggling in many of his speeches, not what I would have expected. Obviously, he led a war which killed 45 million people, and he led a genocide against the Jewish faith which killed many tens of thousands more, and he is not a hero of history. Still there is something in the content which Hitler accentuates in his speeches that, in my opinion, very closely resembles the comments of many commentators on all of the alternative media websites these days. I cannot help to see the similarities; looking for a scapegoat, chiding the international banking cartels, mocking British and American elites for being interventionists, and so forth. It is very ominous to me that most people commenting on collapse blogs, and alternative media have the same mindset that Hitler had in the 1930s. Scary to think what this thinking has led to in the past.<br><br>I never had chance to read the Tolkien novels as a child in the 70s, however there were several animated cartoon abridgements which I was all too familiar with growing up. It actually never occurred to me that it was all metaphors for the world I was living in; that type of realization that most fiction is merely satire of current events was a realization for later in my life. That Star Trek movies were all about the US- VS. Russian and China, (The Federation VS. Klingon's and Romulans) I didn't get it.<br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c6491521223458327748 title="comment permalink">8/12/15, 6:39 PM</a><br><br>

I am conservative in the sense of taking a good look at the traditions that served us well in times when we lived closer to nature and slowly, perhaps selectively, reviving some of those for our own good. We (you and your followers) really are fighting against the "conservation of momentum" as the good old juggernaut heads for the good old cliff once again. Because it was mostly the Democrats who advocated for this kind of change in the direction of our progress, until they got bought out, people still see our general point of view as "left wing." Perhaps we are, after all, the true "progressives"?<br><br>I have a friend who wrote a novel about 20 years ago and managed to get a publishing company interested. And then...I am still waiting to hear from her. It's an age of self publishing and promoting one's own stuff by word of Internet. I never got to see her novel--and she is an intelligent lady. Perhaps that's why. <br><br>Rowling, meanwhile, is so utterly clueless about so many things, that I wrote an entire novel (now rewriting) to address one or two of the more nagging deficiencies. I also rewrote and posted (bless Rowling's heart, she does encourage fan fics) the hippogriff rescue with the laws of aerodynamics observed to a much greater extent. I think it is actually much funner that way. I can imagine how she must have driven her physical science teachers to dudgeon. In fact, I believe she actually describes one such relationship in her series. I give her credit, too, for admitting that "morality" is not her forte. And she admits to depression, with which I can sincerely sympathize. But she is the one that gets published, and I don't think it is just the imaginative fun world she conjured (I got too depressed to finish reading her series).<br><br>At some point, after I finish expressing my own heart, I might turn my pen, for the fun and profit of it, to writing a publishable novel, with tiny hints that I intend it as a farce.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c7244106598857660947 title="comment permalink">8/12/15, 6:45 PM</a><br><br>

However, that doesn't mean that the Democrats haven't ceased being what passes for a Left party in the U.S. As I explained in the comments to your second essay on Fascism and <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2014/06/the-archdruid-on-fascism-part-2.html rel=nofollow>elaborated on at my own blog</a>, Left parties hold redistributionist ideologies, which the Democrats have consistently done over their history. That doesn't keep them from being conservative. After all, the Democrats were both the redistributionist party and the conservative party in the years before, during, and immediately after the Civil War, while the Republicans were the anti-redistributionist party of social change at the same time. In fact, the Republicans of Lincoln's time were the liberal party by two criteria that <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2011/08/food-fight-thoughts-on-liberalism-and.html rel=nofollow>I employed when I earlier examined liberalism and conservatism</a>: liberal policies increase participation in politics and society or improve the economic lot of the "common citizen" or average person and ideally do both, while conservative policies defend the power and wealth of those already powerful and wealthy. Emancipation and other policies of Reconstruction could be framed that way.<br><br><br>That precedent of the Democratic Party being both the redistributionist and conservative party prior to the Civil War is not a good one. Neither is the other example I can think of--the Communist parties of the Warsaw Pact immediately before the fall of the Iron Curtain and collapse of the USSR. That doesn't bode well, never mind that <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2012/09/national-review-ironically-reveals.html rel=nofollow>the Republican Party is the one using Soviet-era imagery</a>. Oh, well, no analogy is perfect.<br><br><br>Speaking of analogies, if the Democrats are the conservative party, then Bernie Sanders would be the reactionary candidate. He wants to go backwards in economic policy to improve the lot of the common man. He's not as radical as you when you proposed going back to the technology of the 1950s to improve the economic lot of Americans. I guess he isn't reactionary <i>enough</i>.<br><br><br>Finally, "The War Against Change" was on full display in Michigan this week as <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2015/08/trump-gets-michigan-welcome-good-and-bad.html rel=nofollow>Democrats protested Trump and the change they fear he represents while he campaigned in Michigan</a>.

It's frightening as well as embarrassing how few people are willing to notice how close today's antigovernment rhetoric is to the ideologies that gave rise to fascism between the wars. The media demonization of the fascists as mere maniacs blinds too many people now to the fact that a lot of people back then found their arguments highly convincing. <br><br>Will, actually, I think you're right; the reason so few people are showing any genuine interest in this presidential election is that the collective conversation of our society has gone in directions the current crop of candidates aren't willing to follow. <br><br>Patricia, write that novel!

I appreciate reading your thoughts on the matter though.<br><br>The question that my mind comes back to as I'm reading these series of essays is this: At what point does the cognitive dissonance become great enough that supporters no longer vote for these clowns? The way I see it, when the status quo is no longer working for a majority of the population, the only reason for politicians to want to support a lack of change, is because it is not in either theirs or their supporter’s interests.<br><br>The broader currents are very easy to understand, but there are many specifics of your political system that I don't get at all. One issue that I don't understand is highlighted in your sentence: "options being presented to them by the existing political order". To my mind that suggests that your political system has been somehow been captured by the political order itself. A larger question arises from that sentence, in that a contender could certainly arise from outside of the existing political order - the rest is practicalities. Certainly it is quite cheap for an individual to register a political party and campaign in a Federal election and many people do and some of them even get into power.<br><br>Yes, the war against change. Of course – clear as mud! I might add that evolution is a response to change that results in adaption or die off. Too bad people don't get that, however, you may be happy to note that nature does get it. ;-)! To stay still sometimes is to be overrun by the inevitable changes.<br><br>By the way, I never read the Harry Potter stories - or watched the much loved films - as there was always something at the back of mind that repulsed me and warned me off the story. I can’t explain it better than that.<br><br>Incidentally, John Crowley captured the meme of change well in his outstanding story (that I'm aware you also enjoy): Little, big. I recommend that story highly to everyone here.<br><br>That was very insightful about the avoidance of the Peak Oil debate by the mainstream media. Thanks and that has changed my perspective on the matter. The funny thing is though, is that ignoring a looming crisis does not make it go away and often multiple crises can overlap and intersect and be far worse than they otherwise would have been.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: There is a new blog entry up <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Power struggle</a>. The recent chicken enclosure project required a water storage tank which I moved from elsewhere on the farm. That move required fixing up the plumbing mess left behind and that was completed this week.<br><br>Then, in an unusual move, I took a leaf out of the Archdruids essay of last week and wrote a few very short stories to narrate and explain how I manage to live here whilst using so little electrical energy. So many people these days jump onto a podium and tell others to do this and that, that I decided to do something completely different and simply try and communicate how I see the world.

A single-payer system funding basic healthcare for all. If people can pay for insurance on top of that, they can go ahead, but at least everyone would get the basics, including public health. The fact that the basics are already paid for would also make additional health insurance cheaper.<br>-get the US government to collective bargain for more reasonable drug prices. If the drug companies won't cooperate, buy the drugs from another country where they are cheaper.<br>-legalize marijuana and make this retroactive. This will lower policing and prison costs, while reducing funding for criminal organizations. Tax it, too.<br>-Use antitrust legislation to break up Too-big-to-fail banks, Monsanto and other problem megacorporations.<br>-do something regarding illegal immigrants. I don't know what to do, but do something else, the current system isn't working.<br>-simplify the tax code by removing loopholes that only benefit the wealthy.<br>-go through the military budget and remove all pork-barrel projects, starting with the F-35.<br>-get out of Syria and Iraq, and close some of the USA's military bases abroad. No more fomenting color revolutions, either.<br>-simplify the assorted income supports/housing supplements/SNAP etc. into a smaller number of programs with less bureaucracy. Use the money saved to help people at higher rates and to help people who are currently falling through the cracks. Could also use some of the savings from the lowered military expenditures here.<br>-grants and tax rebates for rainbarrels, improved insulation etc.<br>-tax unearned income at the same rate or higher than earned income.<br>-gradually cut subsidies for industrial agriculture (not all at once, you don't want to send food prices skyrocketing without giving farms and eaters time to adjust) <br>-use some of the money you've saved to plug or at least reduce the deficit<br>-encourage public transit, bike lanes etc. Now you've gotten out of the empire business, you're going to really need them.<br>-decide which roads are really needed and maintain them properly. Return non-essentials to gravel.<br>-no more giving out student loans. Give grants to a small number of brilliant and financially-needy students, but no loans to anyone. This should burst the post-secondary bubble. Maybe give loans for apprenticeship training/vocational programs? but not standard university. <br><br>There's a lot more that could be said, but that's my two cents for now.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c4398139316665543116 title="comment permalink">8/12/15, 7:17 PM</a><br><br>

My German was very, very good in those distant days, so I listened. Hitler spoke with a heavy dialect accent, which made his speech hard for me to follow in detail. But that turned out to be a plus: I was fascinated to notice in myself, as the record played, that *even though* I could understand about 1/2 of each sentence of his, Hitler's delivery--his rhythms and phrasing, his changes in volume and pitch--were absolutely mesmerizing. I knew what he had stood for, historically, and hated it, but for those few minutes I was wholly swept up in his delivery and would have followed him wherever he led. There was something very like a form of magic, a compelling power, in his use of speech, that was wholly independent of what he had to say. -- Look for that power in the speech of each presidential candidate: where you find it, you find a potential future dictator.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c5579496568084367533 title="comment permalink">8/12/15, 7:21 PM</a><br><br>

A TV series traditionally needed to 'reset' to the same status quo after each episode so that the same cast and sets can be used, and so the various scripts set in the stories universe can be played in any old order with out contradictions too glaring. I remember watching the bland super hero stories of the 90's growing up and thinking to myself something like "The heroes HAVE TO win EVERY time, or things would be so out of control that the series could barely go on. But if the villian wins even once it would upset everything." I remember each episode the bad guys would throw something at the good guys, and after going back and forth for a bit the good guys would finally gain the upper hand and win the contest. Some of the more daring shows (Beast Wars comes to mind as being better fiction than the other frack) would rock the apple cart by letting the bad guys win at the end of a season, which would change everything leading to a darker edgier next season. I was a soft hearted kid and struggled with these changes.<br><br>Noticing that pattern in poorly writen super hero fiction for kids is what this pattern reminds me of. The need to preserve the status quo for the practical reason that coming up with something new is hard and risky! Certainly not worth it for a successful tv serial. For a whole nation, dare not even jest!<br><br>I guess this issue has been working its way through me as well. Still working on a fiction that sprung out of some soul searching from the other blog, not certain if it will fit the space bats calling or not, either way I am having a great time bearing the story along. Delivery is so much more difficult than conception, in many cases. This issue of having a protagonist change things and how to handle it honestly has been on my mind become of it. I have been shocked to find that it is very difficult to do well, being poorly stocked with such stories, though Conan's willingness to change anything in his way is a helpful inspiration.

These last posts by JMG are timely and needed.

Some great sidetracks, but sidetracks nonetheless.<br><br>From your considerable studies of history and past civilizations, would you say this 'War On Change", fear of change is a natural, or human trait? Has it always, (or mostly always) been the case? It would certainly explain the paralysis we, (elites as well as lay-people) exhibit when facing crisis and the dire need to change, eh? Why are we so afraid of change? Even when the status quo is obviously bad, "Better the devil you know!".<br><br>As for being a Liberal, and therefore conservative: Yeah, OK, I'd own that. I know we are all in for massive change and upheaval. I'd just prefer to slow it down to a manageable pace.

I expect that part of the reason is just that people in all situations find it easier to stop doing something pleasant than to start doing something unpleasant. Another part is probably that preparing for peak oil usually means preparing yourself, your family, or at most your local community to go down the slope with relative comfort, while most popular responses to climate change affect everybody equally. One of these is a good way of demonstrating your caring universalistic liberal virtue, and the other is not. Thus solar panels are almost invariably marketed as a response to climate change.

Either way, if the Dems can't manage to get it together, the prospect of a cornpone despot is not so far fetched. By far the best analysis of contemporary American politic has to be <i>Democracy Inc.</i> Sheldon Wolin nails it I think with his "inverted totalitarianism."

In that regard, it will usually lag far behind current needs for change.

But it seems unlikely either will be elected unless there is a major eruption in the country which really polarizes nearly everyone, especially the (formerly) semicomfortable Baby Boom middle class. Judging by the level of intellectual and perhaps spiritual and historical awareness of the general public, I don't expect a good outcome there. Sanders is the best of the lot, perhaps, but is he able at his age to grow into something he is not now? And if he did so, wouldn't the powers that be neutralize him?<br>Re Tolkien: I think the appeal is not only the mirroring of the real events/zeitgeist of the 20th century, but also the mythic elements. All societies need or have a mythos to explain who and why they are. It must be in the DNA; the resemblance to the Norse and other myths of a dark time when a previous Golden Age is being compromised, is certainly clear. The dissonance for us is that, despite our assertions to the contrary most of us have made money our deity, and billionaires our demigods. Sauron and Saruman are evil partly because they amass wealth and influence at others' expense, making them both evil and admirable. Our modern Saurons like Shell oil or PetroCanada create Mordor in the Tar Sands mines but also create wealth for a number of investors and others in the hierarchy of those companies, and bring well-paying jobs to some workers, at least. And we all drive or use fossil fuel to some extent. <br>So although we naturally objectify and project our horrors on the other party, we of course are the guilty party. Until a leader arises who can allow us to acknowledge our own sins of consumption safely and act accordingly and rationally, we're sunk.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c9148035625291721687 title="comment permalink">8/12/15, 9:16 PM</a><br><br>

For example the JBS at one point claimed that then President Eisenhower was an "agent of the Communist conspiracy" (simply for talking to the Soviet Union as opposed to starting World War III). "Birchers", as they were known, wrote a lot of letters during their early years on various scare issues, such as opposition to summits between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and keeping fluoride out of water supply, from which it could enter our precious bodily fluids and corrupt our purity of essence. The Birchers were frequent promoters of moral panics on everything from the Panama Canal treaties to the nuclear disarmament movement, all claimed to be part of the Communist movement to undermine American security, and shared cross-membership and tactics with early Religious Right groups like Billy James Hargis' "Christian Crusade."...Today, they are most worried about threats to US sovereignty, most particularly the (never actually proposed) union between the US, Canada and Mexico.

Dickens ridicules this office until the end of the book when Tite Barnacle's son explains that the office actually has a very serious agenda ,wait for it, to prohibit change so that the existing social order and privilege are maintained.

The overall attitude of the population exists somewhere between the polarities, and all political parties are trying to change reality in the direction of their ideals and to resist change in the direction of other ideals.

One named "A natural history of the last thousand years", the other named "the life of birds". In both works, the argument that people are irrationally afraid of change plays a rather large role. For instance: He claims that many "invasive" bird species of Europe are actually species that already have a long history here, but at some point were hunted to extinction or driven away by the cold 16th-18th centuries. Like you, he claims that people are against climate change because they want everything to remain in the shape that they're used to. On the other hand, hunting and fishing traditions that no longer have a useful purpose and harm birds much more than (he believes) climate change will, are rarely questioned - because they're traditional.<br>His idea of a cure for environmental destruction, interestingly, is also very similar to the ideas sketched out in your Cimmerian posts. He says, natural parks and bird protection zones should not be closed to all humans. Instead, they should be open to visitors so people can become interested in and recognize the value of beautiful birds. Birds, meanwhile, should get used to humans, because human cities are a much richer and safer environment for them than agricultural fields and wood-producing forests, which are like deserts from a bird point of view.<br><br>He also says that the US is actually much better at all these things than western Europe, so these bird-related concerns might be a bit foreign to you.

So Democrats endlessly tell themselves that they can start winning the battles against commercial morality that they keep on losing (on unions, worker rights, pollution, etc.) if only they can learn from their great victories on gay rights etc. when in reality, those 'victories' were just commercial morality steamrolling republicans instead of democrats (the cries from both sides of media bias can be understood through this lens as well, with the media as tireless advocate of commercial morality).<br><br>Even on the rare occasions where the left wing democrats and right wing republicans recognize their common enemy, they still lose, although the battle is sometimes closer (see the TPP battle).<br><br>Arguably, Tolkien was echoing a similar feeling in some aspects of the Lord of the Rings, with Saruman most representing the ethics and threat of commercial morality to the traditional order.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c2327934008035779018 title="comment permalink">8/12/15, 11:17 PM</a><br><br>

Along with Chris Hedges I voted for Jill Stein back in 2012, although I now consider myself to be more radical than Stein, who apparently has no inkling that industrial civilization is doomed to catabolic collapse (to use your terminology).<br><br>Where do we put James Howard Kunstler, who voted twice for Barach Obama? You (John Michael Greer) know Kunstler fairly well, having been a featured guest on his podcast a few times in the past. Kunstler is brilliant, witty and insightful, and even he was drawn in by the "lesser of 2 evils" notion. He looked upon Mitt Romney with some mixture of disgust, repugnance and enmity.<br><br>I got so disgusted with the Democratic party back in the 1980s that I jumped ship. I remember voting for Barry Commoner back in 1980 because Jimmy Carter disappointed me so much with, among other things, his assignment of James Schlesinger (Mr. nuclear power himself) as his energy secretary. Carter is a very decent man but he failed to reverse the trend towards spending ever more tax money on the military industrial complex.<br><br>So anyway, I can't vote for Bernie Sanders in the primaries, but I have many die-hard old guard Democratic party friends who are avid Bernie Sanders supporters. I feel towards such friends and towards the "progressive" wing (PDA - Progressive Democrats of America) of the Democratic party as one might feel towards a washed-up prize fighter, once highly skilled and with a promising future but now a mere shell of his former self. The recently deceased Tim Carpenter was a family friend.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Democrats_of_America<br><br>As you mentioned, on the off-chance that Bernie Sanders actually becomes president, he would almost certainly end up as ineffective and impotent, hopelessly outgunned by the forces of inertia already present within the political and economic system that exists in the USA. We might get a few thoughtful supreme court justices though, for all the good it would do in the long run.<br><br>Could you see Chris Hedges and Cornel West being invited to the White House? How about Noam Chomsky or Richard Heinberg? Such images are so bizarre that it makes me question even the remote possibility that Sanders has any chance at all.<br><br>A close friend of mine recently went to a Bernie Sanders rally in Los Angeles. Upon returning she told me that most of the 30,000 or so avid Bernie Sanders fans at the Los Angeles event were quite young, in the 20 to 30 age group. What are we supposed to do, John, throw cold water on them?

Somehow they woke in me a tendency to want to look outside, beyond, underneath and through ordinary everyday life and the things we are conditioned to take for granted. Seems to me "The Matrix" is one of the few memes doing the same for young people nowadays, albeit in a darker, more obviously violent and altogether digital way, though Tove Jansson's Moomin sagas, <i>in book form</i>, have a wistful otherworldliness about them, for younger children. I was left bemused by the Harry Potter series; I cheered when they became popular, hoping that they would awaken something in my own children that "The Dark Is Rising" had awoken in me, but I'm not at all sure that they did.

He has been very influential and I bet that I'm not the only reader of ADR who has heard of him - but I am the first one here to cite him as one my of my personal influences (quick shout-out to any lurking Keith-fans). Johnstone is known for his work on improvisation and it is quite clear from his two books <i>impro</i> and <i>impro for storytellers</i> that he is very well read, a sharp and observant natural psychologist, and that he has thought deeply about the nature of imagination and creativity - and well, <i>life</i>. <br><br>I am not an actor myself, but at a certain point in my life, it seemed valuable to me take some impro classes because actor-training can give one a number of valuable life-tools (it is about so much more than mere superficial 'pretending'). Anyway, Johnstone says anyone is capable of being engaging, communicative and truly creative, but that one of the reasons people can be fearful and inhibited, can choke back their own creative spontaneity is that they are afraid of <i>things changing</i> - and more specicially we are afraid of <i>ourselves</i> having to change. <br><br>So yes, your thesis here is congruent with something I've come across elsewhere.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c1747653483875929039 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 4:44 AM</a><br><br>

The last huge program initiative in health insurance was a way to prop up job in health care because it is a huge employer. Obama said it himself in an interview (I believe the one with Mark Maron on his podcast) that part of obamacare (yes the president called his program what the fake conservatives on the right call it) was to preserve and create jobs in America. That's the level of desperation we are at - making- up and extending illness in our population to keep people employed.<br><br>Well we already imprison children for 12 years in buildings with cider block walls and fluorescent lights, filling their brains with nonsense and then testing them - in our district 50 days out of 180 day school year -to make sure they can regurgitate it well. The teachers are complete strangers to the parents and nothing that happens in those walls can be examined and seen by the community. Children are molested, attacked and emotionally abused by "professionals". In our state of PA the state revokes about 200 -300 teachers' licenses a quarter because of confirmed abuse of the teacher on children.<br><br>So yes, the change has to come from people at the micro-level - families, streets, neighbors - taking a stand for some thing different and involving others.

Ideas and imagination – and theories - play such a part.<br><br>Upbringing is a funny thing – I got into Tolkein and read the whole lot in not much more than a week in the mid 1950s in the midst of sweet dreams of the Shire where I bicycled with our gang. We were not stuck in our suburb. We had been pre-prepared by imaginative radio drama for children and especially by pre-TV historical fiction. And there was a guy called H.J. Massingham who had actually recorded the place with considerable scholarship – the latter mostly missing in Tolkein who seems to have taken what vibes suited him. And there was still bomb damage visible in London and our suburb. And we had memories from infancy of fire on our street – which could be portrayed as Manichean . <br> <br>What seems extraordinary now, and did so at the time, was my adult experience working for a few months in North America in 1974 in agricultural science research institutions, with a later revisit. Given the almost hallucinatory experience of very similar but different built environments – and organisations - came a realisation that where there was difference, this was change coming our way soon. Such was the trajectory of the fast moving Age of Oil spreading into every cranny. But the wider reality I sensed in the many North American landscapes, and again when my work took me back 20 years later, was how very differently beautiful the place was. I was therefore puzzled by the enthusiasm with which a British imagination (Tolkein) could re-appear in the American psyche –such Anglo-Germanic atavism – and could neglect this beauty, or at least not know what to do with it. It must have been about that time and from there-on that my own critique of Tolkein gained traction and my search for satisfying fictions in literature generally went into serious decline. <br><br>This decline was not wholly a positive experience; reading literature is something more than a hobby. Massingham and before him WH Hudson ‘non-fiction’ paid tribute to what he called “natural scholarship shot through with emotion”, and a “quick and sure grasp of topographical pattern”. Thus harking back still has its appeal for me; for example, if we are still going to need farming, then some of the values celebrated by Massingham – and the old-fashioned temperate farming techniques which were a 17thC to 18thC revolution in their day – could be something more than a day-dream. We need to think hard though about the real social environments of 16th to 19thC Britain and where these did not work in North America.

I would be interested to read your thoughts on another theme I see in contemporary fiction: a lot of what my teenage daughters read seems to me to follow a thread of plucky heroes (mostly female) exposing a corrupt and rotten regime only to discover the rot runs deeper than they imagined. I don't think i'm projecting that, and although my daughters are pretty alert to the state of the world (I think) I'm not sure that explains the popularity of these series among their peers. It seems interesting to me that this theme is showing up so much in YA literature.

But what makes it so compelling to Americans—to such an extent that no other narrative can break through and gain mainstream acceptance? I believe it is a promise: that things can stay the same (even as conditions become progressively worse, but we are taught to ignore that). For an ossified, decrepitating, sclerotic society that refuses to believe it is on a long tumble down a steep incline to utter mediocrity, unspeakable vulgarity and appalling inhumanity, this narrative is just what the doctor ordered. I doubt that any other narrative will be able to compete.

Yes, I was into Tolkien as a child (and even helped edit a translation a few years back); but I loved him for the created world and the languages. The plot, even then, disturbed me with its reactionary fervor and dullness and boredom and endless driveling pretentiousness. (Don't get me started on those movies.) Rowling I couldn't even begin to read; at least Tolkien could put together a reasonable sentence. <br><br>But fantasy is almost always reactionary. (Actually, everything about human society, especially in its decadent phase, is reactionary. It's a rare decade or so that brings actual improvement in the human condition, which is then immediately seen as the norm that we are duty-bound to preserve at all costs.) One fantasy novel that is "progressive" in the current sense of the word is Alex Comfort's <i>Tetrarch</i>. Its depiction of another world with a rational political system is very amusing and has lingered in my mind for decades. An appealing rebuttal of the egregiously, hideously reactionary <i>A Voyage to Arcturus.</i><br><br>Of course, the meaning of the word "progressive," like "liberal" and "conservative", has utterly shifted in the last 60-odd years. It is a bit sad when words change and become even less precise, but that is the nature of language, and it's never been different. Most words, even concrete nouns, are very vague and have multiple, conflicting definitions (try translating anything if you think that's not the case). Is insisting on the original meaning of words reactionary? When people throw around the terms "socialist" and "fascist," having no clue what they mean, I always direct them to the original writings, the manifestos, to find out what it is they think they're talking about. I'm sure I'm very annoying.<br><br>I was talking to someone the other day who was going on about how bad the world's getting. I said, Well, yes. But remember, every older generation thinks things are going to hell, because they're old and youth was a time of energy and relative lack of responsibility, so of course the past always seems to have been much better than the present. Things <i>are</i> going to hell, of course, but because of resource depletion and climate change, not because politicians scream more these days and everybody has a Twitter account.<br><br>My only real hope, if you can call it that, from a Sanders administration is indeed, if he were able to accomplish anything, he might just slow the inevitable and make us just a bit less uncomfortable for a little while longer than Hillary and the Republicans would. I don't think it's wrong to wish for that. But that's all I really hoped for from the current administration, and even those tiny hopes were dashed. Ah well.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c1688383616237184201 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 6:08 AM</a><br><br>

Have you unmasked yourself as Saruman rather than Gandalf? Sauron's trillionaire ring-wraiths won't like competition or power-sharing or proposals for unauthorised changes in the sphere of operations of Mordor Inc. <br><br>More prosaically, there's truth in the old joke that if elections changed anything, they'd be illegal. They're entertainment for the proles, like other sporting contests, such as horse racing, wrestling or football, whose honesty is doubtful. If your team or candidate loses, never mind, there'll be another event along soon, where one can cheer or bet, get the supposed inside dope from the stables and enjoy a day out with accompanying boozing and brawling. For the insiders of course, they're more discreet contests, jockeying for position around the trough, fixing the result and making money via the media where the campaign contributions are spent.<br><br>More depressingly for the sort of people who imagine that shambling around waving placards, shouting inane slogans, forming committees, and actually voting will turn the moon into green cheese for them, we have Bismarck's reminder that the great issues of the age will not be determined by voting and majority resolutions. Even before the vested interests assumed such total and obvious dominance, Americans had that sharp observer H.L Mencken to remind them that, “As democracy is perfected, the office of president represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.”<br><br> Naturally, such people have little influence on what actually happens. The politicians are smart enough to know the hand that feeds them and how to lick it in hopes of reward. Bill Clinton is supposed to have said that by the time you get to be President or Prime Minister of your country, you realize that the really important decisions are made by someone somewhere else. American politics is known to be a means by which the relatively poor become relatively rich. A few months ago a couple of American academics published a study showing that the wishes of the public have virtually no influence on public policy and legislation, whereas money spent by corporate interests on political lobbying produces very lucrative returns. <br><br>Reality outdoes satire. Calgula's joke that he could make his horse a Consul has been surpassed by the Americans who stare in awe at the rear end of a horse in the White House or other public office, and accept its extrusions as wisdom and excitedly debate the relative quality of the equine offerings.Gardeners will have a use for all of it.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c3694055383632451212 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 6:10 AM</a><br><br>

I have been looking carefully at my own motivations for a while now, trying to work through the various layers of un-thinking responses and imagery, in order to bare the reality as best I can. This is not an easy task and is emotionally challenging, to say the least.<br><br>One of the main takeaways (from your blog and other sources) for me has been that I cannot simply be "against" the "problem." First, as you have phased so well, we face not a problem to be solved, but a predicament to be adapted to. Second, we cannot only be against the current system, but must actively work to construct an alternative. (Otherwise, we are hypocrites and mere noise.)

Half a century ago, for the industrialised world to continue in the direction it was going meant it reached somewhere "better" for most of its residents - or, later, that looked and felt close enough to fool people. That's how the words became conflated, "progress" with "good", but I wouldn't say it means the direction we're going in must be "good", given that people speak of progress as "stalled" or bemoan a "lack of progress" in economic and social issues. Obviously we're still going *somewhere*, so this suggests that "progress", to these people, represents something in particular - a concept broadly applicable to the course of history since the Industrial Revolution: increasing scale and complexity of human society and technology. That people believe this to be inevitable, and are utterly baffled by its apparent disappearance over the last few decades, is a slightly separate issue which does tie into the use of the word "progress" but only in the sense it has more recently adopted, not its original neutral one.<br><br>The bafflement largely happens because people don't have a clue about the factors that really underlie growth and contraction, and the contraction/difficulty/lack of progress arises even though nobody seems to have started doing anything differently. The War on Change is therefore rooted in the belief that if we keep doing the last thing we were doing during the good times, "progress" will return - and the fact that the only real, useful change entails individual sacrifice which most people (and particularly the wealthy) can't stomach.<br><br>As for the Harry Potter novels - I think there's a case to be made that Rowling knew what she was doing too. It's hard to tell how much the representation of house elves and so on is intended to be read as shown and how much it's skewed by the use of a not-very-bright and easily-led teenage boy as a narrator.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c4991499826613878158 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 6:25 AM</a><br><br>

I appreciate your use of precise definitions of "conservative" and "progressive," and especially love how how showed me something riding just under the radar of my subconscious attention through your 50,000 foot view of Tolkien and the Tolkien-wannabes.<br><br>Most-recently I've been struck by your notion of "collapse now, and avoid the rush!" In context of recent elections, perhaps the first steps of that notion is already driving the body politic as shown in the 2014 example where more than 2/3 of the voters just stayed home. Perhaps we'll even see "progress" in that direction, encouraged by the GOP through their ballot ID initiatives and the toxic sludge like Trump that all seem designed to de-legitimize the Presidency through an over-the-top deliberate effort to get most of the last 1/3 of the voters to stay home as well.<br><br>I've gone hot and cold on Sanders lately. On the one hand I like a lot of his platform as it is expressed, on the other hand I see that even if he wins the Presidency, none of that platform will live to see the light of day. It would be a cruel trick, and like you said not the first cruel trick, to pin my hopes on the beauty of those ideas and let my optimism and faith in those ideas override my hard-won and rationally-based cynicism regarding the efficacy of the federal government as it exists today (or as it can reasonably change to exist in the next few years) as a practical agent of those same ideas.<br><br>Recently a friend of mine who has worked with me for 15 years in a huge multinational conglomerate left the company suddenly to take a huge pay cut (not sure how much, maybe as much as cut in half) and become a part of the high school he grew up in. That, in my mind, is what "collapse now and avoid the rush!" looks like on an individual level. I sometimes wonder if it is possible that, in spite of the top-down Tolkien narrative War Against Change coming from those who would be our next President, a bottom-up revolution of a few million such people suddenly cutting their salaries in half and pursuing their passions (and in the process cutting their consumptive lifestyles in half) could take hold and capture the imagination of the masses. Would something like that lend itself to fiction, or are we incapable of processing the stories of more than a handful of plucky heroes resisting the oncoming tides of Progress?<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c8404571420030121673 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 6:50 AM</a><br><br>

From what I gather, both derive much of their popularity from the fact that they are so strident and willing to thumb their noses at the establishment which makes them appear "genuine." Never mind that Trump is an utter buffoon of breathtaking dimension and absolutely none of sanders great ideas will ever see the light of day win or lose. Someone is coming who is both iconoclastic and pragmatic, and not "serving the people."<br><br>The American people settle for this status quo because deep down they know they are helpless. Last week I posted a meme on my Facebook page that said voting was an exercise in futility. That provoked a heated exchange with one "friend" about voter suppression and Hillary saving the world. I posted a link to a recent Princeton University study that shows that public opinion means virtually nothing and we are living in an oligarchy. His response was a dejected, "Fine! I guess we just all give up." People cling to Sanders and Clinton out of fear and desperation, pure and simple.<br><br>It strikes me that, as interesting and intelligent as this blog community is, it is still it's own bubble. People cling to the status que because they can't imagine anything better and can't bear the thought of anything less. Steinbeck said, "Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires." An economy that isn't growing means everyone must accept being stuck close to where they are. That dream of future success, however unrealistic, is the only thing that gives meaningless lives of drudgery and empty consumerism a semblance of meaning.<br><br>Personally, I think a small town local life would be living on hell's doorstep.

The average American has atrophied to the point they don't even have the skill set to even think about getting up from their TV set and meeting the neighbors or finding meaningful activity in their life.

(I speak as one of the generation which discovered his books in the 1960s). <br>First, there is no way in which LOTR is a celebration of war. Tolkien had fought as an infantry officer in WW1 and been wounded there. The land of Mordor, in his book, is a pretty exact evocation of the landscape of the Western Front. Tolkien mentions that practically all his close friends died in that war, and indeed his own son was a pilot in the Air Force in the Second. He knew far more about the reality and the effects of war than most of his critics. It is made very clear in the book that Sauron cannot be defeated in battle, and the only hope of victory lies in a couple of very unheroic and ordinary beings demonstrating extraordinary bravery and defeating Sauron through skill and guile. All the battles in the book, as Tolkien emphasis, are simply diversions. Thus, the book belongs to a much older tradition which celebrates not war, but courage and endurance even in the face of certain defeat and death: the world of the Norse sagas he loved, but also of the Iliad. <br>Nor is his vision of society really hierarchical. There are kings, but they are warrior-leaders and wise governors, not kings in the Renaissance and modern sense. Many of the groups featured in the book are in fact essentially communitarian. In turn, this is because the theme of the book is not war but power. It is an allegory of the corrupting effects of power, no matter who wields it and for what purpose: this is why Aragorn refuses to take the Ring himself, because it would tempt him too much. This fear of power not only puts Tolkien in the tradition of the English socialists, like William Morris, but also the anarcho-syndicaists who looked to spontaneously organising communities, not hierarchies of power. <br>And like Morris, and like many of the early Socialists, Tolkien looked backwards to a pre-liberal capitalist society, where people were not just factors of production, where much land was held in common, and where money was not worshipped to the exclusion of all else. And now that we can see the havoc wrought by liberal capitalism, pushed to the extremes that were always inherent in it, can we say that the War Against Change that you identify is always a bad thing? The great lie of liberalism is that you can have it both ways: onwards to a radiant future, always better than the past, but without sacrificing anything worth keeping from the past itself. In fact, liberalism is simply a machine for destroying societies and replacing them with consumer-units. A war against this seems eminently justified to me. Obviously Tolkien would not have expressed things this way (he was born in the 1880s after all) but it's hard to argue that his anger at the destruction of the countryside of his youth, and its replacement by factories and towns, as well as his fear of power (especially relevant in the 1940s) don't have something in them relevant to today.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c6879717240996129760 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 7:43 AM</a><br><br>

I told her that dissatisfaction with Hillary was going to be such that some previously marginal figure was almost certain to pop up, seize the populist imagination and cause a serious crisis for Clinton's candidacy. We'll see what happens next, my personal prediction from here is that the Clinton campaign will play nice for a while in the hopes that Sanders burns out on his own, but if he doesn't then Sanders is going to be gruesomely crushed by the Clintonämmerung machine.

Well do I remember reading that series and later reading to my children: at the end, magic is gone. Now what do we do? <br><br>As a contextual side note, when the series was published, England was going through an unprecedented loss of countryside, including land and animals. Hedgerows that served as habitat for animals were being destroyed to make way for larger fields and farming was being transformed to the modern industrial model, to the immense detriment of English wildlife. And perhaps old country ways. I can imagine the old ones of the light being very upset indeed. Also, nice meta-analysis of plot. I suppose “The War against Change” plot could be a subset of “A Stranger Comes to Town,” one of the (I think) five universal plots.<br><br>As a result of this post, I am grappling again with the concept of change, or I should say, that since change is baked into the universe cake (the whole time-space continuum thing), with how humans grapple with and try to manipulate change: by thinking about and planning for the future while trying to hold on to the good parts of what we have (your old cultural conservators project comes to mind, as does some of the environmental conservation and restoration I’m involved with); by trying to stop change altogether, especially of the cultural kind; and by using the idea of change, attempting to harness change, as a way to physically manifest ideas in the real world that may or may not be of benefit to the denizens of the living earth. (Please notice attempt at ternary thinking.:))<br><br>the last is what dovetails with your plot analysis. A real world example is that in the first half of the 20th century one could go nearly anywhere by streetcar and light and heavy rail. There was no real reason to “change” things except to improve upon the system (more networks, better streetcars). Subsequently car companies and oil companies colluded to buy streetcar lines and put them out of business. While cars were enormously attractive and many people bought into the nascent car culture, others asked why these changes were necessary and how would they improve anything, and even tried to fight back. <br><br>The response was “don’t get in the way of progress!” backed up by plenty of money, power and political influence. Ironies abound. Change changes and has a habit of getting out of control. The law of unintended consequences takes over, often early in the process. Of course that particular change led (in part) to the enormously complex ramifications--pollution, sprawl, dangerous GHG emissions, obesity, public health problems, crumbling infrastructure, inefficient travel, and on and on, that we live with today.<br><br>So, one has to ask, or at least, I am asking, which changes imposed by other humans are worth embracing and which worth fighting? And it seems to me emphasis should be on <i>“imposed by other humans.”</i> Which set of humans, and what are their motivations? Also, if one, or a set of ones, can extrapolate trends, in part by utilizing some sort of holistic idea of how systems operate, perhaps it makes sense to grapple with human-imposed changes, so as to avert the worst, as those people that remained in favor of public transit did all those years (and continue to do). But it also makes sense for these “sets of ones” to create alternatives. Which brings me around to looking forward to next week’s post.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c1723873187736477225 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 10:05 AM</a><br><br>

As I'm sure you know, we have 3 major parties vying for leadership this time around. Our incumbent Conservative party, which has created more change over the last 8 years then any government in recent history by dismantling long-treasured political and social institutions and trying to actively discourage any semblance of a functional democracy (and getting away with it largely, too, thanks to public distraction, apathy, and cynicism). This has been a radical government in that sense, and is indeed hated and feared by many (including me!), despite its focus-group-tested campaign slogan of "strong, stable, government" (now is NOT the time for change! They repeat, given the economic uncertainties, which they regularly exploit). <br><br>The other two parties illustrate exactly what you describe. Traditionally filling roles of the centre and the left, they are difficult to tell apart at the moment, which both leaders are finding challenging. Their campaign slogans tell the tale: the Liberal party's is "It's Time for Change" and the New Democratic Party's is "Ready for Change". Yup. I know I've said it before, but honestly, you can't make this stuff up. Their campaign/party colours are red and orange...is this what you mean by L and M differences?! The Liberals are hoping that their candidate, son of our illustrious leader in the ostensibly boom years of the 60s and 70s, will create warm fuzzy memories of the good times and that this will be enough for people to elect him; the NDP is harkening back a little further to it's roots in founding Medicare and promises more traditional social programs. Both parties, in other words, want to go back to the future. <br><br>Luckily, we do have a very intelligent Green Party leader, and it seems likely they will win a few more seats this year, but a very tiny number overall. I'm hoping like crazy that one of the Conservative opponents wins, but my fear is that, as you describe with Clinton and Obama, even if they do, they won't actually *undo* the radical changes that the so-called conservative party has wrought...<br><br>PS: I'm really looking forward to your next series of posts. I find the re-imagining incredibly difficult. I think the environmental and collapse movements rely WAY too much on visions of the idealized agrarian past for their visions of the future. I watched the BBC series "Tudor Monastery Farm" last year, set in 1620. Although an excellent series, I found it heartbreaking to realize that their society was completely unsustainable too, ecologically, and contained all the roots of our current crisis. They just got away with their paradigm because the scale was so small (in population and energy availability). Imagining our future completely outside of our current paradigm seems an incredibly difficult feat for our measly human brains, apparently, which personally I think is why the doomer scenario is so appealing: it's easier. Sadly, the collapsitarians don't seem to do much imagining of what kind of society might grow out of the apocalypse once it passes...<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c1820676028956090536 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 10:49 AM</a><br><br>

The basic Jin Yong story (best exemplified by The Smiling Proud Wanderer, though these themes can be found in all of his novels which cross the 1,000 page mark) is that power corrupts - though the rulers of the status quo may seem noble, and the people challenging them may seem evil at first, when the protagonists dig deeper below the surface, they find that the rulers have some awful skeletons in the closet, and that some of the people insisting on change have reasonable (and non-evil) reasons for doing so. But if the protagonists choose to support the cause of change, it's generally a tragic mistake, since as soon as a new order is established they will become as bad as the old order in short time. The best thing the protagonist can do is going to a secluded mountain / island / etc. with their loved ones (who are often originally the other side of the status quo/change conflict as the protagonist) and withdraw from civilization.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c7287720811621048608 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 11:11 AM</a><br><br>

This goes to the fact that humans (particularly artists) cannot be reduced to simple dualities.<br><br>To answer your question, why are we frozen into two positions, staying the same, or progressing? I would submit that here, in the US, a large reason is the two party system that developed. Alternative visions, third paths, etc. are excluded from serious consideration by arcane state laws which allow Rs and Ds on the ballot automatically, but exclude Greens, Libertarians, and so on. i.e.- In IL you need 50000 sigs to get a 3rd party candidate on the ballot. A R or a D- 5000. My numbers may be a bit off, but the point stands.<br><br>My conclusion is that the political establishment (and maybe the public at large) does not want change. They a return to the Glory Days. It seems to me this boils down to "I keep my stuff, you come up to my level". The method of getting there just differs.

LeGuin's novels usually follow a hero who is the agent of change, but whose limited understanding creates change of questionable effect. In the Earthsea series, the heroes and heroines mostly regret the changes they have unleashed and work to undo them. In the Dispossessed, outside forces continually try to use the hero's potential for change to bolster the status quo, while he tries to get enough understanding of his world to effect real change instead. In The Left Hand of Darkness, the frozen rigidity of the status quo fights against any change, and change only becomes a possibility when the hero begins to recognize the rigid assumptions within himself. LeGuin saw that change was needed but feared it would come without the necessary deep understanding.<br><br>Frank Herbert's novels usually follow a hero who is the agent of change against a corrupted status quo to which he previously belonged. In the Dune series, the heroes' compassion for the disempowered causes them to question the system, revolt against it, and eventually mimic it. In Whipping Star/The Dosadi Experiment, bureaucratic gridlock provides cover for unseen torture, which the hero can only stop by manipulating the legalities of contract law against the system. In The White Plague, the hero has a psychic break when his high status as a scientist does not protect him from the suffering of war but does allow him to create a plague that causes everyone else to suffer as he had. Herbert saw the evil of the unchanging system but saw change merely as variation, not remedy.<br><br><br>Orson Scott Card's novels usually follow a hero with awesome ability to effect change whose talents are weaponized by the status quo. In the Ender series, the heroes' and heroines' desire to understand and build understanding with others is challenged and manipulated by demonizing propaganda from the status quo, so the changes they effect must be atoned for with better ones. In Songmaster, political intrigue and treachery turn the hero's truthtelling talent into a hidden weapon, which he finally chooses to direct against the corrupted establishment. Card saw the status quo as powerful enough to distort change away from its intended effects, thwarting real change from ever taking place.<br><br>Perhaps having a rich ambivalence to both change and continuity is a healthy survival adaptation in social primates. Things could get better; they could get worse; and they could do either through change or lack thereof.

There are a couple of things that don't get mentioned all that much in the Single Payer arena. The first is that the federal government's current outlays for health care on a per-capita basis are roughly equal to what our peer countries pay for universal health care on a per-capita basis. If we could wave a magic wand and get rid of all the bloat overnight, there would be no problem paying for it.<br><br>The other thing, mentioned by a couple of the posters, is that it would immediately collapse unless we got rid of private health insurance. Completely. Across the board. That gets rid of the health insurance companies, and it also gets rid of employer-pay health insurance as well as letting companies move funds in retirement plans earmarked for health care to pensions.<br><br>Of course, the likelihood of any of this happening is close to zero. While it would get a lot of big companies on board: "We don't have to buy employee health insurance any more? Wowser!" there are a lot of other interests that would be upset.

The current theme of every American politician these days is: "The other side is leading America astray. We have to take America back and return her to the right course." If anything, the rhetoric of both parties is regressive, not that it bears much resemblance to their policies.<br><br>No current politician wants to be identified with the Establishment. The status quo is denounced by all public figures. Of course, the extent to which any of these aristocrats is willing to tinker with the edifice that supports their status is dubious at best. But what of the unwashed masses clamoring for change? Are we really so intellectually bankrupt that we can't imagine an alternative to the officially-sanctioned narratives?<br><br>I don't believe it. Even in an apparently nihilistic story like "The Walking Dead," there's a deep yearning for community and meaningful social roles that can't be measured in quarterly earnings or contained in cubicles. If you haven't seen the show (or graphic novel), I would suggest checking it out. It's striking how the group of main characters reject the refuge of a spotless subdivision. The houses look pointless and sterile compared to the dirty, vicious world outside the community's walls. <br><br>I think they've realized that they can't go back to their pre-apocalyptic lifestyles.

In particular, I don't understand the obvious sentiment for Sanders, or for the leftist ideals being floated. (I'm choosing not to talk about rightists, as there seem to be far fewer of those in the conversation).<br><br>Some months ago, the Archdruid warned that we might be facing a 1914- or 1789-style period of convolution, maybe starting this year. He has also warned of a foreign-funded Syria-like domestic insurgency, and has warned that the USA is in a state of fragility resembling the 1980's USSR and it could soon be our December 1991. Any such thing would almost immediately cause a broad stepdown in economic activity, after which we likely won't be debating safety-net expansion but whether we can feed/hydrate Los Angeles, how to warm 1.5M refugees in winter including 450,000 children (a less serious issue for Syrians), and if any healthcare at all will be available for most people.<br><br>Look, I'm sure the Archdruid would say these things (domestic insurgency, etc) might or might not happen right away. But in any case our major systems are likely to break down within 20 years, and certainly within 50 years.<br><br>That is SOON.<br><br>So if we really take this message seriously, why are we debating the merits of 1976-style liberalism or its fall? If our social-support systems are going away, no matter what (and soon!), isn't it rational (for instance) to discus whether we should step these systems down voluntarily, in stages, creating suffering but at least giving individuals and localities some time to create their own systems....?<br><br>Or should we, Bernie Sanders-like, keep our systems running as strongly as possible, even expanding them while we can, to keep as many people healthy and alive for as long as possible..... despite the near-certainty of a catastrophic, chaotic breakdown, that won't be planned or staged, but concomitant with general breakdowns that *force* the end of our social systems?<br><br>Obviously those aren't the only possibilities one could advocate. But to my mind, if are going to talk about the (futile) national policy landscape at all, this seems like where the conversation ought to be.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c6639804311730874835 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 4:21 PM</a><br><br>

The first is Terry Pratchett’s Discworld series in which he has a whole slew of characters whose main role is to serve as a catalyst for change. Cohen the Barbarian and Rincewind the Wizzard are prime examples. Half the Discworld books are also about various civic figures trying to find ways to adapt to social and technological change in their city.<br><br>Another example is Dr Who the alien Time Traveller who gleefully travels through time and space causing explosions and inspiring others to act against the established order. The Doctor himself is not averse to change, being able to adopt a whole new personality and appearance instead of outright being killed.<br><br>And lastly Max of Mad Max fame who is a mythic figure that wanders in from the wastes and causes just enough chaos to allow ambitious locals to upturn their political structure or maybe just survive long enough to carve out some civilisation amid their new dark age.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c5946623383413299488 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 4:34 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, power corrupts. <br><br>Aragorn, like Gandalf, is wise enough to refuse the Ring. <br><br>Galadriel, who is far far older than Aragorn and far more capable and wise even than Gandalf, is seriously tempted to take the Ring for a moment (and she terrifies poor Frodo as she fights with the temptation). But in the end she finds enough strength in herself to refuse the temptation -- *barely* to refuse it, I dare say. <br><br>So the great and the good cannot help. But what about the little ones of the world, Frodo and Sam? <br><br>Sam is willing to help Frodo bear the burden any way he can, even though it destroy him in he end. But Frodo sadly (and unwisely, as the sequel shows) claims the burden is his to bear alone, and he actually is up to the task *until* almost the very last moment, when he stands on the brink above the fires of Mount Doom. <br><br>And then what happens? The ring is not destroyed by any noble or wise at at all. It is destroyed only because of the hunger and greed of Gollum, the single most loathly and despicable character in the whole story. Had Frodo killed Gollum when he had him in his power, as he and Sam wished, as they thought he deserved, all would have been lost forever. At the key moment, not knowing it to be the key moment, on general principles Gandalf urged the virtues of mercy and pity, though even Gandalf did not foresee what Gollum would do in the end.<br><br>Tolkien was Roman Catholic. He would have known something of the recent events that had led up to the Catholic dogmatic definition of Papal infallibility in 1869-70. And he would have known of the famous dictum of the Catholic Peer, Lord Acton, on that occasion, that "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority; still more when you superadd the tendency or the certainty of corruption by authority."<br><br>For Tolkien, the fictional world that he had created was saved not by a great protagonist, a good and virtuous and heroic man (or elf). Nor was it saved by a small protagonist, however humble or good or otherwise virtuous. It was saved in the end by an evil action of a wretched and corrupted protagonist in his hunger for power, nearly a stranger to anything virtuous or good or heroic.<br><br>I think there is a key lesson for our age in that insight of Tolkien's. I am no Roman Catholic, but I think Lord Acton was onto something very important. We remember the story as of Frodo, a small and common Hobbit, saved the day. He nearly did, but in the end he did not save it. It was Gollum who did the last needful thing that saved day. Without Gollum all would have been lost. <br><br>We may finally have need of the Gollums of our own world as we face the present crisis.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c1424979941359420292 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 4:40 PM</a><br><br>

Seriously, why the *heck* are we discussing the fall of 1970's style liberalism? Good or bad, Reagan or no Reagan, the social systems that worked in periods of increasing median wages and expanding net free energy are going to function *much differently* in an era of social dis-cohesion, declining wages, and falling net free energy.<br><br>I suppose the sentiment is that the Left *should have* pivoted toward recognition of a less-wealthy, less energy-intense future, and *should have* led us down the path of preparation..... and the lament is that instead they pivoted toward reacting to destructive Republican-ism.<br><br>But unfortunately, Reagan or no, Republicans or no, I doubt any message of a poorer, harder, less energy-intense future *could ever* have make headway (for long) even in the best of circumstances. And certainly not after Prudhoe Bay or the re-opening of Saudi oil spigots.<br><br>This is a democracy, and people vote their interests, their ideology, or their morals. Few, very few, vote on Club-of-Rome-style long-haul projections or on historiographical models of social cycles. And even if they did, you would never, ever, get majorities to agree on what should be done (let alone how much should be spent) to deal with the projected situation 50 years in the future.<br><br>To those of us who like (or liked) leftist politics, I want to encourage you to get off of Bernie's attempted return to halcyon liberalism of USA c. 1976. We believe our near-term future is more like eastern Europe of 1917-23. Or Robespierre's France. Or late-Zhou China. Or none of those, just steady and inexorable impoverishment. What, for example, would an effective policy for Rome have been c. 234, just prior to the Crisis of the Third Century? Putting more resources into the urban grain dole? Do we even believe what we've been saying here? Or are we mostly just angry at Reagan and them hate-loving Repubs?

I'm not sure I agree, but will have to read Jacobs and see. <br><br>Spanish Fly, nah, Tolkien corrupted Norse mythology, with a side helping of Finnish (he took a lot of ideas from the Kalevala).

They are really more outcomes than they are "changes," but we've been taught that we can avert any outcome when we put our best minds and enough money on the task.

It's a response to the failure of the status quo when nobody in the establishment is willing to do anything to fix what's failed. Mussolini, Hitler et al. came out of the fringes -- and so will the despot who will take over America to the cheers of millions of people who think they hate fascism, because despotism is the only way they can see to get out from under the failed consensus of the political class." <br><br>I agree that Wolin does sort of see it as gestating from within. However, Fascism is an established fact in America today (privatization of the public sphere is almost complete). it's taken place right under our noses. This is why the inverted totalitarianism theory resonates. Look around us and we find hapless figureheads in public office while the real power resides elsewhere. The 2001 Bush administration was one long daring daylight robbery. At the end they just backed the trucks up to the Fed and openly hauled away the cash. The history of this takeover, the first decade of the new century, could be pasted together from the headlines of the newspapers of the period, in one-inch tall letters. And we still apparently don't get it. The message remains un-received. <br><br>I think maybe change is too light a word for this. The breakdown of the ecosystem? Hmm. What we are headed towards is transformation. Change sort of feels like the seasonal variation of fashion or a new car or a new president. What is called for is more like transformation; proactively reimagining ourselves as a society and as individuals.

The thrust of your post suggests that poplar political movements are not addressing these problems in any really practical manner and what's needed is a magnitude of change that is basically beyond what is generally acceptable to think about in our current culture. From reading many of your other posts, I pretty sure that you agree that the consumption of the planet's physical resources by humans is unsustainable and, if not corrected, will eventually lead to a collapse of the human population from its current levels to something sustainable - which will be much less than 7B .<br><br>If we would like to mitigate this collapse it seems logical that we would think about both human reproduction practices and consumption behaviors as high value areas to affect "change". It seems to me that current concept of a mostly autonomous family unit with mom and pop and their own "private" children is something we should discuss. After all, prior to the advent of agriculture and the establishment of nobility, warriors and shamans to hold land and peasants, the rearing of children was undoubtedly much different - say in the time frame of about 50K years ago. Lots of writers focus on ways to reduce human consumption of physical resources; however, it seems highly unlikely than any conservation plan will succeed with an infinitely growing human population. Maybe we should discuss the way we reproduce?<br><br>As it stand now, our current concept of "family" appears to be one of those sacred things that can't be changed. For example, the UN "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" codifies our deep belief in our right to maintain a private "family" and reproduce at will according any kind of belief system we may be operating under. A few highlights from that document:<br><br>- The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.<br>- Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family.<br>- Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family....<br>- Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance....<br>- Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; .... to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.<br>- Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.<br><br>Should we not even have a discussion of our breeding and child-rearing habits? Is there a more sustainable model? Or, will we just focus on things like eating less meat while we drive even more species into extinction?<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c8750543099700935455 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 7:18 PM</a><br><br>

I think those are a given. Maybe in 50 years we won't have to worry about national civic responsibility, as the US will split into regional nation-states, but for now; what would your course of action be? Inaction? Looting the grain-dole barrels or simply letting them run dry? To be clear, I don't think you're talking about "suffering", of the poor as this happens, but death and (they won't go quietly into the night), destruction.

Hence the people who pretend to paddle it are actually pretending to paddle the other way from where they pretend they are pretending to paddle it.<br><br>Which way the current is actually moving might be a further consideration of great interest, but it actually doesn't matter, because we're drifting with it either way. Perhaps attempting even to dip a paddle in the water risks overturning the canoe, or maybe we're you-know-where with no paddles left at all. In any case, the reversal you pointed out doesn't suggest to me we should turn around in our seats or try to turn the canoe around yet again. It simply underscores the fact that we're drifting. That's how it becomes possible to be confused about the direction in the first place.<br><br>This may ultimately relate to a phrase I've been hearing fairly often since I began discussing these matters on other message boards: "political will." Usually, I hear it in the context of claims that some substantive deliberate collective change, or some great project (e.g. a massive alternative energy build-out), is possible because "all we need is the political will." (That seems to be the engineers' version of "they'll think of something." They <i>have</i> thought of something, but some other "they" has to make it happen.) The implication is that political will is easily conjured up in whatever amount needed (perhaps by "strong leadership"). But in fact, political will is exactly what we don't have and can't seem to obtain: the ability to put paddles into the water and push, to propel the vessel somewhere.<br><br>Less metaphorically, political will relates directly to the ability of a government to address long-term problems by enacting measures that cause immediate and broadly shared short-term and medium-term hardships—and remain in power while doing so. Historically, this has been most visibly achieved during all-out warfare, but just declaring metaphorical war on something (poverty, crime, drugs, terror) obviously doesn't do the trick.<br><br>(I'm reminded of the 1980 campaign of John B. Anderson, the last time I recall in American politics of any such overtly hardship-causing measure being proposed and actually garnering some support, and not coincidentally, the last time I personally participated in a national political election campaign. At the time it felt to me like a last chance, but in hindsight it was apparently already too late.)<br><br>Now, your other blog has a lot to say about individual will. Political will, as best I can tell, is similar in some ways but very different in most. (It's not quite the same thing as political power, nor resources nor wealth nor military might nor any other conventional dimension of power.)<br><br>Individual measures for preparedness and mitigation, such as LESS, are based on making use of individual will rather than expecting effective collective (on the regional or national scale) political effort.<br><br>So, like other commenters apparently, this leaves me wondering where you're going with this. A possible way (besides fascism) to generate political will, perhaps, or additional ways to get by without it? Ideas about what we might do with it if we only had some are, alas, already plentiful.<br><br>(Cue chorus of: "If I had the One Ring, ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum…")<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c1101979330527524959 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 8:30 PM</a><br><br>

The fear of change as rooted in the fear of being changed -- yes, that works, doesn't it? <br><br>Denys, exactly. The whole system is cracking under the strain right now; it's way past the time when repairs will work. <br><br>YCS, have those appeared in non-graphic, written form? I'm not really into visual media; if they were turned into novels, though, I'd consider checking 'em out. <br><br>Phil, you've touched on one of the subtle tragedies of 1960s America, the way that an entire generation turned its back on the mythic possibilities of this culture and country to fixate on a handful of foreign models. That happened in occultism as well -- the US had a huge occult scene before the 1960s that was by no means dependent on British models, but in the wake of the 1960s, nearly every American who was interested in occultism at all acted as though all magic was invented in Britain between the founding of the Golden Dawn in 1887 and whenever Gerald Gardner finished making up the original Wiccan Book of Shadows. Most of what had been American occultism went extinct thereafter. Fantasy fiction was the same way; there used to be an immense amount of it that drew on the American experience, but in the wake of Tolkien et al., everything had to be castles and dragons and some mix of Celtic and Germanic imagery. I grew up in the middle of that and it shaped my imagination profoundly; for me, for example, a place like Glastonbury has a magic that I've never felt anywhere on this continent -- but I'm painfully aware that that's a distortion and a blindness that came to me from the cultural and social context in which I was raised.<br><br>Carol, fascinating. I don't read any significant amount of young adult fiction these days, so wasn't aware of that. <br><br>Dmitry, good. Of course I'm not trying to get a narrative past the filters on the average American brain -- I work out here on the fringes, where archdruids lurk in the shrubbery and green wizards bay at the moon. Those who pick up alternative narratives, after all, will be disproportionately represented among the survivors of the coming mess. <br><br>Brian, fantasy has generally been reactionary in our time, <i>but it does not have to be that way</i>. L. Frank Baum, who invented the imaginary-world fantasy -- that I know of, Oz was the first imaginary country ever to get its own map -- was anything but reactionary, and wove a lot of his own political and social thought into his stories. William Morris, who invented the epic fantasy, was one of England's leading socialists. There are many other good examples. It's precisely the fixation of fantasy on reactionary themes that I want to challenge here. <br><br>Raven, of course not. The issue I'm exploring is what narratives can be spread among the dwellers around the Sea of Nurnen and the plateau of Gorgoroth so that, when Sauron's realm collapses of its own weight, something different might be helped to emerge from the mess. <br><br>Buddha, exactly. The only workable option is to start where we are, with what we have, right now. <br><br>Chloe, of course not. When people use the word "progress" nowadays they mean a tangled mess of utopian fantasies, unthinking emotional reactions, and unexamined assumptions about past and the nature of human history. I'm trying to get past that mess so we can talk about the future in terms that actually make sense.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c6917980782906306932 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 9:26 PM</a><br><br>

If enough of the people whose skills and insight are keeping things patched together and more or less running step aside and go do something less useless with their lives, that in itself might be enough to push the system over the edge. <br><br>RogerCO, yes, I'd gathered that something of the sort was under way from comments from my British friends and readers. I suspect it's going to be a spectacular mess on both sides of the pond. <br><br>Stu, exactly. The conversion of politics to a celebrity cult, by the way, is one of the things Spengler predicted well in advance. <br><br>Btidwell, I'm making a start by teaching a quarter to a third of a million readers a month (this blog's current readership) that there are things more interesting than the latest media thingy to talk about and reminding them of the existence of hobbies. Where you are, with what you have, right now...<br><br>Brian, Brin fascinates me. You'd think that someone with his intelligence, and the kind of taste for absurdity needed to enjoy <i>Bored of the Rings</i> (which I also find sidesplitting), would be able to shake himself out of the utterly uncritical blind faith in the contemporary mythology of progress that pervades this essay and so much of his other writing. <br><br>David, obviously I disagree. I think you're reading far too many of your own ideas and ideals into Tolkien -- which is easy to do; for the first decade or so after my original encounter with the trilogy, at the age of eight, I'd have said exactly what you did. Read through it again sometime and step back from the magic long enough to watch the rhetoric. In Middle-earth, war against the bad guys is always a good thing because, well, they're so evil, and it's all their fault anyway, and of course the kings and nobles are kings and nobles because they're wise and good. Where have we heard these lines before? <br><br>As for comparing Tolkien with Morris, there you've got things exactly backwards. Tolkien was profoundly familiar with Morris, of course -- I don't think there's a fantasy novel in the English language from before the Second World War Tolkien didn't read -- but several important aspects of the trilogy can be seen as a critique of Morris and his ideas. It's surely not accidental, for example, that Tolkien chose to give his wizard nearly the same name as the great villain of Morris' <i>The Well at the World's End</i>, Gandolf of Utterbol -- or that the quests that frame the two stories are so precisely opposite each other in their nature, even though they begin and end so similarly. <br><br>Pongo, that's possible, but the Clinton campaign is really stumbling at this point due to the candidate's inability to rouse the least enthusiasm outside of her own small circle of fans. <br><br>Tidlösa, yes, and that's very much part of it as well. The fantasy that purely notional action like participating in a march can stop things from changing is very important to a lot of people. <br><br>RPC, nah, the Dems don't want the conditions of 1973; there are all those banking laws their rich friends don't like that they'd have to reenact, for example. Nor does the GOP actually want the conditions of 1898 -- what would they do if the US was no longer the most important nation on the planet? That's why I suggest that the Dems actually want the conditions of right now, and the GOP wants things to keep going further in the same direction they've been going for the last forty years. <br><br>Mick, and I bet he kept his promises!<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c3752530443487549360 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 10:15 PM</a><br><br>

What are we supposed to do, John, throw cold water on them?” Yes, please. <br><br>Bernie Sanders has been a de facto Democrat since 1990, and has been used to kill off third party organization in Vermont since then, see: http://www.libertyunionparty.org/?page_id=363 Bruce Dixon, of Black Agenda Report, has what I think is a pretty good take on Sanders: http://www.blackagendareport.com/bernie-sanders-in-hillarys-pocket - “The job of the sheepdog candidate is to herd leftish voters and activists back into the Democratic party one more time by giving perhaps sincere but limited and ineffectual voice to some of their issues.<br>Of course every sheepdog candidate since Jesse Jackson in '84 and 88 always folds his tent at the end of primary season to support the main corporate stooge Democrat for the November election.” As for the hysterical Republicans, the one who will emerge from the idiotic fray will be Jeb Bush, and the Democrat will be boring old Hillary - although JMG and I have a running bet on this. I predict Trump will mount an independent challenge in the manner of Ross Perot, which will end up, by hook or by crook, going nowhere. <br>Since the introduction of electronic voting machines, under centralized long-distance control, it only matters who counts the votes. We have an ongoing federal lawsuit about that very matter here in Kansas, where a professor from Wichita State University has found some very interesting statistical anomalies in the results for Governor Brownback’s re-election, which he won by a very narrow margin. The Kansas Secretary of State is stonewalling like crazy, refusing to release results which are public records. He’s controversial for other reasons - he wrote numerous immigration laws for states like Arizona, and parts of the Patriot Act, too, which have spectacularly failed judicial scrutiny. And he just threw out 20,000 votes which he’d ruled “provisional”, important in an election where the margin was just over 22,000 votes. On top of that, his office was given prosecutorial power over election laws by the Kansas Legislature, last year. So we may be in for some interesting times here in Kansas.<br>I was having a conversation this afternoon with a twentysomething friend who works as a bicycle mechanic, and he doesn’t vote in national elections, because the outcome doesn’t matter. I told him he was right and I don’t vote in national elections, either, or support candidates for national office. It’s a waste of time, energy, and money. As for state elections, see above, they may no longer be a means for changing government; but local elections, that’s another story entirely.<br>Back in my senior year in high school in 1974, after working on a political campaign, I was invited by the Minority Leader of the Kansas Senate to be one of his legislative assistants. I came in and started talking a bit about “evil” Republicans and “good” Democrats, and this lasted for a couple of days, and then the Senator sat me down in his office, closed the door, and stopped his calls, and he explained a few things to me. Namely, that when the elections finished, people were no longer Republicans or Democrats - he and the Republican Majority Leader were close personal friends and they worked together on legislation. Partisan talk was just for the voters, after the election, it, and the banners and the platforms and all that stuff was put away in the closet, so to speak. <br>My take is that government will step in the way of change, of fight against people bringing it about. In the end analysis, people will have to fend for themselves - national health care and other national systems for social welfare - or even state systems - are in a state of collapse and cannot possibly survive. It’s going to come down to neighborhoods and people, representative government will collapse and become largely irrelevant at best, a hated enemy at worst.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c3672617200263281220 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 10:47 PM</a><br><br>

When people start talking about moral absolutes, all they're actually doing is claiming unearned authority for their own moral preferences and prejudices. As human beings, we have no access to the absolute; if there are moral absolutes, our minds are too finite and our capacities for knowledge too limited by our biological and cultural frameworks to have the least idea what they are; all we've got are our ideas about morality, which are -- like everything else human -- flawed, historically contingent, and constantly changing. That doesn't make moral ideas unimportant; they're the codes we've evolved to enable us to live with one another without cutting each other's throats too often -- but that's all they are and all they can ever be.<br><br>The claim that some particular set of flawed, historically contingent, and changing beliefs are objectively knowable moral absolutes is very common in history, of course. It normally leads straight to the demonization of those who disagree, with violence a likely outcome. Figures such as Sauron, Voldemort, et al. are great examples here, because they're wholly imaginary portrayals of pure unmotivated evil -- as I noted in my post, they're evilly evil out of pure evil evilness, without any other motive than that. The history of the last century and a half is full of examples of what happens when that sort of thinking is applied to actual living human beings -- and the rhetoric of moral absolutes you've proposed here is a crucial step, arguably <i>the</i> crucial step, down that ghastly road.<br><br>Pygmycory, "stuck" is a massive understatement. At this point, to borrow a lively colloquialism, the USA is screwed, blued, and tattooed. As for a bankrupt state, again, I'd go further: it's a failed state that hasn't realized that fact yet. <br><br>Other Tom, disconnecting as far as possible from the government feeding trough would also be a useful step, but that's one that very few people -- including those who rail the loudest about government handouts -- are willing to do. <br><br>Clay, that's one of the reasons I haven't been able to stomach superhero comics since my misspent youth. It was just too much of a disappointment that Green Arrow never got to pin Goldman Sachs execs to the wall with well-aimed arrows!<br><br>Revere, gah. Don't even joke about that!<br><br>Tasha, is that anarchy, or simply the recognition that the government isn't there for your benefit? <br><br>Carmiac, I have a sneaking fondness for the whole Mad Max franchise, precisely because it's not just rehashing the War Against Change. It treats drastic, cataclysmic change as something that happens, has happened, and will continue to happen, and deals with individuals coping (or failing to cope) with the consequences. <br><br>Mister R., for what it's worth, my guess is that the GOP doesn't actually want anything of the kind; they know perfectly well that even if a US attack on Iran didn't put two or three carriers on the bottom of the Indian Ocean and turn the necklace of US bases along the Persian Gulf's other shore into smoldering rubble, the result would redefine the word "quagmire" and finish the process of tipping the Middle East into all-out war. The reason they're yelling so loudly about it is that it's Obama's treaty. <br><br>Adrian, excellent.

That's the thing about Tolkien; he wasn't a simple thinker by any means. There's an immense richness to his version of the War Against Change, and a clear sense of its potentials for evil as well as good, that you just don't get in most of his imitators. <br><br>Greg, Nixon also looked so liberal because in his day, there were plenty of liberal Republicans and plenty of conservative Democrats. Washington state, where I grew up, tended to have them more often than not; four-time state governor Dan Evans was a leading liberal Republican, for example, and all-but-eternal senator Henry "Scoop" Jackson was a nationally famous conservative Democrat. All that went by the boards in the wake of the Reagan counterrevolution. <br><br>Backyardfeast, the challenge of trying to imagine something that isn't just more of the same is huge, no question. I'll be exploring one potential vision in the weeks and months ahead, but that's as much to get other people riled up enough to go off in their own directions as anything else. <br><br>Mark, a society terrified of change is going to be a hard sell for anything. I'll be talking next week about how to get past that. <br><br>Steve, the Dems want neoliberalism to retain some elements of the welfare state -- that's as much as they can imagine, and the sum total of their disagreement with the GOP. <br><br>Notes, if those are available in English, I'll have to chase one or more of them down. A very Taoist sort of fiction!<br><br>William, Tolkien's one of my faves, too. I can enjoy the man's prose without buying into his politics. <br><br>Christophe, there's quite a bit of good imaginative fiction that doesn't follow the War Against Change narrative.

It's precisely the fact that it's a living myth that causes so many people not to treat it as "real" mythology. <br><br>Ed-M, the first time the US is actually defeated in a war -- not just bogged down until we walk away, but actually forced to accept terms dictated by the other side -- this nation is going to have a world-class collective nervous breakdown. I'm far from sure the nation as a political and cultural unit will survive the experience. <br><br>John, fascinating. The Campbellian monomyth doesn't have to be a War Against Change -- the one who goes off on an adventure can return transformed, and transform his or her community in turn -- but you're right that that's not how it's usually used.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c5097531352902883570 title="comment permalink">8/13/15, 11:48 PM</a><br><br>

That's why the system we have is so baroque; it's not about health care, it's about propping up the financial side of the economy. <br><br>Rebecca, it's once you grasp that there's no sure refuge against the coming of change that the possibilities begin to open out in front of you. <br><br>Mickey, that's the fascinating thing about current US politics. Everyone claims to be against the status quo, and the policies they propose to change the status quo are exactly the policies that created the status quo in the first place. <br><br>Nuku, good! That's two readers who have a decent level of mythological literacy. You get tonight's gold star. <br><br>Heretick, ah, but nothing's dragging us down, we're marching boldly down in the bizarre conviction that the direction we're going is up. <br><br>Andropos, not everyone on this blog shares your distaste for 1970s liberalism, you know -- nor does the level of crisis I'm predicting preclude maintaining some sort of social safety net for the vulnerable in at least some places. <br><br>Lucius, of course. The fact that the War Against Change dominates contemporary imaginative literature doesn't mean that there aren't exceptions; in fact, it tends to mean that the better authors are the exceptions, because they've got the talent to come up with original narratives. As I noted to Christophe, it's the vast torrent of crap that fixates on the War Against Change. <br><br>Robert, I don't know that anybody but Tolkien himself could do justice to his very distinctive vision!<br><br>Andropos, er, you may want to sit back and breathe deeply for a while. <br><br>Wolfbay, which is one of the reasons why those portions of the country that have overactive regulatory bodies might be best avoided just now. Not everybody has to face that sort of thing, you know. <br><br>Blue Sun, exactly. The delusion that nothing is inevitable -- at its root, the delusion of human omnipotence and entitlement -- is among the most disastrously wrongheaded of the ideas driving us toward catastrophe. <br><br>Ralph, as I've noted here before, your use of the word "fascism" is based on <a href=../../2014/02/fascism-and-future-part-three-weimar.html rel=nofollow>a total misunderstanding of what fascism actually was</a>. What we have in America today isn't fascism, it's the sort of normal authoritarian statism you get in most societies under strain. When fascism comes to America, it won't be waving the banner of the status quo; it will be the great alternative to the status quo, the movement everyone's been waiting for that will break through the gridlock, pry loose the fingers of failed policies from the throat of the nation, and fix what's wrong -- just as it did when it came to Italy, Germany, et al. People in Weimar Germany used to insist they lived under a fascist government, too, and that's one of the things that helped Hitler seize power and show them what fascism was actually like.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c3785073979884980934 title="comment permalink">8/14/15, 12:09 AM</a><br><br>

The "change" that's being fought in the book is not social or economic, its the aggression from Mordor, brought about by the consequences of the unrestrained Will to Power. Although Tolkien disavowed direct comparisons, it's obvious that the LOTR was written partly in the shadow of WWII, when a coalition of nations did actually conduct a War Against Change, and, thankfully, also won. The Fascist parties they fought were always quite clear that they represented a modern, scientifically based concept of race and society which would sweep aside old-fashioned decadent democracy and usher in the modern world. Their opponents were dismissed as nostalgic reactionaries. <br>Why is this important? Liberalism, for all its faults, has not been as violently destructive, but, as you yourself point out, it sells a simple model of progress, and delegitimizes all criticism in advance by presenting its critics as reactionaries who can't get with the modern world. Fighting against that ideology implies thinking that some things are actually worth defending, and that life and society are not eternally renewed like motor cars, with better models. In practice this is what most of us do think. <br>Incidentally, the comparison with Morris is not with "The Well" but with "News from Nowhere", which presents a vision of a blend of tradition and modernism which has always informed a certain concept of socialism. Tolkien was writing in a different tradition, but the similarities (especially the distrust of power) are there all right.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c5539398598152335092 title="comment permalink">8/14/15, 4:57 AM</a><br><br>

The first part of the book is about local American politics and only gets to the Sadaam Husseins of the world much later on. The endorsements on the cover might lead you to believe that his ideas have been vetted and approved of by Important People and three letter agencies. The executive summary is that leaders anywhere will do whatever it takes to remain in power (within the limits of their conscience, I might add, so your local city council cannot be compared to the brutality of Sadaam or Hitler, say), and this means furthering the interests of their base--and you ain't part of their base, never mind you might be part of one of the blocs that they count on come election time. In this light, even change (think Conan as a neutral example from fiction) might be implemented in furthering the end of reign perpetuation. This is a bit different that the fictional resistance to change in so much popular literature, and the popularity of that literature tells a story in itself (although I must confess my mind doesn't want to linger over the issue). It resonates back and explains a lot of 19th century politics in this country, for instance, from the White House riots following Jackson's election (there wasn't enough of the promised graft to actually go around), to my maternal grandfather getting a quarter for his first vote when he was 12 (the last Republican he ever voted for, ever). Politicians will do what it takes.<br><br>It makes me hope, nervously, for some third party candidate that might actually offer a worthwhile choice.

Since we've been buckling down for decades to deny reality even more than usual, Tolkien and his myriad imitators have become incredibly popular.

There's plenty of conservatism in that world, but also characters that break the stereotypes and ones who change things. The world its set in has its own history that the reader learns gradually more about, a history in which there are both long standing traditions and great changes that have happened.<br><br>Since the series isn't finished yet, a lot is still unknown, but I do think one of the reasons the series has gotten so popular is that people are fed up with the simplistic thinking of so much fantasy that you're describing.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c85915447258932867 title="comment permalink">8/14/15, 8:36 AM</a><br><br>

I was thinking "Gandalf on the Roof," because he spends a considerable interval up there on top of Orthanc, while the roof would be the last place I'd expect a balrog. But of course, that's also true of fiddlers, which is part of the point of the original title, so I guess you're a step ahead of me again. :)<br><br>As for political will—no, I disagree, in that it's not just money and material resources alone. The same present lack of political will precludes measures that would save money and resources, such as terminating expensive unsuccessful programs (military weapon projects, drug enforcement, industrial subsidies, education-related mandates, take your pick). Or telling the public (and having the public accept) "we tolerate tens of thousands of deaths per year to have the freedom of automobile travel; we can tolerate a possible few hundred more to have the freedom to assemble for public events without herding through metal detectors." Or anything remotely resembling rationing. (When politicians railed against the boogeyman of "rationing health care," were they not admitting that the supply of health care is inadequate to cover every collective want? And if so, then isn't rationing it actually a good idea?) There are, of course, individual reasons why each of these and many other proposals are politically untenable, from vested interests to sunk-cost fallacies to unreasonable public expectations of perfect safety. Those reasons all contribute, just as limits on money and resources do, to the present lack of political will.<br><br>That's why dramatic social restructurings including fascism and totalitarianism can drum up political will, even though they cannot directly create wealth or material resources. They can convince or force people to take risks, defer desires, and otherwise act against their own individual and immediate interests in support of the cause. That's also why the prospect of fascism looms when political will is otherwise exhausted.<br><br>Or so it seems to me, at the moment. I am, of course, staying tuned.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c3641914821706833860 title="comment permalink">8/14/15, 8:58 AM</a><br><br>

Please know that I bought your Long Descent book when it first came out and I'm a regular reader of your blog. I think your long-descent thesis is still one of the best analysis of our situation and I've recommended your books and blog countless time. My comment about meat had nothing to do with your writings - sorry if I implied that. I often listen to public radio and frequently hear authors advocating people should use crop land to directly feed humans instead of feeding cattle, etc. I'm sure you're familiar with the argument. I also agree with your "leading by personal example" and recall your comments about things like turning down home heating thermostats - in our home, we do many such simple things that agree with your advice. Also, I'm a bicycle advocate and work in our community to promote ways to cut down on automobile use. However, I do think that there is a limit to personal example and public advocacy is needed - after all, it was your book that got me started thinking about a lot of issues.<br><br>Apparently, something in my comment struck you the wrong way. However, the main point I was trying to make was in support of your contention that most people resist change - and what could be a bigger change than rethinking our beliefs about family and reproduction? I certainly wasn't think about doing the same thing over again!<br><br>As to your question: "how do you propose to effect change" - I was merely suggesting that it would be a good idea to have a public discussion of reproduction rights. China did this and the debate over their policy rages on. The US has largely just focused on the "right to life" debate and not on the larger issue of sustainable population. OOH, I doubt that this discussion will occur in the mainstream media until the need is painfully obvious. OTOH, in a forum like this, it just seemed to me that this discussion was possible. If there ever is a wider agreement that the US should address this issue, there are lots of ways to effect change. Probably the most effective is just the bully pulpit to advocate for small families as was done at one time in Japan. Of course stronger measures can be taken with tax codes and other public policies. However, at this time, I'm only suggesting that sustainable population be considered a legitimate part of the public discourse - which currently only seems to be acceptable on the fringes of our culture. Clearly, this topic is unwelcomed by many people - but it seems to me that you're not adverse to unpopular ideas! However, if you feel that discussing the population issue is pointless - I can respect that.<br><br>BTW, I can't figure out why I come up as "Unknown" in your blog as I've joined your site, used a Google name for the comment, etc.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c4626748891617758908 title="comment permalink">8/14/15, 10:17 AM</a><br><br>

Of these, only The Deer and the Cauldron is a major work. I haven't read the John Milford translation myself, but what I've read about it indicates that much has been lost in the translation. That's not a surprise since it's Jin Yong's most satirical and witty novel. Even though some people say it's his best novel, it's certainly not representative since Jin Yong chose to go against his usual style in many ways (for example, The Deer and the Cauldron has the only Jin Yong protagonist who would rather live in a bustling city than on an isolated island/mountain playing music and reading literature with his loved ones). Nonetheless, The Deer and the Cauldron is what I recommend you read if you want to experience Jin Yong's fiction in a printed English translation.<br><br>Of course, if you're willing to read online fan translations of Jin Yong novels, you have a lot more options.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c5109281023471844229 title="comment permalink">8/14/15, 11:03 AM</a><br><br>

The primary dilemma is "who will defend those rights?" And if there is an entity powerful enough to defend these rights, is it also powerful enough to trample them?<br><br>While the UN Declaration might be a warm and fuzzy starting point, it leaves aside the very difficult details of implementing and maintaining legal and social structures that embody them. To cite just one example, the "right" from your post that I quoted above may stand at odds with other "rights" in the UN Declaration such as #17, the "right" of ownership. We are commonly born into a world where everything short of the air we breathe and perhaps some large bodies of water is "owned" by someone else. I think we can agree that these are hardly sufficient by themselves to support a decent standard of living. Given that this is the case, does my right to a reasonable standard of living require others to surrender some of their rights to ownership? Who will decide how this dilemma will be resolved? And if some entity has such authority, can we really say that our right to ownership is even real? Furthermore, if that entity has the power to transfer our right of ownership to another, what is to prevent that authority from simply appropriating our property for its own benefit?<br><br>Another example which you yourself alluded to is the dilemma of a perpetually growing population on a finite planet. We don't have to extrapolate very far into the future to see that almost every one of the rights enumerated in the UN Declaration will fall victim to the "right" to marriage and family if left unchecked.<br><br>Implementing social structures that embody such rights is a snarly task, and one that can never be completed to everyone's satisfaction. At best, we can only come up with something that most of us are willing to live with. And in the end, the only guarantee of our rights is our power and willingness to defend them against usurpers.

In the 1970's the US did export planes (Boeing, Lockheed, MacDonald-Douglas), computers (IBM, DEC, various PC makers) construction equipment (Caterpillar, Deere)and various luxury goods (Tiffany). and agricultural products. et even back then, we were running huge trade deficits with Japan and sometimes Europe. Bring this picture forward to today - planes - most are produced under co-production agreements with customer countries US content varies between 20-40%, computers most of the market had migrated to laptops and tablets, major US brands do fairly well (Apple, etc) but production is Asian. In Asia, knockoff brands do very well. For construction equipment, most production has migrated to Korea and China. Agricultural products still do fairly well. <br><br>I would contend that the US has never been an export oriented producer This can be traced to certain cultural biases being present. A.) English measurement Ever have a car that required Whitworth standard wrenches? B. Refusal to alter goods for foreign markets, and establish foreign marketing efforts.

For example, a "progressive" in this neck of the woods believes that current shambolic family arrangements represent, um, "progress". And - cough - "traditional" moms and dads that stay together and raise the kids conform to a laughable Ozzie and Harriet model that only exists in a fictional 1950's TV-Land. <br><br>See, by this way of thinking, there's something wrong with un-divorced and happily married moms and dads. They just aren't with it, they aren't tuned in to modern times. This model of the family is so out of step. Why did they marry? That is SO un-hip. And, if they married, why didn't they divorce? Isn't that the thing to do? I mean, who is it nowadays that doesn't have an ex, that hasn't been through a bitter break-up? Isn't staying together indicative of a character defect, a timidity, a lack of self-confidence maybe? <br><br>So moms and dads divorce and the politically correct cant is that the kids will be OK, that the kids adapt to whatever living arrangement takes shape with its impoverished single-parent-hood or its ever shifting cast of live-in "partners" or "significant others" or whatever it is that people call their boyfriends-girlfriends nowadays. Because it's the adults that have to be happy first. <br><br>Now, I'm no family counseling professional. But I've seen some of the mess and, from what I've seen, this is bunk. The kids are not ok. They're screwed up and stressed out. I've heard a few teachers of long experience say that once upon a time they'd have two kids out of thirty that acted up but now it's a half a dozen and you can't keep a lid on things. And the teachers cite the kids' troubles at home. I've seen Brady Bunch style families cobbled together from divorce and re-marriage where, in one situation, out of four kids whose lives were up-ended, one got so depressed as to require medication and another kid got so unhappy that he tried suicide - twice. <br><br>Yet, by the para-logic (or whatever you want to call it) of the "progressive", whatever you come up with as a family arrangement is the OK thing. If you complain that, by your own eyes, it sure don't look OK, you're unthinking and unenlightened, talking anecdotes and ignoring scientifically obtained facts and evidence. But I wonder how many others see what I see. How many anecdotes does it take?<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c2328102512759558772 title="comment permalink">8/14/15, 12:33 PM</a><br><br>

I never read any of these books, or watched any of the movies mentioned until my children showed an interest in them. Actually, I cannot claim any literary knowledge outside of Mark Twain (his complete works), Arthur Conan Doyle (his Sherlock Holmes collection), and Voltaire (Candide only).<br><br>However, these movies all viciously and wantonly violated all of the rules of story telling that my father had passed down to me while I was growing up, and I could not understand how anyone could not be outraged by these movies, especially their endings, which are beyond ludicrous.<br><br>I will give one example: in one of the hobbit movies, some elves make a prophecy about what will happen to the guy carrying the ring -- he will die. So far so good, but what actually happens? He is miraculously rescued from death at the last minute and goes on to live out his life in relative peace and quiet. Huh? (For that matter, numerous main actors "die" repeatedly during the films and then miraculously "reappear", making a mockery of the whole concept of the grieving process and even the idea of life and death itself.)<br><br>The whole point of a prophecy is to set the stage for its fulfillment and the only thing that really matters is how the hero will face his destiny. That is the "real" story -- the manner in which he confronts his fate. But that has all been tossed out the window by pretending the prophecy never even existed.<br><br>I have often wondered if this was based on Jewish religious thought, which does not accept death at all and believes (?) that everyone will live forever -- if not here on earth, then most certainly in a wonderful place somewhere "out there".<br><br>However, I never saw these movies from the viewpoint of a contest between those who want to change things and those who want the status quo. That was a keen insight, and I believe you are probably right. It helps me to understand the outrageous violations of basic story telling much better now and I am glad you saw that. I have also noticed that movies that do not follow this pattern tend to be unpopular even though they are excellent movies and well acted. Some are filled with famous actors, but they are largely unknown because they do not follow the "War Against Change" plotline, which I suppose is the only thing our culture cares about now.<br><br>Anyway, thanks for a great and insightful article on modern literature and cinema.<br><br>DeVaul<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c2976102615474110192 title="comment permalink">8/14/15, 2:44 PM</a><br><br>

The question I asked last week, why does the stock market react to job data only by ficusing on the Fed's next interest rate hikes, may have to do with being stuck in a mythology where the outter world (Main Street) plays little role.<br>"Adrian, excellent. Exactly; once you get past the rhetoric of progress and start talking about specific changes being carried out by specific groups of people, to benefit some people and harm others, you've got the basis for clear thought, and thus for strategy."<br>It may be that fighting change in mythology is a way to maintain mythology in a state where it defends certain arrangements favouring the fighter. The science of economics lately seems bent on defending what is amounting to a mythology (free market, etc) justifying the channeling of wealth towards the financial sector.<br><br><br>Adrian wrote "I can imagine the old ones of the light being very upset indeed." In Lord Of The Ring, the Elves are fighting the Dark Lord even though they know that ultimately their age is ending anyway, regardles of the issue of the war. So they are not really fighting against change, they are fighting in spite of change, to make the best of their waning presence.<br>In nowadays' fantasy industry, Elves represent the hidden force of nature, some lost sense of beauty and magic in the world. In this way, they are fighting against change, under the justification of fighting for a long-lost Golden Age. But in the centuries before ours, folklore represented Elves as Impish beings, constantly playing tricks on unwary humans and, in a way, playing the role of tricksters or, if you will, fighting for change.<br>This evolution, which may only be my own perception of the varying ideas humans have made of Elves as an occult force, goes hand in hand with your posts treating dreams about machine. We dreamt of a world where everything would be treated as an object, a long time ago, and we got that reflected in our aesthetics. Take biology, and the inconvenient aspects of it... take the way people nowadays view animals as mere objects of cuteness (and of cute videos) while willingly ignoring all the more organic aspects of caring for an animal.<br>From an occult perspective, maybe the Elves actually are our perception of some occult forces. In this case, have we come to worship the wrong gods ? That would explain why the images of Elves now manifest to us as nostalgia, whereas they used to represent an invigorating source of natural forces. In the end, it may appear that human projects are made of belief in certain gods or deities, and a lot of the predicaments described in this blog can be traced back to the shift from one object of worship towards another.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c109421783258515668 title="comment permalink">8/14/15, 5:21 PM</a><br><br>

The process of divorce and custody was years and years of pain, regret, remorse and loss.

I agree on the "population thing" (BTW, I didn't read JMG's comment back to you as critical, just more as honest questioning). For me, it's one of the main reasons I stopped participating or being interested in any of the Abrahamic religions (not looking to start a debate here). I don't hesitate, in the rare circumstance for this subject to arise with anyone, to calmly and kindly state that I think it's immoral for a religion to encourage reproduction beyond replacement levels. It's a very, very small thing "to do" (besides giving money to population-related charities) and it's definitely not always a pleasant conversation that follows, but to me, it's important to put that thought out there. Population size WILL be controlled. We're just choosing the unconscious, ugly way, e.g. having outside forces greatly reduce it through miserable means.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c4114245090767263262 title="comment permalink">8/14/15, 6:34 PM</a><br><br>

I also think of the way that second wave feminism was transformed from a movement that actually questioned many of the basic presuppositions of modern society into a movement to convince middle class white women to embrace roles previously assigned to middle class white men. <br><br>Denys, I have very mixed feelings about them, and since Stewart Brand has rather too much to do with them -- and his descent from environmentalist to nuclear-industry media whore has been very troubling for this former <i>Coevolution Quarterly</i> reader to watch -- I don't follow them closely. <br><br>Scotlyn, I honestly wish that Pratchett had taken the time to write some serious fantasy. He was good enough to have shaken the genre out of its doldrums. <br><br>Denys, no argument there. The hours I spent in the public schools were, of all the hours of my life so far, the most completely wasted -- and by and large the most miserable as well; and yes, I know that the schools have gotten much worse since I escaped. <br><br>Candace, if you have the chance, you might have a look at my book <i>Green Wizardry</i>, which covers some of the options for disengaging. Don't worry about what other people think, by the way -- by and large, they don't. <br><br>David, well, we'll have to disagree, as I think you're missing a great deal of what Tolkien put in the trilogy -- and yes, I'm quite clear on the difference between his work and the trash churned out by the Tolkien-imitation industry after his death. As for Morris, again, I'm quite familiar with <i>News from Nowhere</i>, but his fantasy novels are to my mind far more important -- which may well be why they've been shoved into the memory hole so comprehensively. <i>The Well at the World's End</i> in particular is a profoundly political book, and embodies a critique of political socialism that gains immense force from the fact that its author was critiquing it from inside. <br><br>Das Monde, almost anything can be turned into a version of the War Against Change if you simply tinker with it enough!<br><br>Wolfbay, glad to hear it. <br><br>Steve, I'll see if I can chase down a copy sometime. <br><br>Brian, I disagree that most people are reactionary by default. There are times in which that's true, and times when it's not -- and the saturation of the media by the War Against Change makes me think that a lot of people right now are interested in change, and those who benefit from the lack of change may just be nervously aware of this. <br><br>RCW, testimony for the opposing position duly noted. <br><br>Howard, interesting. I didn't know that -- I haven't read the series. <br><br>N Montesano, indeed it was. Coll son of Collfrewr, if my memory serves me right -- and I loved those books, too. <br><br>Patricia, I sometimes think it's precisely that people have an uncomfortable awareness of just how close we are to crisis that so many of them get so uncomfortable when the subject is mentioned. <br><br>Myriad, okay, in that sense I'm not going to argue. I think, though, that a new American fascism is going to find its options very sharply constrained by the fact that even with a lot of the graft and fossilization removed, the US doesn't have anything like the resources left to play the role it played in the 20th century.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c3987321146351131233 title="comment permalink">8/14/15, 7:06 PM</a><br><br>

Factor in the reality that every human society is made up of irrational actors and the appeal of a despot who will make people do what they think they ought to do anyway is even easier to understand. <br><br>Unknown, here again, calling for a public discussion of reproductive rights is nothing new; that's been being proposed since the 1960s, with zero results. Talk, as Zen masters like to say, does not cook the rice, and trying to start a conversation that nobody else is interested in having may take a prize for least productive action ever in a world on the brink of cascading crisis.<br><br>Notes, okay, a friend of mine who's literate in Chinese has mentioned "Fox Volant of Snowy Mountain," which I assume is the same book you've mentioned. I've wanted to take in some Chinese gungfu fiction for a while now, and will put Jin Yong on the get-to list. <br><br>Unknown, somehow I managed to miss that song!<br><br>Bob, exactly. After the Second World War, when the US was left with the only significant industrial plant that hadn't been pounded by bombs, we could export to the rest of the world because we were the only game in town. These days, most of what we export is raw materials, for the reasons you've noted -- and you're right, also, that that's not likely to change. <br><br>Roger, I have a very mixed read on that. My parents divorced when I was ten, and that was very hard to live through; my wife's parents remained married until her mother died, and she feels that a divorce would probably have been better for all concerned, especially her and her siblings. That said, today's culture of entitlement and instant gratification very likely leads to a lot of bad marriages and a lot of equally bad divorces. <br><br>Bob, exactly. If Sanders gets into office, his capacity to do much of anything will be minimal unless he agrees to go along with business as usual -- and if he does so, his election won't matter. <br><br>DeVaul, the movies were total garbage. It's pretty common for movies to be worse than the books they were based on, but in my opinion, Peter Jackson took that to new lows. The prophecy you mention? That's not in the books; Jackson stuck it in there, along with a lot of other idiotic tinkerings. (Note for the Tolkien-literate: "<i>Peter u bagronk sha pushdug Jackson-glob bubhosh skai</i>.") The books themselves are considerably more thoughtful -- admittedly this wouldn't be hard -- but problematic, as I've suggested, for other reasons. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, good. The habit of consigning nature to the past, to be viewed through a nostalgic haze, is one of the prime delusions of our age. <br><br>Rain, <a href=../../2015/03/planet-of-space-bats.html rel=nofollow>the details are toward the bottom of this post</a>. <br><br>Zentao, whatever floats your boat!<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c3735987162115847839 title="comment permalink">8/14/15, 7:28 PM</a><br><br>

What would serve best ? LOTR , Narnia , Potter , Dune , Madmax , Enders Game , Earthsea or Foundation ?. It seems to me to be something of a bear pit to view these fables purely in collective , materialistic terms . I think they are mostly alchemical tales that encourage the reader , each and every one of us to clean up our own individual kingdoms , melt , the ring , reforge the sword, depose the dark lord or what have you . If everyone did this , some new and worthwhile movement would follow in its train in short order . <br>Some lefties would see this no doubt as too individual and narcissistic , but there it is . The Potter tales seem to inspire the most revulsion i believe because they perhaps focus too closely on one individual , rather than saving the entire planet , which is not what uncle Karl recommended .

I have no offspring out of choice, not because I wanted to save the planet, but out of personal desire for freedom of action, not wanting the economic/emotional responsibility of children, and not feeling any instinctual drive to “pass on my genes.” At age 70, I‘ve never felt any regret or sense of loss, but that’s not to say that for many folks having kids is a deeply felt necessary part of a “complete life” both on the individual psychological level and on the social level (in most societies not having kids, or even just having one, puts you on the fringe). <br><br>There’s obviously a built-in survival of the species instinct going on; making babies is about the easiest thing anybody can do, and having sex is inherently pleasurable. No intelligence or ability of any kind is required beyond having the basic functional physical apparatus. On the other hand, NOT making babies requires some degree of thought and self-control. So there’s a strong bias towards population increase. Except for religious communities like nun/monks and Shakers, I would hazard the guess that ALL societies who control their population numbers do so in response to environmental pressure, and usually these societies exist in places like islands or circumscribed geographical areas where the environmental limits are obvious.<br><br>In the real world of peak everything, IMHO, it is total no-brainer that world population will decline either with through voluntary action on the part of individuals, govt control as in China’s one child policy, or the more brutal/chaotic effects of starvation and climate change. Population decline WILL happen; how is an open question. <br><br>I personally applaud your suggestion that a discussion is a good idea, but I have absolutely no faith that world population decline will happen in an orderly/rational manner.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c4711652506972133322 title="comment permalink">8/14/15, 11:58 PM</a><br><br>

'Thud' which tackles the problem of religious fanaticism, and 'Snuff' with its themes of slavery, and how we treat 'the other' in society, whoever they are, well, both of them are genius and make me feel like I want to be a better person. Oh, and the Tiffany Aching series - every time I don't want to walk the second mile, but do anyway, it's partly because of my religious upbringing and commitment to doing the right thing, and partly because that's what proper witches do:) Also, the concept that what makes witches properly witchy is that they really SEE what is going on rather than just following the herd. Prompts a certain amount of thoughtfulness in my daily life. (Bear in mind what I know about proper witches would fit among the tea leaves in the bottom of a teacup) I think Pratchett's genius is to take a really useful concept for living a good life, and wrap it up in such dry, hilarious prose that it sticks in your head to pop out at the very moment it is needed. <br><br>And to tie this comment back into this post - uncomfortable change is a real part of the plot lines of Pratchett novels. They often end with the characters having been faced with various inconvenient truths, and by the end of the series the Discworld society is significantly different to what it was in the beginning..<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c5014360928959723021 title="comment permalink">8/15/15, 4:22 AM</a><br><br>

And no Establishment opinion poll can predict it, there's just a general loss of faith in the ideals which hold that society together. The indoctrination loses hold as the institutions which produce the indoctrination lose all credibility and moral force. The Vietnam War was lost because the US Army ceased to fight the Viet Cong and NVA, and started fighting its own officers; schools churn out an entire generation with unmarketable degrees and lifelong crushing debt; political campaigns and parties are no longer treated with interest, but derision - hence the Republican Clown Car Crew and the spectacle of Obama and Clinton and Bush, and the Corporate Shill Congress, utterly disconnected from the people who pay for it all.

Of course, at that time none of the scandals which have destroyed the credibility of the Church, leading to a closer examination of early Church history on my part, had seen the light of day.

On the positive side, besides the breathtaking literary imagery, it fostered in me an appreciation that magic arises from nature and nonhuman agencies, (not a wizard bending the Laws of Physics to his personal whim), that magic awaits under every rock and around any corner. It also emphasized that everyone has something to contribute to a team, unlike the more individualistic techno-fantasy stories so common in American culture now. (Contrast the first few books of the series with the execrable movie version of the first book, to see how Hollywood worships the "Chosen-One-Charismatic-Leader" prophesy. On second thought, if you didn't already know that a movie version existed, please forget I said anything. Don't touch that abomination of a movie with a 10-foot pole.) <br>So it was a bit difficult to read your criticism of Cooper, but I have to admit that I have noticed "The War on Change" in most of the popular fiction across all genres lately. Even my beloved Star Trek - the most common episode plot falls into that category. And Trek is one of the better examples. After the series gained momentum, at least they made a regular effort to understand why the dangerous stranger (alien) wants change, and to think if there might be any safe compromise. Most of the other popular sci-fi has not been nearly as visionary nor predictive. Many people have discussed why dystopias have been more popular than utopias recently, but I think you have hit on part of the answer. For 30 years or so, sci-fi has been terrified of proposing radical changes in society and depicting them in a positive light (except for the bland assumption that technology will continue to solve more and more problems of a strictly materialistic type.) Much of the modern fantasy and sci-fi I read lately has fallen into the mold of "If we allow this change in society, and push it ad absurdio, a dystopia will result, and nobody wants a dystopia." (I'm certainly guilty of writing dystopian fiction myself.) Ray Bradbury once said, "I don't write to predict the future. I write to avert it."<br>As for Tolkien, like most works of classical art (of sufficient complexity and subtlety), IMHO his books have become a Rohrschach blot upon which people loudly <a href=http://www.salon.com/2004/02/28/lord/ rel=nofollow>project their own biases and desires</a>, telling us less about the artist's intentions and more about themselves.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c3361699593057451148 title="comment permalink">8/15/15, 2:46 PM</a><br><br>

(smile)<br><br>We used/use a 330 litre ‘compost bin’ supplied by local council at low cost and sited it in the shelter of an orchard on some recycled galvanised wire mesh to keep out the rodents. It is not ideal and really needs some insulation over the winter and some young rats broke in twice and once I put in a small dead rabbit – the toxic H2S nearly extinguished the worm colony. Still it does for all our kitchen waste as we eat mostly veggies and use very little meat. We put in straw that helps keep the compost not too soggy for the worms. They survived anyway.<br><br>We cheered ourselves this last week by eating only (almost) food we have grown ourselves. A small fraction of what we would need in the way of calories for a year of course – we buy grains and legumes – but it inspired us to greater things! Potatoes with beans (Vicia faba still in green pods) and lots of leaf veggies and our own fruit made it kind of special. Herbs helped.<br> <br>Fell-running like wrestling was a competitive sport for young shepherds back in the day. They could run across the high rough-grazing grounds. Nowadays it is mostly lean hard-looking 35+ year-olds – not so many shepherds - some of whom also do Mountain Rescue in their spare time. At anything over 3000 feet from here north or west you are pretty much in arctic tundra, (think rescue over difficult ground), and at lower levels it is rough heather and mires mixed with a little grazing. (There are people who are trying to bring back the native trees, which would make better sense on much of the terrain than such sparse grazing habitat.)<br><br>best<br>Phil H<br><br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c2207470720259091321 title="comment permalink">8/16/15, 8:58 AM</a><br><br>

Tolkein always said he was a Hobbit at heart, and he also said in one case that Sauron was a literary device but Saruman was the embodiment of real evil of the sort we see around us. But Saruman represents the industrialist, the progressive, the agent of industrial change, while the hobbits are rural-dwelling folk who prefer a simple life.<br><br>So you have in Tolkein the same sort of thing as in Sanders, a move to reset towards the past, using the past to critique the present. I think that's legitimate (not that I think Sanders is looking back to the right time though).<br><br>I think one thing that is happening is that we cannot know the past for sure, nor can we know the future. So sci-fi, history, etc. become ways of arguing about the present. One aspect of that narrative becomes the question of change. Is it good or bad? How to ensure change is good? These aren't easy questions.<br><br>Someone once defined history as "argument from the past."

Years ago I outlined a novel, working title <i>The Red King</i>, which also told Tolkien's story from the other side -- or rather not quite Tolkien's story, since I didn't want to fall afoul of the Tolkien estate, and I also wanted to mess with the plot to make certain points. The titular character, who was of course the Sauron-equivalent, was trying to break the grip of an immortal but basically senile elvish elite, and hit on the strategy of tricking them into destroying the One Ring (or close equivalent) so that the Three Rings (or close equivalents), the basis of their own power, would be destroyed as well. (In the outline, there were seven crowns, one of which was the crown of the Red King -- you can fill in the blanks from there.) It was quite the raucous little romp, in its own way, and I may just go ahead and write it one of these days, if my current fiction project doesn't saturate the market for fantasies that tell the story from the other side!<br><br>Denys, I really do have to make room for a post on Peak California one of these days, don't I? <br><br>Kutamun, good. It really does always have to start with the individual. <br><br>Janet, you're welcome.

The frantic attempt to find some golden age in the past when people didn't behave like people, but like ideologically correct puppets, is a perennial bad habit in our times, but these discoveries weren't news to anyone who's been following the last three or four decades of research. (Please note that the Gimbutas-Eisler theory of peaceful ancient matriarchies was never accepted by archeologists at all -- there were just too many signs of warfare, violence, social hierarchy, etc. in the places and times they'd claimed for their golden age.) To my mind, getting past the notion that people can be expected to act like angels if only they live under the right conditions is essential if we're to make any constructive change at all -- because real change has to take human nature into account, with all the grubby aspects of human nature kept firmly in mind. <br><br>Rapier, and yet some of the most adventurous, risk-taking, intellectually and socially innovative societies in human history have had exactly the sort of structure you've assigned to the conservative side of the line. It really isn't that simple! <br><br>Jeanne, exactly! I always felt for the poor monsters. "The Death of Rodan" would make a great theme for classical music -- perhaps an oratorio. Got your story, btw, so you're in the contest.<br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c6706894921379331703 title="comment permalink">8/17/15, 8:21 PM</a><br><br>

Ever since several effective and relatively safe forms of contraception have become available, the opposite seems to be the case. Most people have fewer children than their grandparents did, if they are allowed to.<br><br>When women acquire access to education and the ability to exercise control over whether they get pregnant, family size usually goes down. This is in large part an economic calculation. If a woman has education or marketable skills, her labor becomes more valuable to the family than her services as a breeder; it's not in the family's interest to keep her constantly encumbered with child-rearing. Mothers when given the choice usually prefer to concentrate family resources on one or two children to improve those children's life chances, rather than spreading limited resources among many. Or if it's a society with a religion that includes celibate monasticism, younger children get sent off to be monks or nuns.<br><br>In some circumstances there is an economic incentive to have a lot of children. Several of these incentives were present in China. Peasant farmers rely on human labor, and children can do useful tasks from an early age. Where there is no money economy or pension system, grown children are social insurance for elderly people. Chinese mores value boys more than girls, so women were and are pressured to keep having children until they produce a son. Normally it takes three generations of economic development to go from (for example) eight to twelve live births per family to zero to three; the government was in a hurry.<br><br>There are other social or governmental incentives to have large families: if the parents get an additional allowance for each additional child, or if the ruling elites get their power and wealth from warfare, and need disposable young men. <br><br>Absent these incentives, children are a lot of trouble and expense, and most people don't want to raise very many of them. The United States birthrate is at about replacement level among the native born, and every other advanced industrialized country has a negative births to deaths ratio. It's my understanding that the Japanese government is trying to persuade its people to have more children, not fewer. <br><br><br><br><a href=the-war-against-change.html#c7799363399145800716 title="comment permalink">8/18/15, 3:45 AM</a><br><br>

They all know that change is irresistible. They simply want to drive events toward "their" change. Preserving things that are good and made of beauty. <br><br>In your subsequent post you wrote : "Myself, I consider violence enitrely appropriate in some situations." ... "Along the same lines, a case can be made that revolutionary violence against a political and economic system is morally justified if the harm being done by that system is extreme enough."<br><br>Strangely enough, you consider fighting against a evil enemy for the sake of liberty of free people of middle earth (and preservation of lands, trees, waters) a "war against change". :D<br><br>On the other hand you consider opposing using violence against the harm done by corrupted political and economic systems a right thing...But cannot this "harm" be also considered "change"?<br><br>Could it be then, that there is a range of "changes" which is entirely justified to fight against? :D :D<br><br><br>The problem in this post, for me, is that you are trying to bend towards a single concept something that is much bigger and complex. <br><br>With Lord of the rings, IMHO, you missed entirely the point.The king returns, but is clearly a Messianic figure. It is a restauration of good against evil, not of some king going back to the throne to grab the people taxes and move armies against other kings. The king, on the sidenote, is not acknowledged through his fighting power or military skills, but throug his healing powers. <br><br>Lord Of the rings is a story of loss and fight to preseerve the good of nature and family: is a story of common people doing the job of suffering and eradicate the bad plants from the infested fields. The entire quest is a quest to lose something, not to find something :D :D<br><br><br>And to be more precise, the real conservative party in Middle Earth are the Elves. Tolkien himself named them as "embalmers" through their use of magic to stop time flow in their enclaves like Rivendell and Lorien. They are the real, true fighters against "change". But, notwithstanding this, they are wise enough to know that they sooner or later will pass out from the world.
