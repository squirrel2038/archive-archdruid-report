There are certain advantages to writing out the ideas central to this blog in weekly bursts. Back in the days before the internet, when a galaxy of weekly magazines provided the same free mix of ideas and opinions that fills the blogosphere today, plenty of writers kept themselves occupied turning out articles and essays for the weeklies, and the benefits weren’t just financial: feedback from readers, on the one hand, and the contributions of other writers in related fields, on the other, really do make it easier to keep slogging ahead at the writer’s lonely trade. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This week’s essay has benefited from that latter effect, in a somewhat unexpected way. In recent weeks, here and there in the corners of the internet I frequent, there’s been another round of essays and forum comments insisting that it’s time for the middle-class intellectuals who frequent the environmental and climate change movements to take up violence against the industrial system. That may not seem to have much to do with the theme of the current sequence of posts—the vacuum that currently occupies the place in our collective imagination where meaningful visions of the future used to be found—but there’s a connection, and following it out will help explain one of the core themes I want to discuss. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The science fiction author Isaac Asimov used to say that violence is the last refuge of the incompetent. That’s a half-truth at best, for there are situations in which effective violence is the only tool that will do what needs to be done—we’ll get to that in a moment. It so happens, though, that a particular kind of incompetence does indeed tend to turn to violence when every other option has fallen flat, and goes down in a final outburst of pointless bloodshed. It’s unpleasantly likely at this point that the climate change movement, or some parts of it, may end up taking that route into history’s dumpster; here again, we’ll get to that a little further on in this post. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably necessary to say at the outset that the arguments I propose to make here have nothing to do with the ethics of violence, and everything to do with its pragmatics as a means of bringing about social change. Ethics in general are a complete quagmire in today’s society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nietzsche’s sly description of moral philosophy as the art of propping up inherited prejudices with bad logic has lost none of its force since he wrote it, and since his time we’ve also witnessed the rise of professional ethicists, whose jobs consist of coming up with plausible excuses for whatever their corporate masters want to do this week. The ethical issues surrounding violence are at least as confused as those around any of the other messy realities of human life, and in some ways, more so than most. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Myself, I consider violence enitrely appropriate in some situations. Many of my readers may have heard, for example, of an event that took place a little while back in Kentucky, where a sex worker was attacked by a serial killer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While he was strangling her, she managed to get hold of his handgun, and proceeded to shoot him dead. To my mind, her action was morally justified. Once he attacked her, no matter what she did, somebody was going to die, and killing him not only turned the violence back on its originator, it also saved the lives of however many other women the guy might have killed before the police got to him—if they ever did; crimes against sex workers, and for that matter crimes against women, are tacitly ignored by a fairly large number of US police departments these days.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Along the same lines, a case can be made that revolutionary violence against a political and economic system is morally justified if the harm being done by that system is extreme enough. That’s not a debate I’m interested in exploring here, though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Again, it’s not ethics but pragmatics that I want to discuss, because whether or not revolutionary violence is justified in some abstract moral sense is far less important right now than whether it’s an effective response to the situation we’re in. That’s not a question being asked, much less answered, by the people who are encouraging environmental and climate change activists to consider violence against the system. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Violence is not a panacea. It’s a tool, and like any other tool, it’s well suited to certain tasks and utterly useless for others. Political violence in particular is a surprisingly brittle and limited tool. Even when it has the support of a government’s resource base, it routinely flops or backfires, and a group that goes in for political violence without the resources and technical assistance of some government somewhere has to play its hand exceedingly well, or it’s going to fail. Furthermore, there are many cases in which violence isn’t useful as a means of social change, as other tools can do the job more effectively. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Pay attention to the history of successful revolutions and it’s not hard to figure out how to carry out political violence—and far more importantly, how not to do so. The most important point to learn from history is that successful violence in a political context doesn’t take place in a vacuum. It’s the final act of a long process, and the more thoroughly that process is carried out, the less violence is needed when crunch time comes. Let’s take a few paragraphs to walk through the process and see how it’s done. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first and most essential step in the transformation of any society is the delegitimization of the existing order. That doesn’t involve violence, and in fact violence at this first stage of the process is catastrophically counterproductive—a lesson, by the way, that the US military has never been able to learn, which is why its attempts to delegitimize its enemies (usually phrased in such language as “winning minds and hearts”) have always been so embarrassingly inept and ineffective. The struggle to delegitimize the existing order has to be fought on cultural, intellectual, and ideological battlefields, not physical ones, and its targets are not people or institutions but the aura of legitimacy and inevitability that surrounds any established political and economic order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who want to know how that’s done might want to read up on the cultural and intellectual life of France in the decades before the Revolution. It’s a useful example, not least because the people who wanted to bring down the French monarchy came from almost exactly the same social background as today’s green radicals: disaffected middle-class intellectuals with few resources other than raw wit and erudition. That turned out to be enough, as they subjected the monarchy—and even more critically, the institutions and values that supported it—to sustained and precise attack from constantly shifting positions, engaging in savage mockery one day and earnest pleas for reform the next, exploiting every weakness and scandal for maximum effect. By the time the crisis finally arrived in 1789, the monarchy had been so completely defeated on the battlefield of public opinion that next to nobody rallied to its defense until after the Revolution was a fait accompli. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The delegitimization of the existing order is only the first step in the process. The second step is political, and consists of building a network of alliances with existing and potential power centers and pressure groups that might be willing to support revolutionary change. Every political system, whatever its official institutional form might be, consists in practice of just such a network of power centers—that is, groups of people who have significant political, economic, or social influence—and pressure groups—that is, other groups of people who lack such influence but can give or withhold their support in ways that can sometimes extract favors from the power centers.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In today’s America, for example, the main power centers are found in what we may as well call the bureaucratic-industrial complex, the system of revolving-door relationships that connect big corporations, especially the major investment banks, with the major Federal bureaucracies, especially the Treasury and the Pentagon. There are other power centers as well—for example, the petroleum complex, which has its own ties to the Pentagon—which cooperate and compete by turns with the New York-DC axis of influence—and then there are pressure groups of many kinds, some more influential, some less, some reduced to the status of captive constituencies whose only role in the political process is to rally the vote every four years and have their agenda ignored by their supposed friends in office in between elections. The network of power centers, pressure groups, and captive constituencies that support the existing order of things is the real heart of political power, and it’s what has to be supplanted in order to bring systemic change. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Effective revolutionaries know that in order to overthrow the existing order of society, they have to put together a comparable network that will back them against the existing order, and grow it to the point that it starts attracting key power centers away from the network of the existing order. That’s a challenge, but not an impossible one. In any troubled society, there are always plenty of potential power centers that have been excluded from the existing order and its feeding trough, and are thus interested in backing a change that will give them the power they want and don’t have. In France before the Revolution, for example, there were plenty of wealthy middle-class people who were shut out of the political system by the aristocracy and the royal court, and the <i>philosophes</i> went out of their way to appeal to them and get their support—an easy job, since the <i>philosophes</i> and the <i>nouveaux-riches</i>
shared similar backgrounds. That paid off handsomely once the crisis came. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In any society, troubled or not, there are also always pressure groups, plenty of them, that are interested in getting more access to the various goodies that power centers can dole out, and can be drawn into alliance with a rising protorevolutionary faction. The more completely the existing order of things has been delegitimized, the easier it is to build such alliances, and the alliances can in turn be used to feed the continuing process of delegitimization. Here again, as in the first stage of the process, violence is a hindrance rather than a help, and it’s best if the subject never even comes up for discussion; assembling the necessary network of alliances is much easier when nobody has yet had to face up to the tremendous risks involved in revolutionary violence. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By the time the endgame arrives, therefore, you’ve got an existing order that no longer commands the respect and loyalty of most of the population, and a substantial network of pressure groups and potential power centers supporting a revolutionary agenda. Once the situation reaches that stage, the question of how to arrange the transfer of power from the old regime to the new one is a matter of tactics, not strategy. Violence is only one of the available options, and again, it’s by no means always the most useful one. There are many ways to break the existing order’s last fingernail grip on the institutions of power, once that grip has been loosened by the steps already mentioned. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What happens, on the other hand, to groups that don’t do the necessary work first, and turn to violence anyway? Here again, history has plenty to say about that, and the short form is that they lose. Without the delegitimization of the existing order of society and the creation of networks of support among pressure groups and potential power centers, turning to political violence guarantees total failure. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For some reason, for most of the last century, the left has been unable or unwilling to learn that lesson. What’s happened instead, over and over again, is that a movement pursuing radical change starts out convinced that the existing order of society already lacks popular legitimacy, and so fails to make a case that appeals to anybody outside its own ranks. Having failed at the first step, it tries to pressure existing power centers and pressure groups into supporting its agenda, rather than building a competing network around its own agenda, and gets nowhere. Finally, having failed at both preliminary steps, it either crumples completely or engages in pointless outbursts of violence against the system, which are promptly and brutally crushed. Any of my readers who remember the dismal history of the New Left in the US during the 1960s and early 1970s already know this story, right down to the fine details. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With this in mind, let’s look at the ways in which the climate change movement has followed this same trajectory of abject failure over the last fifteen years or so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The task of the climate change movement at the dawn of the twenty-first century was difficult but by no means impossible. Their ostensible goal was to create a consensus in the world’s industrial nations that would support the abandonment of fossil fuels and a transition to the less energy-intensive ways of living that renewable resources can provide. That would have required a good many well-off people to accept a decline in their standards of living, but that’s far from the insuperable obstacle so many people seem to think it must be. When Winston Churchill told the British people “I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat,” his listeners roared their approval. For reasons that probably reach far into our evolutionary past, a call to shared sacrifice usually gets a rousing response, so long as the people who are being asked to sacrifice have reason to believe something worthwhile will come of it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That, however, was precisely what the climate change movement was unable to provide. It’s harsh but not, I think, unfair to describe the real agenda of the movement as the attempt to create a future in which the industrial world’s middle classes could keep on enjoying the benefits of their privileged lifestyle without wrecking the atmosphere in the process. Of course it’s not exactly easy to convince everyone else in the world to put aside all their own aspirations for the sake of the already privileged, and so the spokespeople of the climate change movement generally didn’t talk about what they hoped to achieve. Instead, they fell into the most enduring bad habit of the left, and ranted instead about how awful the future would be if the rest of the world didn’t fall into line behind them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On the off chance that any of my readers harbor revolutionary ambitions, may I offer a piece of helpful advice? If you want people to follow your lead, you have to tell them where you intend to take them. Talking exclusively about what’s going to happen if they don’t follow you will not cut it. Rehashing the same set of talking points about how everyone’s going to die if the whole world doesn’t rally around you emphatically will not cut it. The place where you’re leading them can be difficult and dangerous, the way there can be full of struggle, sacrifice and suffering, and they’ll still flock to your banner—in fact, young men will respond to that kind of future more enthusiastically than to any other, especially if you can lighten the journey with beer and the occasional barbecue—but you have to be willing to talk about your destination. You also have to remember that the phrase “shared sacrifice” includes the word “shared,” and not expect everyone else to give up something so that you don’t have to. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So the climate change movement entered the arena with one hand tied behind its back and the other hand hauling a heavy suitcase stuffed to the bursting point with middle class privilege. Its subsequent behavior did nothing to overcome that initial disadvantage. When the defenders of the existing order counterattacked, as of course they did, the climate change movement did nothing to retake the initiative and undermine its adversaries; preaching to the green choir took the place of any attempt to address the concerns of the wider public; over and over again, climate change activists allowed the other side to define the terms of the debate and then whined about the resulting defeat rather than learning anything from it. Of course the other side used every trick in the book, and then some; so? That’s how the game is played. Successful movements for change realize that, and plan accordingly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We don’t even have to get into the abysmal failure of the climate change movement to seek out allies among the many pressure groups and potential power centers that might have backed it, if it had been able to win the first and most essential struggle in the arena of public opinion. The point I want to make is that at this point in the curve of failure, violence really is the last refuge of the incompetent. What, after all, would be the result if some of the middle class intellectuals who make up the core of the climate change movement were to pick up some guns, assemble the raw materials for a few bombs, and try to use violence to make their point? They might well kill some people before the FBI guns them down or hauls them off to life-plus terms in Leavenworth; they would very likely finish off climate change activism altogether, by making most Americans fear and distrust anyone who talks about it—but would their actions do the smallest thing to slow the dumping of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and the resulting climate chaos? Of course not. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What makes the failure of the climate change movement so telling is that during the same years that it peaked and crashed, another movement has successfully conducted a prerevolutionary campaign of the classic sort here in the US. While the green Left has been spinning its wheels and setting itself up for failure, the populist Right has carried out an extremely effective program of delegitimization aimed at the federal government and, even more critically, the institutions and values that support it. Over the last fifteen years or so, very largely as a result of that program, a great many Americans have gone from an ordinary, healthy distrust of politicians to a complete loss of faith in the entire American project. To a remarkable extent, the sort of rock-ribbed middle Americans who used to insist that of course the American political system is the best in the world are now convinced that the American political system is their enemy, and the enemy of everything they value. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second stage of the prerevolutionary process, the weaving of a network of alliances with pressure groups and potential power centers, is also well under way. Watch which groups are making common cause with one another on the rightward fringes of society these days and you can see a competent revolutionary strategy at work. This isn’t something I find reassuring—quite the contrary, in fact; aside from my own admittedly unfashionable feelings of patriotism, one consistent feature of revolutions is that the government that comes into power after the shouting and the shooting stop is always more repressive than the one that was in power beforehand. Still, the way things are going, it seems likely to me that the US will see the collapse of its current system of government, probably accompanied with violent revolution or civil war, within a decade or two. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, as far as I can see, the climate change movement is effectively dead in its tracks, and we no longer have time to make something happen before the rising spiral of climate catastrophe begins—as my readers may have noticed, that’s already well under way. From here on in, it’s probably a safe bet that anthropogenic climate change will accelerate until it fulfills the prophecy of <i>The Limits to Growth</i> and forces the global industrial economy to its knees. Any attempt to bring human society back into some kind of balance with ecological reality will have to get going during and after that tremendous crisis. That requires playing a long game, but then that’s going to be required anyway, to do the things that the climate change movement failed to do, and do them right this time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
With that in mind, I’m going to be taking this blog in a slightly different direction next week, and for at least a few weeks to come. I’ve talked in <a href=../../2015/01/the-one-way-forward.html>previous posts</a> about intentional technological regression as an option, not just for individuals but as a matter of public policy. I’ve also talked at quite some length about the role that narrative plays in helping to imagine alternative futures. With that in mind, I’ll be using the tools of fiction to suggest a future that zooms off at right angles to the expectations of both ends of the current political spectrum. Pack a suitcase, dear readers; your tickets will be waiting at the station. Next Wednesday evening, we’ll be climbing aboard a train for Retrotopia. </div>

As the post states quite clearly, the violence issue is raised only with respect to its possible pragmatic value as a tool/tactic in the process of political change.<br>Furthermore, it seems to me a careful reading of the post reveals that the major theme is NOT in fact even the pragmatic use of violence, but rather how successful revolution or regime change is actually brought about. JMG’s ideas of the steps involved are clearly stated. A minor theme is when, if at all, in the process violence might be an appropriate tactic.<br>May I respectfully remind you that JMG’s use of the failure of the climate change brigade and the success of the right as examples to illustrate his theme of the necessary conditions for political regime change is only a rhetorical tactic to further the main argument. History has its uses, but illustrating an argument with examples from current affairs can be more engaging.<br>In my experience leading men‘s groups and teenaged boys coming-of-age groups, “winning hearts and minds” with a clear and honest statement of where the group is going to end up after the journey, how all the members might benefit in the end, and the possible sacrifices all might be asked to make along the way is a necessary first step to forming group cohesion and energy.<br><br><br><a href=#c2357275297733006668 title="comment permalink">8/19/15, 5:32 PM</a><br><br>

Obviously there are many powerful parties interested in either facilitating or sabotaging that possibility, and how things play out in the history books is hard to guess. If it works there would be the seed of a new structure of alliances potent enough to enact some very major changes on the status quo. The two groups originate in what to my mind are two of the most powerful sources for disruption, the second amendment libertarians and the African American; the two groups have been played against each other much in history, and in the popular narrative of our culture are enemies by definition. Who could be more racist, the main stream narrative goes, than those rural white, gun toting, confederate flag waving, federal government hating libertarians?

In that aspect, it is fundamentally different than the revolutionary process current undergoing in the US: the American revolutionary process you describe is a catabolic process, a step down the ladder - things need to get simpler in order to make the American society work again. In Brazil, the system must be changed in order to allow the country to go one step up the ladder, to develop, get more complex.

Donald Trump has gained a lot of momentum from callously disregarding and mocking "political correctness" and therefore tapping into the repressed frustration of many people over what they perceive to be a handful of college professors and politicians' attempt to suppress their free speech. Of course, the distrust in "liberal academia" risks falling into total collapse within ten years if enough young people graduate 120,000 dollars in debt for a Liberal Arts degree that not even a fast food or janitor job will result from. The growing perception that universities are "liberal indoctrination mills" that charge exorbitant rates for worthless degrees and insurmountable debt will likely contribute to a rebellion against the people who have functioned as the very symbol of "liberal elitism": upper middle class (often) white professors who make six figures and work 5 hours a week (however untrue this stereotype may be for the majority of professors) who somehow claim to be against the very thing they are. As more ordinary americans fall further into poverty, resentment for that class of people and lack of illusions about just how little legitimate research lies behind the aura of academic privilege they embody will likely add fuel to the fires of populist Right Wingism.<br><br><a href=#c5925766628939303130 title="comment permalink">8/19/15, 6:04 PM</a><br><br>

He noted that any successful insurgent movement goes through three phases.<br><br>Phase One is the organizational stage. The emphasis is on creating a political movement, recruiting activists and sympathizers, building alliances with other disaffected groups, propaganda, fundraising, arranging for safe houses and so on. The revolutionaries generally avoid violence at this stage, since it would be premature and counterproductive. There's no point in provoking a crackdown, tipping off the authorities as to what's coming and alienating the public before the revolutionaries are ready to begin their armed struggle. The preparations for armed struggle are made very carefully and quietly. Ideally, the authorities have no idea what's in store for them until full blown guerrilla warfare breaks out and government buildings, security forces and so on start coming under attack left and right in a wave of coordinated attacks staged for maximum propaganda and intimidation value. <br><br>Phase Two is the classical guerrilla warfare stage, where the insurgents are militarily weaker than the establishment and use tactics that maximize their strengths while minimizing their weaknesses. This means raids, ambushes, hit and run attacks, sabotage, assassinations and other guerilla tactics.<br><br>Phase Three is only attained by the most successful insurgent groups. This is when the establishment is clearly losing the war and the insurgents have gained military superiority. The emphasis at this point is transitioning towards conventional military tactics. The guerrillas are reorganized as light infantry, with artillery, air support and tanks if available (think Cuba in the late 1950’s as the Batista regime started to crumble, the PLA in the late 1940’s as the Chinese civil war was entering its endgame or the Haganah during the Israeli war of independence in the late 1940’s). The goal is to finish off the establishment once and for all by crushing them militarily and seizing control of the government and the country.<br><br>It’s very common for insurgent groups to transition back and forth between phases as the fortunes of war shift. An insurgent army may initiate Phase Three prematurely and be forced back into Phase Two, usually with heavy losses, like the Viet Cong after the Tet Offensive. In some cases, the insurgents may find the war is going really badly and transition back to being an underground political movement (Phase Two back to Phase One), eventually taking up arms again when conditions shift back in their favor. This sort of thing requires careful planning and organization, a keen appreciation of the socio-political situation and human nature, and a great deal of flexibility and adaptability.<br><br><a href=#c3144083640342783564 title="comment permalink">8/19/15, 7:04 PM</a><br><br>

Those mistaked guaranteed that it would fail, and splinter into single-issue movements. <br><br>Ray, I saw that. If the populist right can forge a working alliance with the African-American community, crunch time could be very close indeed -- thus it's a safe bet that every conceivable dirty trick will be played in an attempt to prevent that. It'll be interesting, in the sense of the apocryphal saying, to see how that works out. <br><br>Will, ah, but if you want to avoid having to do anything useful, fantasizing about violence is a great excuse. <br><br>Ben, the Tsarist censors were really slow on the uptake. They let <i>Das Kapital</i> through, too, because they didn't understand it. <br><br>Richard, thank you, but if I was Obama's chief of staff, there'd be no way I could say any of these things.<br><br>Alan, got it -- you're in the contest. <br><br>Bruno, true enough! Do you have any reason to think that the Brazilian situation is being funded by foreign powers, by the way, or is the approaching revolution entirely homegrown? <br><br>James, that's a huge issue. The academic industry -- it really does deserve that name these days -- has set itself up for a really ugly fall, what with the absurdly high costs, the proliferation of useless degrees, and the transformation of academe into a dishonest sales staff for predatory loans. Yes, that will likely feed into the implosion of what I tend to call the liberalism of privilege, and in a big way. <br><br>Shawn, oh, no doubt there'll be any amount of false-flag violence: the government will do things and blame them on the rebels, the rebels will do things and blame them on the government. That's business as usual. <br><br>Batalos, the problem with the left, as I see it, is a bad case of self-righteousness mixed with an even worse sense of entitlement. "Of course we'll get our way, because we're right!" is the mentality involved, and it's hard to name any other way of thinking less likely to yield productive results.<br><br><a href=#c8043965742846563131 title="comment permalink">8/19/15, 8:08 PM</a><br><br>

Do me the favor of reading back through the post, and you'll see that trying to work with existing power centers is exactly the strategy I identified as a common cause of failure in the left. No, you identify the potential power centers that are predisposed to sympathize with your cause, and the pressure groups whose interests will be advanced by your victory; that's who you bring into alliance, and then you attract others because you've already delegitimized the existing order and people are looking for something else.

I've argued before that the problem with the US in particular is that there's too little power at the center -- the entire political system is so gridlocked that even the most essential tasks can no longer be done, and the system can be looted with impunity.

A+.<br><br>The Left has maintained for a long time that violence is a bad strategy because the target (The Establishment) happens to be much better at violence than anybody else is. The Establishment is also not unobservant. (It hires people who specialize in being observant.) Any strong revolutionary movement, viciously violent or as peaceful as fields of clover, is not going to be left alone to pursue their strategy, however benign it tries to appear. <br><br>"The Left" -- socialists, communists, labor organizers, labor unions, civil rights workers, their lawyers, their leaders, etc. have been the recipients of several sustained attacks by The Establishment and its surrogates. One of the first was the Red Scare of 1919. It featured pretty crude violence authored by The Establishment: lynchings, assassinations, beatings--the works. The communists were busy on a couple of good projects in the 1930s--labor organizing and civil rights work. After WWII The Establishment weeded them out of responsible positions and/or blackballed, blackmailed, disgraced, compromised, etc. as many of them as possible. Homosexuals were targeted at the same time; they found homos about as unappealing as communists. <br><br>In 1957 the FBI began COINTELPRO which targeted civil rights groups; the KKK (not a civil rights group); anti-war groups; Students for a Democratic Society (SDS); socialists again -- the new crop; the Black Panthers; and so on. This lasted through 1971, when a lucky burglary of an FBI office by a Citizens Investigation revealed the program to disrupt the left. There was much publicity, official investigations, and a climb down by the FBI. <br><br>So, we know that the Establishment didn't stop trying to screw up the Loyal Opposition. Nixon's Dirty Tricks squad, CREEP, cabinet members, and all sorts of other people were involved. <br><br>Then there is the post 9/11 (maybe pre-9/11) domestic spying which the government has undertaken with the help of AT&amp;T et al. <br><br>So, my point is this: Please don't think you will be left unattended by agents of the United States Government. IF some group shows capability and success in delegitimizing The State, The Establishment, The Economic Regime, The Political System, etc., THEN they will be in the crosshairs of some federal agency or a surrogate.

When I read arguments for violence from certain radical environmentalists, for example, I find their logic problematic. If small numbers of people commit acts of violence against "the system" -- what will change in the culture, besides making their underlying cause seem even more fringe, and causing even more misery and bloodshed? Somehow certain activists like to think that only people (and specifically those as "enlightened" as them) have the power to bring down the system, when nature herself will ultimately bring it all down.<br><br>I don't consider myself absolutely a pacifist, though I am no fan of violence, and generally am in favor of non-violent responses to conflict whenever possible, at least in how I live my life. A few years ago I read some of the writings by Jensen and others who associate with Deep Green Resistance, who call for stopping the industrial machine by whatever means possible, even if that means violent action. From a strategic perspective it didn't seem to make much sense to me. When the enemy is the industrial machine, who is the target? Who is the perpetrator that is destroying ecosystems and stealing from the future? It is an entire culture; of course, with varying levels of complicity by people within that culture, but it's difficult to pin down which people or places or institutions to eliminate, because the culture is almost everywhere. Sure, you can kill a few CEOs, or burn down an SUV dealership, or whatever, but the culture will still remain, and there a feedback loops that may even perpetuate the evils of "the system" further in response to your violent action in ways one can't always predict. Systems thinking, understanding flows and feedback loops, not isolating into parts a complex ecosystem -- all are important in political strategy. <br><br>Over a decade ago, I participated more in political protests than I do now, including a few nonviolent civil disobediences, some of which I felt were disempowering. Though civil disobedience can sometimes be an effective strategy (the 60s civil rights movement is a good example). The one area of civil disobedience I wholeheartedly endorse is non-participation as much as possible in the consumer economy. That's a type of disobedience I do everyday; I don't have to go out to some special protest to symbolically express my desire for someone else to enact some change. Not buying achieves results, however small, right then and there, and is empowering in so many ways. Although I don't always agree with the opinions expressed by Adbusters, I have supported Buy Nothing Day (though it should be more than a day), and would be happy if it were to replace Earth Day, which I hate.<br><br><a href=#c4184710907211861499 title="comment permalink">8/19/15, 9:49 PM</a><br><br>

It was, and mostly remains, a hobby of the comfortable middle class, and there is little interest in causing any real revolutionary changes that would remove that comfort.<br><br>Even organizations that started out pretty radical, such as Greenpeace, had devolved into professional pressure groups by the time I got involved in the movement.

It's only a maxim because it appears to be true.<br><br>Which is another way of saying that I think the Left's post-war project is dead. Despite the warnings of Monbiot on the one hand and the vision of Paul Mason's Post-Capitalism on the other, the Left has neither the coherence nor the strategy to effect change - it's too fragmented and far too comfortable arguing with itself to have any effect in the real world. This has resulted in a political void that the Right will eventually fill.<br><br>So in my view the next revolution will come from the Right - although perhaps not quickly. Despite the rhetoric (and the astounding collection of guns) in America, I observe from a distance that Americans are not quick to spring to revolution. <br><br>Some sectors of your society are under the sort of provocation that can only come from an occupying army - see Ferguson for an example - yet there are no armed insurrections against the occupiers, no roadside bombs aimed at the occupying force .... which leads me to conclude that there is yet a shared vision for a better society in America. The leaders of those communities may be preaching outrage, but they seem quite some distance from preaching armed revolt, and I think the political discourse has not yet failed. For instance, gay marriage may be a divisive issue in some states, but the fact that it happened at all underlines the fact that your democracy can still effect social change.<br><br>So despite the warnings and portents - that JMG spots long before the rest of us mere mortals - I am optimistic about the next few years in America.

The yearly fees are less than the property taxes on my house in the burbs. I talk to folks about my plans. I say "Why do I need all this stuff? I don't want to take care of all this house and stuff." Usually, I get a lot of agreement. People nod their heads and see the sense of it. I mention this because I think this could be part of a vision of the future. An arrangement where we spend less time and money taking care of our stuff, and more time focusing on what is really the key to our happiness -- our relationships with other people.

Incidentally, Sun Tzu who was a pretty switched on dude in such matters recommends to take the whole (or I'm suspecting as much as possible).

I suspect that relearning the skills of democracy would be quite useful at this point in time as a useful defusing technique as people could re-engage with the political system instead of feeling alienated.

It started in the FRanco dictatorship. Then, a lot of progressive spanish people had some friendliness to the secessionist basque people, but when the spanish regime changed to "democracy", basque groups continued on the same. It went worse, because they believed that killing civilians would be a good pressure to spanish government to be a free country. So in the 80s, ETA group put bombs at some supermarkets killing a lot of civilian people (not policemen or military), so secessionist groups and parties were isolated by their own violence. They started also killing nationalist basques because they were too moderate...so moderate basque people fd up and became enemy of them. OK very clever, boys... They finished pleading for a political arrangement, and now Basque keeps being spanish soil...Secessionist terrorism has been more sucessful in avoiding basque independence than jingoism from the spanish right.<br>If you go to Northern Ireland, it's not the same song, but it rhymes a bit...<br>Red Brigades in Italy kidnapped former Prime minister Aldo Moro and killed him...Moro was a moderate politican that wanted alliances with communist left, so extreme left made dirty job to the right and extreme right, that did'nt want alliances with "moderate" leftist...<br><br>I'm not a pacifist, but I agree with you that brainless violence is not a panacea.<br><br>There is an old Italian film about stupid leftists using violence, "Allonsanfan" from 1973(Italian '70s had a violent outbreak of extremist terrorism, from right and left groups).

Thus, apart from all the preparatory work (which you mentioned splendidly!), there has to be a severe crisis for the actual revolution to happen.

There is no Ross Perot or Pat Buchanan in the presidential race, only a clown like Donald Trump.

There were more or less competent people ready to take over France after the fall of the aristocracy.

Your discussion of how the right-wing has properly cultivated the pre-revolutionary environment whereas the left-wing has completely failed at this largely because they've identified their causes with those in charge, such as President Obama, and thus cannot bring themselves to actively/consciously de-legitimize the federal government. There is a revolutionary zeitgeist that Sanders is tapping into in much the same way that Trump is tapping into it, a general sense that the status quo is leading us in fundamentally the wrong direction. However, what Sanders and the Dems lack and the GOP has (though Trump probably will not get access to this) is the practical foundation for a revolution, a solid group of people who will be in place to support the revolutionary program once it starts. The GOP has, I think, deliberately shot themselves in the foot by cultivating the least-popular Congress of all time, but that unpopularity itself feeds their goals of de-legitimizing centralized power in D.C.<br><br>Last week I told you about a colleague of mine who recently left our large multi-national conglomerate corporation, took a huge pay cut (maybe as much as half or more), and pursued a long-self-denied passion in the public high school he grew up in. You agreed with me that this is perhaps a way to "collapse now and avoid the rush!" and mentioned that if it caught on that it could tip the scales and accelerate the larger collapse by undermining the fragile processes currently keeping things together. Another less-drastic example of this is another colleague of mine who didn't leave but asked for a 20% cut to his salary in exchange for a 4-day work week. An even less-drastic example is myself, who ~3 years ago was working 55-60 hours per week (only getting paid for 40 hours of course because I'm salary/exempt), dropped to ~50 hours per week a year ago and in the last few months find I'm approaching the 40-42 hour per week range and coasting into a straight-up 40 hour workweek, combined with taking all of my vacation and other paid time off. All of these examples are the exact opposite of Jeb Bush's plan to establish 4% annual growth primarily through productivity gains by increasing the average hours per week people are working.<br><br>I'm wondering if such a bottom's-up revolution towards "retrotopia," starting with a piece-wise rejection of the American Dream(TM), might be a nonviolent method to start this party off. It is certainly preferable to the impractical top-down pipe dream of Progressives where a President Sanders, through the sheer power of his socialist rhetoric inspiring the masses combined with an intelligent set of policies drawn up by a small army of wonk-wizards, steers the country towards retrotopia from his helm in Washington and tweaking the marginal tax rates upward by 5%.<br><br>Good stuff.

This is partly because so much more of the old society always continues into the new one than the revolutionaries want or realise and partly for another reason. There is a situational logic in revolutions. Disparate groups unite to overthrow an existing regime but once they have succeeded in doing so the cause that brought them together is gone and they then fight one another to fill the power vacuum that they themselves have created. These internecine struggles, usually savage, among erstwhile allies perpetuate the breakdown of society far beyond the overthrow of the old regime and delay the establishment of a new order. The population at large feels under threat from the unending social chaos and in these circumstances a strong man who can bring the warring factions to heel and impose order comes forward and meets with widespread support, or at least acquiescence. Thus a revolution carried out in the name of civil liberties, or equality, or to bring a tyranny to an end will itself end by putting into power a Cromwell, a Napoleon or a Stalin. All revolutions are uncontrollable and all revolutions are betrayed. It is in their nature that these things should be so. This fact makes belief in violent revolution as a method of changing society not only irrational and delusional but profoundly immoral. <br><br>And yes anyone in a group who openly advocates violence is either an idiot or a provocateur.<br><br><a href=#c7156653865688165358 title="comment permalink">8/20/15, 11:26 AM</a><br><br>

Another factor in a successful revolution or regime change is a vision of what the future could look like if your ideas are implemented. I think that currently there is no clear vision of what a sustainable, fair, and equitable society looks like. If such a vision could be communicated in a manner that is clearly understood by the large majority of the population, then they could begin the process of moving in that direction, identifying the parts of the current paradigm that do not work as they should, and choosing ways of living, eating, getting energy, voting, etc. that do work toward the goal. This would make the violent portion of the revolution unnecessary as we would already be heading in the right direction. <br><br>There are many ideas of how a society could and should work, but they are not clearly outlined and understood. Some individual ideas are floated, but they can easily be discounted as being socialistic or otherwise not constitutional out of hand without serious discussion. A broader outline of the goal should be fleshed out.<br><br>Here is a place to start. I have a quote from Paul Hellyer (check him out) on my wall: "Earth can be a paradise planet, a model for this sector of the galaxy, clean air, clean water, clean oceans, abundant wildlife, free energy, health and education for every human being."<br><br><a href=#c5516126766364566803 title="comment permalink">8/20/15, 12:33 PM</a><br><br>

I would recommend the works of George Lakoff. He is a linguist who began studying metaphor in language. He came to believe that metaphors are more important that they are usually give credit for and that they structure our thinking rather than being merely decorative flourishes on our language. One example he gives is that since we are an upright species we tend to value high over low. So we speak of having a high position in a company, or higher ideals, or low motives, low-down sneaking cur as an insult, and so forth. Since our vision is concentrated to the front--movement forward is valued over movement backward, which is very pertinent to JMG's comments about progress as an unquestioned value. Now to the political point. Lakoff demonstrates his books that the Right has spent a great deal of time, money and other resources on think tanks such as the Cato Institute. Bypassing the regular universities, which they see as bastions of liberal thought, they have used these other institutions to hone their language. For instance, they will frame arguments with particular terminology which cripples opponents if adopted by them. It is very difficult to argue for something that sounds as terrible as a "partial birth abortion" for instance. Someone may be for estate taxes, which sound like they only affect rich people with estates, a word that calls up images of landed gentry. But a 'death tax' just sounds wrong--tax people for dying, that's not fair.<br><br><a href=#c8776012883416721984 title="comment permalink">8/20/15, 2:11 PM</a><br><br>

I'll add one more little speculation about how this will play out:<br><br>I think that just as some of the most popular folk myths to be told these days by young educated people are about the "backward, primitive, superstitious, pre-rational and pre-scietnfic" peoples of the past (a motif extended to the people of the present who lack college degrees) I argue that within 30 years, many of those very same people who will be alive to tell the tale of it will be trading that narrative in for its exact inverse. <br><br>Instead, the myth will be about a group of young people and their parents who were scammed into betting their entire life savings, plus 30 year-long debts large enough to buy a house or a sports car, on a piece of paper at a campus where, somehow, all the classes were taught by people other than the professor and if the professor ever did come, he or she mostly just wasted people's time by ranting about politics or using made up words and jargon with, ironically enough, no empirical verification or scientific basis. After 6 years of lingering on campus due to a few more requirements each semester that kept them from graduating, the student finally emerges 130,000 dollars in debt for a piece of paper that are somehow a dime a dozen these days (somehow, every waiter and bar tender all got masters degrees)<br><br>Debt collectors, however, relentlessly call the graduate, his family, his boss, and his relatives night and day and threaten to sue him or put him in prison if he doesn't hand over 1,700 dollars a month. Though the value of the college experience still feels somewhat fresh and valuable 5 months after graduation, 15 years after graduation it has become nothing but a bitter memory. 25 years later, when the institution where he graduated has long since been shut down due to dropping enrollments and tougher restrictions on student loans, the rationale behind why that money should still leave his monthly income become even more nonsensical and by the end, masses of graduates take to the streets to burn their degrees and their debt papers. <br><br>Myths of the "pseudo-intellectual who scammed me" will provide fodder for another social taboo. The very same "rationalist" character archetype who is the hero of the age of "progress" will likely morph into the "pseudo-intelectual" villain of future folk tales. I think some sort of dogmatic religion (the exact inverse of that figure) will take hold in that future, with Islam being my bet for the most likely contender (given how much mainstream Christianity in America has been watered down to appeal to consumerist, middle class people through the "prosperity gospel.")<br><br><a href=#c8962242539882222766 title="comment permalink">8/20/15, 2:51 PM</a><br><br>

I strongly suspect that their hubris may be their undoing - but that is their problem.<br><br>I recently had the opportunity to witness someone take on the system and they were thoroughly stomped by the system.<br><br>Incidentally, environmental activists used to regularly be arrested and go to prison. That was like a revolving door way back in the early 1980’s when the state government of Tasmania was trying to dam the Franklin River. It was almost farcical.

None of the things you describe occurred. Internecine struggle following military victory was kept in check while a national constitution was drafted; in the meantime, the state legislatures kept civil order and minimal functions of government going. Elected delegates from the several states ratified the federal Constitution in an orderly way. The first President was chosen essentially by acclamation, but he was no Cromwell, Napoleon or Stalin. He served two terms in office and retired to his plantation voluntarily. Over the next thirty-two years, nonviolent transfers of power between leaders of rival political parties occurred repeatedly. The United States operated under the Constitution of 1789 until the breakdown of order in 1860, and President Lincoln ran for a second term (in an election he expected to lose) during the Civil War.<br><br>As to why the course of the American Revolution was different from many others, perhaps that was because it was moderate, indeed rather conservative, in its aims. It was not preceded by widespread disasters, and it did not seek a wholesale restructuring of society.<br><br><a href=#c6917278261819161473 title="comment permalink">8/20/15, 5:36 PM</a><br><br>

I'll keep an eye out for similar phenomena -- that's the kind of thing that happens when a culture's officially acceptable narratives start really falling to bits. <br><br>MayHawk, see you at the station!<br><br>OldProle, every movement for social change faces that sort of challenge. The American left is unique, or nearly so, in its insistence that it somehow ought to be exempt from the opposition faced by every other movement for social change. <br><br>Beneaththesurface, hmm! That makes sense. The notion of human omnipotence, and the sense of entitlement that goes with it, is pervasive everywhere else in today's industrial societies, after all. <br><br>Nastarana, nothing so organized as a conspiracy. There were simply a lot of middle-class intellectuals who wanted to see the French monarch replaced by something less obsessively class-ridden and autocratic, and who had the great good sense to go to work to make that happen, starting with the end of things they could influence most directly: public opinion. Their exclusion from political and economic power actually turned out to be a huge strength, since they weren't tempted to push the river: they just kept on jabbing away on the ideological plane until the French monarchy had become an object of ridicule and contempt even in the eyes of the people who benefited from it. The Revolution followed promptly. <br><br>Gloucon, that's a subject for an entire post, which will follow in due time. The very short form is that exactly the same points can be made: the peak oil movement failed to take its case effectively to the public, then wasted its time trying to pressure existing power centers rather than building alliances with potential allies, and basically fell over and died when the price of oil came back down. It didn't flop as completely as climate change activism, which is why there are still quite a few people reading this blog -- but it didn't achieve anything like what it could have, if it had gotten outside the protest-mentality box. <br><br>HalFiore, the obvious targets to start with would be the petroleum industry and its paid whores in the media. Imagine posters popping up in cities across the country, and in media: different pictures of landscapes ravaged by extreme weather, over the slogan BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY. Imagine individual spokespeople for climate change denialism targeted by name and called out as liars in the same anonymous, unanswerable way. Meanwhile essays show up in any periodical that will take them, talking about all the jobs that would be created if only the federal subsidies for the petroleum industry were to be spent instead on a nationwide program of conservation and homescale alternative energy. <br><br>Then you go from there -- hammering on the culpability of fossil fuel industries and their spokesflacks for extreme weather disasters, and all the benefits that would accrue to ordinary people if the tax money being wasted on the fossil fuel industry were to go to something more productive, like putting a solar water heater on every roof in the country, and on and on in every imaginable key, from every imaginable angle. Every time the opposition comes up with talking points, you target them, hard, and don't worry about playing fair -- they're not, you know. <br><br>There's more, much more, that can be done along the same lines. All you need is a handful of people who can write well, a little money, and a willingness to think outside the protest-mentality box and seize the initiative from the other side, and away you go. <br><br>FiftyNiner, probably because Jade Helm was simply a domestic-insurgency exercise, not the declaration of war on the American people that it's been spun as by the populist Right...<br><br>Prez, I think television certainly has something to do with it. There are plenty of factors, but that's one. I trust you don't own or watch one!<br><br><a href=#c727620027227284633 title="comment permalink">8/20/15, 5:48 PM</a><br><br>

At the risk of being deleted for not being a true believer, I would like to relate my experience with Greenpeace and how I came to stop supporting them.<br><br>Usually, they sent me requests for money by mail, and for many years I would donate a small amount to them because I believed in what they were doing: confronting polluters directly at the source of the problem. I really admired that. No other organization would do that.<br><br>It was after Greenpeace suddenly jumped on the global warming bandwagon that I began to wonder what exactly they were doing now. One day, I received an email from them talking about the evils of burning coal and other fossil fuels. I decided to respond after some thought.<br><br>First, I should mention that I grew up in Eastern Kentucky, that I worked in the coal mines, that I saw with my own eyes miles and miles of destroyed mountain tops and whole mountains blown up at strip mines and pushed over into ravines, burying alive everything that lived there. Once, a red fox escaped, and a co-worker tried to shoot it, but I stopped him. My crew knew how I felt about the environment, and that I was ready for any kind of fight they wanted to dish out, so he relented.<br><br>The fox got away, but little else did.<br><br>So, one day Greenpeace sent me an email some 30 years later, as mentioned above. I decided to respond to it and ask them a direct question. First, I reminded them that the email had reached me via coal burning plants in Ashland, Ky, and then over huge power lines running from there all the way to Lexington, Ky, where I now live. (Their letters reached me via oil and gas). I told them that I assumed they were aware of this and approved of it before sending it to me.<br><br>My question was quite simple. Had they informed their members here in Kentucky that after ceasing to burn coal, oil, and gas, that they would have to live without electricity, and that this was the proper way to live? I told them that it was, but had they informed everyone of this and were they willing to do the same in DC?<br><br>Their response was Freudian. It side-stepped my question, or rather ignored it completely, and pretended that I had agreed with them on every matter and that they appreciated my support of their cause and then asked me for more money. In truth, I expected not to hear back from them, but this startled me. Were they living in reality still, or not?<br><br>I decided to try once more, asking them to answer my question and give me the details of their vision of our future once the evils of burning coal, gas, and oil had finally ceased. Of course, they had no vision of such a future, since they would have to give up their computers, their phone gadgets, their rubber diving suits and speedboats, and the oil, gas, and coal necessary to power all of it.<br><br>I never heard back from them, but the letters asking for money still come even though I quit long ago and asked them to stop cutting down trees and burning oil to deliver these useless letters to my home. They ignored me, and continue to do so.<br><br>The last environmental organization worth the name had decided to jump off a cliff into a world of magic and make believe. I fully believe that all of America will follow suit rather than face the real alternative: that there are no dilytheum crystals waiting out there to be found and our lives must change if we want to leave a living environment to our children and grandchildren. The so-called baby boomers and the generations before them have no such plans, and the younger generations are so consumed by gadgets that only a catastrophic crisis of Nature will get them to look up and see the world around them.<br><br>By then, it may be too late, but I hope not. As a Deaf person, I can see the world around me very clearly, as the gadgets do nothing for me at all, but I cannot force others to stop using them or pay attention to what is around them. The Romans called it "bread and circuses", I believe, and it works. It works really well.<br><br><a href=#c2763155547409453333 title="comment permalink">8/20/15, 5:57 PM</a><br><br>

It's only recently that the left seems to have lost its ability to recognize that the other side doesn't have to play fair. As for the spinning out of climate-change disasters to 2100 -- no argument there. Right now, towns in the western US are being burnt to the ground because all the firefighters are busy elsewhere, collapsing glaciers in Greenland are causing tremors that are showing up on seismographs thousands of miles away, and Las Vegas may have to be abandoned to the desert in the next decade because there's no more water. <i>The catastrophes are here</i>. Deal with it. <br><br>Flute, exactly. Yes, and we have the same sort of stupidity in the animal-rights scene in the US, too. <br><br>Lou, so? What are you doing to change your own life? <br><br>Uncommon, way off topic, too large to tackle in less than a series of posts, and I prefer to focus on events here in the US where I have some chance of knowing what I'm talking about, so I'll pass. <br><br>Raven, who are you addressing? <br><br>Denys, it's important not to make the mistake of thinking that "the Right" is a monolithic bloc. It's not; the populist Right, the people I've identified as building a successful revolutionary movement, has very little in common with the establishment Right, the people who more or less run the government these days. The Oath Keepers are people who've quite literally taken a vow to defend the US constitution against the US government; where does that fit on your spectrum? <br><br>Mat, a clueless and hopelessly ineffective approach to a complex problem. The faster a system collapses, the easier it is to build it back up again -- and of course it's not irrelevant that neither you nor everyone in the world who thinks the way you do have anything like the resources needed to bring the system crashing down before you're (a) gunned down by SWAT teams or (b) torn to bloody gobbets by furious mobs who've suffered from the consequences of your actions. Next question, please!<br><br>Donalfagan, you have to change hearts and minds to change anything at all. That's one of the reasons Hillary Clinton's approach has racked up such an impressive string of failures over the years. <br><br>Rita, oh, no question, it's going to be a mess everywhere, and a lot of people in the nonindustrialized (and never-to-be-industrialized) world are going to long for an American lifestyle long after the last resources that might have supported that are gone forever. <br><br>RCW, by all means. By the way, is there such a thing as a nonfictional novel? <br><br>Gregorach, thank you. You get tonight's gold star for stating the unpalatable but true in uncompromising terms. <br><br>Cherokee, no argument there! Reviving the skills of democracy is among other things a way of undercutting the legitimacy of undemocratic governments.

Thank you for getting it. <br><br>Mark, have you considered trying to help make those conversations happen? Somebody's got to take the first step, you know. <br><br>One Gun, oh, granted. It's that sense of entitlement again. <br><br>Peakfuture, I'd like to hear more useful slogans as well. That's the best one I recall -- well, that and "People who say you're either part of the problem or part of the solution are part of the problem." <br><br>Spanish Fly, if I had my way, the button wouldn't be pushed. Unfortunately there are a lot of people in this country who don't seem to share that feeling. <br><br>Hapibeli, thank you. I've known a lot of people who've dealt with violence up close and personal, as you have; I consider myself fortunate to have missed out on the experience!<br><br>Trippticket, no, that's not what I was saying. What I was saying is that because climate change activism flopped so dismally, our best chance to prevent the oncoming wave of climate catastrophes has gone whistling down the hot and dusty wind. Much could have been done -- but unfortunately very little was done, and so we have to deal with the consequences. <br><br>Tidlösa, one of the reasons I've wondered more than once if an outside power is funding the antigovernment propaganda et al. in the US these days is precisely that there's so little sense of an alternative being proposed. The most likely result, if that goes on, is disintegration into failed-state status. As for typewriters et al., stay tuned!<br><br>Ed-M, revolutionaries of the left have always been underfunded. That hasn't stopped them elsewhere. <br><br>Karim, funny! No, it'll be a plain diesel-electric train (burning biodiesel, btw), and it'll go all the way to its destination. That said, keep an eye out the window as we ride!<br><br>Wagelaborer, as I pointed out to Denys above, don't mistake the populist Right for the establishment Right. As for money, again, every left wing opposition movement in history has had to scramble for cash, and quite a few of them succeeded anyway. Looking for excuses for failure is not a useful habit -- learning from mistakes and doing something different next time is. <br><br>Whomever, get out there into the websites of the populist Right. They've got a very clear notion of where they want to take the country: back to where it was before the 1960s.<br><br><a href=#c5681936574922004015 title="comment permalink">8/20/15, 7:00 PM</a><br><br>

It depends on whether the people who are pushing toward revolution have any clue what to do with power once they have it.

Having collapsed ahead of the rush in one way, what's your next step? Always have a next step, and always be taking it, and you'll go far. <br><br>Aubrey, see you at the station! <br><br>Robert, you're massively overgeneralizing. Violent revolution, like the nonviolent kind, can achieve its ends so long as the ends are actually achievable: ousting a tyrant, abolishing a specific set of abuses, extending the vote and civil rights to a wider population, and so on. Any kind of revolution, violent or otherwise, that fixes its sights on Utopia is of course going to fail, but that's a matter of the impossibility of the goals, not of violence or its absence. <br><br>Stuart, good. Exactly; you have to have a vision of the future that actually appeals to the people -- not, please note, a vision that you think ought to appeal to them.

What about the American Revolution? It was violent, involved a foreign intervention on the side of the revolutionaries, and achieved its goal: independence from Britain and (eventually) more democracy. The Civil War was also a succesful revolution, since it abolished slavery in the South and ushered in Reconstruction. The counter-revolution (Jim Crow, etc) came later.<br><br>And what about all the national liberation movements that succeeded, both in Europe and the "Third World"? <br><br>Sometimes, a revolution works for the revolutionaries themselves, but not necessarily for the majority. The Russian revolution got off the rails in this way, but it worked toleraby well for the privileged bureaucracy! True, even the bureaucrats lived in fear of Stalin (the top dog bureaucrat who often killed his own kind), but after Stalin´s death, the system finally settled down for BAU, so there was no need for the Soviet elite to question the success of the revolution. That came later, when the system was stalling and became out-competed by Reagan´s USA. <br><br>The realistic/Utopian thing is important, I think. Even a violent revolution has to be realistic. That´s why the Jacobins failed: their "socialist" program and terror worked as a temporary crisis measure when France was besieged by foreign armies, but soon became unworkable, both because the economy wasn´t "ripe for socialization" (to borrow a Marxist phrase), and because the terror had deprived Robespierre of potential allies (since he killed fellow Jacobins and leftists, too). Thus, Robespierre (who was probably a Utopian at bottom) was doomed to isolation and failure, and more realistic leaders took over. Napoleon, anyone?<br><br>Perhaps I spoke too soon about the Right. I´ll check out the populist Right/establishment Right distinction. The idea that Blacks and White right-wingers may become allies sound crazy on the face of it, but I´ll check that out, too. (The Oath-Keepers were mentioned in Swedish media, complete with huge color photos of the same. About the day after JMG´s prediction that there may be an armed insurrection in the West and South on of these days. Ooops.) <br><br>Of course, last time around White Southerners and Blacks united (the Populist movement of the 1890´s), the alliance failed and the South got Jim Crow instead...<br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><a href=#c6219812363234311411 title="comment permalink">8/20/15, 9:13 PM</a><br><br>

If we were to acheive the first part of your prescription and have wide spread support for what actualy needs to be done to slow climate change then all that is needed is a large scale massive permanent debt boycott. Because our economy and finance system is built on a pyramid of credit based on the car loans, house loans, student loans and credit cards of the average person then it would all collapse which would be a giant step towards limiting climate change. The interesting thing about this approach is that it would force those participating to examine what slowing climate change really means as a debt boycot also means the collapse of pensions, investments, retirement savings, insurance and BAU so their can be no fooling oneself as to the outcome. Unfortunetly most people are not ready to give up those things to stabalize the climate so it is no more likely we will get enough support for a violent revolution then we would get for a debt boycott driven collapse.<br><br><a href=#c848378344920842063 title="comment permalink">8/20/15, 10:21 PM</a><br><br>

Stewart, published in 1949. It's at first a fairly typical post-apocalyptic novel. 99.9% of the earth's population abruptly dies in a plague, and a very small scattering of survivors remain, and the plague is gone.<br><br>A very small group forms up somewhere near San Francisco (Berkeley or Oakland, I suppose). They are in no way ideal candidates for a survival community. What Stewart does from this point on is trace the gradual descent from a 1949 technological culture to a primitive one--over the course of 60 years. There is first the catastrophic loss--the population and all its skills first, then in the first year, electricity (when hydro-electric fizzles out), and everything dependent on it; frozen food in the markets, lighting, motors, pumps, and so on. <br><br>Year by year, more and more is lost, more things given up, more adaptations made. The ecology changes; in the dry season, fires burn unabated. Deer and other grazers eat their initial efforts at gardening; predators eat their chickens. People get sick and survive, or not. A few children are born; a few people die. <br><br>The intervals in the story lengthen out; 20 years later, that sort of thing. Ish, (a nickname) protagonist and leader of the group, tries to steer the community in the direction of maintaining literacy, maintaining sanitation practices, and so on; the community isn't interested; they don't learn a lot, they give up on gardening for the most part, they revert to open defecation, and so on. He remains the small group's leader, but finds there are severe limits to what can be done, practically and politically. <br><br>He devises a gift to give the people which he hopes will help them survive. In time, Ish grows very old, and dies. The community <b>has survived</b>, even flourishes, but is much different than Ish thought and hoped it would be. <br><br>What is great about the book is that Stewart stays focused on the story of how he sees technology fading rapidly away, and how people might develop sensible if unexpected solutions (or not) to their predicament of technology loss. Events are not all good, by any means. The story does not end in a paradisiacal victory, but the ending is still satisfying and tilted toward upbeat.<br><br><a href=#c30177948502296827 title="comment permalink">8/20/15, 11:24 PM</a><br><br>

For example, if you click on a Culture, in the various subsections (Books, Music, etc) often the type of articles there are interviews/stories with authors or musicians which explain their motivations, describe how they fit into the various artistic 'isms', and so forth. These articles have the character of being positive - if you for example are the kind of person who wants to do creative work, then the effect of reading all this gives one (or at least me) the sense that they can contribute to this type of activity.<br><br>However, if you read the section of the website titled Environment, you will usually find, with a few exceptions, articles of the character of bad news - the rain forest being cut down, less restrictions against fracking, etc. Which is not to say that it's not important to read about this, it is to the credit of the Guardian that they at least report on these types of problems. But you don't often have stories about local initiatives which have worked, on HOW they worked, on the people behind them, and so on. So the flavour of the Environment section creates a sense of hopelessness in contrast to the Culture section of the website.<br><br>Sure, the Guardian is a newspaper and not a campaign group, but I guess I point this out as a small example of one way of how the climate change/environmental movements have failed: reading any of them gives a person inclined to care about these issues a sense of anger and concern but no sense of being able to contribute to solving them in a way that's not trivial (ie, changing to energy saving lightbulbs). <br><br>As much as Buckminster Fuller had progress-based motivations, he did make the myth of progress concrete for people to give them something to rally behind. In the same way, maybe it would be helpful to have, hmm, a Mythology of the Unnecessarily Discarded, to look have a look again at what humanity has thrown away to see what could be brought back to use and will help people deal with what looks to be coming.<br><br><a href=#c5835197751264283048 title="comment permalink">8/20/15, 11:42 PM</a><br><br>

Gah! However, luckily for me, I am not convinced that joining the political game is the answer. There are so many grass-roots groups doing practical things as they work towards a better world. We can all join one of these, or start one, and eventually, a coalition of these small groups may just coalesce into a sensible political party or movement, or maybe they will just continue quietly to change their own little corners, and influence very, very local politics. Also luckily for me, as I know you will ask this next, YES, I am involved in one such group. We have started small, sharing and learning homesteading technologies, but are growing by the month, and starting to think of ways to spread the joy further in our community. I think this bottom-up approach to changing the world is so much more satisfying than a top-down approach, also things get done on no budget and action comes from the community rather than being imposed upon it, all of which would be my platform anyway, if I were to start a political party :)<br><br><a href=#c3635590175732064418 title="comment permalink">8/21/15, 4:07 AM</a><br><br>

When the Bolsheviks were convincing the farmers and factory workers to rebel it would be somewhat easy for them to envision themselves being able to produce goods and services without the current order, similarly before the french revolution it seems likely that the middle class could easily envisage there businesses being able to continue without the king. But what about the data entry clerk today? If people were to overthrow the current regime today, which in my view is really the corporations, is it obvious to them how they will then be able to supply for themselves? Would the workers in a factory be able to take it over and produce marketable goods when the various components required to produce a salable product are scattered all across the planet, what are the prospects of the various office fauna without the corporations to furnish them with paychecks? As you have stated, if the current imperial wealth pump were to be shut off, the economy of the US would collapse. This seems to be part of the reason why Syriza flopped so spectacularly in Greece. Sure it's true that the EU is looting the country, but it's also true that Greece is reliant on the EU for imports and for a viable currency. Thus you have the more rational people on the left realizing that it would be insane to leave the Euro, and that they should wait until a more opportune time when they will be ready. What they don't mention is that it will never be an opportune time, they have no plans to become ready, if they did the EU would ruin them, and because of this every day there position becomes weaker and weaker. As a computer scientist this looks similar to a "Greedy Algorithm" (I'm not certain what mentats will call it) which at every step always make the decision which maximizes utility, an obvious algorithm, but also one that can get stuck in less than optimal solutions. In any case I think one of the necessary steps any group interested in revolutionary change would be to create a system in which they are not completely dependent on the current regime for there sustenance.<br><br><a href=#c5956310589713275812 title="comment permalink">8/21/15, 6:13 AM</a><br><br>

There is no real left-wing left in Wisconsin. Madison, the former center of the activist community, has fallen under some sort of malaise. I got conformation from a former activist just this week. It's like the left wing, after years of defeat and failure, have just kinda given up.

Neither nightmares nor dreams can help deal with reality until there is a new vision willing to confront and accept the real world. This dream/nightmare mode of functioning is precisely why current press reporting fails to connect the dots and call the latest bunch of news a breakdown point. Perhaps because unlike pragmatic visions, dreams or nightmare can fulfill themselves in twisted ways ? If the press would phrase honest wording about our predicaments, a culture used to only dream or nightmare might react counterproductively, and start destroying itself along with all the rest of the social fabric. Whereas dealing with actual constraints and demands would avert that counterproductive effect, but is a totally unknown mode of thinking in the mainstream culture at this point.<br><br><a href=#c9201104648555658257 title="comment permalink">8/21/15, 11:54 AM</a><br><br>

He was shocked not by the decay of the economic structure (he expected to see that) but by the change in attitude of the people. As an example, a young woman he spoke to who was thinking of leaving the country told him she took a trip about Moscow thinking if she saw someone smiling, she would stay but leave if she didn't. She saw no smiles.<br><br>The journalist was later drinking in a bar with an acquaintance who lived in the city. He was shocked to see a huge fight suddenly break out in the bar for no apparent reason, dozens of people with fist flying and bottles breaking. <br><br>But most saddening was the interview he did with his acquaintance, an old Party member, who was mourning the decline of the communist ideals he had so dearly cherished when he was younger. He said that what was the worst to him was that people weren't just ignoring these ideals, they were openly laughing at them. <br><br>It's not at all surprising that roughly ten years after the article was written that the Soviet Union under Gorbachev's futile attempts to reform it, collapsed and broke up. <br><br>It's even more uncomfortable to see the current process in this country of selecting candidates to run for the highest office in the land, once a highly anticipated event, now being mocked as a 'circus' and openly laughed at.

The critical factors seem to have been two: the people were not only disenchanted, but desperate (lacking sufficient basics such as food and water), and had gotten to the point where they were no longer afraid to risk death in order to create change. (It's unfortunate that only one of the revolutions, in Tunisia, resulted in an improved government -- time will tell if it lasts.)<br><br>Here's a few delegitimizing memes I've come across: "I'm a citizen, not a consumer", "illiberal" (as a counterpart to "cuckservative"), <a href=http://vote3rd.us/ rel=nofollow>"Vote 3rd"</a>, "increase quality of life, reduce quantity of stuff" (inspired by "<a href=http://storyofstuff.org/ rel=nofollow>The Story of Stuff</a>").<br><br>Also, some organizations and people who are moving in the direction of relocalizing local economies and promoting conservation (and thereby gradually starving the industrial economy). (Note that this doesn't involve explicitly delegitimizing the government.)<br> - Green Wizardry<br> - Transition initiatives<br> - WWOOFing (http://www.wwoof.net/how-it-works/)<br> - Farmers' Markets, Consumer Supported Agriculture<br> - Individual and community gardens.<br> - Local currencies, to promote a robust local economy<br> - Bicycling as a means of transportation, not just recreation<br>None of these amount to a great wave of change, but they stand to help at least some people "collapse gracefully".<br><br>Finally, I'd like to recommend the essays of Wendell Berry. Over the decades, he's been developing a well-fleshed out concept of community, based on the foundation (literally and figuratively) of a relationship to a specific area of land, the ecosystems to be found there, and the ethics needed to create a sustainable relationship that binds the people to the land, to each other, and to the rest of the ecosystem. He definitely walks the talk: he's a native of Kentucky (hi DeVaul!) and after an academic career, moved back to his home town and has farmed there ever since.<br><br>A good place to start with his essays is the book "Standing by Words", in good part because of his exploration of the kind of language that can withstand and replace the increasingly meaningless chatter put out by the corporate media. (There's also a nice comparison of a committed marriage with a committed relationship to a farm.) For more recent essays on the harm done by the industrial economy and the nature of local economies that could legitimately be called sustainable, the book "Citizenship Papers" is reasonably representative.<br><br><a href=#c6216525802628148453 title="comment permalink">8/21/15, 8:31 PM</a><br><br>

The problem is that so many people who could actually launch something worth having into the political realm feel the way you do. <br><br>Dagnarus, that's one of the reasons why we're moving closer and closer to real change in this country: as the fraction of people who are actually employed shrinks, and the fraction who are employed doing anything actually productive shrinks even faster, the issue of dependency is less relevant, because so many people aren't getting anything out of the system anyway. That's the process that gives rise to what Toynbee called the internal proletariat, the people who live in a falling civilization but don't share in its benefits or ideology, and whose withdrawal of support from the system plays a significant role in dragging it down.<br><br>Thomas, I read <a href=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/ rel=nofollow>Naked Capitalism</a> daily -- one of the handful of news aggregator sites I follow. Of course it's lagniappe that they routinely link to these essays in their daily Links page!

A fine summing up of what I was trying to say -- the business about a picture replacing a thousand words or so remains true. <br><br>Varun, the collapse of the privileged (and thus domesticated) Left is a good thing, because it leaves a space open for something else -- preferably something less dysfunctional -- to emerge.

One of the reasons I made that call was precisely by comparing the situation in the US today with the situation in the Soviet Union and its satellites before the Berlin Wall came down. <br><br>GreenEngineer, I've already discussed that in detail. The two critical things that were lacking, to my mind, were (a) a willingness to lead by example, by adopting the kinds of lifestyles they were trying to get everyone else to adopt, and (b) a willingness to deal with the reality that they were in a fight, and couldn't just sit there and expect the other side to cooperate with them. <br><br>Dwig, the reason why the Arab Spring had so few positive results was exactly that the preliminary steps didn't get taken, and so it was pretty much a given that the new boss would be the same as the old boss.

This was just an experiment. She has lots of berry busjes, tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, wants to get a bee hive. Tne yard is about as big as a postage stamp but russian survivalism and german efficiency marks her mixed family heritage. I went jogging 2 hours yesterday, first time in decades. This helped me sleep and calmed my nerves. Yoga and tai chi practiced intensively have given my body enormous founts of flexibility and energy which I have to burn off to 'ground' myself. This seems a good way. So my family's personal transformation in a small format for post PO survival continues by slow adaptation of body and resources. When collapse comes and I am strong, flexible, have stamina, am self sufficient and satsfied within myself then who is up there in politics will not bother me nor the winning ideology as I will be among the strongest, most adaptable. I have gone from shy to outgoing, accepting of all types of cultures, foreign types, people of all ages and background by working side by side physically with them all. This is a result of collapse phase 1 since 2008 crisis. I have outlined our response. Apparently the next phase is upon us in the macroeconomy, geopolitics. 7 year cycle. Each time more people fall by the way side. I want to keep growing, adapting to the end, always coming out a sort of winner, making lemonade out of fates lemons. Best motto is to become the change you want to effect. I was resercing voluntary work and learning to teach my oh so precious yoga. Maybe I will nd up visiting sick or learning to use my chi energy to heal or just hug people. Life offers opportunities. My son said he had found inner peace. He is 16. I laughed at that the whole day, presuming his dry humour was laughing at my 'spirituality' but no he insists things don't bug him anymore and this as his argumentative family screams around the dinner table. The buddha has found company. I figure my hugs transfer my energy from my exploding heart chakra and stabilizes him. The other kid is nervous, only hugs his mom, who does no spiritual practice, relaxes through gardening, ironing and a glass of wine. But a mother's love is 10 times stronger regardless. So I had to get far away from mine to find myself and learn to open my heart without her, God rest her soul. Humans and their society go through phases.

I was in Swaziland from 1991-94 (the years between when Mandela was released from jail and when he was elected president). FW DeKlerk, the then president, let Mandela out of jail I believe because he didn't want him to die in jail and become a martyr. The continual violence blacks did against whites and against each other would spin totally out of control. The violence was completely ineffective in that few white people were going to ever give up or share their privelage (jobs, housing, wealth). Black killed white, white killed black. There was no vision of what South Africa would look like and act like if it wasn't an apartheid community, so even if all the whites were killed and their things taken, there wasn't the knowledge or expertise among the black population to run the corporations and government. <br><br>And I using he terms blacks and whites because that is how it was discussed there then.<br><br>I always wondered how much the U.S. Government interfered with what was going on in South Africa.

Your criticisms are timely and on point. I would just add that a change movement can either be reformist or revolutionary. The reformers want to tweak the system, to change it so that it meets their goals, but the basic institutions, or structures remain in place. The reformers just get a seat at the table. The civil rights movement, leading to the voting rights act, leading to the Congressional Black Caucus would be an example of this. A revolutionary movement wants to dismantle the power stuctures and institutions and replace them. The Cuban revolutionaries or Zapatistas might be an example.<br><br>Part of the problem is that the climate movement is largely reformist in its tactics, but the change they are asking for (decarbonization) is revolutionary in nature. IMO, they don't really acknowledge the breadth of what they are asking for. They just think, as JHK puts it, you can run the interstate highway system, the US Army, WalMart and DisneyWorld by other means. The thinking runs, if we get the right people elected or force through the right policies, we can have privileged middle class lives in solar suburbia. <br><br>As well, in order to have radical change, you not only need shared sacrifice, you need shared suffering. In order to have revolutionary action or effective resistance take place, you must have a population that is experiencing the effects of oppression on a wide spread basis. They will then give aid and comfort to the radicals. The quatering of troops, capricious searches, onerous taxes, etc. affected not only the Franklins of the Colonies, they affected the merchants, farmers, and servnts. Therefore the Patriots had support to fall back on.<br><br>Now one can make a cogent argument for fossil fuel dependancy being the driver of much suffering, but here the size of the nation and time lags work against us. Humans have a short time horizon. Even though we see the effects of climate chaos right now, for example the western drough and resulting wildfires, this is not much more that a curiosity to folks in the Midwest. Their fields and forests are green. And of course some of the worst effects are at least 10 - 40 years away due to the inertia in the climate system. People do not revolt based on potential future suffering, they revolt due to suffering in the now.<br><br>Sadly, once these effects are widely felt (persistant drought, megafloods) even m8re terrible effects become locked in. Sea level rise, or God forbid, runaway greenhouse. This is leading to desperation in some quaters, hence the call for violence with out the necessary steps you outlined. The fear is, there is no time.<br><br>But we live in a different world now. Not only do we still have a relatively fat and happy middle class and a confused working class (no suppot base in the population) we have the full power of DHS, NSA et al operating under the Patriot Act and the NDAA. This pretty much guarantees a backlash from the public and a one way trip to Supermax.<br><br><br>So violence at this stage is useless and is in fact suicidal. <br><br><br><a href=#c7805423346042041169 title="comment permalink">8/22/15, 10:14 AM</a><br><br>

I was at a Methodist PPRC meeting some years ago (us Methodists do love our potlucks and our committees) and we were discussing the next years direction. I suggested making climate justice part of our mission work. The associate pastor made a statement that we couldn't go there because it was asking people to change their "entire lifestyle". And here I thought the Gospels were all about changing entire lifestyles and lives. Silly me! But it was a clarifying moment for me and very depressing. When the existing structures won't ackowledge the seriousness of the problem (or its existance) revolution may be called for. But violence, again, at this time is suicidal. Revolution won't happens anytime soon. It is a waiting game until the suffering is widely shared and the pot boils over. But by then there is no guarantee which direction it takes. My inclination is it will be to the Right with a neofascist flavor. Much easier to blame transpeople, gays, Mexicans, Arabs and the dreaded Left than to blame ourelves.<br><br><a href=#c5286193735388107262 title="comment permalink">8/22/15, 10:53 AM</a><br><br>

It's basically only been a movement for the last ten years. We're talking about a movement that wants people to alter their comfortable consumerist lifestyles in order to prevent a disaster happening in the indefinite future. Hardly an easy task. And then there is the counter-movements fueled by corporations with virtually unlimited war-chests. <br><br>You are right that the real threat of violence and disorder comes from the right, they not only have muddied the waters by undermining people's faith in government and building a misguided faith in the market, they have also created conditions of austerity that are accelerating our slide into economic dystopia. <br><br>There is an alternative to violence and that is a religious response to the crisis. Here's my historical analogy: During the fall of the Roman Empire, Christianity replaced paganism. Christian institutions such as monasteries helped maintain agriculture and preserved knowledge, in the form of copying ancient manuscripts. This created a bridge from the ancient world to the modern. It can be done again. My guess is that permaculture could develop into such a religious movement.<br><br><a href=#c3648413963082667373 title="comment permalink">8/22/15, 12:07 PM</a><br><br>

I have mixed feelings about it, one of the strengths of the movement so far has been its lack of partisanship, growing amongst certain elements of both the left and the right. On one hand, such an alliance could bring more support to the cause, on the other hand I'd hate for it to become a partisan issue that divides along party lines like so many others have become.<br><br>The mainstream left has in general been worse than the mainstream right on these issues (the leftward-leaning states often tend to have more codes, regulations, permits needed and other barriers to sustainable living on a low budget, selling products etc than the right-leaning states do).

That hasn't stopped them elsewhere."<br><br>It seems to me that there are three obstacles to the Left getting traction here in the USA (as well as elsewhere these days, like Russia).<br><br>1. First, is my own experience with the Left in Boston. In 1993, in the winter months before a gay &amp; lesbian March on Washington, I had the privilege of meeting up with the Boston contigent's organization at one of their planning meetings. My partner and I took the subway, and when we arrived, we were late. Was the meeting organized like a proper group meeting? It was not. Everyone had broken up into their own little planning circles, each group trying to come up with a consensus. We were so disgusted we immediately left. At the March on Washington itself, we found that the Boston contigent was absolutely, positively LEAST organized of every one contigent there.<br><br>2. Not only is the left outfunded; they are outgunned, as I hinted at (and failed) in my previous comment where I was talking about about the media. Having read other comments here, I noticed that there are a LOT of establishment right media posing as populist right: i.e., Fox News, talk radio (Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, et al) and the Tea Party, which started out as populist in 2008 but got hijacked by the Republican apparat very quickly. Now it's only pseudo-populist like the above-said media. And the establishment media, which is slanted toward the establishment right anyway, knows very well how to keep the base that would supply the populist right under a spell and within or loyal the GOP: read this <a href=http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20150414.htm rel=nofollow>excellent interview of Noam Chomsky by Seung-yoon Lee</a> on the manufacture of consent. The principal reason why today's media are the way they are, he says, is because the media are mostly owned by large corporate conglomerates, and because they have not the readership, but the advertisers as their chief clientele. They report news and catapult the propaganda in a manner that pleases the advertisers. And he says it's gotten worse in recent decades because of the increasing concentration of ownership and the deaths of many a small media outlet both in small markets and large.<br><br>3. The Left really doesn't have anything to offer the masses so long as the masses are psychologically invested in the Religion of Progress and its goodies (growth and consumption). I picked this information off the net, wherein it is told that a climate scientist, frustrated by the public's non-reception of climate change, persued a degree in human psychology and then studied and researched why this was so. He found out that the current public are so psychologically dependent on growth and consumption to such a degree that the cessation thereof, even in individual cases, would constitute an existential crisis for them.<br><br><a href=#c4217325547791892880 title="comment permalink">8/22/15, 12:45 PM</a><br><br>

This is where this blog joins territory covered by your other blog... Here in Ecnarf, we have not just adopted those consumer products, but embraced them. And yet, pragmatism is not verbalized as one of our core values, so we just practice it every day without thinking. But in the USA, you may apply the old adage that a nation starts to decline when its virtues become vices, for instance pragmatism becomes heresy. Which is a predicament - not a problem - that we will most probably not have to face, and no imaginations will need liberating here. Note that we did have one of our most formative events across the 20th century, Mai 68, featuring one motto among many others, "Let's put imagination in power".<br><br>Here in Ecnarf, we do have our share of problems too : soon the influx of migrants will reach us, and we will embrace its dark corollary, the evils of violent populism.

Late-stage apartheid South Africa was a police state for whites and coloreds as well as blacks. I think that the conditions in the Deep South during the Jim Crow era (from the collapse of Reconstruction until the Lyndon Johnson administration) were comparable to apartheid in many ways, as the legal system, economic system, culture and politics were dominated by the goal of maintaining a strict racial caste system by use of state and private terror and violence.<br><br>After the passage and enforcement of federal Civil Rights legislation, even the most racist parts of the United States are not like South African society under apartheid. To give but one example, police may demand ID from African Americans who enter white neighborhoods, and may harass, arrest and even kill them with impunity, but they are not doing so under color of the law. Dark-skinned people are not required to have a government issued pass to travel outside their own neighborhoods. There were once "sundown towns" in the United States; they do not exist any longer. In apartheid SA, blacks did not have the vote. In the US, a majority white electorate elected and re-elected a biracial President. The kind of rhetoric that equates any repressive, unjust, racially unequal society with apartheid is like equating every authoritarian regime with the Nazis.

I think that it is important to remember the dizzying diversity of the right at the moment, there are many fragments of it which are quite cool, even as there are a few veins of nasty through the category as a whole. Much like the greens or the "progressives". Now is not a time to hold tightly onto the traditional categories, now is a time to appreciate that they are actively in flux, and on the local level the forms they are changing into are quite receptive to influence from the basic driver of these matters, basic social relationships. <br><br>I think it was in the comments of this blog a while back I read that the line between good and evil is not drawn between races, nations, or ideologies, but runs through every heart. If the categories that have been holding people apart are in flux, as I feel them to be, now may be a time to reach across those former rifts, and to find individuals who are, for your intents, of good heart. People of good character can be found in most groups, connecting with them now has a chance to make a big local difference. At the moment I am far from Fort Collins, and can feel that in this place the categories mean something different than they do back in FoCo. Much is based on where folks of decency congregate. Certainly on a national level power blocks may form which could be more or less friendly to the kinds of activities that Green Wizards tend to like to do, but what happens on a national level aggregates the local. Depending on how we treat folks with in and beyond the emerging categories in our personal dealings and relationships feeds different possible national potentials. Holding onto old categories could be more costly than normal if this is true. Even if national trends are caught in winds greater than our breathing, islands of diverse local character can be refugia in times of trouble. A handful of fortunate green wizards may suffice to cause such a change.<br><br>I am working on some ideas that might someday contribute to manifesting a group of green wizards or the like.

The civil rights movement, leading to the voting rights act, leading to the Congressional Black Caucus would be an example of this."<br><br>That's right. The Civil Rights movement also ended legalized segregation once and for all, despite the nasty little ploys the segregationists have been using ever since to reinstate it de facto. It is no longer the law of the land anywhere in the United States. We did it - we got what we wanted, and what we thought would be a simple cleanup job that the older generations were too war-weary to do - without any of us shedding blood. All the bloodshed was on the other side, and it totally delegitimized the segregationist cause in the eyes of the nation and the world. And yes, I know those tactics wouldn't have worked against Hitler, but they worked fine against the opponents we had. <br><br>WE WON. We didn't overthrow 'the system' - we overthrew a rotten part of it. Cut it out of the body politic. No longer the law of the land. <br><br>And that, sir (dusting off my hands) is how the Silent Generation does things. <br><br>In fact, it was a member of my own generation, a woman, who referred to the taste for spectacular gestures, bloodshed, and leaving wreckage behind one as in an action movie for teenaged boys, saying "The will to be stupid is a powerful force."

Apparently, if the courts do not correctly interpret the law, Oathkeepers will supplant them and do it for them.<br>I guess civilian control of the military is not important to them, as it was to the Founders. If Truman had not been able to fire MacArthur in Korea we could have had a gigantic US/China land war on the scale of the Russian Front in WW2.<br>I don't run into people who are that radically right here in eastern CT but there are some who get their worldview from talk radio and are convinced that any government is useless. If I can have a particle of influence in the world I feel it is my duty to call them on their bs, to point out that to whatever extent we get rid of government something else will fill the vacuum, and right now it is likely to be corporations and their private security forces. It is important for those of us who want a more gentle collapse to say to these people that local government is very useful if we are going to keep the water on and get anything done.<br>@Nuku<br>To your point, this would be an example of deligitimizing the political system, even in a nominal democracy.

The U.S. government was nice enough to give us two passports - one with a South African visa and one without so we could travel to countries that did not have diplomatic relations with South Africa such as Malawi at that time.<br><br>FW DeKlerk's government began unraveling the apartheid laws and people were "free" to travel technically but in reality everyone had their place. It is like that here in the U.S. You must live in an area where everyone around you looks like you. <br><br>A white friend of mine is working to build an actual pedestrian walkway between an all minority public housing project and her block of apartments in Philly. Yes, segregation is that bad even In a "blue" voting area which has had over twenty years of African American mayors. She crossed the street to the housing project and struck up a conversation with a woman sitting outside. The woman told her flat out she was in danger, and my friend had actually endangered the safety of the woman herself "you don't know who is watching and what they will think we are talking about". My friend was shaken to the core. <br><br>I would encourage you to go South Africa if you can. It's a beautiful country, and you can see with your own eyes how much it is like the U.S. Except they have less of those pesky laws regulating everything and a lot less lawyers. It was a lot like what I imagine the Wild West being like - people enacting what they thought of as justice and keeping those they didn't want or like out of their neighborhoods. I saw a black man gunned down with an AK 47 and left lieing in the field, and the remains of another man who was necklaced and left in the street. Necklacing is where they slip a car tire down over your body which holds your arms down to your sides. Then they pour gas over you and light you on fire. We saw this poor man after the fire had gone out and the smell was unforgettable.<br><br>To get back to JMG's point on violence not being effective in revolutions, that was the point I was supporting in my experience in Southern Africa. There was lots of violence there in the name of black freedom and none of it did much to change the living conditions of black Africans. Even Mandela being president didn't do much as you will still find black Africans living in shanty towns and white Africans living in compounds. My neighbor has done several trips in recent years to KwaZulu to encourage people to stop cooking on an old kind of kerosene (they call it paraffin but it is what we call kerosene) stove in their shacks. They tip over and Thousands of kids a year get burned. Their parents often abandon them in orphanages then because of the high medical care/costs and being disfigured they can't marry them off and if they are missing limbs or fingers that means they can't work.<br><br>If you want current "on the ground" info, you could probably contact a Peace Corps volunteer in South Africa.<br><br><a href=#c3962322049623148270 title="comment permalink">8/23/15, 2:33 PM</a><br><br>

If Karma actually existed they wouldn't be necessary. You wouldn't pollute because you wouldn't want the blow back. Since people can pollute with impunity and make others live with the consequences of their actions, taxes seem to be as close as we can get to a substitute. Of course the people with real power can also transfer the taxes to others as well, so it's true maybe we shouldn't bother.<br><br><br><a href=#c4037916906328010317 title="comment permalink">8/23/15, 4:46 PM</a><br><br>

When you say "all the money and talent invested in the climate change movement," it has me scratching my head. Are you maybe talking about Al Gore? J/K ;)<br><br>Because from what I've seen over the years, climate change has been at best a significant fraction of the campaign budget of a few major environmental groups and scattered small fringe groups. Only in the last decade or so has it spawned a few organizations dedicated specifically to that cause. The fact that the main one in this country is known by a "dot org" should tell you all you need to know about how long it's been around, and how seriously it should be taken. A name that basically means, "visit our website and we'll entertain you with cool graphics and stirring sentiments," will hardly appear to represent a revolutionary vanguard.<br><br>I hope I'm not coming across as belaboring a minor point. I'm trying to get at what you're suggesting about movements. Are you saying that some group of people should have taken climate change more seriously, effectively to the point of forsaking the rest of the field of social and environmental concerns, and then waged a revolutionary struggle over that issue? And that mostly before a consensus had been reached, even among climate scientists?<br><br>How many years do you recon such delegitimizing and outreach efforts as you recommend might have taken to bear fruit? I think these things usually play out over many decades. Climate change has barely been in anyone's awareness for three of those.<br><br>I think a lot of what you're saying can quite legitimately be thrown at the environmental movement in general, and at a large range of social "progressivisms" which seemed to be flourishing in the post-WWII landscape. It's a critique that I think could serve a very useful purpose, though I doubt it will be heeded by many activists, for way too many reasons to go into here. I just think you weaken your case when you go after a movement that was largely, from my view, nonexistent and would hardly been able to do any of the things you suggest even if it had'nt been.<br><br>One last point, and then I hope I'm done other than a point I want to make later to the readers: The climate change <b>issue</b>, as opposed to movement, also had the misfortune of being hijacked by a rogues gallery of opportunists beginning with Al Gore in the 90s and also including a number of leftist organizations that essentially took it as another way to aggrandize themselves and beat up on their enemies/oppressors. This did not help a bit, either.<br><br><a href=#c2177389777949651625 title="comment permalink">8/23/15, 5:29 PM</a><br><br>

Several ex-pat Yanks live here including me, who I sometimes describe as a “refugee from the Evil Empire“.<br>Regarding the political scene here: Though I’ve been here since 1989, I’m no expert as I tend to view politics as a kind of sideshow. So here’s my slightly cynical take.<br>The level of political debate here has gone steadly downhill in the last 20 odd years, and now we have as 2 term Prime Minister of National Party (on the “right” side of the political spectrum) a guy who bills himself as a “businessman” with no history as a politician, who plays the “I was poor kid raised by my single mom in a state house; I made it to the top but I’m still one of you ordinary folks” card, and likes to pull the pony tails of cute young women “just having a bit of fun”. <br>In reality, the guy spent his working life making millions in commissions in London as a currency trader at Morgan Stanley, in other words, a gambler (with other people’s money). He cut his teeth working for an older guy who made mega millions betting against the NZ$ in the 80’s. His self-confessed political legacy will getting a new flag for NZ and selling us out to the multinationals via the Transpacific Trade Agreement.<br>His party is deep into the process of privatization, and there are proven links between the PM’s inner group and right wing groups in the USA from whom they have learned all the “dirty tricks” such as using social media/radio talk show/blogger attack dogs to discredit the opposition without looking like bad guys themselves. They like to talk about NZ’s “Rock Star Economy” while covertly blowing more hot air into a huge housing bubble.<br>The Labor “left” and the Green party are both playing catch up/reaction mode with no real viable alternative vision, just tweeks on BAU. There’s various groups of Maori (the Polynesian folks who were here when the Brits arrived) who mostly are trying to get their own fingers in the public pie either through alliances with the main parties (we have MMP elections here), or through the courts. They occasionally play the environmental card in their role as “traditional Stewards of the Land“, and some of them have a healthy distrust of the White Man’s shinny toys.<br>There is a growing apathy and mistrust of the political process among some young folks and those who like myself aren’t so head-down-ass-up in the system that we can see over the piles of bullshit to what’s actually going down. <br>In terms of the first stage of JMG’s process, NZ is a bit behind the USA in that most folks still buy into the “clean green Land of the Hobbits” image, and economic desperation is still mostly seen as somebody else’s problem. It could all change very quickly though. Being an island nation in the Pacific, we are at the far end of the supply chain for shiny goodies and oil.<br><br><a href=#c3863070935779303906 title="comment permalink">8/23/15, 9:13 PM</a><br><br>

Basically, the established power saw the writing on the wall, negotiated the best deal they could, then handed over power to the up-and-comers. And it worked out, more or less.<br><br>If the Fossil Fuelites decided to hand over power to the Greens, what sort of deal would the Greens agree to? I don't think the Greens have an agreed-upon program or a cadre of leaders with broad legitimacy like the African National Congress did, hence JMG's comment, <i>"the spokespeople of the climate change movement generally didn’t talk about what they hoped to achieve... [But] ranted instead about how awful the future would be if the rest of the world didn’t fall into line behind them."</i><br><br>I learned about the importance of getting the support of power centers many years ago when I was very involved in politics. I made a speech at a national party congress advocating a certain policy our party should adopt. I thought it was self-evident that this was the way we should go. It was the only policy that was attuned to our ideals. In my naiveté I believed it was only necessary to put the plain facts before people and they would agree with you.<br><br>As I was talking, I noticed the audience's eyes kept shifting away from me, and I wondered what they were looking at. Eventually I realized what was going on. Seated behind me on the stage were the half-dozen or so top people in the party, and the audience was gauging their reaction to what I was saying before making up their minds.<br><br>Bear in mind these were educated, middle-class, successful people, yet they were not prepared to make an independent decision. They wanted to see which way the wind blew first.<br><br>I finished my speech to a polite spattering of applause and was treated like a pariah from then on. My proposal was too premature. Now, years later, it is an accepted part of policy and no one remembers it was any different.<br><br><a href=#c1759604856789468278 title="comment permalink">8/24/15, 3:09 AM</a><br><br>

But we got guarantees that property rights would be respected and signed on the dotted line.<br><br>Google the CODESA negotiations for more specifics.<br><br>I disagree with your assertion that black and colored South Africans are worse off. There are now more middle-class blacks than whites, mainly people with secure jobs in the civil service.

No cheap oil from below, but only expensive vegetable oil available. In times, where there are still 300 Million ex-US people need food. Isn´t the energy input of oil-grops about equal, to what we get out of producing it? So will production of vegetable oil not be extremely costly? Will oil be used up extensively then? I see it a dilemma for oil and electric power likewise. I ask myself, if the cost will be affordable at all?<br><br>Maybe you can put a production cicle of vegetable oil into your novel. So we could imagine. how it realistically could be done. Would be enlightening to leave wishfull thinking behind. Which I see poping out in me and everyone I observe. Suppose, it´s due to the lack of knowlegde, being imprisoned mentally in that colden cage of cheap energy driven culture, not yet living in that harsh future life with no cheap energy available anymore.<br><br><a href=#c4891771686803098092 title="comment permalink">8/30/15, 10:46 PM</a><br><br>

Should Krista Tippet invite you, I hope you would accept. She seems to do a lot of research before she does an interview and strikes me as generally pretty insightful. I would love to see how your messages would go over with the NPR crowd. Are most NPR junkies liberal elitists? You betcha! But there may besome folks waiting in the wings to hear your messages, they just don't know you're out there. What was it Pope Francis said, comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable? I say go afflict them.<br><br>On a much more important note, you have an absolute knack for tossing literary bombs, lighting the fuse with the question "what if?" and then letting this community creatively explode. It is a gift, and I for one am deeply appreciative. I think it speaks to a strength of character seeds of ideas and then trust others to cultivate them in ways you may not have chosen. This is what a teacher does. Way Cool!<br><br>@Patricia and @JMG, thanks for the clarification. A funny story, my day job is with the airlines (I know, I know, Boo Hiss, but it helps pay the bills in the interim). My friend Kara was checking a passport and she asked me what nationality was Deutch. I said, "Kara, Deutch is German for German." A week later, same deal. She asked me what nationality was Espana. I said, "Kara, Espana is Spanish for Spanish." We still laugh about it.<br><br>So "Wm., Nihonjin is Japanese for Japanese" LOL<br><br><a href=#c5784794896317561105 title="comment permalink">9/18/15, 10:03 AM</a><br><br>
