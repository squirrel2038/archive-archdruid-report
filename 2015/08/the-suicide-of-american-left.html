<div class=MsoNormal>
Regular readers of this blog know that I generally avoid partisan politics in the essays posted here. There are several reasons for that unpopular habit, but the most important of them is that we don’t actually have partisan politics in today’s America, except in a purely nominal sense. It’s true that politicians by and large group themselves into one of two parties, which make a great show of their rivalry on a narrow range of issues. Get past the handful of culture-war hot buttons that give them their favorite opportunities for grandstanding, though, and you’ll find an ironclad consensus, especially on those issues that have the most to say about the future of the United States and the world. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s popular on the disaffected fringes of both parties to insist that the consensus in question comes solely from the other side; dissident Democrats claim that Democratic politicians have basically adopted the GOP platform, while disgruntled Republicans claim that their politicians have capitulated to the Democratic agenda. Neither of these claims, as it happens, are true. Back when the two parties still stood for something, for example, Democrats in Congress could be counted on to back organized labor and family farmers against their corporate adversaries and to fight attempts on the part of bankers to get back into the speculation business, while their opposite numbers in the GOP were ferocious in their opposition to military adventurism overseas and government expansion at home. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nowadays? The Democrats long ago threw their former core constituencies under the bus and ditched the Depression-era legislation that stopped kleptocratic bankers from running the economy into the ground, while the Republicans decided that they’d never met a foreign entanglement or a government handout they didn’t like—unless, of course, the latter benefited the poor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>An ever more intrusive and metastatic bureaucratic state funneling trillions to corrupt corporate interests, an economic policy made up primarily of dishonest statistics and money-printing operations, and a monomaniacally interventionist foreign policy: that’s the bipartisan political consensus in Washington DC these days, and it’s a consensus that not all that long ago would have been rejected with volcanic fury by both parties if anyone had been so foolish as to suggest it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The gap between the current Washington consensus and the former ideals of the nation’s political parties, not to mention the wishes of the people on whose sovereign will the whole system is supposed to depend, has attracted an increasing amount of attention in recent years. That’s driven quite a bit of debate, and no shortage of fingerpointing, about the origins and purposes of the policies that are welded into place in US politics these days. On the left, the most popular candidates just now for the position of villainous influence behind it all mostly come from the banking industry; on the right, the field is somewhat more diverse; and there’s no shortage of options from further afield. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Though I know it won’t satisfy those with a taste for conspiracy theory, I’d like to suggest a simpler explanation. The political consensus in Washington DC these days can best be characterized as an increasingly frantic attempt, using increasingly risky means, to maintain business as usual for the political class at a time when “business as usual” in any sense of that phrase is long past its pull date. This, in turn, is largely the product of the increasingly bleak corner into which past policies have backed this country, but it’s also in part the result of a massively important but mostly unrecognized turn of events: by and large, neither the contemporary US political class nor anyone else with a significant presence in American public life seems to be able to imagine a future that differs in any meaningful way from what we’ve got right now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d like to take a moment here to look at that last point from a different angle, with the assistance of that tawdry quadrennial three-ring circus now under way, which will sooner or later select the next inmate for the White House. For anyone who enjoys the spectacle of florid political dysfunction, the 2016 presidential race promises to be the last word in target-rich environments. The Republican party in particular has flung itself with creditable enthusiasm into the task of taking my circus metaphor as literally as possible—what, after all, does the GOP resemble just at the moment, if not one of those little cars that roll out under the big top and fling open the doors, so that one clown after another can come tumbling out into the limelight? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They’ve already graced the electoral big top with a first-rate collection of clowns, too. There’s Donald Trump, whose campaign is shaping up to be the loudest invocation of pure uninhibited <i>f</i><i><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>ü</span>hrerprinzip </i>since, oh, 1933 or so; there’s Scott Walker, whose attitudes toward working Americans suggest that he’d be quite happy to sign legislation legalizing slavery if his rich friends asked him for it; there’s—well, here again, “target-rich environment” is the phrase that comes forcefully to mind. The only people who have to be sweating just now, other than ordinary Americans trying to imagine any of the current round of GOP candidates as the titular leader of their country, are gag writers for satiric periodicals such as <a href=http://www.theonion.com/ >The Onion</a>, who have to go to work each day and face the brutally unforgiving task of coming up with something more absurd than the press releases and public statements of the candidates in question. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, I’m going to leave those tempting possibilities alone for the moment, and focus on a much more dreary figure, since she and her campaign offer a useful glimpse at the yawning void beneath what’s left of the American political system. Yes, that would be Hillary Clinton, the officially anointed frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. It’s pretty much a foregone conclusion that she’ll lose this campaign the way she lost the 2008 race, and for the same reason: neither she nor her handlers seem to have noticed that she’s got to offer the American people some reason to want to vote for her. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In a way, Clinton is the most honest of the current crop of presidential candidates, though this is less a matter of personal integrity than of sheer inattention. I frankly doubt that the other candidates have a single noble motive for seeking office among them, but they have at least realized that they have to go through the motions of having convictions and pursuing policies they think are right. Clinton and her advisers apparently didn’t get that memo, and as a result, she’s not even going through the motions. Her campaign basically consists of posing for the cameras, dodging substantive questions, uttering an assortment of vague sound bites to encourage the rich friends who are backing her, and making plans for her inauguration, as though there wasn’t an election to get through first. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, there’s more going on here than the sheer incompetence of a campaign that hasn’t yet noticed that a sense of entitlement isn’t a qualification for office. The deeper issue that will doom the Clinton candidacy can be phrased as a simple question: does anyone actually believe for a moment that electing Hillary Clinton president will change anything that matters? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those other candidates who are getting less tepid responses from the voters than Clinton are doing so precisely because a significant number of voters think that electing one of them will actually change something. The voters in question are wrong, of course. Barack Obama is the wave of the future here as elsewhere; after his monumentally cynical 2008 campaign, which swept him into office on a torrent of vacuous sound bites about hope and change, he proceeded to carry out exactly the same domestic and foreign policies we’d have gotten had George W. Bush served two more terms. Equally, whoever wins the 2016 election will keep those same policies in place, because those are the policies that have the unanimous support of the political class; it’s just that everybody but Clinton will do their level best to pretend that they’re going to do something else, as Obama did, until the day after the election. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those policies will be kept in place, in turn, because any other choice would risk pulling the plug on a failing system. I’m not at all sure how many people outside the US have any idea just how frail and brittle the world’s so-called sole hyperpower is just at this moment. To borrow a point made trenchantly some years back by my fellow blogger Dmitry Orlov, the US resembles nothing so much as the Soviet Union in the years just before the Berlin Wall came down: a grandiose international presence, backed by a baroque military arsenal and an increasingly shrill triumphalist ideology, perched uneasily atop a hollow shell of a society that has long since tipped over the brink into economic and cultural freefall. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Neither Hillary Clinton nor any of the other candidates in the running for the 2016 election will change anything that matters, in turn, because any change that isn’t strictly cosmetic risks bringing the entire tumbledown, jerry-rigged structure of American political and economic power crashing down around everyone’s ears. That’s why, to switch examples, Barack Obama a few days ago brought out with maximum fanfare a new energy policy that consists of doing pretty much what his administration has been doing for the last six years already, as though doing what you’ve always done and expecting a different result wasn’t a good functional definition of insanity. Any other approach to energy and climate change, or any of a hundred other issues, risks triggering a crisis that the United States can’t survive in its current form—and the fact that such a crisis is going to happen sooner or later anyway just adds spice to the bubbling pot. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The one thing that can reliably bring a nation through a time of troubles of the sort we’re facing is a vision of a different future, one that appeals to enough people to inspire them to unite their energies with those of the nation’s official leadership, and put up with the difficulties of the transition. That’s what got the United States through its three previous existential crises: the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and the Great Depression. In each case, when an insupportable status quo finally shattered, enough of the nation united around a charismatic leader, and a vision of a future that was different from the present, to pull some semblance of a national community through the chaos. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We don’t have such a vision in American politics now. To an astonishing degree, in fact, American culture has lost the ability to imagine any future that isn’t simply an endless rehash of the present—other, that is, than the perennially popular fantasy of apocalyptic annihilation, with or without the salvation of a privileged minority via Rapture, Singularity, or what have you. That’s a remarkable change for a society that not so long ago was brimming with visionary tomorrows that differed radically from the existing order of things. It’s especially remarkable in that the leftward end of the American political spectrum, the end that’s nominally tasked with the job of coming up with new visions, has spent the last forty years at the forefront of the flight from alternative futures. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m thinking here, as one example out of many, of an event I attended a while back, put together by one of the longtime names of the American left, and featuring an all-star cast of equally big names in what passes for environmentalism and political radicalism these days. With very few exceptions, every one of the speakers put their time on the podium into vivid descriptions of the villainy of the designated villains and all the villainous things they were going to do unless they were stopped. It was pretty grueling; at the end of the first full day, going up the stairs to the street level, I watched as a woman turned to a friend and said, “Well, that just about makes me want to go out and throw myself off a bridge”—and neither the friend nor anybody else argued.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s take a closer look, though, at the strategy behind the event. Was there, at this event, any real discussion of how to stop the villains in question, other than a rehash of proposals that have failed over and over again for the last four decades? Not that I heard. Did anyone offer some prospect other than maintaining the status quo endlessly against the attempts of the designated villains to make things worse? Not only was there nothing of the kind, I heard backchannel from more than one participant that the organizer had a long history of discouraging anybody at his events from offering the least shred of that sort of hope. <br>
<br style="mso-special-character: line-break"></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Dismal as it was, the event was worth attending, as it conducted an exact if unintentional autopsy of the corpse of the American left, and made the cause of death almost impossible to ignore. At the dawn of the Reagan era, to be specific, most of the movements in this country that used to push for specific goals on the leftward end of things stopped doing so, and redefined themselves in wholly reactive and negative terms: instead of trying to enact their own policies, they refocused entirely on trying to stop the enactment of opposing policies by the other side. By and large, they’re still at it, even though the results have amounted to four decades of nearly unbroken failure, and the few successes—such as the legalization of same-sex marriage—were won by pressure groups unconnected to, and usually<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>unsupported by, the professional activists of the official left. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are at least two reasons why a strategy of pure reaction, without any coherent attempt to advance an agenda of its own or even a clear idea of what that agenda might be, has been a fruitful source of humiliation and defeat for the American left. The first is that this approach violates one of the most basic rules of strategy: you win when you seize the initiative and force the other side to respond to your actions, and you lose by passively responding to whatever the other side comes up with. In any contest, without exception, if you surrender the initiative and let the other side set the terms of the conflict, you’re begging to be beaten, and will normally get your wish in short order. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That in itself is bad enough. A movement that defines itself in purely negative terms, though, and attempts solely to prevent someone else’s agenda from being enacted rather than pursuing a concrete agenda of its own, suffers from another massive problem: the best such a movement can hope for is a continuation of the status quo, because the only choice it offers is the one between business as usual and something worse. That’s fine if most people are satisfied with the way things are, and are willing to fling themselves into the struggle for the sake of a set of political, economic, and social arrangements that they consider worth fighting for. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m not sure why so many people on the leftward end of American politics haven’t noticed that this is not the case today. One hypothesis that comes to mind is that by and large, the leftward end of the American political landscape is dominated by middle class and upper middle class white people from the comparatively prosperous coastal states. Many of them belong to the upper 20% by income of the American population, and the rest aren’t far below that threshold. The grand bargain of the Reagan years, by which the middle classes bought a guarantee of their wealth and privilege by letting their former allies in the working classes get thrown under the bus, has profited them hugely, and holding onto what they gained by that maneuver doubtless ranks high on their unstated list of motives—much higher, certainly, than pushing for a different future that might put their privileges in jeopardy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The other major power bloc that supports the American left these days offers an interesting lesson in the power of positive goals. That bloc is made up of certain relatively disadvantaged ethnic groups, above all the African-American community. The Democratic party has been able to hold the loyalty of most African-Americans through decades of equivocation, meaningless gestures, and outright betrayal, precisely because it can offer them a specific vision of a better future: that is, a future in which Americans of African ancestry get treated just like white folk. No doubt it’ll sink in one of these days that the Democratic party has zero interest in actually seeing that future arrive—if that happened, after all, it would lose one of the most reliable of its captive constituencies—but until that day arrives, the loyalty of the African-American community to a party that offers them precious little but promises is a testimony to the power of a positive vision for the future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s something that the Democratic party doesn’t seem to be able to offer anyone else in America, though. Even on paper, what have the last half dozen or so Democratic candidates for president offered? Setting aside crassly manipulative sound bites of the “hope and change” variety, it’s all been attempts to keep things going the way they’ve been going, bracketed with lurid threats about the GOP’s evil plans to make things so much worse. That’s why, for example, the Democratic party has been eager to leap on climate change as a campaign issue, even though their performance in office on that issue is indistinguishable from that of the Republicans they claim to oppose: it’s easy to frame climate change as a conflict between keeping things the way they are and making them much worse, and that’s basically the only tune the American left knows how to play these days. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The difficulty, of course, is that after forty years of repeated and humiliating failure, the Democrats and the other leftward movements in American political life are caught in a brutal vise of their own making. On the one hand, very few people actually believe any more that the left is capable of preventing things from getting worse. There’s good reason for that lack of faith, since a great many things have been getting steadily worse for the majority of Americans since the 1970s, and the assorted technological trinkets and distractions that have become available since then don’t do much to make up for the absence of stable jobs with decent wages, functioning infrastructure, affordable health care, and all the other amenities that have gone gurgling down the nation’s drain since then. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Yet there’s another factor, of course, as hinted above. If the best you can offer the voters is a choice between what they have now and something worse, and what they have now is already pretty wretched, you’re not likely to get much traction. That’s the deeper issue behind the unenthusiastic popular response to Hillary Clinton’s antics, and I’d like to suggest it’s also what’s behind Donald Trump’s success in the polls—no matter how awful a president he’d be, the logic seems to run, at least he’d be different. When a nation reaches that degree of impatience with a status quo no one with access to power is willing to consider changing, an explosion is not far away. </div>

I think Trump's chances of getting nominated are probably weak (I read today that the bookies lay odds at 5 to 1), but even if nominated he doesn't have the spare billions to run a campaign, and he is pretty well an enemy of the Koch brothers, etc., the traditional paymasters of recent Republican campaigns. As for Hillary: ask Bradley Manning about mishandling classified information. I suspect that even if her special person status keeps her from being indicted that the powers in the Democratic Party will again see once again that she in not electable and they will go off in search of another relative unknown. In fact keeping their candidate secret until the last moment even be their strategy. I feel so old and cynical.....<br><br>And, of course, there is always the Plan C or D of the current oligarchs if things get too uncomfortable for them: find sufficient emergency somewhere to declare an extreme national emergency and send dissidents off to the FEMA camps.<br><br>Collapse doesn't always have to be slow and catabolic---sigh! It is hard to think of things to do on a personal level that could create the opportunities for better outcomes for the population at large. There are little things most of us can do, like buying a more efficient car and conserving water, but these are mostly symbolic unless and until such practices catch on. Organic farming is about no new pesticides, not the pesticides that will be in the land and water for centuries to come. Organic also means that the grower uses no GMO seed stocks, but not that there are no GMO genes and their effects present in the crops--commercial organic foods can actually legally have a percentage of GMO genes present. And those GMO genes can spread to other plants--witness the surprisingly large number counties in the US with super-weeds that are Round Up resistant. Even doing the right thing is only putting on the "cleanest dirty shirt" because of the events of the last 40 years perpetrated by the more for me now crowd and their political hirelings.<br><br>I weep for our grandchildren.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c3565214514645421720 title="comment permalink">8/5/15, 6:15 PM</a><br><br>

Major party politicians don't get it. The Democratic party through 'progressives' under the bus and consequently have nothing to offer anyone who wants a better future. That they lost the support of millions is something they don't get. Republicans who get their support from common folk who imagine they might actually get rich some day and be Republican themselves are blatant in their disregard for the same common folk they used to schmooze. They don't get that there is a limit to the amount of abuse people will tolerate.

But one party (or both of them, I reckon) could have a meltdown and be replaced. <br><br>I was just listening to an interview with Sturgill Simpson and he was discussing the mixed feelings he has about so frequently being compared to Waylon Jennings. He wondered if it was "psychosomatic," i.e., that mainstream country music today is so effing terrible people are just longing for some honest-to-God Waylon-like musical phenomenon to happen, and Sturgill is maybe the closest thing to that right now.<br><br>Reading your post it's easy for the imagination to wander into a very dark place - where some truly malicious destructive but charismatic force with a plan and the means to enact it could rise up to fill the political vacuum of continued status quo maintained by our two current parties. That's ugly and I don't really want to think about that. But what about the good alternative? What if, like music lovers sick to death of vacuous lame-o commercial Bro Country longing for an authentic Waylon-type to emerge, there is actually a huge constituency of people in the US who would burst out of their malaise for real political leadership and a movement that honestly would called a spade a spade, and had a plan for dealing with our energy-economic-environmental travails?<br><br>I mean, what's holding up these two joke parties, anyhow? Does anyone take them seriously? I'm sure the doomer side of the blog-o-shpere would have lots of fun imagining all sorts of nasties taking over the US in the wake of the Ds and/or Rs self-destruction. But can you see any benefit from imagining how a serious, honest, beneficent movement might coalesce to fill the breach, and writing some posts about that? Or are we just too off-the-deep-end culturally and intellectually as a society for that to even be remotely realistic?<br><br>Sturgill has a large and growing following now, has released two landmark albums and has been touring relentlessly, despite receiving zero support through any mainstream musical channels.

Hillary Clinton continues to sweep up the primary votes because of her ability to deftly jump through hoops and make it look like something anyone can do. She continues to command the majority of votes, including minority voters, for that reason, but in fact her maneuvering talents are quite unique. People who vote for Hillary are voting for that promise of normality, but she is still putting on a mere act that has little relationship to what happens when the show comes to an end.<br><br>I remember in some earlier posts you called American politics in the 21st century a total sideshow that will not have much influence on anything. But it's hard to keep away from the spectacle. It's so much fun to watch a fortress start to crumble, and it's simply amazing when that fortress is the entire way we talk about ourselves. There's so much going on: the visible formation of elite dynasties, the shift of the role of government away from economic disparity and towards linguistic policing, the total avoidance of the signs of collapse (anyone notice that Army chief of staff saying that the war on ISIS will last 10-20 years?

Even the Greens which have a presence in the Federal Senate down here appear to have lost their colour in recent years. There are some notable exceptions though as there are a few independents in the Federal Senate such as Nick Xenophon who talks a lot of common sense, but as individuals they can be overwhelmed by the system. The system is well setup to tackle threats from within. It is the unexpected that the system cannot get a handle on very well. The simple lesson to take on that is don’t fight the system as it may stomp you!<br><br>If you can forgive a quick trip back into the time of the Hyborian age for a moment or two, I noticed an interesting feature of that story. When sorcery becomes involved it is often countered by other sorcery meanwhile the potent force of nature then crashes through the space left over - often in the form of Conan smiting his enemies. It is a blood thirsty tale!<br><br>It is a fascinating insight from the author and it can well be applied to the realms of magic. Because to my mind anyway, what magic can create, it cannot hold for long against the real world force of nature. The powers that be, let loose thaumaturgy by the bucket load onto the population these days and people lap it up. Because, by and large, people want to be told what they want to hear – it is an easy sell. But such a strategy doesn't work against the forces of the real world / nature. It doesn't create energy and it certainly doesn't put food on the table.<br><br>There is also the trap, that the politicians relying on thaumaturgy as an instrument of policy, get caught in the trap of their own beliefs. The problem is that they will never quite know when the next sorcerer will pop up their head, look about them at the world as it is experienced by the people and then cast another spell more appropriate to that real world experience. And yet, all the while, nature will be waiting in the background waiting for a chance to lunge in and bash some skulls.<br><br>One fascinating quote from the book - and sorry, I do digress as I’m really enjoying the book which I haven’t read for a couple of decades - is that civilised men can be impolite to one another whilst the barbarian knows this is unwise because he may get his skull cracked if the other party takes offence!<br><br>Ah yes, the poor. Over here the unemployed are a whipping dog in the media. Somehow that same media forgets that welfare to families and the elderly costs 10 times the amount spent on the unemployed.<br><br>Conan would agree with your observation about seizing the initiative. Also Sun Tzu would also agree. Interestingly too, I pursue that strategy because it simply works and produces results, although some people - whom I consider to be hopelessly apathetic to their day to day circumstances - have accused me of being a control freak - which is meant to be a derogatory term. <br><br>Those rusted on supporters in the middle class that you write about are overly comfortable and as I pointed out in the previous paragraph about welfare, they're on the take.

The mid 1970's when U.S. oil production peaked and the first embargo happened mark a very clear inflection point on pretty much any chart of economic indicators you pick - wages, debt/GDP, etc. <br><br>Did the Reagan era hasten along some of bad response to these trends? Yes, but I'm focused on the progressive side of the ledger, for this post. And it was the Democratic party that, through the operation of the Democratic Leadership Council, bounced the last of the New Deal era positions after Mondale's defeat in order to produce a more electable candidate - Clinton. <br><br>Now with most policy choices constrained, and most activists sensing the futility of the conventional political process, some of them have retreated into moralistic pietism. Sociologists Christian Smith and Melinda Lundquist Denton use the term theraputic moralistic deism to describe the religious aspect of it. In either view, asserting one's own righteousness is certainly a human powered activity that is possible in an era of energy decline (although boosted by cheap energy like everything else).<br><br>As for the current situation, what I find, being relatively close the belly of the beast, is that most of the politico types in D.C. assumed the chaos in the primary so far is a sideshow and would dissipate once people come to their senses. Doesn't seem likely to happen, for the reasons you laid out. <br><br>The best analogy (yes, a mechanical one) I can come up with is that what's going on now is like a pinball game, and you don't know how many balls are left to play. Eventually it will go tilt from all the effort to keep going, because the ground has shifted, and the game won't work anymore.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c278810624753646415 title="comment permalink">8/5/15, 8:23 PM</a><br><br>

The poor feller's getting so frustrated that I recently noted him saying that Marx and Lenin were probably right: you need a revolution to dislodge the capitalists! Today he published an article on Op-Ed News offering solutions to the terrible bind we are in, but I am afraid those would fail for the reasons you have noted. <br><br>I also think human civilization is prone to eventual power usurpation by psychoopathic elements precisely because psychopaths are able to accomplish the dirty tasks no one with a conscience would be able to do without severe health consequences, but need done so badly in order to promote their own interests that they will turn a blind eye to it all.<br><br>Off topic, but in your response to someone last week you described our house with uncanny accuracy, cobbled together with a southern greenhouse and pumpkins climbing the fruit trees, except our compost pile is a plastic bin in a vain effort to discourage rats.

And while you're right that the Democrats' defense the of status quo is not particularly inspirational, there are plenty of areas (women's rights, labor policy, taxation, etc.) where Republicans openly favor making things worse as fast as possible, and at the state level of governance are doing so with great vigor (see Kansas for a particularly excellent example).<br><br>Rather than saying that the parties are "indistinguishable" I think a more accurate statement is that if the nation were to need a hearty meal, the Democrats would after much deliberation manage to provide a day-old plate of badly overcooked pasta with no sauce, and the Republicans would gleefully serve up a burning bicycle tire.

I remember that election very well. Perhaps you will not agree with my analysis of it. Robert Kennedy, ever the opportunist, charged through the hole that McCarthy opened up and would have won the Democratic nomination has he lived. He was forming a coalition between the white working class, people of color, portions of the Left, liberals and moderates, something no one on the Left had succeeded in doing for decades. His charisma mobilized people who had been disengaged from electoral politics. He was a reformer, certainly not a revolutionary, and I think he could have been elected with enough popular support to make reforms possible. <br><br>I don't attribute most bad happenings to conspiracy, but in 1968 RFK was a real threat to the status quo, and I don't think his assassination was a fluke.

Hedges mentioned that in the end, Sanders will hold his nose and endorse Hillary Clinton, because he already made such a deal in order to run as a Democrat in the 1st place.<br><br>There are some things the Democrats, even the seemingly honest and well-intentioned Bernie Sanders, can't say:<br><br>We (as a nation in the USA) must largely give up the notion of repairing national infrastructure. We must allow many of the roads and bridges to fall into disrepair. We must downsize our cities, abandon air travel and quickly engage in efforts in the direction of Samuel Alexnder's "voluntary simplicity". (see the Simplicity Institute - easily found by a google search)<br><br>Even the most enlightened of the Europeans (Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, etc.) aren't this radical. They all have every intention of continuing their high-energy living, with electrified homes and businesses and liquid fuel as needed.<br><br>What is the biggest taboo of all? It is admitting that industrial civilization is headed towards irreversible collapse, and this collapse is already well under way and will accelerate in the not too distant future. This means a collapse of industrialized agriculture, a massive global human die-off, an epidemic of failed states, and the loss of culture in many places throughout the civilized world. A global dark age is not that far away, probably less than a century, and it will be evident in some places much sooner.<br><br>How in the world is a politician supposed to get elected, even avoid being pelted with rotten vegetables, for saying such things?<br><br><br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c6410308071307942075 title="comment permalink">8/6/15, 1:16 AM</a><br><br>

But I'm not sure it's especially helpful when it seems to render the terms 'left' and 'right' fairly meaningless as descriptors. If a party subscribes to economic neoliberalism, then I'd say it's on the right.<br><br>Seen from across the Atlantic therefore, both your two main parties appear to be firmly right-wing. Here in the UK we have experienced a similar alignment in the past 35 years or so with our two main political parties as the Labour party was hollowed out from within to become an economically neoliberal (and shamefully warmongering) party called New Labour, trying to appease a predominantly hostile right-wing press but with a little 'progressive' window dressing to pacify the membership. They dropped the New and went back to being just Labour at the recent general election, but their leader Ed Miliband couldn't communicate well and neither did their economic approach significantly shift. They notably got hammered by the SNP in Scotland (who ran on a much more left-wing platform overall) and their small rise in voteshare was not rewarded by our archaic voting system.<br><br>Cue an enormous rumpus in recent weeks with their leadership election as a traditional lefty - Jeremy Corbyn - who had been written off at the start as a marginal figure, now appears to have a good chance of winning. This is mainly because he offers a clear alternative to the passive neoliberal worldview espoused by the other three candidates, and can effectively advocate a positive vision in policy terms rather than simply saying what he opposes. This is much to the confusion and horror of those in the neoliberal wing (aka the Blairites) who are pulling all manner of publicity stunts to try to ensure he doesn't win. <br><br>As a Green Party supporter/activist (we quadrupled our votes at the recent general election to over a million and still have only one MP - thanks First Past The Post!), I'm watching with some interest from the sidelines. I think the problems we face with climate/energy/overshoot are terrifyingly huge, and I suspect Corbyn won't go far enough fast enough in tackling them, but I would love to be surprised. He is clearly someone with strong moral convictions and the ability to articulate those convictions, and that is a hopeful sign at least. So no suicide of the left going on over here; on the contrary, it appears to be awakening from its coma.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c2154668302958152996 title="comment permalink">8/6/15, 1:38 AM</a><br><br>

Our own left(ish) Labour Party seems to be indulging in another suicide attempt dressed up as a leadership contest. For those not in touch with UK politics, it's hard to describe, but it appears the party grandees have enabled a 'hard-left' candidate to run to give an impression of variety, and he has taken a stonking lead, to everone's amazement and panic. Hordes of new members are joining the party. Various factions are slating this as either pseudo-Trotskyite 'entryism' or right-wing infiltration. The party grandees are in a blind funk.

(Like anybody who uses the phrase "sustainable growth".) It's amazing and utterly baffling that people who were grown adults twenty years ago - and certainly fifty years ago - can't recognise how drastically things have changed in terms of things like the distribution of wealth, the price of oil and the priorities of politicians. People still talk of the "left" and the "right" as though they mean something but here across the pond it's become strikingly apparent in the past few months that there's almost no difference between them. The Democrats may do nothing but react to the Republicans, but the UK Labour Party - the old bastion of the left - has stopped bothering even to do that. The futility and moral bankruptcy of this is obvious to everyone except, it seems, the professional left wing, which has gone into a tizzy over the prospect of Labour electing a leader who actually sounds leftist (and whether or not he would actually make a difference is largely irrelevant - even the *suggestion* of a few old lefty ideas is radical these days) and the party may well schism if he gets the job. The ice is cracking. <br><br>Meanwhile, up in Scotland, we've got one of the most peaceful independence movements in human history and I can only hope it stays that way. I get the strong impression it falls into your category of "a vision of a different future" - one that may not turn out to actually be any better, of course, but one that at least involves action and definite change rather than more of the same. I don't know so much about American politics, but I do get the impression you've got further to go before anything similar arises - chaos and disruption, yes, but the required cognitive and emotional shifts needed to set off in a new direction will require a bit more time.<br><br>Ah, well.

A small nitpick with your pejorative use of the now universally reviled term "conspiracy theory" in paragraph 5, though. Does a small group of political insiders, a political class if you will, who say one thing for public consumption and another thing quite the opposite among their well-connected friends not represent a conspiracy of sorts? I think what's changed about "conspiracies" in general is not that they're more secretive or <i>necessarily</i> pernicious, but that they're carried out much more commonly and openly under the simple guise of Business as Usual - the alignment of like-minded business interests, these days. Worse still, I think most Americans accept that state of affairs openly and see nothing wrong with it, the concept of the mythical "public good" having long since been consigned to the trash can of archaic concepts as well. In summary, I think perhaps you underestimate the level of cynicism inherent in the American character these days, from the working class stiff all the way up to the Fortune 500 CEO, something I personally find that needs to be revised upward quite regularly.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c1267289490360056314 title="comment permalink">8/6/15, 5:59 AM</a><br><br>

The left media which I have been listening to seems to be capable of suggesting positive steps which could be taken, such as a massive federal jobs program, investment in green energy/rail/public transport infrastructure (as part of the jobs program), all paid for by a tax on wall street wealth. I suspect that there program might even work if we hadn't already blown through the oil, and the unpolluted atmosphere. At the very least I think it's more likely to work that whatever trump is pushing.<br><br>Personally I think a large part of the problem which the left has is that it's to "rational" (I don't mean this in a good way). The left does not understand the utility which being willing to stay the course in a game of chicken can yield. For example most people who like to play chicken only like to play it with people who will swerve. I believe the progressive left calls this "voting for the lesser of two evils". Obama calls it permission to disregard anything the progressive left thinks and or feels.<br><br>Tieing this back to the article I posted previously, I noticed that for the previously article that there was at least one post mocking the idea that assault rifle would be capable of defeating all the high tech ordinance which the US armed forces had available to it. This seems to have a lot of traction with the left, and also seems to blatantly ignore the facts of the last 15 years of US military history. I'm not certain whether the militia movement or something like it has the insane believe in it's own righteousness needed to sustain an insurgency against the US government, but I suspect the inability of the majority of the US left to entertain the possible damage they could cause is a blindness to there own (and if I'm honest my own) lack of moral courage (namely the willingness to actually suffer for ones own believes.)<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c1116121060547394178 title="comment permalink">8/6/15, 6:08 AM</a><br><br>

I was able to ask Dr Jill Stein a question, briefly spoke with her running mate Cheri Honkala, and chatted with a lot of delegates and other press. Despite liking nearly everyone I met, what I took away from the convention was that the Greens believe that their party can govern without working closely with business interests.<br><br>I'm no historian, but it is my impression that all but the most absolute monarchs have to satisfy the people that run the businesses that keep the country or nation solvent. While it may appear unseemly, there will always be the making of deals, awarding of contracts and granting of favors. Roman Emperor Claudius discusses that sort of thing at length, and I presume even the divine Pharaohs did it as well. <br><br>I think the real problem with the left is that they lost the support of business when times got tougher. When there was plenty of profit to go around, business grudgingly went along with unions, square deals, new deals and even environmental regulations. But that malaise that Jimmy Carter saw was real enough, and Reagan's Morning in America meant jettisoning all that lefty stuff to try to keep the profits coming in. <br><br>I moderated, at my old blog, nasty exchanges between staunch, well-to-do Hillary Dems and bitter, struggling Kucinich progressives, so I think you are right on point about some Dems wanting to keep what they have. I don't think it should be a surprise to anyone who follows energy depletion that the left can do little but hope for an increasing pie, while the right cynically hacks larger slices from an obviously shrinking one.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c2320907716265580200 title="comment permalink">8/6/15, 7:16 AM</a><br><br>

Nor are they necessarily synonymous with the two main political parties. <br><br>2) Focusing on elections and the contest between the Republican and Democratic parties, if your criteria for judging who to vote for (or whether to vote at all) is whether or not they will try to bring massive systemic change comparable to establishing the Constitution of 1789, ending slavery, or the New Deal, then you're probably going to be disappointed. If those events happen they will be in reaction to crisis. None of the examples you yourself used were cases where the charismatic leader in question ran for office on a platform of ending the old order. The constitution was a series of compromises, not a genius scheme of government. Lincoln pledged to leave slavery alone where it existed in 1860, not end it. I imagine committed abolitionists probably said "there's no difference" at the time. When FDR ran against Hoover his main line of attack was that Hoover was letting budget deficits get out of control. Be still my beating leftist heart. Lincoln and FDR were not "Lincoln" and "FDR" when they were first elected.<br><br>3) Even if you see the differences between two candidates as marginal, remember that within those margins are decisions that are a matter of life and death for millions. For example: Obamacare is weak tea given the larger dysfunction of the nation's system of health care, but if you're a diabetic who had no insurance before, suddenly being able to afford your insulin is a pretty big improvement in your quality of life. Food stamps may be part of a broken food production and distribution system that is going to go away at some point anyway, but for now, if you're one of the unemployed cast-offs of the brave new global economy, they may be what's keeping you alive to see another day. FDR's advisor Harry Hopkins, in response to the argument that if we did nothing over the long run the economy would fix itself, said "People don't eat over the long run, they eat every day." <br><br>4) Candidates in an election are not robots programmed to carry out the platforms of their party. They are human beings whose background, worldview, intelligence (or lack thereof) and emotional stability (or lack thereof) matter, especially in a crisis. To stick with the examples above, what if Hoover had been reelected in 1932, or a different Republican had gained the nomination in 1860? Would they have been able to pull off what Lincoln or FDR did? <br><br>For a more recent example, think back to the 2000 election: I knew a lot of Nader voters who expressed the same "there's no difference" view. And if Gore had won, no the US would not have stopped being a capitalist country, broken our fossil fuel addiction, tamed wall street etc. But I highly doubt Gore would have decided to invade Iraq. In avoiding that one decision alone, hundreds of thousands dead would still be alive, millions of other lives would be better, we wouldn't have poured a trillion dollars down the rathole and so on. If, as Nader said, there wasn't a dime's worth of difference between Bush and Gore, not having had the second Iraq War seems to me to have been a pretty big dime.<br><br>5) You're focusing on Presidential elections here, but I'd argue at the local level there's often more room to maneuver and make a difference. Maybe you and some of your other readers should consider running for town council or planning board and trying to develop alternatives there if that's an avenue that's open to us.<br><br>Anyway, I humbly submit these points for your consideration.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c8942692070601479494 title="comment permalink">8/6/15, 7:25 AM</a><br><br>

Still, I feel the need to state the obvious:<br><br>I won't comment on Syria, but in the case of Ukraine, a lot of people were genuinely fed up with their country's leadership, and especially with Russia's dominance over their country. I lived in Moldova for 4 years, and it is a similar situation there. And while I am fully aware of how dysfunctional and undemocratic the EU is these days, especially seeing how they are treating Greece, a lot of people in countries like Moldova and Ukraine genuinely look to the EU as an escape from Russian imperialism and Russian-inspired autocratic government. <br><br>Of course, many of them fail to notice that the EU will care about their sovereignty and well being just as much as Russia will. And I have a hard time arguing with them, especially since no one is considering a viable alternative which does not involve bowing down to someone more powerful.<br><br>But whenever I see Americans criticizing their government for "regime changes" in one country or another, I get the feeling that they are overestimating their own importance, and ignoring the complex socio-political landscape of said countries. I am sure that you are not one of them, but I am writing this for anyone who might fall into this rhetorical trap.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c2686198695192892773 title="comment permalink">8/6/15, 8:06 AM</a><br><br>

Even if a genuinely leftist movements could get in power, the power of big banks and finance can crush it easily. A vivid illustration has just been provided by Syriza in Greece. And that’s not even accounting for the fact that a leftist politician can’t even get in power in the U.S. as campaigns are bankrolled by wealthy donors, of whom the Kochs and Sheldon Adelson are just the most visible representatives. Hilary has many allies on Wall Street.<br><br>I’m sure someone so versed in history knows that patronage and clientism are forever the way of democratic politics. Lack of sudden, abrupt change is a feature, not a bug, of democratic politics as envisioned by the founders, which you yourself have pointed out. In normal times, this might be considered a good thing. Also, there is good evidence that parliamentary systems are more responsive, since a single party can form a government, while Presidential systems are more sclerotic and vulnerable to sudden shocks, since you have opposing parties in control of different branches of government who each have a claim on popular legitimacy. Will Durant pointed out that any democracy is ultimately an oligarchy due to inherent asymmetries of wealth and power.<br><br>I’d have to quibble with the statement that Obama is pursuing the exact same foreign policy, though. Is there any doubt that were there a Republican administration in power for the last eight years we would be at war with Iran right now? Instead, we have a negotiated settlement viciously pilloried by Republicans. It seems to be an error of binary thinking – either the parties are totally opposed or they are exactly the same. Any party will oversee the U.S. imperial system; that’s a given, but the Democrats, it seems, are the lesser of two evils, although evil, to be sure.<br><br>Finally, this excellent essay by Corey Robin makes some good points. He points out that the Left being for the future and the Right being reactionaries longing for the past is not a reliable guide to politics today. Interesting stuff:<br><br><i>"In 1820, 80% of Americans were self-employed; by 1940, 80% worked for someone—or something—else. “The individual has gone,” declared John D. Rockefeller, “never to return.” Driven into the mills and the mines or onto the rails, these refugees from the shop and the farm were injured, maimed, or killed (35,000 per year) by industrial capitalism. They were the lucky ones. Many Americans couldn’t get work at all. In the 1870s, unemployment became a census category for the first time. So desperate were jobless New Yorkers that they got themselves arrested just to enjoy a night off the streets, in jail. They also struck, marched, organized, bombed and killed, launching decades of class warfare, literal and metaphoric, that would haunt the country’s elites for years to come."</i><br><br><i>“What [Steve] Fraser shows, with vivid set pieces drawn from the nation’s most violent battlefields, is that far from presenting itself as the enemy, the past was viewed by workers and farmers as a resource and an ally. In part because the capitalist right so heartily embraced the rhetoric of progress and the future (no one, it seems, was content with the present). But more than that, historical memory enabled workers and farmers to see beyond the horizon of the capitalist present, to know, in their bones, what Marx was constantly struggling to imprint upon the mind of the left: that capitalism was but one mode of economic life, that its existence was contingent and historical rather than natural and eternal, and that because there was a past in which it did not exist there might be a future when it would cease to exist. Like the nation, capitalism rests upon repeated acts of forgetting; a robust anti-capitalism asks us to remember.”</i><br><br>http://www.salon.com/2015/08/02/we_have_the_left_and_right_all_wrong_the_real_story_of_the_politics_of_nostalgia_and_tradition/<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c7325812128616096240 title="comment permalink">8/6/15, 8:14 AM</a><br><br>

The Sanders campaign might represent an attempt by folks like the J Street lobby to get Israel and its lobby in the USA to see sense and stop trying to provoke wars the American public won't support any longer. If so, I fear it may be too little, too late.<br><br>The second point of interest is that Sanders would seem to be the only candidate I know of who is an open, high profile GMO opponent. That, I suggest, is what is getting him the large crowds and favorable poll numbers.

The group that you refer to in this article as having committed suicide is not the "left," which was traditionally a group of radical elements actively fighting against the rise of corporate power (think coal miners taking up arms against Baldwin-Felts detectives in WV, Homestead steelworkers meeting Pinkerton thugs at the docks with clubs and knives, Mary Harris "Mother" Jones, Emma Goldman, Eugene Debs, Big Bill Haywood, and the old communist and socialist parties). Rather, what you are talking about here is progressive liberalism, which occupied the center of American politics throughout much of the industrial age, seeking not wholesale change (or revolution), but incremental reform in order to stave off wholesale change (or revolution).<br><br>As Chris Hedges has pointed out in his work, specfically <i>The Death of the Liberal Class</i>, the American Left was effectively whacked by a series of events, namely the Red Scare after WWI and the Russian Revolution, manifested most visibly in the Palmer Raids, and finished off by the antics of Tailgunner Joe McCarthy in the 1950s. Political liberals, typified by the Democratic Party, joined with the reactionary right in the post-war massacre of what elements of the left were still around. The only "left" that we have in the US anymore it typified by some fringe activists (like, for instance, the International Socialist Organization and A.N.S.W.E.R.) and academia. These remaining elements are left only for show, to play the role of perennial losers in our ritual political theater. They are prime examples of the statement supposedly uttered by Fredrick the Great in regards to a critic of his: "He can say whatever he wants, so long as he lets me do whatever I want."<br><br>The slow suicide of American liberalism was started by this turning on radical elements, because as soon as the left was out of the way, the reactionary right turned their sights on to the liberals as the new enemy. It was hastened along by attempts by rightist Democrats to cozy up to corporate interests, undermining what was left of labor's remaining influence in the process. The reason that the liberal class no longer exhibits any new ideas is that the primary source for their new ideas -- the radical left -- is as dead as Dillinger, and has been for quite some time.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c5413225296485383362 title="comment permalink">8/6/15, 10:54 AM</a><br><br>

In all other realms they were to be strictly banished. We are talking about the murdering of dreams, the imposition of an apparatus of hopelessness, designed to squelch any sense of an alternative future.

Alternative candidates, like Sanders and Trump, will fall by or be shoved to the wayside. That's the case even if Sanders or Trump does like Ron Paul - remember what happened to him? But this is by design, and has been for a long time: <br><br>“The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can ‘throw the rascals out’ at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy.” Carroll Quigley, Tragedy and Hope, 1965, at p1245.<br><br>That's the genius of the constrained choice offered by the two party system - there is heat, and light, and battle, and high drama - but the policy does not and will not change. There's simply too much money riding on this to let there be the possibility of dramatic shifts in policy every four years. As Emma Goldman once said, "If voting could change anything, it would be illegal."<br><br>That's pretty much it for this election - and for every single election since Nixon - McGovern in 1972. The American Left pretty much petered out with the end of the draft in 1973, when the New Left of the Port Huron Declaration had blown themselves up, got religion, moved to the country, or got married with children and a mortgage. With the end of the draft, they lost their foot soldiers, there was no longer any reason to march. And 1973 was the first year of the Energy Crisis, incidentally. And things got worse, until 1979, when there was gas rationing and people were running pickup trucks using methane digesters in the back. People were running scared, and when you're running, you're constantly reacting, there's no time to think, to look around - and so, with some little nudges from the powers-that-be, the Left was totally marginalized, pushed back to the universities where it could be easily contained. People naturally desire for things to continue as they are, hence the words in the Declaration of Independence: "all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed." - and so you can see the history of the past 42 years or so of decline. Eventually, though, it will come to an end, as it did in the 1770s here, and in the 1980s in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc. But change will not come through stage-managed elections, as they are simply a means for manufacturing consent to policies set in stone: http://hope.journ.wwu.edu/tpilgrim/j190/Chomsky.summary.html Change will come by two means: "in order to break free, citizens must take 2 actions:<br>1. They must seek out information from ALTERNATIVE MEDIA (media outside the mainstream and usually having a particular point of view)<br>2. they must move toward change by becoming engaged in community action -- because people can use their ordinary intelligence to make changes in their lives and communities. Grassroots movements begin there."<br><br>This happened in the Colonies by means of newspapers such as the Pennsylvania Gazzette, broadsheets, the Sons of Liberty, and the like; and in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe via samizdat and groups such as Solidarnosc in Poland. Now, we have the Internet, but very little in print, and it is easy to disappear things from the internet, and we don't, for the most part, have community, or community action. So that's the puzzle to solve.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c7629749211842177787 title="comment permalink">8/6/15, 11:56 AM</a><br><br>

Much of these actions can be explained if the politicos have surmised (correctly I believe) that the masses will not accept austerity or a further decline in living standards overtly. Even if it is in their best long term interests. That solution, while perhaps the correct one is not viable politically, as Jimmy Carter showed us all too well. As long as you have not promised a decline, you are free to blame it on the opposition when it occurs. Hence we get the continuing rounds of make believe as the can is kicked a bit further down the road each time, along with the expected blame game.<br><br>Recent events in Greece would seem to reinforce this theory. If you read the ex finance minister's interviews, they had a Plan B: to default, stick it to the ECB, and start printing their own currency. The finance minister was all for it but the gov't as a whole rejected it. Most everyone agrees it would have been in Greece's long term best interest. The ex-FM does not say why it was rejected, but I strongly suspect it was due to the realization that the short term pain it would have inflicted on the country would have driven the gov't out of power. Not to say that their chosen path will inflict any less pain overall, it just will be spread out and easily blamed on the same ECB villains.<br><br>One has to ask what sort of leader today could stand in front of his country, promise a future of lower standards and increased hardship and remain in power. It is not a sales pitch that many will buy (readers of this blog being one of the notable exceptions). However wait until folks are freezing in the winter and starving, then this same pitch gets a lot more traction, especially if you can create an "enemy" who can be blamed for all the suffering. <br><br>This political phenomenon is as old as the hills, and sadly still very much in play. The only alternative to it would be for a leader to stumble upon an untapped area of potential growth, and offer that as a solution to the problem. These days however those untapped areas of new wealth and growth are pretty scarce.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c5642256530462704458 title="comment permalink">8/6/15, 1:07 PM</a><br><br>

Why do the feds need to carry out large scale counterinsurgency exercises in civilian areas when every major American military base already has urban combat training facilities, "Combat Towns", as they're called? Particularly when these exercises are in areas when there is a lot of animosity towards the feds and the exercise planners openly labeled the most conservative areas of the country as enemy territory for purposes of their training exercise.

Study has taught me skepticism. Even Bernie, who inspires many I trust, inspires me not. Does he seem better than the others discussed in politics? Sure, so does a gorilla on PCP; if it came down to wet gorilla vs. Bernie I would be quite stumped. I don't vote regardless in such matters. Though not voting, I fear, is voting for disruption. The cynicism of study is right, but the idealists candidates are all that is left when the current consensus breaks.<br><br>The craving for something to believe in is strong, I hope something of some value attaches to it, even if much that is terrible is also likely to be there, avoiding the horrors of 'anywhere but here' may not be possible, but finding some boons to incorporate may still be possible. Something good could be saved.<br><br>I look around me and see the remains of many positive visions for the world that I have tried to enact. The one thing that remains in the bitter lose of many visions and ambitions is an understanding that the human being does not die of mere failure. I am a failure, and I think it is the most powerful thing in my life, so much has failed, and yet I endure. I can glean from fields what I need, and hide from what weathers threaten. Companionship is the only want that hurts, hunger and discomfort are petty. My life becomes empty of purpose, but this in an great freedom, I have room for a positive vision, even though at the moment the visions that have tried to fill that space have died. The fear of failure is the greatest violence done by our education system. May failure make space for positive vision and positive action, for now unborn failures, false starts, and pipe dreams fill the soil where a positive vision might grow.<br><br>Seeds of positive vision are good now. Look, little is needed to be happy, little to thrive. Bankruptcy cannot take the structures, and humans survive with out utilities. Food is important, but it is simple to learn, and our suburban system can become garden space as quickly as there is motivation. My garden veggies rot, they are too much bother to harvest when all others want to eat at restaurants, if food were rare or valued many times more food could be grown over course of a couple seasons. Positive visions are needed to make humans harmonious, too much now the madness of unborn failures obscure space for this. We need healthy, vital, abundant seeds for how and why to work together. Seeds of discord are many fold and will always grow where better seeds do not germinate and shade them.<br><br>I feel so lost, because my seeds of hope keep dying, and I am sad. But, I know to keep planting and playing, still I am worried because in my blood I can feel the urge for change, and knowing how study tames my blood is by comparison I can conceive how hot the blood of those around me might be getting. Nastiness is getting close it feels like, I have hedged my position as best I can, I await nature's judgment.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c8132722569199738595 title="comment permalink">8/6/15, 4:44 PM</a><br><br>

Of course not. <br><br>Spanish Fly, it's the same on this side of the water; the left spends three years out of every four denouncing the Democrats, then falls meekly in line behind the Dem candidate because the scary Republicans are so much worse.

We tend to hear the voices of dissent, as feckless and impotent as they might be today, while missing the steady stream of people exiting the system. And I don't mean those 'failing first' ahead of the rush. Is it possible the solution will look unlike anything we're imagining? That certain problems, like our political system, may be transcended or made irrelevant or outgrown (to use a somewhat loaded phrase, though I mean it figuratively)?<br><br>It might be easy to dismiss voices like <a href=http://breakingsmart.com/season-1/ rel=nofollow>this</a> or <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Choose-Yourself-James-Altucher-ebook/dp/B00CO8D3G4 rel=nofollow>this</a> as simply the deluded hopes of those still married to the cult of technology, but it seems to me that there's a significant amount of thought behind them in terms of the way the <i>process</i> of finding solutions is changing and while it might just look like a bunch of people tinkering with software and developing useless iPhone 'apps', I think if we label it as such, perhaps we miss the much more significant philosophy and trends that are driving them. I think people like these would also agree that "the center cannot hold," but their response is much different.<br><br>While I am inclined to agree that their is a certain cyclical pulse to history, do you think that the increasingly networked nature of our current world changes any of the assumptions that might lead one to conclude that the decline of America is analogous to the decline of the Roman Empire?<br><br>I do not have an uncritical faith in technology but I do wonder if there's more to do be done than "weeping for our grandchildren" as one commenter said. While I think one owes it to themselves to take a realistic and critical view of the world, when I look I do see localized areas of real vitality even as the foundation of the status quo seems quite unstable. I see it even, and maybe especially, in America. Even as the dysfunction of Washington takes center stage, perhaps the real center of America has shifted or is shifting. I guess all I'm saying is that individuals should be encouraged to try lots of things, embracing change and uncertainty, and failing frequently. Some of the probably involves new technology, and I don't think that's a bad thing. <br><br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c4865592627989348312 title="comment permalink">8/6/15, 6:55 PM</a><br><br>

Not so; faith in progress consists of a belief that (a) improvement is inevitable and (b) that improvement consists of continuing to go along the same course we're already on. It's perfectly possible to reject the myth of progress and still say, "Here's a situation that can be made better, given commitment and hard work."

What gives the SNP their advantage is that they're saying "Things will be different" -- at this point they don't even have to show that things will be better, just that something will finally change.

Obamacare, similarly, improved access to medical care for some Americans and worsened it for many others. I agree, as repeatedly noted in this blog, that local elections are well worth voting in, since there it's sometimes possible for citizens to have some influence on political decisions, but cherrypicking recent history to obscure the basic identity between both party's actual policies simply helps feed the problem I'm trying to address. <br><br>Troy, true enough. I don't know if Trump will be our Halliot, but those who dismiss him as a clown forget that the same label was applied to Hitler, Mussolini, et al. <br><br>Jonathan, well, that's why I specified the American left, of course. <br><br>Ursachi, granted. One of the things about regime change is that it falls flat when there aren't genuine grievances to exploit -- which is again, one of the reasons why I expect a serious attempt at regime change, with Russian and/or Chinese funding, in the US in the not too distant future. <br><br>Escape, my take is that the only reason the Republicans are pillorying the agreement with Iran is that it's Obama's agreement -- just as the Dems pilloried Dubya for drone strikes and then fell completely silent when it was Obama's turn to vaporize wedding parties. If the US went to war against Iran, we'd end up with carriers at the bottom of the Persian Gulf, and the prompt implosion of US power globally would follow in short order. <br><br>Mister R., no argument there. <br><br>William, my bet's on an irrational discussion, probably carried out using bullets and roadside bombs. That's not the outcome I'd prefer, but it's the one to which all sides seem to be hurrying as fast as they can. <br><br>Kathleen, I hope so. <i>Rolling Stone</i> has been pretty much a party-line Democrat rag for a long time. <br><br>Dammerung, exactly -- and the more the media mocks him, the more Americans will support him.

In fact, I'll bet $100 that they're the ones on the ballot, to an autographed copy of one of your books - your choice - if they're not. <br><br>The thing that most Americans don't know about American political parties is that the two-party system we have now is not a fair system, and it never has been, because the Democratic and Republican parties are private associations. There's actually Supreme Court jurisprudence on this exact issue: 530 US 567 (2000) [http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/530/567.html] This means, simply, that they may change the rules, refuse to seat delegates or entire delegations, replace delegates, and so on and so forth, to arrive at the candidates who have been chosen by the people who *really* control the parties. A friend, who had reason to know, told me that George Bush and Dick Cheney would be the Republican nominees in the 2000 election - in 1997. Bush's people had bought the nomination and that was that. The same goes with Jeb and Hillary.<br><br>If Sanders tries to make a fight of it - or if his supporters do - he or they will get the Ron Paul treatment. But I figure he'll fold his campaign in April 2016, in time to spoil any third party run, as he's done in Vermont in the past. Trump, and the rest of the Klown Kar Krew, will fold their campaigns just like Sanders, except that Trump may run as an independent, in a Ross Perot-style move, for the same reason that Perot ran against Jeb's father - to split the vote and deny him the Presidency.<br><br>As far as preserving the status quo goes, Clinton is the best candidate; there won't be the massive demonstrations and hellraising by the Left and "Progressives" as existed up until 2008, which ended abruptly with the election of Obama. And it won't be troops that fight against any budding insurgency, it'll be police and sheriffs. who'll do that job.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c1672175189627162095 title="comment permalink">8/7/15, 3:34 AM</a><br><br>

I ask out of interest as that description may change peoples perceptions? Dunno what do you reckon?<br><br>Also the other thing that springs to mind is that in my previous comment a person could easily swap magic for fossil fuels in that context and get the same outcome. In an era of decline the future battles will be won on the basis of the power that can deploy the lowest cost per kill basis (think drones versus IEDs). Am I reading too much Conan Chronicles recently? My goodness, but I am enjoying that tale and wow, does the author know his strategy or what?<br><br>Just on another completely different issue - and that it is how life goes sometimes with a bit of timely digression (!) - I've always had this kooky half formed idea that there is only so much finite life energy on the planet and as humans multiply a strange sort of balance sets in and other life forms get displaced. Anyway, as other life forms get displaced, the available finite energy gets reduced (it is not a fixed point, by any means). Anyway, it is all a bit kooky and half formed ideas, but I started thinking about that recently again because there has been a surprising increase in the number of shark attacks.<br><br>Now in and of of itself, shark attacks are not unusual, but the sheer increase makes me wonder whether there are greater changes going on in the food supply in the worlds oceans? Dunno, but certainly it does mean something and sharks are massively adaptable and have been around for a whole lot longer than us (we're food to them).

About the Tiny Farm. I also wondered a bit about water, until two things came to mind. First was a blog by a scientific type who lives in California. He mentioned that in the middle of a drought they've had flash flooding, and that the actual variation in recent annual rainfall is within the usual limits; so I expect there will be enough water to sustain enough market gardening to tickle the palettes of the jaded rich, to sustain a few intensive cultivators for another generation at least.Secondly, serving the needs of the rich and powerful is a good survival strategy, at least for those who can manage it; far better than sitting on a heap of baked beans and shooting at government agents, or joining a mob howling empty slogans.As long as there's enough water to sustain a population that supports a ruling class, the rulers will ensure that priority in allocation of resources goes to those who serve their safety and comfort. <br><br>Regarding lumber and other things not home made. I hope the Archdruid can confirm that a complete collapse of society is not to be expected imminently. Division of labour and a market economy can be expected to continue, particularly around those who have wealth and power. I understand that there is a substantial timber industry just to the north of California, so it is reasonable to suppose that its products will continue to be available there. Similarly, other items not produced locally will be traded, probably in less variety, perhaps for vegetables. Division of labour, comparative advantage and the invisible hand of the market will continue to operate, as in Adam Smith's time, below the level of financial, bureaucratic and political scams. It won't be necessary to go Neolithic in order to survive, (and even then they had trade and specialisation.)<br><br>Its nice to see useful ideas escape from what the general public may regard as a Hippie Reservation. As in the Parable of the Sower, they,like windblown seeds , may be productive in unexpected places.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c9011970297834193475 title="comment permalink">8/7/15, 5:56 AM</a><br><br>

In this case, <i>of course</i> JFK was murdered by an isolated, secretive group with a political agenda, as were JFK and MLK before him as well. For all the reasons you listed, he and they were all genuine threats to the entire American political system, and killing them was given only a little more thought than assassination of foreign leaders and revolutionaries like Che Guevara, which had been (and is still) routinely carried out without a second thought. Bring any of this up to any otherwise smart and articulate American citizen and just wait for the two word utterance signifying the end of their rational thinking process. Oh, you're a <i>conspiracy theorist</i>, eh? <br><br>The rehabilitation of that word in mainstream discourse - as unlikely as that seems to ever happen - would signal, to my mind at least, the willingness of Americans to truly consider the many currently "unthinkable" abominations that have been and continue to be carried out in their name. Until then, rational discourse will be limited to fringe internet comment boards like this and a handful of others. Or, as the old saying goes, "it's not paranoia if they're actually out to get you."

I quickly dismissed the notion that the owner of the vehicle was proudly proclaiming their communist leanings to the western world as the vehicle the plate was attached to was a quite pricey BMW SUV. I suppose the BMW driver in question was reaching out to other similarly oppressed, conservative Republicans in the area. The plate could have been referring to something else, I guess (redhead, rosacea sufferer), but I had to chuckle at it as I had just finished reading this blogpost on the political landscape a little beforehand.<br><br>At work, I have many conservative customers from both sides of the aisle and these days, to a person, they all believe that they are part of a beleaguered minority. Their way of life, "The Culture of Contentment" entitled, is under assault and while both sides would never agree with each other about quite literally anything, they are identical in their beliefs of being betrayed and persecuted by what's unfolding in the world around them. They wouldn't express it this way because they all see a malevolent hand in their decreasing circumstances. None of them see their own part of privilege and consumption in the unfolding tragedy, and not one of them understands that the inputs to keep endless expansion going, to prop up their retirement portfolios, are just not there. The message that the world needs right now from its leaders is not a message that can be sold to these people. <br><br>Did the left abandon its constituency or did they just realize that no one would follow? Living small is a loss in status to someone to whom status matters. Living with less than you can afford while the other side gorges, going back to the land to manually toil are tough ideas to sell. Nothing that can be put in a soundbite, except maybe, "Collapse Now and Avoid the Rush!"

(Of course joined in this by others.) I almost feel, without succumbing to full blown conspiracy paranoia, that "the circus" of Republican candidates is a distraction from what is happening elsewhere. "The circus" is literally that, a show.<br><br>Though both parties are to blame for the mess we're in, and the Democrats have their own oligarchs, the Republican party seems hollowed out, a shell for the Koch brothers and their organizations to exploit for their own purposes. When talking about the Republican base, you are talking about a Koch-brother funded Tea Party and Heritage Action Center among other organizations that push Republican candidates and legislators from the right. The Republicans pay them to use their data collection organization, so much more sophisticated than the Republicans' own. Republican candidates must pass muster with them. They, and their various non-profits and think tanks are past masters at disinformation (Google Koch brothers, the Heartland Institute and climate change denial) and promote legislation and politicians who are in favor of what they call "freedom," which is actually freedom for them to make profits, no matter the effect on people or planet. <br><br>Now they are starting to court the media more overtly and claim they are standing up for the rights of poor people (while storing toxic petcoke in poor neighborhoods such as the Calumet area of Chicago). All of this is right out in plain sight, a matter of public record. Anyone thinking about fascism should pay very close attention. The Kochs appear to be positioning themselves as the heads of a "savior party" when/if the Republican party crumbles or some kind of catastrophe occurs.<br><br>That's the one interesting thing about Trump's otherwise rather silly candidacy: he publicly refuses to jump to their whistle. He doesn't need them. And he's hired away some of their staffers. Perhaps that is one reason why he is more popular in the polls.

I think that the invention of TV, and the suburban sprawl, both after WW2, plays a big role. How does a left party reach the masses? No one goes out to parks, so soapbox speeches are out. Going door to door is difficult, when the doors are so far apart. TV not only supplies endless entertainment and propaganda, but makes lectures and organizing unappealing. Why go out and listen to someone drone on about a better society, when you can watch explosions on TV?

We have finished making the kitchen more suitable for people who cook from scratch and also process and preserve food (good, naturally-lit work area, no gimmicks or extra appliances). We are now literally downsizing the house by removing an unusable sunporch that leaks heat all winter long. We'll then insulate before adding siding to the new exterior wall. This should make a huge difference, energy-wise.<br><br>To the point: We've lived in the house almost thirty years and, as people do, deposited stuff in the sunporch--which now must be assessed and disposed of. Among the stuff were two boxes of books unopened since the late 1980's.

This culminates in getting nominated. Considering the political favors performed for these "Party regulars" by the Clintons, they have an advantage. Phase two is the general election, where the relatively extreme statements made to rouse the "regulars" is moderated to pander to the electorate. By the way, any threat of a third party run is absurd. The election laws are written in such a way as the make it impossible (just ask Anderson) <br><br>The second major factor is a money equation of present US politics - generous campaign contributions &gt; financial deregulation and favorable legislation &gt; generous campaign contributions (and you can add in the "revolving door").<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c8777239918180443452 title="comment permalink">8/7/15, 11:05 AM</a><br><br>

Both first of all adhere to the imperative of growth as an all purpose cure for all maladies. The Democrats will insist growth does not conflict with the environment. You can bet this is one question that will not be seriously debated in this campaign. Neither will population. Climate change will be but mainly how we can apply technology to it. Globalization will continue to looked upon as the tide to raise all boats. Capitalism, the same. Technological advancements will help us to plug renewables into the infrastructure coal and oil built. And natural gas will continue to be cited as the bridge fuel. <br><br>But, no where or no how, will either party offer us a vision of exactly what a sustainable future would actually look like other than a slightly modified facsimile of what we already have. Or how we could divert scarce resources sufficiently away from our need to keep the wheels on this unsustainable leviathan to build a real sustainable infrastructure and economic system. Or how we could feed a growing world population and sustain it on the down slope of peak oil with an industrial mode of agriculture, food processing, and distribution growing more dependent on finite resources each day. Or how a ponzi system of capitalism -- you too can become rich by humping in the hierarchy for the rich -- can maintain faith among its followers who may grow to realize that their efforts are not only not making them rich but are doing so at great ecological and environmental harm to the planet and future generations. <br><br>So, it comes down to this -- our political system has become a technopoly. Our choices, our decisions are being handed to us by default, by what the machine needs to keep its wheels on and to keep the economy that makes the machine healthy. And by all the glitter and shine that cyberspace can encompass globally to maintain the faith in the technology and the manufacture of a human face of happy unity in it. All of the alternatives are cast out as being far too radical, a bridge way too far to cross. That the machine and not the earth is our salvation. So, we get CAFE standards and not a serious consideration that we might really need to re wild half the planet.

Cobbling together a living from various part time jobs, always looking for jobs, always worrying about right now does not leave time to read, reflect, to get a big picture of the world. I run into people all the time who are very aware of what's happening to them but cannot connect the dots to the trajectory we are on and keep thinking if they just work a little harder everything will be OK. They cannot see the futility of working harder in a purely exploitative economy. Being crushed by the system does not always spawn revolt, in this case it makes people politicaly stupid. The lack of outrage by people who work for a living, or at least muted outrage, to the TPP, a plan for the removal of every last obstacle to exploiting everything and everyone, is an example. <br>Today, with all the electronic distractions, once people have become economically disenfranchised the process seems to perpetuate itself. <br>The very concept of "middle class" is amorphous. It used to mean working one job, 40 hours a week, and living well, not with endless extravagance but with essential needs secure. Now "middle class" includes households where everyone permanently works multiple jobs and live on the edge of financial disaster. In the same way the concept of "left" and "right" have both shifted to promote corporate hegemony, the concept of middle class has shifted to include what we used to consider poor. Of course, there is a certain embarrassment to being poor in a country where the mythology says anyone can make it, so it makes sense for people to think of themselves as middle class.<br>I've been reading "Savage Continent," about the chaos in Europe in the years immediately after WW 2. I was struck by the terrible, calculated way that the Germans and Soviets each treated their POWs. Of course, hatred and retribution were involved, but it was also very practical. Starved, exhausted, dehydrated and sick prisoners were too beaten down to be much trouble to anyone. I know it would be extreme hyperbole to compare this horror to the plight of our working class, but the principle is the same: beat them down into numb obedience and they won't be any trouble to the ruling class.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c9172842954365938529 title="comment permalink">8/7/15, 12:50 PM</a><br><br>

I'm curious, though, what alternative you think the left should be offering that mainstream people would actually buy into? I saw through Obama in his first campaign, but he rallied the people by offering Hope. There is nothing "hopeful" about telling people to ride a bike ten miles each way in the rain to work, even though it wont even make a difference in the end.<br><br>An anecdote that I think is revealing...Last week I was invited to a Neopagan Lamas ritual (First Harvest) hosted by the pagan circle of a local Unitarian Universalist church. So, a very progressive group of people. The subject of gardening came up and, out of eight or ten people four of us have vegetable gardens. I don't have one this year because I fumbled my chance to plant seeds indoors and couldn't afford potted plants from the garden store. One of women confessed her guilt over not planting a garden this year because she realized she hates gardening. Another woman said "the truth is I plant a garden because my family has had one since I was a girl and I like the vegetables but I really don't like gardening, either." My procrastination last Spring might spring from the same ambivalence. Even among those disposed to embrace a sustainable lifestyle, the truth is that it is *not* always (or even usually) pleasant. Unless one's commitment to philosophy is like so many vegans who don't care how bad food tastes as long as it is "healthy." Seems to me it is utterly impossible to pry people away from their air conditioned TV room when they aren't even ambivalent about their distaste for the subject. Honestly, was there ever a time when that wasn't true? The Hippie communes in the 70s didn't fail by accident.<br><br>Changing the subject, since you didn't mention it you may not know...The Clinton's have become quite good friends with the Bushes. To the extent that George called Bill his "brother from another mother" and they have become a popular double act on the feedbag lecture circuit that pays has-been politicians ridiculous amounts of money to show up. That just adds a whole other disturbing depth to the interchangeability of Hillary and Jeb. Interestingly, so far Jeb is the one distancing himself from that (not so) odd couple relationship but it's going to bite Hillary sooner or later.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c5557266680506554339 title="comment permalink">8/7/15, 3:52 PM</a><br><br>

I certainly wouldn't claim that the US electoral system is fair in any sense; vote fraud and other means of rigging elections are as American as apple pie, to say nothing of the broader nexus of corruption and institutional power that frames the whole process. My point is simply that the system is set up to pick, from among the available stooges, one who has (or can fake) enough popular support to be a viable figurehead -- and neither Clinton nor Bush can do that. My working guess is that Clinton's campaign will peak this year and go down in the early primaries, possibly due to Sanders, and that Bush will never get past also-ran status. Who will take the nominations? Hard to say at this point; Biden or O'Malley could easily pick up the frontrunner spot once Clinton implodes, while the GOP field is much more wide open; Trump, Rubio, or Kasich are likely, but the GOP could go for someone from the Tea Party fringe if they decide that losing the election is a better fundraising move than winning it. <br><br>Cherokee, the US political class gets described as an aristocracy from time to time, but it's purely rhetorical -- our political class is a collection of cheap whores, not a nobility in any imaginable sense. As for Conan, there is no such thing as reading too many Conan stories!<br><br>Raven, I wonder how much of that is being spread by Corbyn's rivals...<br><br>Martin, the military in the US is fully integrated into the structure of political and economic power in this country -- look at the way that US military officials have been defending the F-35 fighter program in the teeth of all the evidence that it's a useless dog of a plane. If a coup took place they'd be among those up against the wall, and they know it. <br><br>Daergi, that's a useful data point -- that "both sides of the aisle" now see themselves as a beleaguered minority. They're right, too -- and that means that we're just waiting for the first demagogue who has the wits to figure out how to appeal to the majority. <br><br>Adrian, exactly. Trump is demonstrating that there's life outside the suffocating narrowness of the current political system, and people are flocking to him. Whether it's him, or some more talented and ruthless demagogue, somebody's going to do an end run around the failed consensus, and away we go. <br><br>Wagelaborer, no, Obamacare hasn't been mentioned on this blog as a good thing. It's one more lavish and hopelessly corrupt subsidy for the medical, pharmaceutical, and insurance industries pretending to be a health care program, and I've said so since it was first proposed. <br><br>Adrian, I know the feeling. I have a shelf of those books near the desk where I write my weekly posts. Which William Morris novel, btw? That's an almost unheard-of taste these days. <br><br>Changeling, well, we'll see. <br><br>N Montesano, no question, those are a better use of your time. This blog is mostly for those who haven't gotten there yet. <br><br>Pygmycory, that means that Canada's gotten to the point the US reached around 1980, when it finally sank in to the middle class that the only way they could secure their privileges was to throw the poor and the working class under the bus,and the politicians are responding accordingly.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c6771298428588920570 title="comment permalink">8/7/15, 4:35 PM</a><br><br>

Since data is widely available - the next (!) economic revolution is even called Big Data - it is easy for one to drown in numbers, and forget to interpret them... at least, forget the inconvenient bits, or manipulate the numbers. The reliance on numbers instead of litteral discourse might suffer from what I'd call "the illusion of derivation".<br><br>The mathematical tool of derivation, and all of calculus, that is, quantify and calculate not just the measurements you have at hand but also their rate of change, has made physics into the discipline it is today, and is the bread and butter of mathematicians as much as of staticians.<br>But when statisticians deal too much with derivated metrics, they can easily lose track of the base metric itself.<br>For example, having zero-growth is labelled with such deprecative expletives as "stagnation, marasm" while it actually means that businesses are working as much as usual, instead of collapsing. Is it not good enough to have no particular disaster to deal with ? of course not, since it means that the derivation of GDP is then quantified as zero, nil, nada... and nothing IS bad. Even if we had constant economic growth, it could be bad, since the derivation of growth (itself the derivation of GDP) is zero ! This is what happened this spring, when everyone was worrying about China because its rate of economic growth was decreasing... but hey, its economy was still growing by 7 percent !<br><br>Maybe a possible answer as to why derivating metrics has taken such importance to nowadays' economic discourse is, metrics that derivate into positive numbers are good to fuel speculation and economic bubbles. And speculation along with its offshoot, bubbles, are a convenient way to concentrate actual wealth into a few hands at the expense of everybody else, using abstract (imaginary ?) wealth (using labelled "financial").<br>But eventually this illusion of derivation loses track of the value of the base metric you started with.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c4220711259943922023 title="comment permalink">8/7/15, 4:50 PM</a><br><br>

Does that mean the US employment rate is anywhere near a stisfying level (zero) ? Erm...<br>Notice that the illusion of derivation plays out of the mathematical tool itself. Since derivation is, by definition, the rate of change at a given moment, you can use it at any moment you like when that rate happens to have taken a value that fits you. This is where a drawing is worth a thousand words, and curves can show you the actual history of US unemployment numbers :<br>http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000<br>View it from 1948 to 2015, and you will see that the unemployment rates have only lowered now to their lowest level between 1984 and 1990 (after the last Oil Shock, before the Reagan era). But they are still higher than in 2000, and in 2008. In terms of unemployment, the USA never quite recovered from the dot-com bubble 15 years ago, whereas it took less than 10 years to recover from either the 2nd and the 3rd oil shocks. It never quite recovered from the first oil shock too...<br>When the derivation of a metrics does not suit you, you can always pick up another metric that conveys the opposite message. This is why the fantasy of perpetual growth is still seen as the norm, because in spite of so many other indicators derivating inappropriately, economics has been able to juxtaposate to them an indicator crafted to have an always positive derivated quantity (GDP, and its derivated quantity, growth).<br><br>In this respect, the 2008 recession was the hallmark of all crises since the last World War, because annual GDP was no longer able to derivate into a honest, positive value, and even had the bad taste of going negative for two years in a row, which hadn't happened for the last 30 years. Between 1980 and 2008, so 29 years in total, annual GDP growth was negative on only 4 years (out of 29), and for absolute values of less than 2 percent. 2009 marked a break from that convenient habit...<br>Ref. http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?page=6<br><br><br>And now, if someone could explain to me why I keep spotting red numbers lately, and the following style of headline :<br>"Wall St. drops as jobs report augurs for September rate hike"<br>because the way I understand it, is : okay, the job data is encouraging, so the Fed might increase their interest rate on US treasury bonds, and that will be bad for financial speculation, so it is very bad for us...<br>In other words, having Main Street ease a little would cause Wall Street to unease a lot ? If the Fed increases interest rates, will that be bad for Wall Street or for Main Street ? Either way, it will spell trouble on your side of the pond, and on mine as well. Go buy those pitchforks while the store still has them for cheap...<br><br>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/06/france-russia-mistral-warships-deal-cancelled<br>Ecnarf should have delivered those Mistral to Russia after all, and its Left or its Right wings of politicians are about as disenfranchised from its people as in the USA.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c2656654479648137848 title="comment permalink">8/7/15, 4:51 PM</a><br><br>

It was less brutal than I was anticipating. I vacillate between a deep cynicism and a guarded optimism. I suppose my slight sense of optimism lies not so much in particular technological solutions or even technology itself but my and others ability to change directions quickly, to seek creative solutions, and see opportunity in uncertain situations. Intense curiosity is technology agnostic.

And for your replies and wry grin. <br><br>A more basic question: does the concept of left and right for describing the spectrum of political, economic and social leanings have any relevancy to shaping a vision that might get man on to a sustainable course? When all of it is based upon the supremacy of man? A supremacy based upon the handing down of a civilization ordered by a supreme being? With man above all? Destined to fall. <br><br>Something much more fundamental is awry. While we look for some meaning on what left or right may have in store for solutions to our civilizational failings, these meanings fail us because they trap us into the same old thought patterns that got our teats in the wringer to begin with. <br><br>So, how can we escape ourselves and the cosmic prison of human history and culture? To shape a new vision that sees outside of our failed concepts of left and right or the perversions that have absconded with such labels? <br><br>I think the vision has to come from earth. For man to place himself second. To change the paradigm from big man/small earth to big earth/small man. Does man have it in him to humble himself before earth's spirits? To seek a covenant that gets man beyond and outside of himself? Down here. Equal to all? <br><br>We need a basic course in Earth 1.0. Numero uno. Earth first, not as a leftist radical cry, but as the working principle for living on earth. But, of course, such calls get me pilloried and quartered by the forward stampede, labeled as inconsequentially too far left. A danger to progress. Out there. Voice in the wilderness. Unthinkable. And of course it is. A burden to bare as an outcast, knowing of our fall.

This experiment showed it could be done without all that much lumber.<br><br>As asides, they discussed competing theories for the decline of the Rapa Nui. One was that Asian rats were introduced, bred quickly with no natural enemies, and devoured the seeds and seedlings of the palms. Another was that the Rapa Nui killed the birds whose feces nourished the palms. Another was that Europeans introduced diseases like cholera - as they did elsewhere. Another was that Europeans - who referred to all non-Christians as cannibals - took away Rapa Nui as slaves. <br><br>I'm thinking the Rapa Nui had a leader with a bad hairpiece, built moai with topknots to honor him and it all went downhill from there.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c6595108275854713000 title="comment permalink">8/8/15, 6:19 AM</a><br><br>

The left has been systematically purged from the conversation. Eugene Debs was tossed into the joint under the Espionage Act, FDR saved capitalism from itself with the New Deal (and of course the massive Keynsian pump priming of WWII) and of course McCarthy was the nail in the coffin of any Social Democratic movement.

It's not a "conspiracy theory" because the Kochs are doing it in broad daylight.<br><br>Second, to doomerdoc, unless the next war the US loses is as devastating to our nation as WWI was to Germany, I think our rising fascist leader is more likely to resemble Mussolini than Hitler. Mussolini seized power and ruled by promising to restore the glories of the Roman Empire. Hitler rose and ruled by blaming the Jews for everything. Mussolini gets no attention in American war movies or other popular culture, so we don't think much about him, but we did get a reminder from Martin.<br><br>Third to das monde, I would describe the Republican primary field in the last Presidential election as a bunch of clowns, but the current field as a bunch of demagogues. More than half of them have had or currently have serious political careers as Senators or governors of medium sized states. Since we trying to be nonpartisan, I'll call the Democratic field a bunch of hacks.<br><br>Kudos to Martin for pointing out that Lincoln and FDR violated their first term campaign promises. <br><br>I agree with the analyses of wagelaborer and some others about reasons why the American Left has not recovered its ability to organize the masses. I also agree with JMG that the Left's fundamental problem is the absence of any vision of the future to work toward, since dictatorship of the proletariat and bigger slices of an expanding pie are off the table.<br><br>Finally, I agree with JMG and others that being active in local communities where politics is retail is not a waste of time. If something resembling representational government continues in our fair nation, it's also the best place to acquire skills and allies for larger scale politics. If it doesn't, being politically active will either mark one out for liquidation or as someone to be courted as a supporter of the new regime.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c6726054370027107136 title="comment permalink">8/8/15, 2:53 PM</a><br><br>

He suggested the way forward was to accept limits. To stop worshiping self indulgence and consumption and in the context of the speech to conserve energy It was called his malaise speech and right after the speech his approval rating rose. Then came the opeds and the media din that soon turned most everyone against everything he had said. Carter was actually a conservative and an evangelical Christian and yet he was and is despised by conservatives. Soon we elected Reagan who doubled down on every possible thing that would break the culture of consumption and American exceptionalism. <br><br>Point being there is no possible winning political message that deviates from the norm. Note that I said his approval rating rose right after the speech, then the bottom dropped out. That was because all the vested interests who run big media lead people by the nose away from any stinking limits. It isn't that a good plurality of people at least are ready for change.

What to do? What to do? Continue to feature the freak show for those precious ratings? or follow the overlords' script in pushing the next puppet of choice, (Just-Jeb-exclamation point). I guess in the end, the overlords won as they tend to do. He's ousted from the next round of debates. Freak show over. Who can bother to watch the next ones. The rest of the clowns are dull as dishwater and so obviously flip-flopping and dissembling. Puppets indeed.<br><br>I think you're spot on about Hillary, and sadly about the left abandoning their post. Again, I'm reminded of Adam Clayton's "Century Of The Self", the Mad Men-ish no-holds-barred advertising genie infiltrating the political arena.

Since democracy is a resource that we all directly benefit from in many ways, and many of us (including the entire commentariat of this blog) have well-developed thinking skills, it seems incumbent upon us to help foster thinking skills in others in our local communities. What do you think is the best method for this? Modelling behaviour? Starting book clubs? Leading classes? Gently pointing out logical fallacies? All of the above? This blog strikes me as an excellent example of a forum which encourages the nuts and bolts of thinking and I offer a heartfelt thanks for the efforts you've put in.<br><br>My experience with leading plant walks indicates to me that many people are hungry for hands on knowledge. I'm not sure how much this enthusiasm extends into the more esoteric realms you outline in your 2012 democracy posts and I struggle to imagine the most effective form this education would take. Do you have any suggestions for people who want to encourage thoughtfulness in their communities in order to strengthen democracy? How do we as lone individuals and families pick up the slack of the public educational system, and teach citizens the inner skills vital to democracy?<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c3171139845721552978 title="comment permalink">8/8/15, 5:51 PM</a><br><br>

People have been offering reports of systems breaking down and services that formerly worked well falling to pieces. I would like to report on systems that seem to be working about as well as they used to under stress. My intent is just to share the information, not to imply that it disproves anything. If we only post about stuff that isn't working right, it may lead to confirmation bias. <br><br>Every summer and fall, large sections of California forests and grasslands go up in flames. Some years are worse than others. It barely rains from June to November. The native bunch grasses which are adapted to summer dry spells have been largely overrun by European annual grasses which dry out as soon as the spring rain stops. The indigenous inhabitants of California set small fires to keep the woodland understory open and provide browse for deer, but the white man suppresses the smaller fires and fuel builds up; any lightning strike or human spark can set it off.<br><br>For decades fire season has brought containment campaigns of near military proportions. A big one currently underway is at the Rocky fire in Lake County, which is northern California hill country. It's going pretty well. Standing mutual aid agreements have drawn equipment and personnel from suburban and rural fire districts all over the northern half of the state. They are working together and the fire is 62 percent contained. One fire fighter was killed.<br><br>The local population, which includes a lot of retired people and summer visitors, received evacuation orders far enough in advance that they were able to evacuate not only themselves but most of their animals. It appears they all had private transportation. Many have stayed with family or friends or in Red Cross temporary shelters. One town of more than four hundred people evacuated en masse to a Moose Lodge.<br><br>Last week, the San Francisco Chronicle sent a reporter to the Moose Lodge for a feature story. The parking lot was full of RVs and tents. The inside of the lodge was full of cots. An unnamed donor was providing three meals a day. The atmosphere was convivial. One ninety year old WWII vet was enjoying telling his war stories to people who hadn't heard them yet. Several people interviewed expressed gratitude for escaping with their lives and resignation about what they might find when they went home. The evacuation orders have just been lifted, so now they know. <br><br>The same section of the paper had a story quoting someone in the state Department of Forestry who provided the bigger picture. He said that the fire season is a month longer than it was in the 1970s and the fires more frequent. Fire control used to be less than half of the department's budget. Now it's eating up more than half. Year after year, less money is available to spend on conservation, fuel reduction and other activities that reduce fire danger. He wants the Legislature to appropriate more money for those programs.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c737762795291892695 title="comment permalink">8/9/15, 3:25 PM</a><br><br>

During a brief colloquy between Republican frontrunner Donald Trump and Fox moderator Brett Baier, the pugnacious casino magnate revealed the appalling truth about the American political system, that the big money guys like Trump own the whole crooked contraption lock, stock, and barrel, and that, the nation's fake political leaders do whatever they're told to do. Without question, it was the most illuminating commentary to ever cross the airwaves. Here's the entire exchange direct from the transcript:<br><br> FOX News Brett Baier (talking to Trump): Now, 15 years ago, you called yourself a liberal on health care. You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system. Why were you for that then and why aren't you for it now?<br><br> TRUMP: As far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you're talking about here.<br><br> What I'd like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state. I have a big company with thousands and thousands of employees. And if I'm negotiating in New York or in New Jersey or in California, I have like one bidder. Nobody can bid.<br><br> You know why?<br><br> Because the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians, of course, with the exception of the politicians on this stage. (uneasy laughter) But they have total control of the politicians. They're making a fortune.<br><br> Get rid of the artificial lines and you will have...yourself great plans...<br><br> BAIER: Mr. Trump, it's not just your past support for single-payer health care. You've also supported a host of other liberal policies....You've also donated to several Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton included, and Nancy Pelosi. You explained away those donations saying you did that to get business-related favors. And you said recently, quote, "When you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do."<br><br> TRUMP: You'd better believe it.<br><br> BAIER: — they do?<br><br> TRUMP: If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand, a lot of money.<br><br> TRUMP: I will tell you that our system is broken. I gave to many people, before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And do you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me. And that's a broken system.<br><br> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did you get from Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi?<br><br> TRUMP: Well, I'll tell you what, with Hillary Clinton, I said be at my wedding and she came to my wedding. You know why?<br><br> She didn't have a choice because I gave. I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good. I didn't know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world. It was.<br><br> BAIER: Hold on.....We're going to — we're going to move on." <br><br><br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c8978565198333443151 title="comment permalink">8/10/15, 7:50 PM</a><br><br>

Hasn't this leftism always focused on social projects? Lifting all boats, not just the rich? Universal healthcare? Universal affordable education? Large and secure social safety nets? Protection for the old and the poor?<br><br>From the point of view of decline, these seem to be (at best!) ways of making life as pain-free as possible while we coast toward the slow-motion crash and burn of our systems. And at worst, these large-scale wealth-expenditures, in consuming needed resources, hasten and deepen our near-future long period of suffering.<br><br>Put simply, in an era of general contraction, large-scale social projects are doomed to fail, and attempting them, however well-intentioned, will sink needed resources and make our situation worse.<br><br>We here on the Archdruid's comment stream think that the whole extravagant system, with its mammoth structures (even highly valued ones like Britain's NHS) are going to be gone no matter *what* we do. And not in 500 years, but in 50 years.<br><br>If we really believe this, how can support for any form of fiscal/government progressivism survive? How can anyone advocate for welfare or universal healthcare, when any such "advances" are for the moment only?

Not that I've had a huge effect, but at various times I've been a classroom teacher explicitly teaching thinking skills, an advocate, and a liaison between various groups, carrying energy, as it were. And then there's blogging, writing, speaking, and leading workshops, along with hands-on ecosystem work. <b>All, I must emphasize, on a hyper-local level.</b> (For example, I do workshops for my local Quaker Meeting--a few months ago about soil, at the end of this month about climate change, the pope's encyclical and Quaker responses.) A group I'm associated with (though I'm not at all one of the founders or leaders) organizes educational events such as edible garden tours so people can share their knowledge and skills. <br><br>I also have taken part in local government: whenever my municipality announces the need for citizen input on some aspect of planning, I'm there. You'd be surprised at how few citizens show up to these kinds of things, but this is democracy in action. A small group of us have been able to get involved and advocate for better transit planning, adding sustainability and climate-change considerations to our town's comprehensive plan, getting the town to purchase green energy, and other things. <br><br>Through my experiences I have come to believe that the butterfly effect manifests in each person's life and that there's no best way to help solve problems such as nurturing thinking skills or democracy. What you do sends ripples everywhere. It seems that if one can pay attention to and achieve clarity on what one should be doing oneself, openings for further action will occur in the areas one is drawn to and has talent for. Thus, you mention leading plant walks. Keep doing that! Keep studying plants (one of my own favorite areas of study) and get to know other people with similar interests. You never know where that might lead. <br><br>I believe your Jewish tradition has much to offer on the subject of discernment and life work. for me, there is a strong spiritual component in all of this; my spiritual life is infused with love of the living earth and thus my morality, ethics, and the discernment of a right course of action.<br><br>I hope I am not coming off as one of those busy-body, advice-giving, annoying aunts, but your questions strike a resonant chord.<br><br>In the light (as we Quakers say),<br><br>Adrian<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c5593982330226773484 title="comment permalink">8/11/15, 7:06 AM</a><br><br>

It shows what a bunch of nasty, pathological liars many of those politicians are. Rand Paul blurts out "you´re buying politicians", at which Trump goes in for the kill, pointing out that - surprise - Paul himself took money from The Donald! Later, Paul and some others *still* attack Trump for "buying politicians", Trump responding that almost everyone on stage (except Scott Walker, I think) has taken money from him... <br><br>Of course politicians lie and cheat, but this must be one of the first times their lies are so obviously exposed! The fascinating thing is how Rand Paul and the rest doesn´t seem to have any sense of "damage control" (or propriety) - they lie brazenly in front of millions of viewers, despite Trump (who can expose them easily) being literally in the same room?! Sociopathic behavior? Or just sheer desperation? Or do they actually expect Republican voters to continue supporting them? <br><br>Now, *that* would be scary... <br><br>I don´t think Trump is better than the others (I mean, he *admits* buying politicians!), but at least his appearence (and perhaps his future disappearence) will create some much needed commotion, a bit like when Ross Perot´s difficulties inadvertently exposed the undemocratic character of many U.S. elections, Perot (a billionaire!) having serious problems getting on the ballot in many key states. <br><br>Hopefully, this might make some people think.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c8846911961568219946 title="comment permalink">8/11/15, 2:41 PM</a><br><br>

I'll give it a go.<br><br>Why bother fighting for social justice programs in the twilight of decline? <br><br>1) Barring some sudden unforeseen catastrophe, like the Yellowstone Caldera blowing up and destroying most of North America... like tomorrow: We're in the midst of a slower decline, say another 100 years? Many of us will still be struggling down the slope for the rest of our lifetimes. The fabric of our civilization will still mean a lot to our collective lifestyles and abilities to cope or not as we descend, and (again, barring some sudden, sweeping collapse) during and after societal collapse. Rome fell, yet Rome is still a populated city today. It's not like it doesn't matter, because we'll ALL be gone and dead shortly. There will be people left who will carry some of our civilization with them.<br><br>Does it make sense then to throw in the towel now, on the most vulnerable in society? Not to mention the moral implications of such a course of action/inaction.<br><br>2) Again, as a lay-person and an artist, not an economist, I'm hardly the best person to articulate this, but: From all of the economic readings I've seen, organizing a more even playing field, social safety nets, etc… would probably have the opposite effect to the one you are describing. No one is advocating a McMansion and luxuriant middle-class lifestyle for all, just affordable healthcare and 'food security', equal treatment under the law.<br>Allowing the continuation and growth of the rapacious oligarchy; income inequality, civil rights inequality, and the unchecked financial casino to keep spinning will drive the nails into the coffin of the environmental destruction and societal collapse much faster. The more inequality= the more riots, clashes, destruction.<br><br>Without a doubt, most 1st-worlders will have to learn to live with less than they have and expect now whether or not the politicians talk about it or not, whether or not there is any policy for sane decline to a sustainable level, (there won't be). A lot of us are doing it anyway, more and more are personally, individually 'collapsing' to LESS regardless of what society at large does, regardless of whether or not we chose it or were forced into it. Those folks at the bottom of the heap are capable of living with less and have economic survival skills that those living with more don't have.<br> No doubt there will be clashes, riots, death. In this fractal collapse, some 'chunks' of the populace will fall, (a.k.a. die) tragically. Why exacerbate it?<br><br>Kind of like throwing the baby out with the bathwater because the baby would only grow up and die eventually anyway.<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c7685386646847895306 title="comment permalink">8/11/15, 5:33 PM</a><br><br>

The nearest grocery store to my house is about a mile "as the crow flies", but by car it's more like three. By bicycle, I notice some substantial hills. The entire neighborhood of several hundred homes is accessible through just one road, which now includes a full-time surveillance camera. I can avoid the worst of the hills by taking my bike through a wooded lot on a sometimes-muddy trail of less than 100 yards, which connects to other trails and almost to a grocery store. Some of my neighbors have been agitating for years to have a paved trail bypass The Big Hill, so the local government studied the problem, and has recently acquired rights to the land. So, now it's just a matter of building it, right?<br><br>Well, no. One of my neighbors claims that a "criminal element" is just waiting for this hike/bike trail to be built so they can infiltrate the neighborhood. He is so desperately fearful of this that he has taken a petition door-to-door, claiming support from those of us who oppose him (and other bogus arguments), gathering signatures to "Stop the Bike Path!"<br><br>So, now the planning board needs to figure out whether it's the vocal minority that wants it, or that wants it stopped. How do we find evidence that "bicycle access does NOT increase crime"? It's like asking for proof that "eating vegetables does NOT cause baldness". Who would have ever considered the possibility of something so absurd?<br><br><a href=the-suicide-of-american-left.html#c454972911421145123 title="comment permalink">8/11/15, 6:56 PM</a><br><br>

As far as someone speaking one's mind as a criteria to be president, it depends on whether what flies out of one's mind and mouth is worth anything at all. The wild and totally unthinking loyalty his followers have is scary, and sets off red warning lights in my brain.<br> His son Donald, Jr. seems at times to listen to his dad and have a WTF look on his face as if he can't believe what his dad just said, and sometimes has a rather frightened look. Ivanka, his daughter, seems to try to veer his wild rantings into something more rational and practical. His son Eric reminds me of Rolf in The Sound of Music (nodding his head in agreement unconditionally). And Melania impresses me as someone who would have enjoyed giving the "thumbs down to some poor slob in the Roman Coliseum.

Been here since 1988. Been in the area since 1973 when we went "back to the land". We're 80 miles north of Spokane and about 20 miles form the Canadian border. At the moment there are multiple wildfires burning out of control in my vicinity...one 5 minutes away, one 20 minutes...you get the picture. The governor has declared our county a disaster area...except that there are no firefighting resources that can be mobilized...so they are sending the National Guard. You can't volunteer to help because you aren't "trained". These are big fires destroying homes and there are not enough resources to combat them. This is what the future looks like. We will accept prayers, good wishes and whatever magic can be sent our way. If you are curious, go on Facebook and search "Tri County Fire Danger News". Keeping faith for close to 50 years.
