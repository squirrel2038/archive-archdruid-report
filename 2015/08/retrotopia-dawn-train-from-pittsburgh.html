<div class=MsoNormal>
I got to the Pittsburgh station early. It was a shabby remnant of what must once have been one of those grand old stations you see on history vids, nothing but a bleak little waiting room below and a stair rising alongside a long-defunct escalator to the platforms up top. The waiting room had fresh paint on the walls and the vending machines were the sort of thing you’d find anywhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Other than that, the whole place looked as though it had been locked up around the time the last Amtrak trains stopped running and sat there unused for forty years until the border opened up again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The seats were fiberglass, and must have been something like three quarters of a century old. I found one that didn’t look too likely to break when I sat on it, settled down, got out my veepad and checked the schedule for the umpteenth time. The train I would be riding was listed as on time, arrival 5:10 am Pittsburgh station, departure 5:35 am, scheduled arrival in Toledo Central Station 11:12 am. I tapped the veepad again, checked the news. The election was still all over the place—President Barfield’s concession speech, a flurry of op-ed pieces from various talking heads affiliated with the losing parties about how bad Ellen Montrose would be for the country. I snorted, paged on. Other stories competed for attention: updates on the wars in California and the Balkans, bad news about the hemorrhagic-fever epidemic in Latin America, and worse news from Antarctica, where yet another big ice sheet had just popped loose and was drifting north toward the shipping lanes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
While the news scrolled past, other passengers filed into the waiting room a few at a time. I could just make them out past the image field the veepad projected into my visual cortex. Two men and a woman in ordinary bioplastic businesswear came in and sat together, talking earnestly about some investment or other. An elderly couple whose clothes made them look like they came straight out of a history vid sat down close to the stair and sat quietly. A little later, a family of four in clothing that looked even more old-fashioned—Mom had a bonnet on her head, and I swear I’m not making that up—came in with carpetbag luggage, and plopped down not far from me. I wasn’t too happy about that, kids being what they are these days, but these two sat down and, after a little bit of squirming, got out a book each and started reading quietly. I wondered if they’d been drugged. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A little later, another family of four came in, wearing the kind of cheap shabby clothes that might as well have the words “urban poor” stamped all over them, and hauling big plastic bags that looked as though everything they owned was stuffed inside. They looked tense, scared, excited. They sat by themselves in a corner, the parents talking to each other in low voices, the kids watching everything with wide eyes and saying nothing. I wondered about them, shrugged mentally, went back to the news. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d finished the news and was starting through the day’s textmail, when the loudspeaker on the wall cleared its electronic throat with a hiss of static and said, “Train Twenty-One, service to Toledo via Steubenville, Canton and Sandusky, arriving at Platform One. Please have your tickets and passports ready. Train Twenty-One to Toledo, Platform One.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I tapped the veepad to sleep, stuffed it in my pocket, got out of my seat with the others, climbed the stairs to the platform. The sky was just turning gray with the first hint of morning, and the air was cold; the whistle of the train sounded long and lonely in the middle distance. I turned to look. I’d never been on a train before, and most of what I knew about them came from history vids and the research I’d done for this trip. Based on what I’d heard about my destination, I wondered if the locomotive would be a rattletrap antique with a big smokestack pumping coal smoke into the air. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What came around the bend into view wasn’t much like my momentary fantasy, though. It was the sort of locomotive you’d have found on any American railroad around 1950, a big diesel-electric machine with a blunt nose and a single big headlight shining down on the track. It whistled again, and then the roar of the engines rose to drown out everything else. The locomotive roared past the platform, and the only thing that surprised me was the smell of french fries that came rushing past with it. Behind it was a long string of boxcars, and behind those, a baggage car and three passenger cars.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The train slowed to a walking pace and then stopped as the passenger cars came up to the platform. A conductor in a blue uniform and hat swung down from the last car. “Tickets and passports, please,” he said, and I got out my veepad, woke it, activated the flat screen and got both documents on it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Physical passport, please,” the conductor said when he got to me. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

“Sorry.” I fumbled in my pocket, handed it to him. He checked it, smiled, said, “Thank you, Mr. Carr. You probably know this already, but you’ll need a paper ticket for the return trip.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ve got it, thanks.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Great.” He moved on to the family with the plastic bag luggage. The mother said something in a low voice, handed over tickets and something that didn’t look like a passport. “That’s fine,” said the conductor. “You’ll need to have your immigration papers out when we get to the border.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The woman murmured something else, and the conductor went onto the elderly couple, leaving me to wonder about what I’d just heard. Immigration? That implied, first, that these people actually wanted to live in the Lakeland Republic, and second, that they were being allowed in. Neither of those seemed likely to me. I made a note on my veepad to ask about immigration once I got to Toledo, and to compare what they told me to what I could find out once I got back to Philadelphia. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The conductor finished taking tickets and checking passports, and called out, “All aboard!” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I went with the others to the first of the three passenger cars, climbed the stair, turned left. The interior was about what I’d expected, row after row of double seats facing forward, but everything looked clean and bright and there was a lot more leg room than I was used to. I went about halfway up, slung my suitcase in the overhead rack and settled in the window seat. We sat for a while, and then the car jolted once and began to roll forward.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We went through the western end of Pittsburgh first of all, past the big dark empty skyscrapers of the Golden Triangle, and then across the river and into the western suburbs. Those were shantytowns built out of the scraps of old housing developments and strip malls, the sort of thing you find around most cities these days when you don’t find worse, mixed in with old rundown housing developments that probably hadn’t seen a bucket of paint or a new roof since the United States came apart. Then the suburbs ended, and things got uglier. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The country west of Pittsburgh got hit hard during the Second Civil War, I knew, and harder still when the border was closed after Partition. I’d wondered, while planning the trip, how much it had recovered in the three years since the Treaty of Richmond. Looking out of the window as the sky turned gray behind us, I got my answer: not much. There were some corporate farms that showed signs of life, but the small towns the train rolled through were bombed-out shells, and there were uncomfortable stretches where every house and barn I could see was a tumbledown ruin and young trees were rising in what had to have been fields and pastures a few decades back. After a while it was too depressing to keep looking out the window, and I pulled out my veepad again and spent a good long while answering textmails and noting down some questions I’d want to ask in Toledo. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d gotten caught up on mail when the door at the back end of the car slid open. “Ladies and gentlemen,” the conductor said, “we’ll be arriving at the border in about five minutes. You’ll need to have your passports ready, and immigrants should have their papers out as well. Thank you.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We rolled on through a dense stand of trees, and then into open ground. Up ahead, a pair of roads cut straight north and south across country. Until three years ago, there’d been a tall razor-wire fence between them, soldiers patrolling our side, the other side pretty much a complete mystery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The fence was gone now, and there were two buildings for border guards, one on each side of the line. The one on the eastern side was a modern concrete-and-steel item that looked like a skyscraper had stopped there, squatted, and laid an egg. As we got closer to it, I could see the border guards in digital-fleck camo, helmets, and flak vests, standing around with assault rifles. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then we passed over into Lakeland Republic territory, and I got a good look at the building on the other side. It was a pleasant-looking brick structure that could have been a Carnegie-era public library or the old city hall of some midsized town, and the people who came out of the big arched doorways to meet the train as it slowed to a halt didn’t look like soldiers at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The door slid open again, and I turned around. One of the border guards, a middle-aged woman with coffee-colored skin, came into the car. She was wearing a white uniform blouse and blue pants, and the only heat she was carrying was a revolver tucked unobtrusively in a holster at her hip. She had a clipboard with her, and went up the aisle, checking everybody’s passports against a list. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I handed her mine when she reached me. “Mr. Carr,” she said with a broad smile. “We heard you’d be coming through this morning. Welcome to the Lakeland Republic.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Thank you,” I said. She handed me back the passport, and went on to the family with the plastic bag luggage. They handed her a sheaf of papers, and she went through them quickly, signed something halfway through, and then handed them back. “Okay, you’re good,” she said. “Welcome to the Lakeland Republic.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We’re in?” the mother of the family asked, as though she didn’t believe it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You’re in,” the border guard told her. “Legal as legal can be.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Oh my God. Thank you.” She burst into tears, and her husband hugged her and patted her on the back. The border guard gave him a grin and went on to the family in the old-fashioned clothing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I thought about that while the border guard finished checking passports and left the car. Outside, two more guards with a dog finished going along the train, and gave a thumbs up to the conductor. A minute later, the train started rolling again. That’s it? I wondered. No metal detectors, no x-rays, nothing? Either they were very naive or very confident. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We passed the border zone and a screen of trees beyond it, and suddenly the train was rolling through a landscape that couldn’t have been more different from the one on the other side of the line. It was full of farms, but they weren’t the big corporate acreages I was used to. I counted houses and barns as we passed, and guesstimated the farms were one to two hundred acres each; all of them were in mixed crops, not efficient monocropping. The harvest was mostly in, but I’d grown up in farm country and knew what a field looked like after it was put into corn, wheat, cabbages, turnips, industrial hemp, or what have you. Every farm seemed to have all of those and more, not to mention cattle in the pasture, pigs in a pen, a garden and an orchard. I shook my head, baffled. It was a hopelessly inefficient way to run agribusiness, I knew that from my time in business school, and yet the briefing papers I’d read while getting ready for this trip said that the Lakeland Republic exported plenty of agricultural products and imported almost none. I wondered if the train would pass some real farms further in. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We passed more of the little mixed farms, and a couple of little towns that were about as far from being bombed-out shells as you care to imagine. There were homes with lights on and businesses that were pretty obviously getting ready to open for the day. All of them had little brick train stations, though we didn’t stop at any of those—I wondered if they had light rail or something. Watching the farms and towns move past, I thought about the contrast with the landscape on the other side of the border, and winced, then stopped and reminded myself that the farms and towns had to be subsidized. Small towns weren’t any more economically viable than small farms, after all. Was all this some kind of Potemkin village setup, for the purpose of impressing visitors? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The door at the back of the car slid open, and the conductor came in. “Next stop, Steubenville,” he said. “Folks, we’ve got a bunch of people coming on in Steubenville, so please don’t take up any more seats than you have to.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Steubenville had been part of the state of Ohio before Partition, I remembered. The name of the town stirred something else in my memory, though. I couldn’t quite get the recollection to surface, and decided to look it up. I pulled out my veepad, tapped it, and got a dark field and the words: <i>no signal</i>. I tapped it again, got the same thing, opened the connectivity window and found out that the thing wasn’t kidding. There was no metanet signal anywhere within range. I stared at it, wondered how I was going to check the news or keep up with my textmail, and then wondered: how the plut am I going to buy anything, or pay my hotel bill? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The dark field didn’t have any answers. I decided I’d have to sort that out when I got to Toledo; I’d been invited, after all. Maybe they had connectivity in the big cities, or something. The story was that there wasn’t metanet anywhere in the Lakeland Republic, but I had my doubts about that—how can you manage anything this side of a bunch of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>mud huts without net connections? No doubt, I decided, they had some kind of secure net or something. We’d talked about doing something of the same kind back in Philadelphia more than once, just for government use, so the next round of netwars didn’t trash our infrastructure the way the infrastructure of the old union got trashed by the Chinese in ‘21. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, the dark field and those two words upset me more than I wanted to admit. It had been more years than I wanted to think about since I’d been more than a click away from the metanet, and being cut off from it left me feeling adrift. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The sun cleared low clouds behind us, and the train rolled into what I guessed was East Steubenville. I’d expected the kind of suburbs I’d seen on the way out of Pittsburgh, dreary rundown housing interspersed with the shantytowns of the poor. What I saw instead left me shaken. The train passed tree-lined streets full of houses that had bright paint on the walls and shingles on the roofs, little local business districts with shops and restaurants open for business, and a school that didn’t look like a medium-security prison. The one thing that puzzled me was that there were no cars visible, just tracks down some of the streets and once, improbably, an old-fashioned streetcar that paced the train for a while and then veered off in a different direction. Most of the houses seemed to have gardens out back, and the train passed one big empty lot that was divided into garden plots and had signs around it saying “community garden.” I wondered if that meant food was scarce here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A rattle and a bump, and the train was crossing the Ohio River on a big new railroad bridge. Ahead was Steubenville proper. That’s when I remembered the thing that tried to surface earlier:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>there was a battle at Steubenville, a big one, toward the end of the Second Civil War. I remembered details from<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>headlines I’d seen when I was a kid, and a history vid I’d watched a couple of years ago; a Federal army held the Ohio crossings against Alliance forces for most of two months before Anderson punched straight through the West Virginia front and made the whole thing moot. I remembered photos of what Steubenville looked like after the fighting: a blackened landcape of ruins where every wall high enough to hide a soldier behind it had gotten hit by its own personal artillery shell. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That wasn’t what I saw spreading out ahead as the train crossed the Ohio, though. The Steubenville I saw was a pleasant-looking city with a downtown full of three- and four-story buildings, surrounded by neighborhoods of houses, some row houses and some detached. There were streetcars on the west side of the river, too—I spotted two of them as we got close to the shore—and also a few cars, though not many of the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The trees that lined the streets were small enough that you could tell they’d been planted after the fighting was over. Other than that, Steubenville looked like a comfortable, established community.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I stared out the window as the train rolled off the bridge and into Steubenville, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. Back on the other side of the border, and everywhere else I’d been in what used to be the United States, you still saw wreckage from the war years all over the place. Between the debt crisis and the state of the world economy, the money that would have been needed to rebuild or even demolish the ruins was just too hard to come by. Things should have been much worse here, since the Lakeland Republic had been shut out of world credit markets for thirty years after the default of ‘32—but they weren’t worse. They looked considerably better. I reached for my veepad, remembered that I couldn’t get a signal, and frowned. If they couldn’t even afford the infrastructure for the metanet, how the plut could they afford to rebuild their housing stock? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
The cheerful brick buildings of Steubenville’s downtown didn’t offer me any answers. I sat back, frowning, as the train rattled through a switch and rolled into the Steubenville station. “Steubenville,” the conductor called out from the door behind me, and the train began to slow.</div>

Maybe it's only my own Great Lakes jingoism and anti-high tech bias, but I loved it. I like how the main character doesn't know jack about what's going on in Lakeland Republic. It's like going into North Korea, or a secret zone in the USSR. The family who was immigrating to be on the right track, against the expectation of the narrator. The partial recovery of both states is very interesting. Even if the east coast republic sounds a little bit dystopian, the fact that there's even a state standing after the second civil war is impressive enough. I remember reading something about Byzantine history and the author said something to the effect of "they recovered, but life kept getting worse and worse." Lakeland Republic, by contrast, via ditching high technology, and defaulting, seems to have chosen the right policy suite for that situation. It's like when you said it's better to turn around when you're going on the wrong path than to accelerate.<br><br>Thinking further, this brings to mind the thought that but for world politics from 1776 onwards, the US might have been a lot better off as six or so large but completely separate republics. Such an arrangement might have created more cohesive states without timid constantly gridlocked legislatures.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c5451139786591659558 title="comment permalink">8/26/15, 6:15 PM</a><br><br>

I'd question the ability to feed a video image directly into the visual cortex, but that's a nit. I take it the end of the war was about 40 years previous?

Good stuff:<br><br><i>In the case of economics there are no important propositions that cannot be stated in plain language. Qualifications and refinements are numerous and of great technical complexity. These are important for separating the good students from the dolts. But in economics the refinements rarely, if ever, modify the essential and practical point. The writer who seeks to be intelligible needs to be right; he must be challenged if his argument leads to an erroneous conclusion and especially if it leads to the wrong action. But he can safely dismiss the charge that he has made the subject too easy. The truth is not difficult. Complexity and obscurity have professional value—they are the academic equivalents of apprenticeship rules in the building trades. They exclude the outsiders, keep down the competition, preserve the image of a privileged or priestly class. The man who makes things clear is a scab. He is criticized less for his clarity than for his treachery.</i><br><br><a href=http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2015/08/john-kenneth-galbraith-on-writing.html rel=nofollow>http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2015/08/john-kenneth-galbraith-on-writing.html</a><br><br>To be accurate, the Lakeland Republic will need to be quite chilly; it's been about 15-30 degrees below normal year round here in Wisconsin for at least the past 3 years.

I already want this to be a novel. Any chance this will follow a similar trajectory as <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> in moving from a series of posts to a full fledged novel?<br><br>Your timing seems good for me on this one. I felt very bleak this weekend, and at multiple times suffered an intense sadness. This isn't particularly usual for me, but everything began to hit very close to home these last few days. An east wind blew smoke from the endless number of wildfires here into the North Oregon Coast. From the window, in the morning, it simply looked like fairly typical summer fog. But a step outside brought home that it was heavy smoke, the day was hot, and the wind was as well. It was unnerving--when you see haze and wind here on the coast, you generally step outside to cool air and a fine mist. The actual outside sensation was such a contradiction to what it normally is, it left me very unsettled.<br><br>Couple that with the stock market gyrations of the last week, the sense that the imminent financial crunch is picking up steam and heading in to clobber us shortly, and the Trump circus as a far-too-possible example of a rise of fascism in this country (read a few of the articles that have come out the last couple days about why people support him, then compare it to JMGs writings about the risk of fascism here in America) and . . . well, I didn't feel well. The very rough future we face is becoming all too real and present.<br><br>And so, a fictional exercise in a (somewhat?) hopeful vision of the future is what I can use right now.<br><br>That said, I'm very curious to see what the trade offs of Steubenville are. Obviously, they don't have the metanet, but I'd be surprised if you took us through this full narrative, JMG, without throwing some trade offs at your readership that hit closer to home than just loss of the internet--which, ironically, most of your commentariat is likely to cheer. As you've repeatedly noted, no decision is without its pros and its cons. Will the cons of Steubenville be a bit stickier than just loss of computer-based goodies and the personal automobile? I'll be surprised if not.<br><br>Lastly, let me provide a commendation to "If they couldn’t even afford the infrastructure for the metanet, how the plut could they afford to rebuild their housing stock?" The sly commentary there is absolutely delicious.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c8443352349909150655 title="comment permalink">8/26/15, 8:08 PM</a><br><br>

What came out of our imagining was a stunning indictment of the society we live in. Everyone wanted a close-knit community, shared resources, no cars, wood heat, chickens and gardens. <br>So---if we all understand that this is the kind of life that we want for ourselves and our children, why aren't we concentrating our time and effort into building the "community" where we are? <br>I feel strongly that the people who end up as neighbours share some deep connection which few people have investigated. They are the community we all want, right here and right now, ready made, for better or for worse. <br>JMG's fiction can help us identify what we want but imagining it in a future after wars and currency collapse and breakdowns just makes us feel that we cannot accomplish it today, where we are. We feel helpless because the catastrophe, the charismatic situation, has not "jump-started" the process.<br>I think that that is wrong. We do not need a war and breakdown to start on the path to what many (most) seem to want. <br>Share your produce with your neighbours! Get to know them! Break down the invisible walls that keep us apart. Very likely these "walls" are a construct of Madison Avenue convincing us that each home needs a lawnmower and bread machine. They sell more that way!<br>It will seem embarrassing at first but you will be surprised at the common thread that brought each person into the building or onto the street that you live on.

I don't know whether it because it's so fresh in my mind that the tone of this writing seems eerily similar. I don't think Carr is quite like Richards (or if you will take this as a compliment, I for one really appreciate King's work), but the sense of a future where so many people can't see what's wrong with the picture, and how it stems from a present where people can't see what's wrong with the picture is coming through strong. <br><br>I do like how blinded by his veepad, Carr is. Maybe they have a food shortage indeed.<br><br>That said, here is a link to my entry for the short story competition. I posted at it at the end of the comments section of your last post, but I just wanted to make sure it made it. It is set in south western Australia, roughly 2,000 years after present, though the characters wouldn't be able to give an exact figure. What they know about the past is based on what they have been telling themselves over the millennia. What they have needed to remember, and what they have needed to forget.<br><br>Enjoy.<br><br>http://intoviews.blogspot.com/2015/08/alay.html<br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c8578049161774912532 title="comment permalink">8/26/15, 9:00 PM</a><br><br>

By the way, I really enjoyed the mention of the chip smell from the locomotive. A nice and very subtle touch. Incidentally, the country trains here are very swish and travel at pace that is faster than a car, but on one of the branch lines travelling to the town Swan Hill (a lovely name for a town on a big inland river), they still use those blunt nosed diesel electric engines in front of a few passenger cars and sometimes a mail car. I used to like catching that service into the big smoke from here, because there is a first class car and perhaps that is a bit of a misnomer - given the age of the car, but the seats were big and plush and comfy - and there are toilets.<br><br>Now the funny thing is I had to stop using that service, because you have to book a paper ticket or otherwise the conductor has a bit of a hissy fit. Now ordinarily, that would be an easy thing to do, but the local station is no longer manned and has been replaced by an el-flasho automated ticket system which requires people to have a smart card which isn't quite so smart because you can't buy them at the station which is not manned.<br><br>Apparently, tourists are highly confused by the entire ticketing system. Who'd have thunk it?<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: I've got a new blog entry up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Living with consequences</a>. Where I discuss what it means to live in a small community where social faux pas can be recalled many decades after they actually occurred and you have to worry about intangible things such as your reputation. Some of the fruit trees are producing blossoms now as spring approaches. I'm experimenting with hugelkultur again putting into practice the things that I've learned. I've turned a few eucalyptus saplings into a very nice looking fence. And more metal work art. Plus lots of house construction stuff and cool photos.

In point of fact, quite a few of Mr. Carr's assumptions about efficiency, productivity, and the like are going to come in for a bruising -- but a clueless narrator is a great asset in this sort of fiction. As for Canada, we'll see -- I'm just beginning my exploration of this fictive world. <br><br>Pygmycory, me too. It's definitely been a good week to sit back with a bowl of popcorn and watch the carnage. <br><br>Christophe, but of course! Competent Utopian fiction has to be plausible or it doesn't work -- the reader has to be able to think, "Well, why <i>don't</i> we do things that very sensible way?" or it gets dull very quickly. I recall a Somtow Sucharitkul story from some years ago in which there was a Utopian society -- and the reason it was utopian was that all the people were computer-controlled corpses, going through the motions they were programmed to go through. A brilliant bit of satire!<br><br>Degringolade, thank you in advance!<br><br>Tom, but if you go west-southwest to Steubenville, you cross the Ohio River there, because it veers southwards. Rail corridors very rarely follow straight lines; they go from population center to population center via the most level available route, which entails some vagaries. You might try following the trip as we go on a road map -- I've got an old highway atlas, the same one I used to map out Trey's journey in <i>Star's Reach</i>, and will be using that extensively as the story proceeds. <br><br>Escape, that's classic JKG! He's right, too -- professional economists hate him because he didn't deck out his theories in quantitative drag. <br><br>HalFiore, the only difference between the Pittsburgh station now and the one in the story -- which is set in 2065, by the way -- is that last time I was at the Pittsburgh station, the escalator still worked. Fortunately not all train stations are like that, and in the Lakeland Republic, none of them are. <br><br>Joel, not only will it be a novel, I've already got the publisher lined up. I'm glad a hopeful future helps! That's one of the great benefits of this sort of narrative -- it's one thing for me to post abstract discussions of the Retro Future, and quite another to turn it into a story and make it concrete in the reader's imagination. <br><br>Mary, how many of those people who all agreed on what they wanted were willing to chuck the comforts of their middle class lifestyles in order to build that future? That's where the rubber meets the road, and having seen way too many of those discussions myself, I've learned that talk is cheap, and everyone's ready to sit back and cheer while somebody else gives them the future they say they want. One of the reasons I place my future visions after wars and crises is that the wars and crises are pretty clearly on their way; the other reason is that I honestly think it's going to take something on that scale to jolt the comfortable off their sofas and make them come to grips with the fact that if they want a better future they're going to have to make it themselves. <br><br>Gwyn, I'm pleased to say that my fiction is doing a good deal better than it had in the past -- I fielded my first-ever advance on a novel recently, and the novels of mine that are in print are picking up some attention and enthusiasm. Thus <i>Retrotopia</i> will become a novel, and I already have a publisher lined up for it. I'll be sure to post here once it's available for advance sale. In the meantime, enjoy the story!<br><br>Joel, excellent! That fine example of classic verbiage wins you tonight's gold star. <br><br>Max, please reread the first paragraph of the post...<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c8566401161472051909 title="comment permalink">8/26/15, 10:47 PM</a><br><br>

I did get your story; please put in a comment marked "Not for posting" with your email address, so I can contact you if your story is selected for the anthology, and you're in. <br><br>Zack, glad to hear about the new imprint! I'm not a great fan of that phrase of Eisenstein -- to my mind, it rather reeks of a sense of entitlement that may not be helpful at a time when coming to terms with the hard limits of the planet is the most pressing need we've got -- but anything that opens up visions of the future that aren't either (a) the status quo or (b) one step further the way the status quo has been going is a good thing. <br><br>Aias, how marvelous -- Thiel is actually starting to get a clue. Now maybe he'll notice that people outside of his class of overpaid parasites have very good reasons to dislike and distrust science and technology, starting with the fact that science and technology are so consistently used to benefit said class of overpaid parasites at everyone else's expense...<br><br>Mister R., they are indeed. Chicago's an independent and fabulously corrupt city-state, but the rest of Illinois is part of the Lakeland Republic, along with all of Wisconsin and Michigan. (Minnesota belongs to the next republic west.)<br><br>Cherokee, that's classic -- put in a helpful new technological interface that proceeds to get in the way of using the technology. I bet if the railroad ever notices that ridership is off, they'll try to pin the reason anywhere and everywhere but the technology. <br><br>Joe, as you'll see, it's rather more complex than that -- the family that's immigrating obviously got paperwork in advance, for example. As for immigration, the reasons why there hasn't been a flood across the border will become clearer as we proceed. <br><br>Noreen, thank you! <br><br>Dan, good. I was wondering how many people caught the biodiesel in the locomotive. As for touching hearts, that's always the goal of fiction -- but utopian fiction also seeks to stir the brain into action as well.

This is something I came up with during my studies in politically idealistic sustainability, while interacting with the working class at the job that paid my bills, at a public university in Upstate New York around 10 years ago. The only difference is that the "Lakes Federation" is further east of your "Lakeland Republic." It's capital is Syracuse and it prospers between your story's setting on the west, it's allies in Canada and the Mountains Federation (Northern New England) to the north and east, the drowning and poisoned lands of the Donald Trump-Larry Hogan-Chris Christie Empire (which conquered Southern New England, New York City, Southern Pennsylvania, and Virginia as a result of the dystopian, suburban reactionary, anti-railroad events currently happening in our own 2015 time-frame) to the southeast, and the forest border guard posts along the Route 6 corridor in the Northern Tier of Pennsylvania. <br><br>It is great and comforting to read about your vision for a sustainable, agrarian, future republic in the Midwest, though. When I traveled by bicycle across America in 2013, I actually crossed the Ohio at Steubenville after touring the old C&amp;O canal and railroad trails to Pittsburgh and beyond. Upon entering Ohio, I had to deal with contaminated water from gas fracking but I also met some of the realest, most helpful people of the tour since my crossing of New England and Upstate New York. Steubenville had an economically abandoned downtown, but it's historical landmarks were well preserved and the elders working at the library were not afraid to ask me who I was and where I was coming from, before welcoming me to use the WiFi there. This friendly hospitality, which is not afraid to work with the land and ask real questions, continued until I approached Cairo in southernmost Illinois, even though agrarian monocultures increased as I rode down the river. <br><br>Can't wait to see your conclusion to this story. And more detail on what ever happened to the Trump-Hogan-Christie Empire. My angry at life, but otherwise smart, reactionary Republican friend back in Baltimore needs to see the wisdom before she drowns and chokes on her own carbon dioxide based disdain for the real world.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c5047109940715494252 title="comment permalink">8/27/15, 1:14 AM</a><br><br>

I look forward to the whole tale.<br>Trains to Ohio made me a bit nostalgic for our annual Thanksgiving trip to visit the old aunties in Conneaut,OH in the 40s &amp; early 50s when I was, probably, 5-12. We would leave NY in the evening and have a sleeper room. I remember the meals being brought to the room covered with metal lids over the plates. I would have a top bunk, and remember waking up at each station we stopped at and opening the window a bit to watch the people get on and off the train in the frosty air. In the morning we would be at our destination.The aunties had a huge old house with attic and basement and a secret stairway and I would play with the neighbor kids. Lovely things, trains.<br>On a more current note, we are having huge, unprecedented summer rains now here in Hawaii, complete with a 500,000 gallon sewer spill and the beaches closed in Honolulu and Waikiki.

It must take a long time to cover any distance in the USA (and the same with driving) which, of course, is only evidence that - as a country - it's too big for its own good. It's another area where you're going to be in a worse position than us across the pond once the downslope kicks in; I don't think anywhere in Europe gutted its rail system to the same extent (trains, particularly local lines, and other forms of public transport did lose out in the competition against cars but there was much less of the kind of wilful vandalism from the motor industry that plagued the States) though our government has developed an unfortunate fascination with high-speed rail.<br><br>As for the use of technology to confuse tourists - I was in London recently and learned that the only ways to ride a bus are now Oystercard or pre-paid ticket.

Small gardens at many homes fed a LOT of people. <br><br>Oh, and the kids were generally well-behaved (except maybe for the time, age 8, I drove my uncle's Wileys Jeep through a fence), because they were hand-reared (in several senses of the phrase) and had a productive and functional place in the family.<br><br>Sadly, the narrow-gauge Newfie Bullet was seeing it's last days around that time as well. I too prefer trains over all other means of transport; I remember fondly (if occasionally dimly) the bar car on a number of trips between Toronto and Montreal when I was dating my wife-to-be. <br><br>I'm very much looking forward to learning more about the Lakeland Republic, perhaps I will emigrate; I'm an organic farmer so you could say I already have my 'Green' Card.<br><br>Last thought, I followed your advice from a previous post and obtained 'The Great Crash 1929'. Let me hasten to add my recommendation to all the readers here. JKG has a wit to match JMG; he apprently majored in Economics with a minor in Sarcasm; highly educational and entertaining.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c6083010771190012915 title="comment permalink">8/27/15, 2:37 AM</a><br><br>

I think I also would break down in tears and need patting on the back if I could up and make that journey right here and now! And I do not live in what I presume is still the United States!<br><br>War damage and all that … reminds me of childhood, but much more recently of smoke-damaged broken farm houses stranded in mine-fields after the recent Balkan wars. Border posts? Yes, a lot of our work concerned rebuilt Border Posts. There are very dark clouds again across those uneasy places– and civil war once more at flash-points in Europe where a way of looking at the world – quintessentially the American way – could be better adjusted to reality. (Dmitry Orlov is not impartial, but he keeps us up-to-date).

Full overhead electrification of the network does not look as though it will ever be completed.

I have long believed that good fiction is the best vehicle by far to transport these ideas to larger audiences. While I prefer the written word, regardless of the media form a popular story is capable of planting the seed of ideas that grow and root into the public consciousness. There's really no other method that can compare except for major shared experiences/events, which are usually disasters and end up being largely fiction too by the time they are spun and predigested for us. You never know how such ideas can fester in the background, being passed around and reused in other works, eventually to pop back out and be incorporated into a new understanding (religious sensibility?).<br><br>We think in stories and will remember the experiences we've had while immersed in one.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c5783997716093023492 title="comment permalink">8/27/15, 5:36 AM</a><br><br>

Those tracks also don't head for Steubenville; to do that, historically, you'd have to board at the P&amp;LE station on the south side of town, now a mall. That's not to say the tracks haven't been rerouted, but you're fighting geography.<br>Also, if the tracks go back clear to the Atlantic, it might be a nice touch in the final version if the train is fueled with petro-diesel until it crosses into the Lakeland Republic. Or...since you've got streetcars darting about, the train could get an electric locomotive at the border.<br>(OMG, I'm turning into one of those cranky old engineers who critique the technology in science fiction stories!)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c8327135245673144280 title="comment permalink">8/27/15, 6:27 AM</a><br><br>

After the last crash, banks had quite a lot of foreclosed properties. They sold them to speculators, who rather than sell them in turn (few buyers) turned them into rental units.

Having had a hand in constructing a "Potemkin village" visible from the south, one might have a unique degree of skepticism about any appearance of southern prosperity that happens to leak across the border.

But I think that only scratches the surface. What I see at play so far, at every level of the Heartland Republic, is a decision to abandon highly centralized operations in favor of decentralized ones. In doing so, the people of the Heartland Republic appear to have placed a cap on the ability of elites to loot for their own advantage and benefit. <br><br>It's almost as if this fictional future country was drawn up by E.F. Schumacher and Wendell Berry, at first glance. Keep things small, local (and beautiful) to the maximum extent possible, and the abundance can be widely shared across a broad base. Insist on bigger and more centralized, and the surplus is funneled upward as rapidly as possible -- while at the same time undercutting the very conditions that make the surplus possible, as the elites most benefiting are too far removed from those conditions to view them in any way other than an abstraction (hence the reference to what Carr learned in business school).<br><br>Already can't wait for the next installation, JMG!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c5443303362451152305 title="comment permalink">8/27/15, 7:52 AM</a><br><br>

I have been an Oblate Novice there for too long. I am hoping to be able to proceed to full Oblation in the spring of 2016. (Oblates, as you may perhaps already be either dimly or vividly aware, are a kind of "Third Order" - laity living in the world, and yet supporting the spiritual and temporal mission of their particular selected monastery so far as their particular secular circumstances may permit.) <br><br>LaTrobe is on the present Amtrak line linking New York to Pittsburg. Awkwardly, this puts LaTrobe on the bad side of your 21st-century Iron Curtain. <br><br>Have you any suggestions regarding the fate of the Archabbey? Does it develop a countercultural witness, cultivating its present ample Pennsylvania fields in the spirit of your envisaged future Lakeland farmers, while occasionally quietly reminding people of the small-private-holdings ideas promulgated by 1890s Leo XIII in <i>Rerum Novarum</i>? Or does it compromise its ideals by embracing monoculture agribusiness? I take the fate of the Archabbey as a small, manageable, test case, to help advance the following more general line of investigation (a line too vast, I think, for you to address in its proper generality this week): <i>Does the government on the eastern side of your unhappy Iron Curtain co-opt Catholicism, as Stalin's USSR co-opted the Orthodox Church (monasteries included)?

Do they continue in some reduced state, like the railway (your combination goods-and-passenger short-train arrangement, with biodiesel traction, seems credible) or have they been driven under? I would like to think that in Lakeland there are private tutors preparing students for examinations set by external, prestigious, examining boards (say, run by Cambridge University or Hah-vud). I would further like to think that some of the old Lakeland universities have survived in skeleton form by retaining their hardcopy libraries and some lab space, now selling to students, at some moderate price, admission to these key facilities. The idea would be that if you are a student preparing for your "Cambridge University Physics-of-Radio Level Three Comprehensive" and your "Hah-vud Multivariate Real-Variables Tensor Analysis" exams, you would get your education at world standards, and yet at an affordable price. My envisaged students would additionally rejoice in the salutary administrative separation of teaching authority (their local Ohio tutor or "coach", with whom they would be in relations of friendly alliance) from their examining authority (the "Board", too geographically and administratively remote for any interpersonal power-games; you never even meet "Board" personnel, since the exam papers are sent from Cambridgeshire or Massachusetts to your local JP or county court). <br><br>PPS: How good are humanities in the K12 Lakeland schools?

We had a sleeper, definitely from the 50's or 60's. Muted paint, but very well designed, with plenty of heat (it was winter) and a comfy couch. The train stations were dreary remnants of what they had been. The train was constantly stopping to either let a freight train pass or frozen switches. AMTRAK had the lowest priority. The snack bar was a joke, so good thing we brought some goodies. Soon the constant stops made a joke of the schedule. And approaching the cities, we saw the worst slums and industrial backwaters imaginable. But overall, the experience was pleasant, since we were on our own time.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c3677934878044782504 title="comment permalink">8/27/15, 9:01 AM</a><br><br>

I especially like the fact that both societies seem to have retained or revived technology from decades past. One thing that always bothered me about sci-fi futures was that all infrastructure looked the same – in Star Trek utopias everything was spanking new and clean, and in post-apocalyptic fiction nothing has been repaired or retrofitted since the apocalypse. In the real world, of course, my area contains five-, fifty- and 300-year-old structures, along with five-, twenty- and 60-year-old cars. I would assume even more variety in a world forced to reuse more. <br><br>Ironically, I would expect the older materials and buildings to last longer – I’ve written about the infrastructure here outside of Dublin, where the multi-story office buildings became derelict as soon as they opened, while the stone bridges have functioned for a few centuries. <br><br>I did wonder how a border through the middle of North America could be tightly sealed against immigration, when the USA has so much trouble patrolling the Mexican border – but perhaps your future states are no more successful. <br><br>I’ll be interested to learn more about the social controls and pressures that Lakeland uses in lieu of guards and technological dependency. That’s another problem with most speculative fiction – it too frequently creates utopian societies with improbably few controls, or falls back on police-state clichés. Most human societies, though, rely on family pressure, religion and shame to shape behaviour, and I’d like to see more writers explore that. <br><br>I’ll look forward to reading more. <br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c6634771223133354344 title="comment permalink">8/27/15, 9:26 AM</a><br><br>

The land has withered into something wretched. The dust has settled on a lonely, barren planet. The hardened survivors of the loss of Earth's precious resources scrape and struggle. Ernest Holm Michael Shannon lives on this harsh frontier with his children, Jerome Kodi Smit-McPhee and Mary Elle Fanning. He defends his farm from bandits, works the supply routes, and hopes to rejuvenate the soil. But Mary's boyfriend, Flem Lever (Nicholas Hoult), has grander designs. He wants Ernest's land for himself, and will go to any length to get it.

I think that the lack of the Vweb and cell phones in the Lakeland republic is more of a Chicken and Egg thing. Instead of the more obvious guess that not wasting resources on digital devices and allowed this more successfull retro-republic to thrive instead I think the story will be that the absence of these things allowed the political concensus required to pursue a different and more appropriate future. In other words, perhaps the civil war more effectively destroyed the internet, cell phone network, and television infrastructure in the Lakeland Republic region so that the Orwellian flow of distractions not longer kept the population entranced and they were able to develop the political consensus ( nod to your last post) to have a real revolution. They were then able to put the members of the rentier and political classes to the sword ( or guillotine, keeping with the retro theme) and develop a consensus as to the way forward in a future of limited energy and resources. They then wisely choose not to bring back these distractions even though they may have been prosperous enough, both because they waste valuable resources better used elseware and because of the danger to the culture. <br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c5945588675379211477 title="comment permalink">8/27/15, 10:36 AM</a><br><br>

Cute. :)<br><br>I like where this is going. But only because I know you'll steer well clear of deindustrial SF pitfall #3: "perennial problems solved via spontaneous fundamental changes to human nature." (It's a pitfall in other SF subgenres too, of course.) In other words, while I look forward to more details of life in Retrotopia/Lakeland, what will really make it interesting is examination of the social systems and tradeoffs that make it possible. Somewhere, a number of pipers are being paid.<br><br>For instance, I suspect (in order to make various quantities balance) that the immigrant family might be voluntarily entering into some kind of indenture. Which wouldn't preclude their new living conditions being far better than their former ones. (Per the negation of pitfall #3, abuse would be a possibility they must weigh for either situation.)<br><br>I also anticipate something like 1920's-era medicine and life expectancy. Basic medical and surgical care (augmented with post-1920s knowledge but relatively little post-1920s technology), usually delivered by house call (required because most patients don't have cars). The doctor would be one of the people who use the cars Carr saw in Steubenville (though it would have to be one that could negotiate unpaved farm roads, and perhaps double as an ambulance.) If there is an MRI machine in Toledo, it will be used in those cases where it really makes a difference in the outcome (instead of e.g. ruling out unlikely alternative diagnoses to protect the doctor from law suits).

Several posters here seem to think that was meant to refer to biodiesel. Having made my own BD and taught classes in how to make it for many years now, I should point out that BD when burnt does not smell like french fries (or fried fish or any other fried food). The BD process does a very good job of cleaning any remaining food stuffs from the fuel. BD has a subtle but distinct odor, but it is unique and unlike any fried food. Now if they were just filtering the used fryer oil and burning that directly in the train's engines, then the exhaust would likely smell of fried something.<br><br>In all likelihood, in the circumstances of the story, those folks would probably not be converting their used oil to BD. That takes too much in the way of concentrated inputs. Rather they would filter and burn the used cooking oil directly. Much cheaper and easier to do.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c3542730792869956693 title="comment permalink">8/27/15, 1:07 PM</a><br><br>

There's no train service east of Pittsburgh, as the mid-Atlantic states have spent the last fifteen years trying to get foreign aid to put in a Chinese-made high speed train from Buffalo to Baltimore, rather than using local labor and resources to do something less trendy and more useful. <br><br>Leo, these days, if you take a bus trip across the poorer parts of the US, you'll see people like that, complete with plastic bag luggage. <br><br>LatheChuck, of course -- but remember that we're getting all of this from the viewpoint of a narrator who has probably never thought about what the phrase actually means. <br><br>DaShui, thanks for the heads up. As noted last week, I have a lot of readers on the rightward end of the political landscape -- possibly as many as I have on the leftward end. As an old-fashioned Burkean conservative, I have no problem with this. <br><br>Bruce, good! I was hoping for that reaction from the throwaway line about the school. <br><br>Kevin, good. Keep that comparison in mind as we proceed. <br><br>Musings, very good. There's more to it than that, but Schumacher in particular is an important influence on this project. <br><br>Tom, it's an easy mistake to make. That's one of the reasons I'm obsessive about plotting out character movements on a map!<br><br>Nastarana, the fate of the parasitic rich was not pretty; I'll get to that. As for libraries, you bet -- big, comfortable, attractive brick buildings full of actual paper books, with actual librarians to take care of them. I adore libraries; any utopia I create is going to have plenty of them.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c103525554768766863 title="comment permalink">8/27/15, 6:21 PM</a><br><br>

I don't anticipate public flogging, but knitting is quite another matter. <br><br>Weedananda, thank you. As for the Republic of New England and the Maritimes, to give it its formal name, it's an independent nation, struggling to deal with rising sea levels as well as the other difficulties besetting the nations of the former United States, but doing a better job than most. <br><br>Bob, west of the Mississippi, Amtrak's bottom priority and you can tell. East of the Big Muddy, it's a different matter -- and the snack bars and dining cars are actually not half bad. <br><br>Cathy, thank you. I don't expect to have much more to say about the veepad, as the focus of the story is what the Lakeland Republic does instead of another round of brittle and shoddily made high tech gimmicks. <br><br>Dammerung, funny!<br><br>Cathy, single POV is to my mind a very powerful tool for making a narrative work; there are some stories that can't be told that way -- <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> is one of mine that had to be done as a kaleidoscope of different points of view -- but I honestly prefer it, when it will work at all. <br><br>James, stay tuned!<br><br>Revere, not a question I'd thought of, as I'm not a fan. Still, that's a good point -- and since every utopian fiction surfs on the implied contrast between things as they are and things as they could be, sports should get a look in. <br><br>Brian, no argument there -- too much utopian literature falls into the modern bad habit of thinking that human nature is a function of political, economic, and social systems, and if you change the system you can make human beings act like angels. Au contraire, a good alternative-society story has to explain what motivates people to act differently. <br><br>Varun, luck! I've got your story, so you're in the contest. <br><br>William, to my mind, first person POV is all but essential when you really want to work the contrast between what the reader thinks when he or she sees something, and what your point of view character thinks when he or she sees the same thing. Third person, even if it's a tight single character POV, just doesn't have the same impact. Of course there are times when a writer doesn't want to foreground that contrast -- when, for example, it's a more useful effect to gently draw the reader into seeing things in a different way -- but a story that draws a hard contrast between the present and an imagined future is very often best done as a first person narrative from a narrator who's at least a little clueless. Trey sunna Gwen in <i>Star's Reach</i> was a great deal of fun to write, precisely because his unthinking responses to the world around him were so different from those most readers would have!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c3904897665659429666 title="comment permalink">8/27/15, 6:49 PM</a><br><br>

One of the things that can really sneak up on people is that huge changes don't necessarily happen all at once, apart from ordinary background noise. <br><br>Zach, you can read Galbraith's book from cover to cover in an evening, if you don't laugh yourself into hiccups too often!<br><br>Dermot, interesting. I haven't seen it, and to be honest, I probably won't -- I don't do much visual media at ll -- but it's intriguing to see that sort of idea getting more into circulation. <br><br>Moshe, I would indeed quibble with that; more precisely, I'd roll my eyes and point out that it's not exactly realistic to expect that the people who have most to lose in a total collapse, and who also have access to resources that have proved more than adequate to stop such collapses in their tracks in the past, will sit on their hands and say "Whatever shall we do?" in plaintive voices while the world crashes into ruin around them. <br><br>Unknown Evan, you're welcome and thank you.

Stay tuned!<br><br>Toomas, I think it was about forty boxcars, but Carr wasn't counting so I could be wrong. <br><br>Patricia, "post toasties" -- that's a keeper. Thank you. <br><br>Toomas, excellent! Yes, exactly. All the current rail infrastructure was trashed in the Second Civil War, where it hadn't simply fallen to bits beforehand. The tracks on which the train to Toledo is rolling were laid recently -- in the case of the Pittsburgh-to-Steubenville section, in the three years before the story opens. <br><br>Myriad, also excellent. As I noted above in my response to Brian Kaller, I have no time for the kind of bad fiction in which everyone acts like angels because they live under the right political, economic, or social system. I can promise you that the Lakeland Republic contains just as many greedy, stupid, selfish, arrogant, and power-hungry people as any other human society, and it's anything but perfect; on the other hand, certain changes have been made that head off some of the abuses and stupidities of our present society.

It's filtered vegetable oil, of course, not the blend that gets called "biodiesel" these days.

I tend to agree that many people are afraid of science and technology and as JMG has said, for good reasons. Usually. <br><br>Science has become synonymously with technology.

I'm honestly not sure what the former state of Oklahoma looks like in this fictive 2065. <br><br>Sarah, it sounds as though you're a cutting edge early adopter of the exciting new technologies everyone will be enjoying in 2065... ;-)<br><br>Ozark, one of the things that often gets forgotten about that word "utopia" is that it simply means a place that doesn't exist. Good utopian fiction always aims for plausibility. <br><br>Carmiac, as I see it, the southwest is toast. Current patterns in climate change will make most of it uninhabitable -- the water shortages you're seeing now are just the cutting edge of the new normal -- and the collapse of the US economy means among other things that the funds currently going to prop up an unsustainable region won't be there indefinitely. I expect to see Las Vegas and Phoenix abandoned to the sands within my lifetime, and California turn into a world-class basket case if not a Somalia-style failed state. Yes, things really are that bad. <br><br>Martin, diesel-electric locomotives are vastly more efficient as well as cleaner. One of the things you'll want to watch for is technological bricolage -- the interweaving of technologies of very different dates of origin. We already do a lot of that, but the Lakeland Republic does it in some very unexpected (to us) ways. <br><br>Adrian, I don't know Chicago well enough to do a novel set there in 2065, in its fabulously corrupt city-state era -- but I'd love to read such a novel. <br><br>Fabian, whereabouts in southwest Washington? My dad's family is from Aberdeen and we had relatives scattered over quite a bit of that part of the state; it's been a while, but I used to know it fairly well. <br><br>Doctor W., I'll be interested to see if you still think that when you've seen more of the Lakeland Republic!<br><br>Rain, got it. Please put in a comment marked "not for posting" with your email address, so I have a way to contact you if your story is chosen for the anthology. <br><br>Patricia, excellent! Glad to see that somebody caught that. It's going to be discussed at length later on. <br><br>Shane, I don't often hand out two gold stars in a night, but the wanton and entirely deserved destruction of a dumbphone deserves one. If that helpful spirit will simply catch on... ;-)<br><br>Howard, it's a legacy of the Second Civil War, when federal forces used plutonium-jacketed artillery shells as a terror weapon. (People were hanged as war criminals for that after Washington DC fell.) Soldiers' slang for those was "pluts;" to get plutted was to get hit by one, and then by extension to get clobbered in any particularly messy way; from there, "plut" became an all-purpose obscenity. You'll also hear "keech" used as a slang term for excrement, but that's because UN peacekeeping troops guarded the borders for a while during and after Partition, and the border between the former states of Pennsylvania and Ohio had a large contingent of peacekeepers from army of the Scottish Republic. <br><br>Nathaniel, the former US in this fictive 2065 is around a dozen independent nations. The same thing happened in a few other places -- for example, as you may have gathered from my comment immediately above, Scotland is an independent republic in 2065 -- but not generally; there are countries that have broken apart and countries that have merged through conquest or other means, as usual.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c4361817434965510606 title="comment permalink">8/27/15, 10:58 PM</a><br><br>

At one point I studied it at school and was reminded of it by your post this week. <br><br>The theme is a vision of England in the 2050s where the country is divided, but the fault-line is urban vs. rural, the latter of which has gone back culturally to something like the 19th century. As I remember the technological regression is not quite as pervasive as it first appeared. Most people in the rural area ride horses rather than cars but do use some electrical gadgets.<br><br>I wonder if the form of corporatist capitalism existing now is becoming more like the Communism that existed in Eastern Europe before the end of the Iron Curtain. Communism (as practised) would be the endpoint of corporatist capitalism once all the various conglomerates coalesce by takeover/merger into a single monopoly. Perhaps that doesn't even need to happen, once the point of oligopoly is reached the conglomerates share interests and act as a unified bloc. The limited areas of the economy under control of small and medium sized businesses are 'tolerated' a bit like the unofficial marketplaces that existed in many Communist countries.<br>Including now in North Korea where I heard an anecdote from someone who visited there that there was this market which didn't exist according to the government, although some of the shoppers there were wearing the red badge with portraits of the first two members of the Kim dynasty, denoting them as Party members.

Thanks for writing it.<br><br>The story is reminicent of an essay by Gene Logsden I read in the Draft Horse Journal, about a 10,000 acre farm, comparing two methods of operation. One method was standard industrial ag, employed 2 or 3 people, used massive equipment, brought in off-farm inputs from everywhere, collected subsidies, used questionalble pesticides, mono-cropped, had serious erosion problems and fed into a system of ag where standardization, specialization and consolidation of control ruled.<br><br>The other method Logsden discribed was to divide the 10,000 acre farm up into 100 100 acre parcels and farm with draft animals. This method employed 100 families, and like most pre-fifties farms was diverse, profitable (without subsidies) and ran on farm and community produced inputs. The 100 acre farms, because they acrually supported the family needs, grew a wide range of crops, orchards, forests, gardens, fence-rows, pastures, ponds, poultry, pigs, cows, sheep, dogs, kids and any other life form the family thought worthy. <br><br>This second diverse method of farming created a whole range of local supporting businesses around the 100 family farms, including farriers, millers, bakers, butchers, groceries, carpenters, plumbers, electricians, and indeed everything a small town needs to operate and thrive. The land was better cared for and provided for many of the community needs. It was a holistic system of community agriculture that developed interdependencies between people, the land, plants and animals. It created wealth that was shared within the community, with extra wealth for export.<br><br>I think I'd take my team and family and move there if I could find the place.

Not all of the nations that are currently exporting of mass produced industrialized cash crops didn't choose to adopt those practices themselves, after all. With what seems to be a nation that is still clinging to a great deal of technological and military power bordering it, and an ascendant Chinese hegemony that is taking over the role in global economics and politics that the US is currently declining out of, how does the Lakeland Republic manage to avoid the fate of similar republics in the world right now? What's to stop China, or the East Coast states from using guns, bomb threats, and forced treaties to force them to grow and export industrial hemp or corn monocultures at slave wages? I'll also be curious to see what their system of government is like, especially since the one nation I can think of off the top of my head that has managed a large scale transition in agricultural methods and technology managed to garner the political will to do so by being a dictatorship.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c2189435356894682554 title="comment permalink">8/28/15, 8:04 AM</a><br><br>

A quick Google search on its demographics will tell that the U.S is actually very diverse. Also its not nearly as "united" either, on multiple lines.<br><br>There is currently a flux in U.S demographics. There are multiple changes but the most notable is the large influx of Hispanic individuals from Mexico and Latin America and a huge increase, at least in some places, of multiracial individual mostly from a growing acceptance, again in some places, of interracial marriages and couplings. Many people are also relocating to other parts of the U.S right now for multiple reasons including to be in areas that more conform to their personal sociopolitical beliefs.<br><br>However al this being said: the fact is that while the U.S is very diverse, it is still VERY much segregated, its just not legally enforced anymore. There are areas and even neighborhoods within many U.S cities where you literally will almost never see a person of another race, despite the overall diversity of the larger area. Many places are still even divided on ethnic lines(such as Italian, German, etc) but this is far less common than it was even 50 years ago. Chicago, IL for example is actually EXTREMELY diverse, however its also extremely segregated, often ranking among the most segregated cities in the U.S. On the other cities like Sacramento CA are also very diverse but also very racially integrated. Unfortunately however, while an extreme example, Chicago is quite typical of most major U.S cities in terms of segregation.<br><br>The country is also still Very much divided on issues of religion, politics, general world viewpoint as well as race/ethnicity and levels and feelings on integration. It doesn't suprise me at all that JMG chose to make the former country into a dozen or more new one, and really, it would have felt pretty unrealistic otherwise.

Mainstream -corporate?- opinion seems to be against the new Montrose admin, but Mr. Carr snorts at them... or at her? He seems to be associated with government in some way: he says "We’d talked about doing something of the same kind back in Philadelphia more than once, just for government use..." Also, he's been invited to Toledo by someone, and even the border guard knew he was coming. Finally, he mentions reading briefing papers. Ordinary people get their information from some branch of the mass media, and don't usually refer to it as "briefing."<br><br>So, he's either a government functionary, possibly representing the new admin, or a businessman on a trade mission.

Although, Stephen King is far more than a horror writer. This is the man behind Shawshank Redemption. He's a secrets man. And he see's quite clearly how people might perceive their revelation, and their responses to them. The parallel I see happening here, between The Running Man and Retrotopia, so far, is the portrayal of "Extended America". The extension of the present day shmozzle into the not so distant future. While Running Man takes the standard extrapolation of the centralised power increasing and becoming more technologically colosseum-like, JMG is going down a more realistic path to my mind and showing a fractured land. (Though when the Running Man was written I could see why King's version of the future might have seemed more real) <br><br>The other similarity in their writings in this case is the showing of something potentially begign and quaint, as a place that may actually be filled with deep labrynthine secrets and unspoken or even unrecognised horrors.<br><br>I suspect there's more to Steubenville than just a permaculturalist's wet dream. I suspect that apart from Carr's destiny of paradigm shifting, we might see some kind of Cuba like society emerging in this story. One where, yes there is a green revolution of sorts, but perhaps enclosed in walls that allow nothing more.

Any area that sustained life, pre-Columbus, (and now with Climate warming, adding appropriate temperature degrees, so minus those areas historically on the brink of being to hot and arid to sustain habitation) - those areas will again find a few inhabitants. Small pockets of CA, possibly even Phoenix, along the Salt River will again be plagued by us, ornery, grumpy humans. No doubt, my own options, either the Fragrant Harbour of Hong Kong, and / or our Hopeful collapse/retirement area of Western WY, have always sustained medium-sized populations of humans and most likely will again. Oddly in both places, local inhabitants have historically disliked their neighbors and will probably fight to keep themselves to themselves.

If only the people who end up running American foreign policy were as deeply read in the history of other cultures, I believe that our history of interactions with the rest of the world would have been much different over the last century.<br><br>You hit the nail on the head with your skepticism of general uprisings and secessionist sentiments in the US in the near future. I was born and live in Alabama, the first capital of the Confederate States of America. I have never believed for a moment that the overriding sentiments that drove the American Civil War was a nascent and irrepressible sense of "nationhood" in the Southern soul. I say this having learned just this year a bit of family history that had been told to me, but now has actually been confirmed: I was born in 1952. Three of my great-grand parents were still living and two of the three lived long enough for me to become acquainted with them and to remember them well. My paternal great-grandmother, who was born in 1845 and died in 1927, was 16 years old at the outbreak of the Civil War. She became in her very young life a noted nurse in the care of the wounded veterans in the State of Georgia. After the war she married and had a fairly large family. My grandfather was her youngest child--born in 1883, when she was 38 years old. He entered the US Navy as a young man and served with distinction in WWI. His two sons who survived to adulthood both served in WWII. His grandsons served in the US Army during the Vietnam era. So, my family are all proud Americans. We seek to be nothing else. We are not pleased by some of the actions taken by our government from time to time, but we remain loyal patriots and look forward to the time when our government will change for the better. I hope that time is near. I would very much like to be able to look out with pride to the rest of world and have the rest of the world look back and feel once again that the pride is justified. To me that is the essence of old fashioned patriotism.

While the whole Confederate Flag loving Southerners crap and the Texans calling for secession get a lot of press coverage but there are a lot of things that don't. I'd like to believe that my country is just as united on most things as I used to think we were but recently I've begun to doubt.<br><br>People may not be beating down the doors yet but they're talking about it... the fact that they're even talking about something that even a decade or two ago would have been considered completely insane is.... telling. While all humans seem to have a misguided desire to want everyone else to look, act and think just like themselves, I have to admit, we Americans have that bug pretty bad. Right now most of the people talking about changes in the U.S are still calling for just a change in the way government is run and or getting rid of the current regime.... unfortunately that's all they really agree. Just about every other idea about how the government or new government should be run is different from eachothers.<br><br>While a lot of people like to present a strong united front its just that a front. Even in places where people are considered to have largely the same opinions and culture like the south its still pretty divided. The south central, south eastern and south central U.S seem very similar but on closer inspection are completely different from eachother in terms of economic base, some(but notable) politics and just overall culture. N that's not even getting into the northern areas which might even be more different. I think embracing our differences make us better as a whole, unfortunately a lot of other people don't agree.<br><br>As far as the states go: you gotta realize that its not exactly the same as say the provinces in most other country. For one, for all the people going on about the power of the federal government the states actually have far more autonomy than most traditional provinces. Also most regions again tend to have their own separate customs, practices and culture but most notably their own social, political and religious beliefs. <br><br>Again also, you gotta realize that one shared aspect of our culture is the whole independence thing, for obvious historical reason. Its a little weird actually. We want other people to respect our own individuality and independence but somehow think they should again be just like us. Not necessarily in a malignant way, we actually think they would be better off, kind of like were helping them... and I'm not talking about other countries here, I mean our own people. Though I've noticed a lot of people are starting to think a "just go your own way" and split deal would be better. <br><br>We don't like to admit it but we've been weird this way since inception, and many people are starting to think we've been fundamentally different since inception, as well. I have to admit that its probably a small miracle that we got it together and made a whole nation in the first place. Look at a detailed historical look at the American Revolution, if you want, and you'll see that we really didn't agree on much other than wanting independence from Britain. With the Civil War if you look into the broad reasons and inner conflicts during it it wasn't nearly as simple as north vs south. Again, small miracle that we didn't totally split up then. Which is one half of the reason, the other being ending slavery, that Abraham Lincoln is still so revered. <br><br>I'll admit right now it doesn't seem like things are about to go totally crazy yet, but as you said these things never seem likely, until unfortunately they become inevitable.<br><br>Nate<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c6742440747717978547 title="comment permalink">8/29/15, 8:19 AM</a><br><br>

If JMG's ideas on how things will shape up in the future are even close to correct its not difficult to see it splitting.<br><br>Its hard keeping a sense of national identity with a group of a few hundred million people spread out over several million square kilometers. It will be even harder when there's little to no long distance communication (such as phone lines/towers and internet.) Little to no long distance travel (such as planes, trains and especially cars.) And the industrial/military/economic complex base that was keeping this all together is failing thanks to a dwindling supply of reliable energy in the form of fossil fuels. Especially when those people are increasingly convinced that they don't like the federal government and that they have little to nothing in common with the people on the other side of these vast lands. And that they don't think combining there ideological differences make them better anymore,which is a shame. Considering all this, its not impossible for me to believe that the country would be split into multiple different pieces 50 some odd years from now.<br><br>Nate<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c8303613026110604919 title="comment permalink">8/29/15, 8:55 AM</a><br><br>

Don't have a TV or newspaper, and don't get down off the hill much, but it does seem I've heard some recent kerfuffle about the confederate flag. So we went to town and at the gas station I noted by the cash register 2 or 3 nicknacks with confederate flags on them, like a belts or a wallets or something. (American flags, I'm used to seeing.) So, driving off, right away, we saw a house with a huge confederate flag draped across the fence.<br>What's up with this?<br>My state went north in the civil war, although barely, with some counties actually going north and some south, as well as some families being divided internally. My own county was similarly divided even between its own north and south. One local family that has kept some knowledge of its history had at least one such family, with some brothers going north and some south, uncles going north and nephews going south. There is a woman who lives just up the road from me. She is 94 and is the youngest child of the youngest child (there were 14) of the woman who built the house she lives in just after the civil war. Her husband went north with one brother, two other brothers went south. The older sister of the 94-year-old wrote a memoir that made it into the local library. I went up the road to meet her after reading that memoir.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c8884481411730674309 title="comment permalink">8/29/15, 1:47 PM</a><br><br>

The other glue holding the territory together is economic. The Soviet Union planned regional interdependence into its economy. The US federal government supported and encouraged interstate commerce, but did not impose it. The results have been similar. Most economic activity sells to markets beyond the local region. As a result, a large portion of the population moves from state to state in search of economic opportunity, and many people don't live in the places where they were born, or where their ancestors lived. Geographical mobility undercuts regional attachments.<br><br>Most wars have economic motives. I don't think the Union is likely to break apart until one of two things happens. At present, the poorer states get more back from the federal government in the form of subsidies, tax sharing and federal employment than they pay in income and corporate taxes. As the US economy declines, income transfer via defense spending, social welfare programs, highway building, etc. is shrinking. I believe the only significant federal subsidy programs that have grown recently are medical. If a region begins to see the federal government as more of an obstacle to its prosperity than a help, support for breakaway movements will rise out of self interest. We've seen some agitation of this sort in the intermountain West, but it hasn't come to much yet. <br><br>If infrastructure decay and disasters reduce interstate commerce to the point where local economies are mostly decoupled from the national economy, people will start thinking of their region or state rather than the entire country as their homeland, just as they did before the Civil War. <br><br>Sooner or later, one of these trends will either require devolution of power to regional state compacts, or break apart the Union. I'd prefer the former, but the latter seems more likely. I'm writing here of popular uprisings. Nations can also be dismembered by outside forces.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c1581963275507274702 title="comment permalink">8/29/15, 1:55 PM</a><br><br>

Thought I would respond since I have grew up in Seattle and the surrounding area. I currently live on the Olympic Peninsula near Port Townsend. <br><br>The climate is in a period of change. We are now experiencing a real drought situation. Not as bad as CA.. yet. Last winter there was very little rain or snow in the mountains and only a few days of freezing weather. When I grew up summer temps were more moderate. A 90+ day was rare, now they are pretty common and even a triple digit temp is not rare. As I write this we are having a very strong windstorm which is at least a month early. <br><br>As for Seattle. I loved it when I was growing up and even as a young adult. It was friendly and easy to get around in. You couldn't pay me to live there now. Rents and house prices are out of sight. Traffic is a mad house. I've been told that the bus and light rail system are pretty good though. <br><br>On the positive there are some great places to live outside seattle. Where I live in Port Hadlock is one. Edmond's and Kingston, Snohomish valley, and others. Where I live has a plethora of small organic family farms with an abundance of vegetable, eggs, chickens, masses of fruit, some great little restaurants, farmers markets, small community oriented stores.

I'd like to go in for school, work, fun etc but not to live.<br><br>@Glen thanks for the help!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c8355707909495288036 title="comment permalink">8/29/15, 7:20 PM</a><br><br>

Im not saying that most people don't still move around the U.S freely for mostly economic reason. I'm not saying that some kind or kinds of revolutions/secession movements are going to happen tomorrow. I was merely comment and giving a general idea of my opinion on some of the attitudes on the subject in the U.S and where it may lead in the future. You'll notice that my posts are purposely broad and a little vague. I was just trying to give a general idea, on again, my opinion on the matter, and some facts. <br><br>As far as secession/revolution goes: Again, no where close to it now, but the seeds are starting to be planted. Again, most people still would not do it, but the fact that a lot would even entertain the idea kinda points to the possibility at some point in the future. If you look a few posts back, JMG thinks something like this might happen even sooner than I do. This however is set in 2065, 50 years from now, more than long enough for these feelings to grow. Mind you, I'm not jumping up and down happy, or happy at all about it. But history and time doest care what any of us want. <br><br>Again these are just my thoughts and feelings, not trying to proclaim that I have some all knowing knowledge or something like that.

I see it heading in that direction, but think the timetable may not be as soon as this story or "Twilight's Last Gleaming" for much of the same reasons that Deborah Bender describes and also because even a status quo that's obviously crumbling often seems to hang on for a surprisingly long time, such as the current economic bubble, even if it crashes next month it still held on far longer than most people following the issues would have thought five or six years ago.<br><br>I think it's highly probable that something like the first half of "Twilight's Last Gleaming" will occur before 2030, possibly much sooner, with the US losing its empire and becoming much poorer. However, I don't see a breakup happening as immediately after that as "Twilight's Last Gleaming" proposes. I imagine it will take at least a few years of the US as a third world country, with starvation being a real threat for enough people, for the momentum toward breakup and.or mass insurgency to reach a tipping point. That point could be reached sooner if a truly fascist regime takes over, but it will take a lot to override the inertia of the status quo.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c4909076796870297954 title="comment permalink">8/30/15, 7:51 AM</a><br><br>

Obviously I agree that its very possible that the U.S may break up in the relatively near future based on some kind of cultural/political/ideological grounds. Again I'm not really cheering here as (unpopular as the sentiment is starting to become) I actually like some of our difference and think mixing them has a more positive effect than negative one. But, as Ozark said, a breakup is probably inevitable at this point, though perhaps not as soon as JMG is predicting.<br><br>@JMG as far as the whole race/ethnicity thing of the U.S and its contribution to its split- I agree with you that its not nearly as a factor as the cultural/political/ideological grounds. I was just trying to give Urasachi a general break down since he commented on it.<br><br>@JMG as far as moving to Seattle WA area goes- that is very disappointing. I was actually very much looking forward to heading out that way. But now that its got the Archdruids stamp of disapproval.... I still may consider it haha. Or at least somewhere further inland in the area. Honestly I had just wanted to move to a reasonably pleasant metro area (though of course it won't be perfect) that was relatively surrounded by some very beautiful wilderness. I love the country but I'm still young and I have to admit the ease of access of things to do in a city and well, yea the occasional clubbing, still appeals to me. By or on the coast would have been a plus, but I'm not so sure that's a good thing right now, for reasons that should be obvious to someone in the climate change community like yourself. I can think of one city that I think meets most of my standards, Anchorage, AL. But to be honest, I'm not really ecstatic about moving to the same state that Sarah Palin is from.... though I've heard pretty good things about the city itself.<br><br>Nate<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c8789185802066664479 title="comment permalink">8/30/15, 3:01 PM</a><br><br>

Culturally, demographically, and historically, KY is more southern than northern, and the Ohio River is a more logical national border than the border between KY and TN. It doesn't make sense to me to put TN in the Confederacy and KY in the Midwest. The only "Yankee" part of KY (besides the carpetbaggers) is the northern KY suburbs of Cincy. Southern Baptists are the largest religion, the state is a crazy quilt pattern of counties using metes and bounds that were not surveyed into neat geometric squares like the Midwest, most of the counties have been dry, not to mention the general animosity and sense of "otherness" that has existed forever between KY and its northern neighbors. KY'ians regard themselves as closer to and more similar to their fellow mid southerners in TN, Ark. and had similar accents to boot. I'd be interested to know your rationale behind lumping KY with its northern neighbors, what tilts it more in that direction than the CSA. Confederate veterans in my hometown cemetery will turn in the graves if they're lumped in with the Yankees in the Midwest. :)<br>HalFiore,<br>creating a scapegoat of the Confederacy to be is not becoming. I could easily envision a multicultural, multicolored South of the future that creates a totally new myth of the antebellum era and the original CSA as a noble and valiant agrarian stand against industrialism, based on the beliefs and writings of the Southern Agrarians and I'll Take my Stand. I can imagine this future, embraced by multicolored people clearly of African, European, and Latino origin, causing both racist white Confederates and Civil Rights activists to turn in their grave, but, then again, you must remember that the current myth of the South as national scapegoat and evil other has just as little to do with reality as well. As JMG has said, the conditions that enable slavery, a labor shortage and plantation agriculture, won't exist on a planet of 7 billion for a good long time. The freed slaves who established Liberia ended up recreating the plantation South in Liberia. If people in the South are relying on the largesse and power of the federal government to create a sense of safety and mistrust their neighbors of whatever color that much, then perhaps they shouldn't be living in the South.

And the African-American man who was probably the last baby born a slave in this nation was still alive when both of our choldren were born (1969 and 1971). <br><br>When I was a boy, the strongest of the cometiung narratives about the Civil War seemed to me to be, "OK, we had that war and some things got settled at last. No one has to like the specific way they got settled, but they're settled now. Now let's pull together and make this nation work again, whether we like how things got settled or not." You could buy small desk-flag sets with a Union and a Confederate flag side-by-side, and what that seems to have symbolized for most people was, "Two distinct heritages, but one nation now and forever more, born in a sea of spilled blood." I used to own one of those sets, though it got lost somewhere along the way.<br><br>All that common purpose broke down, so far as I remember, in the '60s and '70s, when a multi-front culture war started up. I blame the self-righteous on all sides, and the discovery that televizing the culture wars was obscenely profitable. I have always hated self-righteousness, a little kore strongly when the self-righteous person happens to be on (what I think is) the right side of history (or ethics or morality or justice).<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c7152507518659020743 title="comment permalink">8/30/15, 6:35 PM</a><br><br>

As far as people still remembering the horrors of something that happened centuries ago- agreed. Even though the actual historical details very often get muddled or even changed completely, the FEELING of those events is what really gets passed on to future generations and sometimes it can be hard for them to go away. This can have positive effects and/or negative ones depending on the situation. I'm not even gonna touch the whole confederate flag issue except to say that I wish people weren't going so crazy over it on BOTH sides of the debate. Thanks for the well wishes!<br><br>@Shane Wilson - Your vision of a multicultural/multicolored south that's changed the mythos of the Civil War era as agrarianism vs industrialism is actually quite interesting! Stranger things have happened and as you say the current mythos surrounding it isn't exactly correct either. It kind of reminds me of a conversation I had with a classmate a while back about how history isn't as written in stone as most people think.<br><br> I can think of a few reasons history could change over time right off the top of my head. "History is written by the victor!" Its an old saying, but its true. People who win a war against another nation or culture often change the history of not only the losing side but there own to fit more into how THEY viewed the conflict. Usually painting themselves as totally 'good' in there eyes and the loser as their idea of totally 'evil'. Then there's the change of historical "facts" over time to more fit into a cultures changing values and ideals. Even just the personal bias of the Historians or Scholars writing the books, scrolls etc. A good example would be the depictions of the Roman Emperor Nero by most scholars of the time. Most of them, or at least most of the ones we still have records from, hated his ass. So its more than appropriate to think there description might have been a little one sided. Also just losing certain descriptions of an event, like a full honest rendering, and only having something that basically amounts to one writers opinion or not even that. It would be a little funny if people of the future got some of their "history" of the U.S or the world of today from what is basically fantasy fiction.<br><br>Nate<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c785432272849601753 title="comment permalink">8/30/15, 7:14 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, the history of slavery is pretty nasty. The north doesn't have clean hands in that matter either, with a few individual exceptions, northerners were perfectly happy to buy the products of southern slavery. Also, the whole US was built upon some pretty nasty history of exploitation of American Indians. Not that the US is unique in such things either, among other places Britain has all of its history of colonialism and exploitation, and its not demonized like the south is.<br><br>The south has plenty of its own regional differences that go back to its settlement, highlands vs lowlands being the biggest division. The south had its own internal struggles during the Civil War (such as the East Tennessee unionists, martial law was declared there by the Confederate government) and its unclear how well it would have held together in the long term had the Confederacy won its independence in the war. The south is no more monolithic than the north, and although the sort of racist, bible thumping caricatures in most people's minds are certainly present, that doesn't mean they'd actually achieve their goals. I can imagine if a new Confederacy does actually form, plenty of those most eager to see it happen will end up disappointed on the result (the same holds true for other regions ad well). Just looking at demographics, whites may be a minority in some southern states in a few decades, and once the balance of global power shifts away from the west, a white minority wouldn't have the backing of the global power structure anymore.<br><br>As contrary as it may sound, I also wonder if the south may actually be less likely to go for an orderly breakup as in Twilight's Last Gleaming than many other parts of the nation. My reasoning is that places not in the former Confederacy are more likely to be able to bring people from different ends of the political spectrum and of many races together to support secession/breakup, while in the Confederate states secession is too closely associated with whites and right wing politics to have as broad an appeal as to get a majority to support it. Insurgency is another matter, however, as it could be quite a force to reckon with without being an actual majority.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c3002600916682805418 title="comment permalink">8/30/15, 7:21 PM</a><br><br>

The other thing is that certain provinces naturally "pair" with certain states and it is most parsimonious to imagine them as part of nations with their American state counterparts rather than provinces further removed. Manitoba &amp; Saskatchewan w/the great plains states, Ontario w/the Great Lakes states, Alberta w/the Mountain West, BC w/the Pac NW, and the Maritimes w/New England. Not that there wouldn't be HUGE issues combining a Westminster Parliamentary Monarchy w/an American Republic system, but considering that both Quebec &amp; Louisiana marry civil law systems w/English Common Law nations, some accommodation can be done. Most of Canada's history has been in reaction to the US, though. The settlement of the Loyalists as a result of the American Revolution, confederation in response to US encroachments during the Civil War.

It is classified as light rail, but these were thirty ton cars, not city trolleys.<br><br>Electrified rail is more efficient than locomotives hauling their own fuel, and also more flexible in that it's relatively easy to give most of the cars their own propulsion motors, enabling the dispatchers to break up long consists into short ones depending on demand. However, electrified rail systems have maintenance problems of their own.<br><br>You can't power a track of any length from end to end from just the ends. Intermediate power stations are required or the voltage drops when a load is put on it. If one of those power stations gets a blown transformer, that section of the line goes dead. <br><br>The interface between the third rail or the overhead power line and the moving train has to be tight to avoid arcing which starts fires or stops the train. But the train is moving most of the time, and different cars will ride higher or lower on their suspension depending on load, so the connection has to flex somewhere. You're talking about a mechanical contact with a whole lot of amps flowing through it, making and breaking from point to point every second. What could possibly go wrong?<br><br>You also need to fence or otherwise limit access to the third rail, to prevent people and animals from stepping on it and frying themselves, or something conductive being dropped across the third rail and the running rail, crowbar-ing the system. (Usually the item melts, opening the short circuit; then a bunch of breakers and things have to be reset.) The rail has to be protected from rain and snow. If it's an overhead power line, it's vulnerable to everything that happens to overhead power lines. <br><br>Marin County, California had a passenger rail system from the late 1800s until the 1940s. One branch line ran a few blocks from my home. Initially it was fossil fueled; later they electrified some of it. A few years ago, Marin County and Sonoma County persuaded the federal government to pay some of the capital costs of restoring limited passenger rail service on part of the old right of way (not the part in my neighborhood). I'm sure they considered electrifying the line, but they went for plain old diesel locomotives instead, probably because of the initial cost. If the thing catches on, maybe they'll electrify it later.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c9182804233332487431 title="comment permalink">8/31/15, 5:33 PM</a><br><br>

(For example, dragging space travel and other claptrap of the industrial age into the <i>Star's Reach</i> universe, or making the US win in <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i>.) My stories are at war with the conventional wisdom, and I ask fanfic writers to respect that and leave the basic presuppositions of the stories unchanged. <br><br>Jbucks, you get tonight's gold star for catching that.

You asked for my opinion, and I gave it. That doesn't mean you have to follow it. <br><br>Shane, interesting. I suppose it could go either way, but very large parts of the southern Midwest are as southern as Kentucky is -- Indiana had more Klan members in the 1920s than any other state in the Union, for example, and southern Illinois was a hotbed of Confederate sympathies during the war and long afterwards -- and I've watched a range of cultural differences between the deep and shallow South widen over the years. <br><br>Btidwell, the agenda isn't veiled at all. This story, as suggested by the title <i>Retrotopia</i>, is using the literary form of the utopian narrative to explore alternative social, political, and economic systems. I hope to make it entertaining to read, but it's no more a novel for its own sake than <i>Ecotopia</i> was. <br><br>Ozark, that's a valid point. One of the things that's featured in both my stories about the dissolution of the United States is that it wasn't a matter of the South trying to go its own way; in both cases, the Union fell apart, leaving the states to regroup on a regional basis.

Anyone who grew up during the Cold War knows about that sort of thing! And anyone with the smarts of a street vendor who has a soundtrack at his stand or truck could come up with the idea, it's so obvious.<br><br>So - saving a science fiction "damping field", or the threat of retaliation, what's to prevent it?<br><br>And how WILL Carr pay for things inside the borders?<br><br>We also have the question of adolescents, who when something is forbidden, hidden, or disapproved of by the adults, will seek it out. So do they give their kids a year outside to get their fill of that world? (Oooh - new reality series for the Outsiders, "neoAmish girls run wild" (and get into BIG trouble, as newbies will.))<br><br>Nor would I assume the Lakeland kids would be immediately disgusted by the Outside. "The fleshpots of Egypt" are always a great attraction. "How you gonna keep them down on the farm after they've seen Paree?"<br><br>Oh, lots and lots of questions.

It is not, and never was meant to be or work as a savings account system. The money you put in those 47 years did not go towards your Social Security check, but all those retired and disabled people drawing Social Security while you were working. Elders for whom Social Security did not exist began receiving checks immediately when the system took effect in the 30s. Social Security is not a savings account system, the funds you paid have already been paid out to people drawing it when you were working. Likewise, social security benefits being paid today come from current FICA taxes, so are being paid on the backs of today's workers, many of them Millenials who will never see a cent.<br>Most of the Millenials went into debt for education because they were told a Bachelors Degree was the absolute minimum to have a someone decent paycheck, and graduate school was required to be well off.

Let's look at today's LTE: LTE with 1800/2600MHz (for urban regions) has a cell radius of only 2km. LTE 800MHz for rural areas offers 10km.<br><br>It's not only the transmission power, however, but also the timing. GSM has a maximum theoretical distance from cell phone to tower of about 35km. If you are on the sea, in a ship, you may even have a signal display at 40km, but the cell phone will not register with the tower because of the transit time the signal may not exceed.<br><br>Next thing, who in Lakeland would buy the Veepads? How would they put their trade record straight, what should they deliver in turn? And most importantly, if people in Lakeland don't use Veepads, then there is no point in things like "social media". Even if you had a Veepad, your friends wouldn't. Not least because they wouldn't have a signal anyway (except those close to the border).<br><br>Now of course other frequency ranges like short wave have much more range, but the data rate they allow for is not useful for such applications. Plus that exactly the range would mean that the cells are very big, which would mess up the whole thing even more because radio is a shared medium. In bidirectional mode (internet), the available bandwith gets divided by the number of participants in a cell, you see.<br><br>So there is no need for a dampening field, physics alone will do.<br><br>Since bidirectional applications either lack range or bandwith, unidirectional transmission would be the way to go for spreading "news" (i.e. propaganda, of course) to Lakeland. But that would be old-fashioned radio, not Veepads.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c3167237059667052081 title="comment permalink">9/2/15, 12:19 PM</a><br><br>

I spent almost 20 years running the personnel management, payroll, etc of a company that would have up to 200 individuals on payroll in any given year. You are right that the system was set up to be an "insurance" program, but starting in 1968 the federal government stopped even pretending that there was such thing a "social security trust fund." To cut to the chase, the CATO Institute--no liberal policy wonks them--admits that in the intervening years at least 2 trillion dollars have been applied to other government functions and will never be put back into social security. In 2009 the payouts to recipients exceeded FICA taxes collected and that trend will probably never reverse. Given enough time it will put to a lie all the bogus "employment" statistics coming out of both sides of the political spectrum and the last we are likely to hear on the matter is: "Well, it always was just a 'promise' to pay, it was never a legal 'obligation'.<br>It is absolutely going to be major part of the collapse that is the subject of this blog.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-dawn-train-from-pittsburgh.html#c5591324332793718741 title="comment permalink">9/2/15, 12:35 PM</a><br><br>

Social Security is the kind of "insurance" that was common with the old lodges - you know, the Masons, Odd Fellows, Elks and so on and so forth. They went bust frequently because they weren't actuarially sound, which doesn't mean that they didn't try.<br><br>To use insurance terminology, it's an annuity beginning at 67 and payable for the rest of the insured's life. If you tried to get it from an insurance company, the agent would ask you how much you wanted, and then they would tell you what you'd need to pay. The problem with Social Security is that both the pay-in and pay-out are set by politicians, not by insurance company actuaries, so the pay-in is way too small for the benefits.<br><br>Currently, there's more coming in than is going out (which will change in, I believe, 2017 or thereabouts); the excess goes into the Social Security Trust Fund, which is, by law, invested in a special class of US Treasury Bonds that pays below-market rates and cannot be sold on the open market.<br><br>To put it another way, excess Social Security revenues are currently propping up the government's deficit, and when the flow switches around, they're going to have to be paid back out of general revenue.<br><br>There are solutions, none of which are politically palatable. The most obvious one, if one wants to maintain it as a defined contribution system would be to let the retirement age float.<br><br>PS. I'm an insurance industry insider. I worked for Continental Assurance Company for around 25 years, and had gigs at Allstate Insurance after that.
