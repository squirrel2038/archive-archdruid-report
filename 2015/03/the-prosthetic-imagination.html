<div class=MsoNormal>
Two news stories and an op-ed piece in the media in recent days provide a useful introduction to the theme of this week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>. The first news story followed the official announcement that the official unemployment rate here in the United States dropped to 5.5% last month. This was immediately hailed by pundits and politicians as proof that the recession we weren’t in is over at last, and the happy days that never went away are finally here again. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This jubilation makes perfect sense so long as you don’t happen to know that the official unemployment rate in the United States doesn’t actually depend on the number of people who are out of work. What it indicates is the percentage of US residents who happen to be receiving unemployment benefits—which, as I think most people know at this point, run out after a certain period. Right now there are a huge number of Americans who exhausted their unemployment benefits a long time ago, can’t find work, and would count as unemployed by any measure except the one used by the US government these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As far as officialdom is concerned, they are nonpersons in very nearly an Orwellian sense, their existence erased to preserve a politically expedient fiction of prosperity. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
How many of these economic nonpersons are there in the United States today? That figure’s not easy to find amid the billowing statistical smokescreens. Still, it’s worth noting that 92,898,000 Americans of working age <a href=http://m.cnsnews.com/news/article/ali-meyer/628-labor-force-participation-has-hovered-near-37-year-low-11-months>are not currently in the work force</a>—that is, more than 37 per cent of the working age population. If you spend time around people who don’t belong to this nation’s privileged classes, you already know that a lot of those people would gladly take jobs if there were jobs to be had, but again, that’s not something that makes it through the murk. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We could spend quite a bit of time talking about the galaxy of ways in which economic statistics are finessed and/or fabricated these days, but the points already raised are enough for the present purpose. Let’s move on. The op-ed piece comes from erstwhile environmentalist Stewart Brand, whose long journey from editing <i>CoEvolution Quarterly</i> to channeling Bjorn Lomborg is as perfect a microcosm of the moral collapse of 20th century American environmentalism as you could hope to find. <a href=http://blog.longnow.org/02015/02/06/jesse-ausubel-seminar-media/ >Brand’s latest piece</a> claims that despite all evidence to the contrary—and of course there’s quite a bit of that these days—the environment is doing just fine: the economy has decoupled from resource use in recent decades, at least here in America, and so we can continue to wallow in high-tech consumer goodies without worrying about what we’re doing to the planet.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a savage irony in the fact that in 1975, when his magazine was the go-to place to read about the latest ideas in systems theory and environmental science, Brand could have pointed out the gaping flaw in that argument in a Sausalito minute. Increasing prosperity in the United States has “decoupled” from resource use for two reasons: first, only a narrowing circle of privileged Americans get to see any of the paper prosperity we’re discussing—the standard of living for most people in this country has been contracting steadily for four decades—and second, the majority of consumer goods used in the United States are produced overseas, and so the resource use and environmental devastation involved in manufacturing the goodies we consume so freely takes place somewhere else. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That is to say, what Brand likes to call decoupling is our old friend, the mass production of ecological externalities. Brand can boast about prosperity without environmental cost because the great majority of the costs are being carried by somebody else, somewhere else, and so don’t find their way into his calculations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The poor American neighborhoods where people struggle to get by without jobs are as absent from his vision of the world as they are from the official statistics; the smokestacks, outflow pipes, toxic-waste dumps, sweatshopped factories, and open-pit mines worked by slave labor that prop up his high-tech lifestyle are overseas, so they don’t show up on US statistics either. As far as Brand is concerned, that means they don’t count. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We could talk more about the process by which a man who first became famous for pressuring NASA into releasing a photo of the whole earth is now insisting that the only view that matters is the one from his living room window, but let’s go on. The other news item is the simplest and, in a bleak sort of way, the funniest of the lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>According to recent reports, state government officials in Florida are being <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/03/09/florida-state-most-affected-by-climate-change-reportedly-bans-term-climate-change/ >forbidden from using the phrase “climate change”</a> when discussing the effects of, whisper it, climate change. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is all the more mordantly funny because Florida is on the front lines of climate change right now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Even the very modest increases in sea level we’ve seen so far, driven by thermal expansion and the first rounds of Greenland and Antarctic meltwater, are sending seawater rushing out of the storm sewers into the streets of low-lying parts of coastal Florida towns whenever the tide is high and an onshore wind blows hard enough. As climate change accelerates—and despite denialist handwaving, it does seem to be doing that just now—a lot of expensive waterfront property in Florida is going to end up underwater in more than a financial sense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The state government’s response to this clear and present danger? Prevent state officials from talking about it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We could look at a range of other examples of this same kind, but these three will do for now. What I want to discuss now is what’s going on here, and what it implies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s begin with the obvious. In all three of the cases I’ve cited, an uncomfortable reality is being dismissed by manipulating abstractions. An abstraction called “the unemployment rate” has been defined so that the politicians and bureaucrats who cite it don’t have to deal with just how many Americans these days can’t get paid employment; an abstraction called “decoupling” and a range of equally abstract (and cherrypicked) measures of environmental health are being deployed so that Brand and his readers don’t have to confront the soaring ecological costs of computer technology in particular and industrial society in general; an abstraction called “climate change,” finally, is being banned from use by state officials because it does too good a job of connecting certain dots that, for political reasons, Florida politicians don’t want people to connect. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To a very real extent, this sort of thing is pervasive in human interaction, and has been since the hoots and grunts of hominin vocalization first linked up with a few crude generalizations in the dazzled mind of an eccentric australopithecine. Human beings everywhere use abstract categories and the words that denote them as handles by which to grab hold of unruly bundles of experience. We do it far more often, and far more automatically, than most of us ever notice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It’s only under special circumstances—waking up at night in an unfamiliar room, for example, and finding that the vague somethings around us take a noticeable amount of time to coalesce into ordinary furniture—that the mind’s role in assembling the fragmentary data of sensation into the objects of our experience comes to light. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When you look at a tree, for example, it’s common sense to think that the tree is sitting out there, and your eyes and mind are just passively receiving a picture of it—but then it’s common sense to think that the sun revolves around the earth. In fact, as philosophers and researchers into the psychophysics of sensation both showed a long time ago, what happens is that you get a flurry of fragmentary sense data—green, brown, line, shape, high contrast, low contrast—and your mind constructs a tree out of it, using its own tree-concept (as well as a flurry of related concepts such as “leaf,” “branch,” “bark,” and so on) as a template. You do that with everything you see, and the reason you don’t notice it is that it was the very first thing you learned how to do, as a newborn infant, and you’ve practiced it so often you don’t have to think about it any more. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You do the same thing with every representation of a sensory object. Let’s take visual art for an example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Back in the 1880s, when the Impressionists first started displaying their paintings, it took many people a real effort to learn how to look at them, and a great many never managed the trick at all. Among those who did, though, it was quite common to hear comments about how this or that painting had taught them to see a landscape, or what have you, in a completely different way. That wasn’t just hyperbole:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the Impressionists had learned how to look at things in a way that brought out features of their subjects that other people in late 19th century Europe and America had never gotten around to noticing, and highlighted those things in their paintings so forcefully that the viewer had to notice them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The relation between words and the things they denote is thus much more complex, and much more subjective, than most people ever quite get around to realizing. That’s challenging enough when we’re talking about objects of immediate experience, where the concept in the observer’s mind has the job of fitting fragmentary sense data into a pattern that can be verified by other forms of sense data—in the example of the tree, by walking up to it and confirming by touch that the trunk is in fact where the sense of sight said it was. It gets far more difficult when the raw material that’s being assembled by the mind consists of concepts rather than sensory data: when, let’s say, you move away from your neighbor Joe, who can’t find a job and is about to lose his house, start thinking about all the people in town who are in a similar predicament, and end up dealing with abstract concepts such as unemployment, poverty, the distribution of wealth, and so on.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Difficult or not, we all do this, all the time. There’s a common notion that dealing in abstractions is the hallmark of the intellectual, but that puts things almost exactly backwards; it’s the ordinary unreflective person who thinks in abstractions most of the time, while the thinker’s task is to work back from the abstract category to the raw sensory data on which it’s based. That’s what the Impressionists did:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>staring at a snowbank as Monet did, until he could see the rainbow play of colors behind the surface impression of featureless white, and then painting the colors into the representation of the snowbank so that the viewer was shaken out of the trance of abstraction (“snow” = “white”) and saw the colors too—first in the painting, and then when looking at actual snow. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Human thinking, and human culture, thus dance constantly between the concrete and the abstract, or to use a slightly different terminology, between immediate experience and a galaxy of forms that reflect experience back in mediated form. It’s a delicate balance: too far into the immediate and experience disintegrates into fragmentary sensation; too far from the immediate and experience vanishes into an echo chamber of abstractions mediating one another. The most successful and enduring creations of human culture have tended to be those that maintain the balance. Representational painting is one of those; another is literature. Read the following passage closely: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Eastward the Barrow-downs rose, ridge behind ridge into the morning, and vanished out of eyesight into a guess: it was no more than a guess of blue and a remote white glimmer blending with the hem of the sky, but it spoke to them, out of memory and old tales, of the high and distant mountains.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By the time you finished reading it, you likely had a very clear sense of what Frodo Baggins and his friends were seeing as they looked off to the east from the hilltop behind Tom Bombadil’s house. So did I, as I copied the sentence, and so do most people who read that passage—but no two people see the same image, because the image each of us sees is compounded out of bits of our own remembered experiences. For me, the image that comes to mind has always drawn heavily on the view eastwards from the suburban Seattle neighborhoods where I grew up, across the rumpled landscape to the stark white-topped rampart of the Cascade Mountains. I know for a fact that that wasn’t the view that Tolkien himself had in mind when he penned that sentence; I suspect he was thinking of the view across the West Midlands toward the Welsh mountains, which I’ve never seen; and I wonder what it must be like for someone to read that passage whose concept of ridges and mountains draws on childhood memories of the Urals, the Andes, or Australia’s Great Dividing Range instead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s one of the ways that literature takes the reader through the mediation of words back around to immediate experience. If I ever do have the chance to stand on a hill in the West Midlands and look off toward the Welsh mountains, Tolkien’s words are going to be there with me, pointing me toward certain aspects of the view I might not otherwise have noticed, just as they did in my childhood. It’s the same trick the Impressionists managed with a different medium: stretching the possibilities of experience by representing (literally re-presenting) the immediate in a mediated form. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now think about what happens when that same process is hijacked, using modern technology, for the purpose of behavioral control. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s what advertising does, and more generally what the mass media do. Think about the fast food company that markets its product under the slogan “I’m loving it,” complete with all those images of people sighing with post-orgasmic bliss as they ingest some artificially flavored and colored gobbet of processed pseudofood. Are they loving it? Of course not; they’re hack actors being paid to go through the motions of loving it, so that the imagery can be drummed into your brain and drown out your own recollection of the experience of not loving it. The goal of the operation is to keep you away from immediate experience, so that a deliberately distorted mediation can be put in its place. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You can do that with literature and painting, by the way. You can do it with any form of mediation, but it’s a great deal more effective with modern visual media, because those latter short-circuit the journey back to immediate experience. You see the person leaning back with the sigh of bliss after he takes a bite of pasty bland bun and tasteless gray mystery-meat patty, and you see it over and over and over again. If you’re like most Americans, and spend four or five hours a day staring blankly at little colored images on a glass screen, a very large fraction of your total experience of the world consists of this sort of thing: distorted imitations of immediate experience, intended to get you to think about the world in ways that immediate experience won’t justify. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The externalization of the human mind and imagination via the modern mass media has no shortage of problematic features, but the one I want totalk about here is the way that it feeds into the behavior discussed at the beginning of this post: the habit, pervasive in modern industrial societies just now, of responding to serious crises by manipulating abstractions to make them invisible. That kind of thing is commonplace in civilizations on their way out history’s exit door, for reasons I’ve discussed <a href=../../2013/11/toward-green-future-part-three.html>in an earlier sequence of posts here</a>, but modern visual media make it an even greater problem in the present instance. These latter function as a prosthetic for the imagination, a device for replacing the normal image-making functions of the human mind with electromechanical equivalents. What’s more, you don’t control the prosthetic imagination; governments and corporations control it, and use it to shape your thoughts and behavior in ways that aren’t necessarily in your best interests. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The impact on the prosthetic imagination on the crisis of our time is almost impossible to overstate. I wonder, for example, how many of my readers have noticed just how pervasive references to science fiction movies and TV shows have become in discussions of the future of technology. My favorite example just now is the replicator, a convenient gimmick from the <i>Star Trek</i> universe: you walk up to it and order something, and the replicator pops it into being out of nothing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s hard to think of a better metaphor for the way that people in the privileged classes of today’s industrial societies like to think of the consumer economy. It’s also hard to think of anything that’s further removed from the realities of the consumer economy. The replicator is the ultimate wet dream of externalization: it has no supply chains, no factories, no smokestacks, no toxic wastes, just whatever product you want any time you happen to want it. That’s exactly the kind of thinking that lies behind Stewart Brand’s fantasy of “decoupling”—and it’s probably no accident that more often than not, when I’ve had conversations with people who think that 3-D printers are the solution to everything, they bring <i>Star Trek</i> replicators into the discussion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
3-D printers are not replicators. Their supply chains and manufacturing costs include the smokestacks, outflow pipes, toxic-waste dumps, sweatshopped factories, and open-pit mines worked by slave labor mentioned earlier, and the social impacts of their widespread adoption would include another wave of mass technological unemployment—remember, it’s only in the highly mediated world of current economic propaganda that people who lose their jobs due to automation automatically get new jobs in some other field; in the immediate world, that’s become increasingly uncommon. As long as people look at 3-D printers through minds full of little pictures of <i>Star Trek</i>
replicators, though, those externalized ecological and social costs are going to be invisible to them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
That, in turn, defines the problem with the externalization of the human mind and imagination: no matter how frantically you manipulate abstractions, the immediate world is still what it is, and it can still clobber you. Externalizing a cost doesn’t make it go away; it just guarantees that you won’t see it in time to do anything but suffer the head-on impact. </div>

In our second year, someone gave us a 3D printer. For a while I taught classes and workshops on how to use it, but I found myself spending increasing amounts of time trying to fix it; and at the same time my students were going un-taught. I'd turned from the actual humans in my charge, into a <i>servus robotici</i> — a servant of the robot, which is really what a 3D printer is, a CNC plotter capable of moving in X and Y dimensions, and a limited Z range of motion, attached to a feedstock of plastic wire and a heating element.<br><br>For all its vaunted technological efficiency, the 3D printer produced a lot of the product which bears the technical name "spaghetti" —a partly-complete model with some sort of code-bug in the middle of it which caused the print head to veer wildly, creating mass amounts of loops and whorls of... cheap plastic garbage. For every "clean print" of a model, I got five or six garbage ones. Some of this was the result of the 3D modeling skills of the students (and their teacher, me, I'll admit).<br><br>When the machine broke, I didn't replace it. For one thing, it was expensive to operate, both in terms of my available hours to fix it and set it up for each print and prep it for the next one, and feedstock to keep it ready to generate more cheap plastic junk. <br><br>But for another, it didn't teach the students <i>enough</i> for the cost. Sure, they learned some 3D modeling skills. But the printer did not reward care and attention and deliberate action. A sloppy, crude model was likely to print fine, while a carefully-executed and planned model would fail for unknown reasons that could not be determined. The machine rewarded slip-shod design, and threw up obstacles to deliberate care.<br><br>Someone gave us the money to buy a new one. And so I persuaded them to let us build a wood-shop with the money instead. Some power tools, to be sure, but mostly hand tools for measuring, cutting, drilling, smoothing, and shaping wood. Imagine: A whole woodworking shop suitable for teaching 3D shaping, for the price of one machine that can do nothing but create junk already ruined for the landfill!<br><br>Now someone proposes that I spend the budget I have on LittleBits — premade toys for teaching electronic circuits. With an eye-roll, I point them to the soldering irons and the full case of tiny drawers of electronics parts we already have...<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c7736626735036654422 title="comment permalink">3/11/15, 7:54 PM</a><br><br>

A starship - much like a planet - is a very closed system. 3D printers are rubbish – nuff said. When they can do resilient and strong metalwork, I’ll be impressed, till then they are a toy.<br><br>PS: The views here are distant, the mountains gently undulate, even when they reach above 6,000ft. The country is worn down by age. Depending on the season the colours are different too. Winter is green and grey, whilst summer is blue and grey. Scars in the landscape are generally distinct and red/brown, with the occasional yellow. The skies are a rich blue, which turns deeper when the day is at an end. Heat brings on the unmistakable smell of eucalyptus oils which hang in the air like a blue haze and obscure distant detail. Every four or five years, the trees will flower and the entire mountain range smells of honey and the buzz of insects reaches its peak. Summer days bring on the drone of grasshoppers and cicadas - it is an unmistakable sound. The birds call in the morning and at the evening, whilst at midday only the fast moving small birds take advantage of the hot lull and you can hear their chirps as they dart amongst the shrubs seeking shelter and feed. None of the birds here sing, but many have lonely and beautiful calls that strike your heart with a depth that is surprising and can’t be easily forgotten. The nights are alive with bats, gliders, rodents and and hovering above all are the owls.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: This weeks blog <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Aerials in the sky</a> covers a DIY antenna, autumn weather closing in, commencing the wood shed project, refurbishment of the overlocker, replacing the intended strawberry bed with a cottage garden, usage of woody mulch, usage of mushroom compost and the commencement of the house construction.

Is the count of unemployed persons limited to just those people receiving unemployment<br> insurance benefits?<br><br> No; the estimate of unemployment is based on a monthly sample survey of households.<br> All persons who are without jobs and are actively seeking and available to work are<br> included among the unemployed.

There is no requirement or question relating to<br> unemployment insurance benefits in the monthly survey.<br><br>(end of faq extract)<br><br><br>It’s calculated from two nationwide surveys, conducted monthly, called the Household Survey and the Establishment Survey. The first is of 60,000 households, the second is of approximately 143,000 employers. The official definition is: “Each month the Current Employment Statistics (CES) program surveys approximately 143,000 businesses and government agencies, representing approximately 588,000 individual worksites, in order to provide detailed industry data on employment, hours, and earnings of workers on nonfarm payrolls.”<br><br>Here’s where to find the official press release: http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm .

There is absolutely no excuse for commercial producers to be casting some untalented hack in a McDonald's commercial when, for almost the same price, they could cast a classically trained thespian with serious training and credits and just happens to be delinquently behind on his/her car/mortgage/credit card/rent payments. Times are no better for actors than they for most everyone else, and I’m embarrassed at the thought that producers are not taking advantage of how easily they could be exploiting some of the best performers in Hollywood.<br><br>Kidding aside, at the Los Angeles casting studio where I work - and where 95% of our business comes from the casting of television commercials - it’s not uncommon to see hordes of people trying to snag a very limited number of audition spots. I remember there was one casting director who had one day to cast a video game spot, and had enough time in that day to see a hundred people. To fill those hundred audition spots, he received something like 5000 headshot submissions.<br><br>What is more interesting is when you have callbacks and the director/producers/ad agency people all show up, and when you actually get a chance to listen to how a lot of these decisions are actually made, and I will tell you that the prosthetic imagination certainly works both ways, for the people making these decisions are themselves operating from a perspective where their own imaginations have been heavily manipulated. One of the sadder examples is a situation that comes up reliably every six months or so, where the production/ad agency team will decide they want to do something “new” and “edgy” by doing a commercial with an interracial black/white couple, something they’ve exposed to plenty of times in the media but probably not very often in person. And what starts to happen almost every time is that, when they see two actors of different races being all kiss and lovey right there in front of them in the audition, they start having second thoughts, because something about the real experience - not the manipulated media one - but the real experience of watching two people convincingly interact like that makes them feel uncomfortable in a way they didn’t anticipate.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c1420862411545122793 title="comment permalink">3/11/15, 10:22 PM</a><br><br>

Great site. What he does is really quite simple; he has a record of all the "adjustments" to calculating GDP, unemployment and the rest that the government has made in the last 30 years or so. He then just backs them out. You can then see unemployment as it would have been reported under, say, Ford. It's not a pretty picture.<br><br>The sheer amount of statistical tomfoolery is mind-boggling, to say the least. But the entire edifice now rests upon it, truly. The only way we can continue to service our debt is through financial repression. That requires treasury rates to be below inflation rates. But high official inflation rates would be politically untenable today, especially given all the money printing nationally and internationally in the last 6 years. Yet a lowered inflation rate means a higher "real" GDP number. And just like that, you have the "recovery." It's a simple product of our chosen debt management strategy. <br><br>Never mind the fact that GDP prints have error bars of +/-3% anyway, and growth has averaged less than that. This means, even by the government's own admission and figures, that it's entirely possible the last twenty years have been a recession (overall, barring the fluke quarterly spike). Moreover, downward revisions after prints now outpace upward revisions by like ten to one.

The great majority of the most successful and privileged boomers seem to me to be concerned with conserving nothing quite so much as their own comforts and privileges. <br><br>Last month a local magazine did a piece on promoting the maker movement in schools, and as is drearily familiar with all such articles I've seen to date, by far the greatest play is given to robots and 3D printers. I now understand more fully why robots have always left me cold, and am coming to positively loathe the very notion of 3D printers. These prosthetic obsessions appear to me to be the greatest impediments to people in the maker movement learning to, you know, actually *make* things - like, with their hands, for instance. <br><br>The replicator from Star Trek reminds me of a proposed device described by Nigel Calder in his book "Spaceships of the Mind," published in the 1970s. It makes any artifact or consumer product you want by molecularly reorganizing bits of moon rock or asteroid or whatever else happens to be handy. It's called a Santa Claus Machine. How exactly it is to work was left a little vague. The same book contains a photo of a young man whose t-shirt is blazoned with the motto "Lunar Mine by '89," an exciting development that I am sure we all await with baited breath. <br><br>RT has reported that the singer Sarah Brightman will be giving a concert from the International Space Station. In the interview, she enthused about being involved in something so representative of the future. I've nothing against Ms. Brightman, a fine vocalist, but as she is a very famous and therefore - I infer - wealthy individual, this tends to confirm my impression that privilege generally insulates people from noticing unpalatable realities that conflict with their preferred beliefs. <br><br>I've been noticing with increasing perturbation the effects of a great deal too much television watching on the mentality of my family members. Their degree of emotional engagement in this unproductive, downright detrimental activity has grown increasingly disturbing.

I think the blindness itself is another hidden externalize created by increasing layers of complexity of both society and technology. We are essentially drowning in our own abstractions.<br><br>I somewhat blame the control systems of the modern household for giving us the illusion of simplicity. Lightswitch on/off, oven on/off, faucet water on/off. I fear that being raised with so many mindlessly simple control systems and sheltered from the inter workings, wiring, elements, valves/pipes, we have left ourselves with an immensely strong habituation of looking for an on/off switch. The mindless drivel surrounding climate change and the environment has us literally looking for a on and off switch. We are not looking for solutions, we are looking for a button to press.<br><br>The way someone who has grown up raising chickens on a family farm and someone who has grown up microwaving a bag of pre-breaded chicken tenders have two very different ideas of where chickens actually come from. For the latter person the chicken comes from a bag in the refrigerator. The parents may have to buy the bag of chicken in a grocery store, they are privy too a deeper layer of complexity of chicken production than the child, however they are completely ignorant of the chicken processing plant and transportation warehouse network. For each layer of complexity we have placed we cover the concept of "chicken" in another mental shroud. eventually the number of mental shrouds separating the abstraction chicken from the actual chicken approaches the limit of what short term memory can muster. Each layer of complexity and technology throws the original meaning deeper and deeper into abstraction until it is divorced from anything meaningful. Perhaps there are many negative externalities like this that we are by and large completely unaware of because they are not quantifiable.<br><br>Then again this is basically what Vico suggested when civilization reaches the "Barbarism of Reflection". I am not sure if he also noted that the death by abstraction was the principle reason most civilizations were too paralyzed to do anything about their own tragic fate. Is systems blindness really a symptom of the barbarism of reflection?<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c8718597745432200199 title="comment permalink">3/12/15, 12:27 AM</a><br><br>

If you believe your own lies everyone else does too. In Hollywood they say'if you can fake being genuine you've got it made'. The so-called mass media and advertising, as well as the govt. and industry reports to our MOT offices to coordinate Newspeak adjustments to expressive phraseology. We receive instructions from above. The Plan and Reality are completely separate entities. I wonder myself how far the RDA has drifted since my childhood but since old records are eliminated upon reality adjustments to the 'Ever Present' no one knows. Tomorrow will be different. I am uncertain if my marmelade is less sweet due to sugar rationing to be concrete, if I am really so old or if the calendar is being manipulated. Perhaps the MOT is just not told everything,or at least not my division. It is better to believe the RDAs if one is to remain in Acceptable Perceptual Boundaries(sanity).

In general, most OECD nations count it in the same manner and it *doesn't* rely on collecting benefits. However, for me, this doesn't change the validity of your point since it is still a highly dubious measure. As you no doubt know, if you stop seeking work (ie give up as there is nothing out there for you) then you are not counted in the headline unemployment rate anymore. The general rule of thumb my economist teacher told me was to just double whatever the headline rate stated to get a reasonable idea. A better measure is nationwide hours worked, and here in Australia at least, it has markedly declined over the past 5 years. Anyway, I only say this because it is the sort of quibble that some people might use to conveniently ignore your entire argument.<br><br>On a similar note, here in Australia, since a conservative government changed the rules in ~1998, our official inflation rate *excludes* house prices. That's right, the single most expensive purchase for most Australians is simply omitted like it is not a thing. Coincidence this was implemented just before the largest property boom since the gold rush times of 1890 (and from which the subsequent crash real house prices took nearly 100 years to recover)?<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c5312561030772726584 title="comment permalink">3/12/15, 3:30 AM</a><br><br>

Of course this works just fine for those disseminating the prosthetic images--in fact it could be considered an added bonus.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c3622151186674980979 title="comment permalink">3/12/15, 3:39 AM</a><br><br>

The exhibition was breathless in its discussion about the possibilities of 3-D printing and what it would mean for production going forward especially in the developing world. <br><br>Naturally they glossed over how that would really work. I've been to one of the poorest countries in the world (Togo) and a complex machine that can't handle dust and has plastic inputs from China is the last thing they need. Like - how do you fix something that was produced from a 3-D printer? Well, the assumption seems to be that you just print again. How do you fix this glorious machine that will be sent to each village? Nothing. This would end up like the library they had at the village that was built and donated by some Southern US Christian charity - the charity had sent English language books. To a country in French-speaking West Africa. So it sat there unused. Because no one asked the villagers and their leaders what they wanted to do with their village. They just assumed...<br><br>They also glossed over something very fundamental - who the hell is supposed to design things? All they could do is show the 3-D printer as something that anyone could replicate things with. But what about original design? What about the waste? What about the fact that this is all oil based? Nothing. Total silence. And no historical context at all as to what it would mean for society nor how production of goods is changed by and changes the very societal context in which it is produced. It was such a wankfest, I actually had to leave. I was livid.<br><br>A few days later, I went to the V&amp;A. There was an old hidden dusty part of the vast V&amp;A (old school design museum) which discussed the changes of industrial production over the past 250 years and the impact on society that this had. You could read quotes from great thinkers over that time and understand the direct impact that this massive change in production had on society. It was moving.<br><br>And on a similar note, did you see this hilarious article about Google Ventures? http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-09/google-ventures-bill-maris-investing-in-idea-of-living-to-500 The article is called "Google Ventures and the Search for Immortality". It is as bad as it sounds. We must change ourselves as humans and use technology since - “It will liberate us from our own limitations.” These people really hate being human.

It is, of course, my withdrawal from the world as mediated by the little box of flickering pixels that the majority have installed in their living rooms. I literally do live in a different world to that of most of my neighbours, and I find the term 'prosthetic imagination' a very apt description! <br><br>I do still listen to the radio, where, someone once said, 'the pictures are better', but I find it easier to maintain a distanced viewpoint from what I'm hearing. It somehow seems less prone to complete domination by the corporate agenda, or at least that agenda becomes more transparent, and the nuances of strict definitions (such as 'jobless rates' etc etc) become clearer.<br><br>One advantage to all this is that I can report that I don't actually know which fast food outlet uses 'I'm loving it' as a slogan, although I do harbour something of a guess as to its identity ;-) <br><br>So Florida is to be renamed 'Submarine Base 2' perhaps, to match my homeland's status as 'Airstrip 1'? Has the chocolate ration been increased from 30 to 20 grams per week also? One of the founding tenets of Newspeak is that the unspeakable becomes unthinkable. The unthinkable then becomes impossible. I wonder how long it will be before Florida unilaterally redefines the sea-level datum point rather than admit the actual level is rising?<br><br>Slightly more tongue in cheek, about the reconstructive nature of our visions from literature, I should point out that my native soil is in the EAST Midlands, which is OBVIOUSLY Tolkien's model for 'The Shire' - and my experience of the WEST Midlands (as a student in Birmingham) casts that region as the model for Mordor. Though to be fair, I did reside a while in Elgar Country near the Malvern Hills, which I grant could be an annexe of the Shire.<br><br>Much to chew on in this week's post, so I'm going to reread it over my second breakfast....<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c7785078324069407618 title="comment permalink">3/12/15, 4:38 AM</a><br><br>

I just wanted to ask real quick, if I can. You believe in rebellion, freedom and love, right?"<br>Mom: "Absolutely, yes."<br>Dad: "Rebellion, freedom, love."<br>Stevo: "You two are divorced. So love failed. Two: Mom, your a New Ager, clinging to every scrap of Eastern religion that may justify why the above said love failed. Three: Dad, you're a slick, corporate, preppy-ass lawyer. I don't really have to say anything else about you do I dad? Four: You move from New York City, the Mecca and hub of the cultural world to Utah! Nowhere! To change nothing! More to perpetuate this cycle of greed, fascism and triviality. Your movement of the people, by and for the people got you... nothing! You just hide behind some lost sense of drugs, sex and rock and roll. Ooooh, Kumbaya! I am the future! I am the future of this great nation which you, father, so arrogantly saved this world for.

There is a lot of corruption and general faux-thinking patterns left over from previous times, and more accumulating now, and worst of all is, people do get ever more daft than, say, 40 years ago or a century ago. They can't much think for themselves, not just the commoners, but also those who are meant to be the reference/guidance for the crowds. So the big question really is, how can it all be healed?

I remember watching a lecture he gave that turned up on youtube ( I think it was at the red room) where his answer to the question of how he would have educated his children got cut off in a video edit. Personally, I will send my kids to public school, but will try to supplement their education as much as possible. I try to teach my 17 month old as much as I can on my own and he is never in front of a screen.<br><br>I have considered writing about my experiences as a stay-at-home dad (SAHD) in the context of deindustrialization. Many men find their wives working, because our economy is more geared towards the kind of service jobs women do, while the kind of jobs men traditional do have become more scarce. At the moment the blog and potential book would concentrate more on doing the most with the home economy, as my son is young and I don't feel I could give any direction in parenting beyond his current age. But eventually I would incorporate parenting. It would concentrate on cooking, gardening, herbal remedies, entertaining kids without electronic gizmos, and the reasons for doing those things. I think a resource like this, especially one geared towards SAHDs would be welcome. Though I'm sure it would be useful to those outside that target demographic. If I can find time I might start the project soon.

Thanks for talking about how climate change is impacting Florida. That was one of my main reasons for leaving Miami Beach and moving back to the old family farm in eastern NC. <br><br>Five or six years ago, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties openly discussed the need to drill more municipal water wells along their western borders b/c the ones along the coastline were slowly becoming inundated with salt water due to sea level rise.<br><br>The south western corner of Miami Beach was also regularly flooded during high tide when I lived there. Not significantly but the water did come up from the storm drains and a few inches or more were on streets such as Alton and West ave. Talking to locals who had lived there much longer than me, it was a common occurrence for me to hear that this tidal flooding wasn't the way things used to be. Years and years ago, the streets would only get flooded like that due to storm surge or very rarely a full moon high tide. <br><br>I moved away about three years ago and since that time Alton road has undergone a major construction project to raise it and improve drainage.

I left a short comment there; <i>"Seems Stewarts devolution is nearly complete..... 'gollum!, gollum!'"</i> I've given up trying to be kind to folks of Brand's calibre.<br><br>Moving on to this Report sent something of a chill up my spine, with the same link I just abandoned angrily, and your LOTR reference. Being not-so-prone to supernatural and spiritual tendencies, I still have to wonder if this event is indicative of some underlying abstractive process I'm ignoring (or perhaps not abstract at all?).<br><br>As for the uncounted unemployed, I fall smack into that category. Prior to 2008, my wife and I held four jobs (two each). Now we have one (officially) between us. Not that I haven't had some fairly pitiful opportunities to return to the roles of the officially employed, but after multiple evaluations of cost vs. benefits, it became apparent that whatever opportunities were available amounted to a net loss, all costs considered. Since we were already making other arrangements, mine outside of the formal economy, we decided to stick with what was working, although on a lower level, financially. Seems there are real benefits in the 'gray' economy, and from producing one's own goods and services (avoiding intermediaries and externalities) that the formal economy doesn't want us to even consider. Harkens back to the days of single-income families that has been so abstractly (and concretely) erased from most folks lists of possibilities.<br><br>It would be interesting to hear about what other arrangements readers here have made; how many others have decided to shun the formal economy, such as it is. How's that working out?<br><br>That that economy is failing certainly isn't an abstraction to those paying attention. The trick is to find that knife's-edge between what is and the quest to weather the storm of what's to come. Just another tricky day I suppose, out here in the nether-lands, avoiding the traps of modernity.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c2185158419629894673 title="comment permalink">3/12/15, 8:08 AM</a><br><br>

If you think about it, any index reported for a long enough time period, if the change were constantly skewed to present a biased picture, would eventually head toward zero or very large. But the reporting of an absurdly small number has an effect, which I gather might be your point.<br><br>The smaller number makes relative change look a lot more significant than it is. So they can trumpet a few percentage points change (in this case, from 5.7% to 5.5%). This gives the illusion, and provides some sort of mental gratification, that changes are occurring. Now apply that change to the U6 number, and it doesn't look nearly so impressive.<br><br>My second thought is that, from what I've read, that fast food burger actually does provide something that gives it more appeal than your description of the tasteless atrocity that it, without doubt, is. That particular combination of grease, salt, simple carb rush, and who knows what other psycho-active chemicals delivered in the disgusting package is the result of extensive physiological and psychological research. Whole university departments are dedicated to that sort of research. (At my alma mater it as called "Food Science and Technology," which should tell you all you need to know.)<br><br>So, yes, the advertisement is indeed selling something other than the actual experience had when eating the product.

Lewis is apt:<br><br>"It's all in Plato, all in Plato: Bless me, what do they teach them at these schools?"<br><br>Reading through the various pros and cons in the 3d printing article Ruben linked, was the people touting 3d printing kept going on and on about the artisitc things one could make, but never really answered the question about how many things you actually NEED that could be made with one. I mean really, if you look around your home how many things are there that I would need to replace often enough to justify a 3d printer to make replacements. It pretty much insures a continuation of the modern disposable mentality. Jevons paradox would likely come into play as well. I can eaily envision the owner of the 3d printer simply filling their house with 3d printed junk because they CAN. And how this is different than filling their house with Chinese plastic junk from Walmart is never addressed.<br><br>I wonder why the "prosthetic imagination" has gained such a hold. I go back and forth in a "chicken and egg" fashion. Does the prosthetic imagination take the place of something we are lacking as a people, as a culture? I mean, we have enough of a cultural patrimony that you have to wonder why they get any traction with creating false images. On the other hand, I can't deny that fortunes are made through the crafting of the prosthetic imagination. Following the money is usually a safe bet. Still the question remains, why have we impoverished ourselves to the extent that this prosthetic imagination (a great term by the way) as able to fill the vacuum?<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c4398574429538079617 title="comment permalink">3/12/15, 8:19 AM</a><br><br>

That is known as U-3, one of six unemployment rates published by the BLS. The broadest U-6 measure was 9.5%, including discouraged and marginally attached workers.<br><br>Up until the Clinton administration, a discouraged worker was one who was willing, able and ready to work but had given up looking because there were no jobs to be had. The Clinton administration dismissed to the non-reporting netherworld about five million discouraged workers who had been so categorized for more than a year. As of July 2004, the less-than-a-year discouraged workers total 504,000. Adding in the netherworld takes the unemployment rate up to about 12.5%.<br><br>The Clinton administration also reduced monthly household sampling from 60,000 to about 50,000, eliminating significant surveying in the inner cities. Despite claims of corrective statistical adjustments, reported unemployment among people of color declined sharply, and the piggybacked poverty survey showed a remarkable reversal in decades of worsening poverty trends."<br><br><br>So it seems that by excluding long-term discouraged workers, the effect achieved is similar to excluding those who exhausted their unemployment benefits, since those groups will largely coincide. <br><br>Interesting that the phrase "netherworld" is used, not exactly standard econo-speak. The virtue of shadowstats is that he just calculates things they way the Govt used to calculate them, which makes it a bit hard to argue with.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c2042157211563003651 title="comment permalink">3/12/15, 8:20 AM</a><br><br>

Because your insights are devastating and so incontrovertibly substantiated, the accompanying lightness of tone helps "the medicine go down."<br><br>I love the way you've built-upon last week's discussion of prosthetics, and slowly, clearly built your case in this essay with those three excellent examples (shame about Mr. Brand's love affair with ignoring externalities and worshipping at the altar of Whiz-Bang Ever-Upward Final-Frontier-ism...

A had a stepsister (RIP, she succumbed to cancer) who had suffered a serious eye infection which forced its surgical removal; in your description of our unconscious processing of things we see before us-- a tree-- you mentioned that one automatic/ unconscious process we engage is that of determining the viewed objects' distance from us...<br><br>I recall from my experiences with my stepsister, and from things I've run-across on this topic, that depth perception-- judgment of distance-- is greatly-to-totally impaired in using/ having only one functioning eye... As I understand it, our mind engsges in automatic, basically mathatical (speaking of abstractions) calculation of distance by "comparing" the two eyes' perspectives...

Having been in the manufacturing industry for 25 years, I can remember these devices before they were called 3d printers. Back in the 90's they were called "Stereo Lithography" machines or" Polymer Deposition Rapid Prototype Device", and found some use in creating protoypes or molds for making castings of real material. But later some wag named them 3D printers to evoke the image of something that would be as cheap and easily operated as a desktop printer. In fact the mass produced motion technology of the inkjet printer enabled these "plastic squirting" devices to be made cheap ( within a certain size range). <br> Where most people run off the rails in promoting 3d printers is in forcasting the amazing and usefull things they will be able to do in the near future. One of the most common mistakes of Techno-optimists is in miss applying Moores Law. They assume that the rapid reduction in cost and increase in speed of microprocessors that has occured in the recent past applies to all technological fields. Thus the huge numbers of people who proclaim that in the near future that batteries will be cheap and have huge capacity, Drones will deliver packages to our homes and 3D printers will make replacement brake rotors for your car right in your own basement. <br> The leap from a 3D printer that can squirt out a plastic "happy meal toy" to one that can make a working brake rotor is immense and involves real materials, energy and old school manufacturing technologies like machining and casting that are not getting any cheaper. <br> Most people do not realize that they have had "3D Printers" that can make metal parts for several years now. They are called CNC Laser Sintering or other such names. I was involved with a manufacturer who had some laser sintered parts made for a new product. The machines that do this cost upwards of $500,000 and use lasers to melt and bond high tech metal dust together. In addition to the need for a powerfull laser, these machines have a working compartment that is heated to nearly 900 degrees because even the expensive lasers used can't melt the metal dust at room temperature. Then this working area has to be flooded with inert gas so melting metal dust does not react with oxygen in normal air. None of these things ( energy, powerfull lasers, or inert gas) or the technical suites that make them possible is getting cheaper. So the future of being able to make brake rotors in your basement is not coming. It is just imagination.<br><br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c3074309844580622543 title="comment permalink">3/12/15, 9:38 AM</a><br><br>

It is a challenge, certainly, to wean oneself off seductively comfortable (if erroneous) habits of thought and behavior. And this is without taking into account the resistance to change that comes up when interacting with the rest of society.<br><br>Taking the discussion of prostheses to (perhaps) a more extreme application, would one not be able to say that writing itself is a prosthetic for human memory? In oral cultures, stories are told, rather than read, and the story-telling is a communal act, not an individual one.

The actual problem is that the resource allocation rights for the individual (known as "money") are tied to income work, at least for the masses who don't live on workless rent income. That doesn't make sense when facing more and more automatisation. The extreme case of 100% automatisation would mean that we would have every possible good (within the resource limits), but nobody could buy them. Obviously, the main benefit of the automatisation went to the machine owners, something that Marx had well noticed.<br><br>A possible solution would have been to freeze the living standard, reduce the working hours and deviate from paid work so that the goods produced by the machines would have found their way to the people anyway. Instead, our society popped up the amounts of produced goods so that we still had use for the work force and didn't have to change the allocation mechanism, at least while the resource mining rate could be raised accordingly.<br><br>But hey.. that's capitalism: The stores are full of goods, but the people are poor because they lack the money to buy them. In socialism, by contrast, the people are poor because they have lots of money, but the stores lack the goods.<br><br>In that way, Star Trek combined capitalism with socialism: People prosper because they have the allocation rights and the stores are full.<br><br>In reality, we're going to do the blend in a slightly different way: People are miserable because they lack money, but that doesn't matter because the stores are empty anyway.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c7371721936982472507 title="comment permalink">3/12/15, 12:03 PM</a><br><br>

You get what you pay for, that has nothing to do with the technology. E.g. you can buy a new tent for $20 - which will not be waterproof and is likely to come apart after just one festival weekend. However, you can't conclude that tents are no good because if you are willing to pay $400, you can get a decent, waterproof and lasting tent.<br><br>Some professional machines even can use metal powder through laser sintering, which of course lacks the strength of forged metal, but is still good enough for quite some applications. According to several aviation journals, the door handles in the Airbus A350 are manufactured using 3D printing, which takes advantage of the fact that you can make objects with inner structure (like bones). The result is that the door handles are as stable as before, but the weight was reduced by 30%.<br><br>Other printers can use input material consisting of roughly 40% wood powder and some glue for the rest. By controlling the temperature of the printing head, you can even fake wood texture like annual rings. You can saw, drill and grind the result. But despite the considerable amount of wood in it, it is special waste, due to the glue.<br><br>The obvious drawback is that such professional machines are not affordable to the end customer. However, there are already companies for 3D printing "on demand", and since they combine many individual customers' orders, they can afford more expensive 3D printers. Economy of scale. That has been the same with large colour 2D prints where buying a colour laser printer capable of printing A1 or even A0 paper sheets would be prohibitive to an end customer who may want just a dozen printouts.<br><br>3D printing can have a viable business - not only spare parts (saving logistics and stockpiling), but also prototypes and mock-ups. That saves the expensive tool forms, especially for prototypes where later changes to the forms have to be expected. Or, at least for plastic parts, you can even generate the tool forms using 3D printing - that saves quite some money.<br><br>3D printing is an option even for industrial manufacturing if the desired or an equivalent material is available for 3D printers and if the production volume is not that high - like with aircraft, see the initial example, or with components for ships and yachts.<br><br>So you are right that 3D printing isn't Star Trek replicators, and that we are not going to print out our goods at home anytime soon, if at all. 3D printing will not replace other production methods either, but it is already complementing them. But although 3D printing has been overhyped, there is some real potential in it nevertheless. Especially if you don't lump together consumer and enterprise application, which are two very different domains.<br><br>Gardner's "Hype Cycle" currently sees consumer 3D printing at the "peak of inflated expectations", already plunging into the "trough of disappointment". The "productive plateau" is expected in 5-10 years. Enterprise 3D printing is different in that is as said disappointment phase already behind it and is approaching the productive plateau, which it is expected to reach in 2-5 years.<br><br>Of course, such current industrial developments don't take the looming deindustrialisation into account. But that's a wholly different matter which btw. applies to conventional industrial production as well and thus isn't a counter argument specifically against 3D printing.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c8422383115879072094 title="comment permalink">3/12/15, 12:03 PM</a><br><br>

Currently, it is a wonderful tool for prototyping (<i>really</i> wonderful), and perhaps as an educational technology. However, ecept for stuff that is very small, needs little strength, doesn't need to look very good, and can't be more easily produced by other methods, 3D printing is not currently appropriate to manufacture very much. But I see it being more appropriate for a larger set of applications in the not-too-distant future. It won't solve all of the world's problems, but it already solves quite a few, and will solve a few more as the technology matures.<br><br>CNC routing and milling, on the other hand, are mature technologies and widely applicable. I find both much more compelling than 3D printing in its current form.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I can't decide whether easy access to technologies like CNC routing/milling/printing are good or bad on the whole. On the one hand, they enable more folk to build their own stuff, and perhaps free them to solve their own problems in novel ways. Democratizing design and manufacturing seems like a good thing. Moving manufacturing closer to the consumer (ie. right into their home), should make the externalities more obvious and eliminate many trips to the store. On the other hand, making it easier for folk to make stuff could push up consumption.<br><br>My latest project involving CAD design and CNC manufacturing is bee hives. It will cut the cost of my hives by about half, allow me design to my needs, and the raw materials are locally available. I can see negatives in my choice to build hives locally using CNC, but not enough to outweigh the positives.<br><br>I hope the conflict I feel is coming across.

I found myself, earlier this week, having some difficulty sorting out my reaction to the current <a href=https://populationspeakout.org/ rel=nofollow>Global Population Speak Out</a> project. In a nutshell, they've produced a beautiful large-format hardcover photo-essay book called <i>Overdevelopment, Overpopulation, Overshoot</i> (or <i>OVER</i> for short), to raise awareness of same. (In case the obvious question comes to mind, the book is dedicated in part to William Catton.)<br><br>You can order a hardcopy for $50 or view the entire book online. But the organization is also <a href=https://populationspeakout.org/the-campaign/get-involved/book-champion/ rel=nofollow>soliciting proposals for how one would use a grant of three to ten free advance copies of the book to "raise public and media awareness of global population issues</a>." In other words, they're not really sure how their book will actually help, and so are trying to crowdsource solutions.<br><br>My proposal is to make a video of burning three or four copies of the book to boil a gallon or two of contaminated water into potability, to demonstrate the real nature of one of the eventual consequences of overshoot. (To wit, things you might value highly for their abstract qualities will likely be sacrificed to sustain more basic needs.) At first I thought that idea was just the smart alec portion of my brain (never dormant since being honed to perfection by twelve years of public school) doing its usual thing, but I've reluctantly concluded that that's the best use I can think of, except for using the book to bash certain deserving people over the head with. (That, the organization couldn't possibly approve, for liability reasons).<br><br>In a way this illustrates the phenomenon you discuss in this week's post. GPSO is looking for abstract approaches to resolving a predicament that's very physical in nature, and quite likely having difficulty understanding why they're hard to find. My proposal, while still abstract itself, at least refers to a portion of the relevant physical reality. (The head-bashing one would be less abstract still. Hmm; maybe worth another look.)<br><br>I doubt they'll approve the proposal, despite explicitly requesting "outside the box thinking and provocative ideas." But I'll keep you posted!<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c2353657158842718194 title="comment permalink">3/12/15, 2:46 PM</a><br><br>

That was very insightful, and your discussion of Mr. Brand reminded me of it.<br><br>A relative of mine, a self-proclaimed Environmentalist, serving on boards of non-profit enviro orgs was stunned that I frequently dry my clothes on a rack in my living room, saying, 'But, I like my clothes soft and warm out of the dryer'. He's very pro-recycling, which is great, but not willing to make statement by giving up creature comforts. (Full disclosure, I do sometimes use a dryer for underwear and socks, but usually hang up jeans and shirts to dry. I'm no angel...)<br><br>I have also thought part of the fascination and postive press for 'green' electric vehicles comes from that they are considered to be futuristic, not that they have any substantial environmental benefits when the industrial systems needed to provide such vehicles (both the material for manufacture and source of electricity) are taken into account. I have a friend that has converted a car to electric power, and lot of his interest has been the 'look' of it, the electronic gauges inside, etc., ignoring how nasty the pollution is that produced said <br>electronics for the gauges, etc. As an aside, the cheering for photovoltaics, which are produced like computer chips, bugs me too. Someone is drinking the industrial effluent from the processes that produce those things. My point isn't <br>to bash the technologies, just the wilful ignorance of not thinking through implications of producing them.<br><br>Another thing that I find strange is how in most recent popular articles on environmental concern anymore seem to fixate solely on greenhouse gas production of various activities or products, so as to ignore all manner of the rather acutely toxic chemicals produced as a result of our electronic consumer products fetish, not to mention packaging waste, off-gassing of fabrics, etc. It is as if the flux and circuit board etching compounds, plastic enclosures, and rare-earth heavy metal production and endocrine disrupters that go into them don't cause pollution in countries that the production facilities where those items are produced were moved to (to reduce externalities here, of course). I don't know if it is just easier to think in terms of a side effect you don't think you can control ('more CO2 from buying this product, but what can you do?') versus 'this produces toxic sludge from the plant, which would make me evil'.<br><br>Also, I remember watching some cable tv show (maybe HGTV or a home show) where the discussion was about 'green' or environmentally friendly department store window displays. I thought, maybe not having one at all to display your wares would be the most environmentally friendly statement....

Sometimes I see a news item about a study showing the inaccuracy of human memory or various other flaws in our perception, thinking or senses. I don't take issue with most of those studies themselves, as you've written about here and in greater detail on your other blog, the world we experience is interpreted through our minds and isn't an exact reflection of what's out there. What I have an issue with is the way these things are presented in the media, which so often leads to the messages of "don't trust your own experience, believe what the culture and the media tells you" and also "human perception is flawed, technology is the cure".<br><br>That logic doesn't make much sense. After all, culture, mass media and technology are created by humans in the first place, so there's no way putting faith in them will free anyone from what they perceive to be flaws of human perception and thought. It just enriches the pockets of those selling them consumer lifestyles.<br><br>I'd also like to take a closer look at the example of the Sun and the Earth, because I've seen it used by others as a fallacious argument. The argument often goes something like "Mere observation shows that the sun revolves around the Earth, and we know that to be false, that's an example of why your own perceptions and observations are often best ignored." The problem is, nobody perceives the sun revolving around the Earth, we perceive the sun rising in the East (often north or south of East depending on the season), making its arc across the sky and setting in the west, then coming up again the next day. Going from that to "the sun revolves around the Earth" is an abstraction, it would be an easy one to make if we didn't know better, but it's still an abstraction, not an observation.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c7604148451532337021 title="comment permalink">3/13/15, 9:19 AM</a><br><br>

ADR has radically altered my conception of the world in ways that counteract the effects of mass media, social pressure and my conventional education. I need a weekly reminder of the deception at the heart of the Establishment, because it still pervades my life. It doesn’t help that I’m living with my retired parents, whose continued comfort (and moral satisfaction) depends on the status quo. I think my generation (X) and our successors are, by necessity, more subversive.<br><br>Insofar as "occult" means "hidden," you could say that consciousness of the externalities of the economy has become occult knowledge, with all the transgression that connotes. Ergo, it should come as no surprise that an Archdruid is bringing it to our attention. As we have become more removed from the natural world, knowledge of our effects on the environment has become more subversive. <br><br>We've also resorted to sentimentalizing Nature, worshipping it in lieu of helping it, as if it were already dead or beyond saving. Of course, industrial society is the lost cause, no matter how much our culture would like us to believe that Nature itself is endangered. Our ecological niche faces the greatest danger. Progress has convinced many of us that Nature can’t survive without us, when the truth is just the opposite.<br><br>I remember being disappointed as a kid when we went on vacation, because the sights never looked as good to me in person as they did on TV. Television inflated their aura. I never understood why restaurant commercials would trumpet their “homemade” cooking. To me, “store-bought” or “industrially produced” beat “homemade” any day of the week. As I see it, the problem for we post-Boomers is not that we confuse the prosthetic experience with the physical, but that we prefer the prosthetic. <br><br>I didn’t start eating organic food until my mid-20’s, and only now, at the age of 37, can I say I’ve almost completely overcome my fondness for fast food. Obviously, there was a physical component to the shift in my palate, but I attribute most of the change to an emotional recovery. I no longer need junk food to summon the safety I felt in childhood.<br> <br>Real Life has been drained of possibilities by the electronically-mediated alternatives. iPods didn’t destroy street socialization with strangers; that technology emerged to fill a void that had already been created by TV and video games. Even we Gen-Xers find it awkward standing next to strangers in silence at the bus stop. Smartphones relieve that anxiety.<br><br>The Virtual Reality of TV, video games and the internet is a safe zone with all consequences externalized. It can only meet our needs on a superficial level, but it will never reject us. The Real World offers no such guarantees, and, as people have increasingly opted for artificial activities, there are fewer chances for real human connection. The Real World thus provides less motivation for people to leave their electronic cocoons.<br><br>I posted a new essay, "The Dustbin of History," on my blog, <a href=http://ridingtherubicon.blogspot.com/ rel=nofollow>Riding the Rubicon</a>, this week.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c2231759714874566624 title="comment permalink">3/13/15, 11:36 AM</a><br><br>

While I appreciate the point of your article, I feel your handling of the "Nature is Rebounding" article is not up to your usual standards.<br><br>First, as Luke Devlin tried to point out, your repeated attribution of the article to Steward Brand is incorrect. Mr. Brand is simply summarizing a talk given by Jesse Ausubel. It appears Mr. Brand writes the summaries for all The Long Now Foundation's monthly seminars. I am sure that he does not equally endorse the views of all the talks he summarizes. While Mr. Brand, as the host of the seminars and President of the Board of Directors of The Long Now Foundation, certainly has a large role in selecting speakers, that does not make the ideas his own. Mr. Ausubel would be rightly offended that you are attributing his work to other people.<br><br>I encourage you to watch the talk being summarized at http://longnow.org/seminars/02015/jan/13/nature-rebounding-land-and-ocean-sparing-through-concentrating-human-activities/ You'll find much of it a well thought out and researched position. Though your interpretation of the facts and predictions based on those will likely be different. That is more a reflection of your knowledge of things such as peak oil and resource depletion that are not well understood or believed generally.<br><br>Finally, The Long Now Foundation certainly doesn't share our view of the future, however, I think it is mis-characterizing their views to claim they are trying to avoid confronting "the soaring ecological costs of computer technology in particular and industrial society in general". They are attempting to "foster long-term thinking and responsibility in the framework of the next 10,000 years." Based on other material I've seen from them, I'd like to think that they would welcome other well thought out views of the long term future such as your own. Furthermore, I think their fascinating project of the 10,000 year clock (a clock carefully designed in the hopes that it might be able to run for 10,000 years) bears a resemblance to magic as you have discussed it.<br><br>I think if you sat down with Mr. Brand you would find the two of you had much in common in your thinking though with import points of disagreement.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c830281407956306662 title="comment permalink">3/13/15, 12:04 PM</a><br><br>

The "landscaping" replaces anything that wants to grow there with something alien. I know the native plants and trees in my area, and in a lot of suburbs I don't see a single native species anywhere. It has always made me uncomfortable, being in these places and your essay helps me understand why. <br>I think it would be possible to grow up in a landscaped neighborhood knowing nothing about where you are from, or in other words, not be from there, or anywhere. All places are the same, they are completely abstract, they are empty. In a sterile environment, people don't form the habits of observation, of living through the senses that we need to live like human beings. Really, in a lot of places the people look dead to me, no passion or real enjoyment.<br>In a place where every part is interchangeable, where a Japanese red maple is no different than an Acer rubrum, nothing really matters and we're all just parts in a Henry Ford auto plant. When the landscape is irrelevant it becomes a vacuum that needs to be filled, an ideal situation for selling entertainment or propaganda. Nature is always somewhere else, probably an experience you pay for.<br>All the life around us should be intimate and treasured. It should be known by everyone, for free.<br>Everyone needs to be from somewhere, or else they are homeless in the deepest sense.<br>The Frodo Baggins description made me think of the Berkshire hills.<br>Thanks to Chris for the beautiful description of your home.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c4235702575182977259 title="comment permalink">3/13/15, 12:39 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not too sanguine about that.</i><br><br>Did you know that the Apollo 11 landing (well all of them) were done mostly automated by computer? And that the Apollo 11 computer had to reboot 2,3 times during the powered descent? Fortunately, they designed it to recover after having to reboot and to continue flying the descent module (and there are stories about them constantly and randomly rebooting the guidance computer over and over again in the simulator and fixing anything they could until they could fix no more). It's one of those little facts they don't really tell you too much about. I had to actually go look up what a 1202 alarm actually meant, that's how little any of the official media would tell you about it. I think Armstrong switched over to semi-manual landing guidance (where he was manually feeding requests via joystick to the computer) and that took enough load off it so it stopped crashing. People can argue that it wasn't the computer's fault, but it was crashing and rebooting, and when you're trying to land 250000 miles away, I don't think you really care whose fault it is :) And you wonder why pilots don't trust computers too much.<br><br>My take (coming from the technical world) on automation in general is that it isn't a cornucopia, you're making a tradeoff. You're giving up something to gain something else. Generally what you give up are the little emergencies, having to have someone watch something all the time, or the requirement to hire teams of people to watch over one thing. You can instead hire one person to watch it all by herself, or one person to watch a whole bunch of things. <br><br>What you get in exchange are great big emergencies that happen much less frequently. The big emergencies generally need much more intelligence, creativity and skill to solve than the person you employ to watch over the whatevers generally has on hand. Depending on how automated whatever it is, it could require Einstein level intelligence and creativity.<br><br>So they're going to deploy lots of robots and AI - what I'm going to be watching and waiting for is the Big Boner, where someone left off a semicolon in the code which subtly changes its meaning and it doesn't get caught for months or years until some corner case triggers it and then Hilarity Ensues and doesn't stop ensuing for quite a while afterwards.<br><br>Or my vision of what would happen with the Robot Future(tm), is they would hire a few smart people to design, build and set up the Robot Factories(tm) and then fire all their asses to Save Money. Then the factories would run unattended for decades, until they encountered some condition that they couldn't handle. And then everyone would go back to the stone ages, because they had fired all the people who knew anything about fixing them, and those people had gone off to I dunno, prepare for the inevitable collapse?<br><br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c4626678624981866694 title="comment permalink">3/13/15, 1:37 PM</a><br><br>

Reactions have ranged from impatient dismissal -- “Yep, industrial society is bad for the environment and people in all sorts of ways; I knew that; we all did, why are we wasting so many words and so much pomposity on the point” -- to a fair bit of defensiveness. I keep having to chide myself like a lazy student; “Wait, don't just blow impatiently past this; think about it.”<br>What's triggering all this defensiveness? Guilt, in part, I think; all my efforts to disconnect notwithstanding; I am mired to the neck in industrial society. My homemade herbal remedies and home-cooked meals don't offset driving to work everyday in my car (and to the grocery store, and to visit friends and family...); nor do they offset attitudes like this one; at least until I figure out an alternative way to make filbert milk, you are not prying my blender out of my hands. Guilt for selfishness, accompanied by defensiveness. A feeling of being trapped in this mire, with many of the available choices highly unpalatable, and a sense that, however much I do, it's never enough. But, as long as I don't think too hard, overall, am reasonably happy...<br>On second thought, maybe it isn't surprising that I haven't liked them much. This is not comfortable.<br>And having worked through that, guess I'd better spend some time considering prosthetic imaginations. The Other Tom's comment on that point, about suburban landscaping, was thought-provoking.<br>It seems to me that a prosthetic imagination might be something of a survival requirement in an industrial society, along with a considerable sense of numbness. Because otherwise, being trapped among too much plastic, concrete and steel, surrounded entirely by meaningless artificiality, is suicide-inducing (I mean that literally, not flippantly).<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c2947215573490491341 title="comment permalink">3/13/15, 1:38 PM</a><br><br>

I took him to the seeds we had planted last week, he planted a sugar-snap pea plant. His plant and five others had started sprouting. He helped me water the plant and was re-energized, we spent the last 45 minutes running around play fighting after that. The same thing is happening with my friends. I've took them to the gardening store last week and will be taking some more this week. They're all losing interest in the prosthetic world. It takes the energy of our entire civilization a life time to build this wall around our souls, it takes nature literally days to break them down. It is no wonder our would be leaders fear the power of nature. <br><br>Regards,<br><br>Varun<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c4220183183037385025 title="comment permalink">3/13/15, 2:36 PM</a><br><br>

Right next to it is a sports clothing store. It occurred to me that much of the need for prosthetics and the prosthetic imagination happens because we disembed actions from daily life. An hour of gardening, compost turning, bicycle riding, and walking to the bus -- all things I'm sure many readers in this blog do regularly -- eliminates the need for a gym. That we take so much exercise on machines we don't need -- and buy clothing from a store we don't need to do it -- seems a perfect example of so many of our problems. <br><br>(I wonder, too, in the near future how many prosthetics will be turned into tools. I recently read an article where a man turned one of those gosh-awful elliptical machines into a home grain grinder.)<br><br>Although I do have to admit that I have not been turning the compost very much since it froze solid. :) I'm still learning the ins and outs of it with my recently found copy of <i> Let it rot </i> and a few other resources.

In a college biology class over 40 years ago I had a professor who spent an entire lecture describing the wasteland, that borders on desert, that is a pine plantation. I had never really thought about it although I live in a part of the state where much farmland had been given over to forestry. Dr. Mount had said in his lecture that a pine plantation is a much a monoculture as any you will see and functions the same way. With the small mammals, reptiles and amphibians gone, even the awesome timber rattlers and Eastern diamondbacks have to leave. Left behind is the ravenous pine bark beetle, who when he is found has to be fought with everything that logger man has in order to be defeated. I would suggest to Mr. Brand that he come to the deep south in August, find a safe shoulder of the road to park, walk one hundred yards into the pines and spend fifteen minutes just absorbing the experience--and absorb it he will. The air in there is thick with the fumes of the pine resin and at those temperatures makes it almost impossible to breathe. Loggers are supposed to wear respirators when harvesting the trees, and Mr. Brand will understand exactly why. Add to this the fact that at most the land will be able to produce no more than three successive crops of trees--ninety to one hundred twenty years--and you really are left with sandy soil desert islands pocking this verdant landscape. Not a pretty picture, nor a 10,000 year plan.<br>On the other hand, I certainly hope there is toilet paper here at least for duration of my life!<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c6766067331413721630 title="comment permalink">3/13/15, 4:53 PM</a><br><br>

Its theme is discovering the basic patterns (family relationships) in botany. The author, Thomas J. Elpel, has a brief essay entitled “Nature as Wallpaper” on the inside cover. I think it is tangentially related to the theme of the post this week. The essay reads in part:<br><br>“Nature exists as little more than wallpaper in most people's lives … At best, we are sometimes so taken by a scene … that we pause for a moment to admire the wallpaper … The real world, as people experience it, is the world of people and culture … It is when you stop to say “Hello” to this old friend [a flower you recognize], that the plot thickens, and you notice something new … This is my trap to draw you in one flower at a time, to entice you to wander off the beaten track and into the wallpaper, meeting friends and neighbours as you go … Years later you may find yourself in a meadow of wildflowers and wild life … surrounded by friends you have seemingly always known, only to realize how far you have come … There in the distance is what you once called the real world … But now seems like a house of smoke and mirrors … full of self-importance but empty of substance. The real world, you discovered, was the wallpaper all along.<br><br>Like colours, you need a name for your “neighbours” (denizens of the natural world) to truly recognize them. Like exploited humans or the unemployed, whether these are not recognized because they are not considered worth it, or because it is too threatening to do so, the social slight of being externalized is clearly unwise. Consistently maintained nonrecognition (externalization of the mind) means these potential friends become enemies. <br><br>Nonetheless, I am persuaded those doing the ignoring and distracting basically know the negative consequences of their actions or just don't care one way or the other. It is a mistake to assume those paid to have an opinion speak their own minds let alone the minds of those who pay them. Perhaps there is a little self deception going on; but, basically, those paying the piper just don't care. Their sense of self must be so limited; otherwise, they would not be engaged in the game of privatization of profits and externalization of costs in the first place.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c9050442126378735087 title="comment permalink">3/13/15, 4:54 PM</a><br><br>

Still, you're spot on to pay attention to both sides of the issue.

Gah. <br><br>Peter, the first known artworks date from before our species evolved -- some of the earlier hominids engaged in decorative patterns and very basic representational art. Our species has been making art since it first evolved, which was most of a million years ago. The golden age of cave painting in the Magdalenian was 15,000-10,000 years ago, so it had hundreds of millennia of artistic expression and innovation before it, and there's every reason to believe that the Magdalenian artists did in fact see what they were doing as representations of the world, just as modern representational artists do. <br><br>Ed-M, it is indeed about keeping up appearances.

Of course they won't accept it, but I hope that one or two of the people who read the proposal might begin to grasp the possibility that producing big glossy books about our problems doesn't do much to solve them. <br><br>Librarian, it's on the get-to list!<br><br>Mark, maybe so, but the advertising is critical -- otherwise people might notice that it's much cheaper to make their own greasy junk food at home. <br><br>Dan, I can't speak to that, never having seen the newer version (and having rolled my eyes and giggled at occasional glimpses of the earlier one). <br><br>Random Man, and yet I know a substantial and growing number of people who are extracting themselves from the treadmill in one way or another. There are alternatives. <br><br>Curtis, oh, granted. A "maker culture" where nobody actually makes things, but they all sit around watching a machine make things, is a consumer culture under another name. Makers actually roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty. <br><br>JABA, several people have already brought up sites showing that if you keep calculating joblessness the way it was calculated thirty or forty years ago, the figures are much higher than they are today. Have you noticed the recent flurry of articles wondering why nobody's spending money when there are all these new jobs out there? I'd suggest that this is fairly good evidence for the claim that job numbers are being jiggered. <br><br>Bob, par for the course. I wonder if it's ever occurred to Mr. Huntsman that his chemical company is part of the reason why so many people, including Mrs. Huntsman, are coming down with cancer these days. <br><br>Cathy, thanks for the printing failures link!

Exactly! The moral collapse of 20th century American environmentalism was precisely the unwillingness of the privileged to grapple with the fact that their own lifestyles were crucial parts of the problem -- and nobody whose lifestyle is part of the problem has ever really been part of the solution. <br><br>Cathy, funny. Hang onto your hat, by the way -- the fracking-related bankruptcies and debt defaults are beginning to pile up. <br><br>Gloucon, I'm not talking about the people who make 3-D printers. I'm talking about the people who go around on the internet insisting loudly that someday very soon 3-D printers will solve all our problems by making consumer goods basically for free, and who inevitably bring <i>Star Trek</i> replicators into the discussion, thus showing what they've got stuck sideways in their brains. <br><br>Scotlyn, thanks for the link!<br><br>Ed, industrial capitalism and industrial socialism are slight variations on the same theme: in one, the corporations are the same as the government, and in the other, it's exactly the other way around. Of course the one that happened to claw its way to the top is following the same trajectory toward failure as the other. As for Spengler, no argument, he'd have made a ferocious blogger -- sitting in his sparely furnished apartment, books piled around him, hammering at a keyboard, crafting next week's post on how the EU is making all the same mistakes as the Ming dynasty, or what have you. <br><br>Skintnick, thanks for that. Very elegantly done!<br><br>Tye, thanks for this! It's a great example. "Our bogus figures insist that everything is fine -- why aren't people behaving accordingly?" is a common plaint of elites as they slide down the greased slope into oblivion. <br><br>Denys, ouch. I wish I had an answer; I'm very fortunate to be married to a woman who gets peak oil and the predicament of our time as thoroughly as I do, and learned the skills of getting by from parents who grew up during the Depression! I've seen quite a few marriages torn apart by this sort of thing, so compromise, and a willingness to leave the subject alone, is probably necessary. Beyond that, I don't know what to say. <br><br>Michael, the Onion is a treasure. Yes, I saw that -- they just go from one direct hit to another. <br><br>Moshe, at this point, when somebody says "But we need to grow," you can take that as the expression of a death wish and act accordingly, and by and large, you'll be dead on target. <br><br>Ozark, excellent! In fact, you get tonight's gold star for pointing out a crucial issue. If human thinking and perception is flawed, are abstractions concocted by human thinking and perception going to be less so? How about manufactured products and a built environment made by human beings on the basis of their flawed thinking and perception? How about a virtual environment from which everything but the direct product of human thinking and perception has been removed? If you want to move away from the flawed aspects of human thought and perception, going deeper and deeper into their products may not be the brightest idea...<br><br>Professor P., true, but I prefer less chemical means.

The best thing to do, if you can, is to get books from a locally owned full service bookstore; that's a plus for authors, because most bookstores order two copies when a customer orders one, put the extra on the bookshelves, and if it gets bought, restock: that way lies steady sales, and a happy author. (I also love bookstores and would like to see them thrive, for whatever that's worth.) If you don't have a local bookstore of that kind, please do go directly to the publisher's website and order it there -- I get a bigger share of the purchase price. The huge discounts Amazon demands from publishers to maintain its stranglehold on the industry come out of my royalties, and so I get a small fraction from an Amazon sale of what I get from either a bookstore or a publisher-website sale. <br><br>Roger, no argument; these days it's not uncommon for me to hear edged jokes on the order of "Yeah, inflation's under control, but prices keep going up anyway."<br><br>Robert, I don't normally welcome poetry here, but the thought of Heracles decking John Galt with one blow from a heavily muscled Hellenic fist is too good to pass up. <br><br>Mickey, that's a fascinating concept: knowledge of externalities as a form of occult knowledge. Here's my question: what abilities to shape the universe of our experience do you gain by embracing that form of occult knowledge? <br><br>Dan, because if people let themselves realize what's actually happening, and how close we are to real trouble, they'd run screaming out into the night. Especially for those who've invested everything they have in the fantasy of perpetual business as usual, crunch time is getting very, very close. <br><br>Jeff, so noted; I was mistaken. I took the piece as Brand's, partly because it was presented as such in the websites where I first encountered it, and partly because it resonates so closely with the ideas Brand himself promoted in his recent book <i>Whole Earth Discipline</i> and elsewhere. I took the time to watch the video, by the way, and I don't consider it a well thought out and researched position -- quite the contrary, to my mind it's yet another example of Bjorn Lomborg-style cornucopian cherrypicking, of which we have quite enough already, thank you. As for sitting down and finding common ground with Brand, finally, no, there you're quite wrong; as just noted, I've read his <i>Whole Earth Discipline</i>, and with any person who could write that book, I have no intellectual or ethical common ground whatever. <br><br>Other Tom, excellent! I'm going to give out one of my very rare second gold stars in a night for that -- you're quite correct, of course, and the manufacture of denatured "natural" environments is a critical piece in the externalization of human thought and imagination. <br><br>Bear, it's more than just a refusal to do anything about our problems, it's the flight into a prosthetic reality in an attempt to pretend that the problems don't exist. Your image of the robot future is all too plausible, btw -- you might want to consider that as the basis for a piece of fiction sometime! <br><br>Nm Mm, I think another large part of it is the impact of cognitive dissonance, which is extremely uncomfortable for the human psyche. One of the core gimmicks of the prosthetic imagination is to keep people caught in a series of doublebinds that generate cognitive dissonance, since that makes it easier to get them to distract themselves with the media, or what have you; talking about the kind of thing I'm talking about here makes the congnitive dissonance all too apparent, and people get angry and brittle as a result.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c753945536262974169 title="comment permalink">3/13/15, 9:44 PM</a><br><br>

I'm delighted. If that continues, it's going to be a lot easier to deal with the mess ahead. <br><br>Kyoto, good. The term "simulacrum" has its own virtues, since it stresses the way that what you get from the prosthetic economy isn't what you're told you're going to get, but an imitation or representation of it. That's a core part of the strategy, since you remain dissatisfied and so ready to buy something else to meet the unmet need -- and of course it's just a simulacrum, too, so the dance goes on. <br><br>Curtis, of course! Down the road, you can look forward to exercising in freezing weather by chopping wood for the wood stove, you know. ;-)<br><br>Agent, thanks for the book tip! I'll have to look that one up. As for the people who promote the prosthetic economy, I think you underestimate -- or, shall we say, "misunderestimate"? -- the human capacity for self-deception and acquired stupidity. People can convince themselves of some amazingly brainless things if they think they can get something from doing so. <br><br>Donald, thanks for the reality check from the trenches! As a self-employed author, I don't have a lot of direct contact with the sort of things you've described, but what I hear from friends and lodge brothers certainly seems to point in the same direction. <br><br>August, thank you! I'm frankly startled by the number of predictions of mine that have scored a hit recently -- though I'm glad to say not all have done so; that the world got off its backside and did something to slow down the Ebola epidemic is an immense relief, for example.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c5427443059898785047 title="comment permalink">3/13/15, 9:53 PM</a><br><br>

So happy to have a stool in this virtual living room for these weekly essays and discussions. <br><br>Denys said...<br>"So when one spouse wants to "collapse now and avoid the rush" and the other spouse …"<br><br>Denys; I am in the same boat as you in that respect. In other respects, I'm pretty sure our situations are very different, but hopefully still helpful to relate. <br><br>We are US expats living in Hong Kong for the past 16 years. Our now teen sons are absolutely thriving in an exceptional international school, far more than we could hope to give them anywhere in the US. We stay here primarily for that. We did a massive shrink/collapse starting a few years ago when my husband lost his job and our finances drastically decreased - It was hard, but in a lot of important ways, it was a blessing in disguise.<br><br>The furthest I've gotten in bringing the husband along in properly collapsing is an agreement that in 3 years, when our youngest graduates high school, we can move back to the US and go for it. The one security we were able to keep is our home in very rural Wyoming, so an off-the-grid collapse would be very do-able. This course of action will of necessity be sped up if his current job here in HK ends, or anything else out of our control forces our hand. <br><br>In the mean-time, there IS something to be said for tweaking / incrementally collapsing-in-place to prepare one for such a big change. <br><br> From our Western culture, my husband finds change to LESS dubious and hard to swallow, I'm a change, collapse, go-native maniac and even I'M finding only possible to integrate incrementally). But done incrementally, We've both been able to see and mentally process the costs and benefits of adopting new LESS (in our case, traditional Chinese) methods. I suppose in light of JGM's essays - willingly, even happily shedding our prosthetics, piece by piece, as opposed to having them stripped from us in one big rip.<br><br>All of this personal story in (a probably ham-fisted way of) explanation to suggest that maybe your spouse would accept a timeline of such a bigger change as moving house, (or changing to a closer job?), and in the mean-time, continue implementing ways, in-place, to LESSen your load? <br><br>This week's essay is spot-on in this question - so much of our ability and probability of enduring any societal upheaval depends on our mental/emotional flexibility. IMHO, incremental changes flex the muscles of mental/emotional adaptability. I truly think this is the biggest hurdle to overcome.<br><br>Also, I wanted to acknowledge your post from last week in which you described the hostility and aggression in your neighbors and colleagues - as I've noticed this sharply as an outsider only coming back to the US sporadically over the past years. In my limited visits, I think you're right, there is a palpable aggression and discontent, a feeling of almost panic that seems to have grown. You said you are exhausted, but Kudos to you for mediating and helping them through their own (whether they realize it or not) prosthetic stripping transitions. <br><br>Best Luck to you and yours, <br>Cheers,<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c1907903084118435467 title="comment permalink">3/13/15, 9:53 PM</a><br><br>

I was driving, got lost, and came up to an intersection that should have been familiar, but seemed wrong and confusing.

I had the distinct sensation or impression of a physical mental map floating up and rotating around to the correct orientation. It made me dizzy.

The first is where one partner is really struggling with the issue at hand, maybe disagreeing with you, but wrestling profoundly with it out of respect of your ideas and opinions. In this case I think Caryn's suggestions above are really valuable.<br><br>The second is where your partner is not willing to engage with your ideas at all, which argues a high degree of disrespect for you as a person, a situation which led to my own divorce eighteen months ago. In our case, we married young, straight out of university, and I stayed home and raised a bunch of children and read a lot of books, started gardening and made a lot of jam, while he climbed the corporate ladder and spent a lot of time in business class and plush hotels. <br><br>He is, of course, part of the demographic that has the most to lose from LESS - his wealth, his career, his identity - and I am the demographic who has the most to gain - with no established career I can dabble freely in green wizardry practices which gives me the option of living on very little. <br><br>Do you remember the 70s TV show 'The Good Life'? Tom decided he wanted to live a more meaningful life, so chucked in his job and became self-sufficient in Surbiton. And lucky for him, Barbara was right behind him. But what if Tom had been married to his posh neighbour Margo? Or Barbara to the sybaritic Jerry? Well, that is the trajectory our marriage took..<br><br>My ex-husband and I still like each other a great deal, but have no common ground on which to exchange ideas. Our roads diverged..<br><br>But interestingly, we started out with similar values. And I really do think that the relentless pace of the executive life and the rarefied atmosphere of the of a life lived in boardrooms insulated ex-hub from the realities and values of life as lived by ordinary people. <br><br>And it is a terrible pity, because once he was an immensely practical hands-on person who could fix or build absolutely anything. And now he lives on the tenth floor in an immaculate apartment and only uses his hands to tap out countless emails..<br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c2166154882047110993 title="comment permalink">3/14/15, 12:40 AM</a><br><br>

I cannot offer a properly argued rational case for this, but I do have a very strong gut feeling about what will ultimately prevent its occurence.<br><br>Put simply it is this: I do not believe a self-reflective conscious can be developed that is not embodied. Without a physical body that interacts with the wider world, I suspect no self-awareness can emerge and without this there can be no self-purpose. In effect, all an AI can amount to is an extremely complex machine bound to its initial 'training', remaining incapable of conceptualising an 'I'. I also suspect that the mortality of a body is also a significant factor, and - although I hate to use the term - even if we mimic intellect in a machine, can we ever create a 'soul' in one?<br><br>As I said, I can't really put a solid foundation under this belief, and it is tantalisingly shrouded in shadow.

Goalposts change abroad in asia, europe as well i suppose as we hit economic skids, take on technological prosthetics. If I get back to states would be interesting to get a feel. Incrementalism I know from adjustment to sports routine, diet, reading. Everyone discusses adapting to coming collapse.The situation seems to be different for everyone, everywhere and forced collapse is most likely to force adaptation, unemployment, income reduction, etc. Faux ecothinking is not my bag as I am antisocial. Who could I play hypocrite to? Just imagine having cash for a prius, eco vacations in jungle. If i could plant a garden, land too expensive, too little time. Wife is addict of cop/detective series. Big TV, too much electricity. Hotwater heater on roof saves on gas for washing up on sunny day but not on heating. Insulation and windows good but cheap solar for electric would be useful. Rabbits for meat? Wife talks about beehive. If we had a bit of time and cash we could do a few things. People with kids, jobs, habits have trouble making changes. Lost my desk job from crisis, got a manual low paid job and wife took part time to make it up. So my yoga, biking paid off in ability to do hard work. Panic over possible inflation and worries over rent got us to buy a govt. subsidized eco house. Now we have no cash reserves but are closer to where we should be. This all happens in stages. I bet economy will hit skids globally soon enough and more decisions will be forced on a lot of people which will in the end be healthy for them. The rat race is money based consumerism but oranges and bananas don't grow up here and at the store I get lots of fruit year round with cash. If I can all my own fruit, berries, veggies, mushroom, have own chickens for eggs and produce own energy this will likely be in concert with my local neighborhood as I am average guy, slow adapter, conservative don't stick my neck out kind of guy. This is why a periodic step down crash is good. Wife, neighbours, coworkers, society suddenly accepts, helps with next step in self sufficiency and you can see what is really useful. Prepper end of world stuff or zerocash hippy backwoods selfsufficiency is not mainstream stick in the mud enough for me. There are ecovillages here but that is like joining a commune. Anonymous city life being just like everyone else but having no car, doingyoga, gardening is no big deal. I can afford a better life now because I live cheaper and always saved and that goes for diet, sport in terms of health too. Gradual adaptation, hard work, adjustment. If I am in the middle of modern life but still think like my depression era parents and despise modernism from my gut(and this conservative skepticism is also antieco skeptic as well, out of sheer obstinacy) then I will probably come out ahead in the end. Whoever buys the newest Windows or Apple product before the bugs are worked out gets lots of headaches. Of course in my own hobbies, like yoga, tai chi which don't need group adaptation I can play out my inner radicalism to the core. Internet blogs are also an outlet from conformist suburban boredom.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c1036252242206522157 title="comment permalink">3/14/15, 6:29 AM</a><br><br>

I checked it out and the artwork is beautiful, plus I liked the story excerpts I saw highlighting the teaching and learning relationship between the child and her grandparents.

I will also mention the book over on the Green Wizards forum in the discussion thread on collapsing early with kids on board. <br><br>Denys and Caryn-<br>I too am in a "mixed marriage" as far as awareness of the decline goes. We allow each other a fair bit of space- I garden and can, he plays his computer games and watches TV- and we meet in the middle around the less controversial shared interests like the kids. It's not his fault that I have changed over the course of our marriage- had my "awakening"- and he has not yet. I keep working on the ideas with him as gently as I can. Every news story and purchasing decision is an opportunity for discussion, but one has to be careful- JMG is right that it's very threatening to always be chipping away at your spouse's faith in the religion of progress. We just had a very disheartening (to me) conversation around space exploration that showed me that he really still hasn't given up that belief that humankind is meant for the stars. Sigh. At least with our host's insight about Progress as a religion, I can respond more sensitively, realizing that I am challenging some very important core beliefs in someone for whom they have worked fairly well so far. As usual in marriage, I'm attempting to employ patience and kindness and persistence, but also just to let things be and do my own thing, and leave him the right to do his. I don't have the right to choose his worldview for him, but I can try to share mine as the opportunity arises. I really hope that the dawn of his understanding won't be too late, but that's not within my control. I can be as prepared as possible myself, however, and be ready to be the rock if his worldview is forced into an abrupt change by outside circumstances.

Have you noticed the recent flurry of articles wondering why nobody's spending money when there are all these new jobs out there? I'd suggest that this is fairly good evidence for the claim that job numbers are being jiggered.</i><br>You're right about this of course, but it is tangential to the issue that I raised and actually kind of illustrates the problem that I was trying to point out: Things are bad enough without posting wildly inaccurate claims such as, “Still, it’s worth noting that 92,898,000 Americans of working age are not currently in the work force—that is, more than 37 per cent of the working age population.”<br>Unless of course you consider my 83-year old mother-in-law “working age”. <br>I’m not trying to be provocative. I’m just pointing this out because it could potentially raise questions about your credibility for newcomers to your site.<br>Personally I think there are some positive aspects to seeing the drop in labor force participation. After all, if one were to adopt your LESS approach there’s pretty good odds that at least one family member would drop off the official roles and either work off the grid or focus on household services.

What a wondeful salon this is, and I'm finally motivated to chime in. <br> <br>I am a professional data modeler, meaning I create abstract models of the who, what, when, where, and how facts about business systems, with the end goal of creating computer systems to run them. It is a difficult job, involving a lot of interpersonal dynamics and politics, because I must analyze and articulate the business, reflect it back to them, and guide them towards consensus. On the other end, I must turn these conceptual models into technical specifications and database designs. This is an activity that no one enjoys, but I stress to them that if they don't make decisions, then some random guy in a cube somewhere will make it for them when they implement the lines of code that automate their business processes. What strikes me as funny is that those lines of code are referred to as the "physical" part of the system, because they are so much less abstract than the upstream conceptual models we use to communicate with the business. Within the computer systems themselves are the seven layers of the OSI model, ranging from graphical user interfaces to the physical wires connecting the machines. <br> <br>If I do my job well, I hope to contribute to mnemonic, easy to use interfaces to the systems that represent the true intentions and requirements of the business. The reality, however, is that most decision making is really done by the programmer, because everyone shies away from the hard work of examining and constructing the abstractions. If they are lucky, the programmer is intelligent, dedicated, and has the necessary business knowledge to make this happen. There are many such heroic programmers out there, but I don't recommend it as a way to run a business. <br> <br>As satisfying as my job is when the models are elegant, at the end of the day, it is the sensual, material world that delights me. It is time for some serious gardening, and my muscles are still sore from the ballet class Thursday night.

If we were to put people on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most "Greer," I would say I'm about an 8 while my partner is about a 4.

He's helped cut back expenses, gotten insulation in, biked more, driven less, spent less, supported businesses that are going to be useful (local organic gardening) and the like. Also, when I sat down to finally talk to him about my recent mental issues--I'm struggling with peak-induced anxiety/depression--he did not deny my emotions, say I was crazy, or otherwise try to invalidate what I said. It was a huge relief - I realized I ultimately have a spouse in my corner even if he isn't on the same page. <br><br>I think if I were in your position I would be most concerned if your partner opposes your efforts or tries to deny what you're going through. <br><br>As an aside, you sound like a very thoughtful, lovely woman.

Thank you for putting it so plainly. With regards to the “thinker” vs. “the ordinary unreflective person”, though, it is my observation that the latter category quite frequently gives birth to a third as those who merit that description aspire to act out the image society has given them of what an erudite person is, and what he or she is supposed to do. It's not pretty. It goes as follows: Take the normal habit of unconsciously, yet compulsively, relating to the world through the mental abstractions you happened to inherit, shift it (very self-consciously) into overdrive, while at the same time seek to accumulate (preferably from the internet) as much of other people's mental-abstractions-run-amok (and the results thereof) as you possibly can. Now make it your mission in life to educate others... I coined the term “belief sponge” a while back, and so far it has done a pretty good job of summing it up. I've noticed that people most prone to it are those who are into giving some form of instruction, sports coaches for example. Examples galore comes to mind. Freshest one was a couple of days ago, during brake from sparring in the dojo, when one instructor didn't like the silence and started giving a lecture about the reason human beings were able to experience joy was because their bodies contained lithium, and went on about it and why people actually did things like being outdoors was really just to get more lithium and on and on... Managed to control the urge to ask him whether he had figured this out himself, or had had this tremendous insight bestowed upon him by the internet. As I sat there quietly finishing my tea, I couldn't help wondering if I was the only one who could hear how dumb this sounded, or if everyone else was also being awkwardly quiet for the same reason as I.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c2951007144113788810 title="comment permalink">3/14/15, 11:45 AM</a><br><br>

Will a plastic 3D printer compete with mass produced injection molding? You can see (polymer) 3D printing as a subset of polymer extrusion that has been massively scaled down/consumerized (maxed inefficiency). There are very few tasks where one can assume they'll beat other manufacturing methods, just based on the physical the physical limitations that come with the above. Rapid prototyping is another (important) matter. Also if you look at the method as just one more way of additive manufacturing it puts things in a more useful perspective I'd say.<br><br>Also there is potential in very complex/organic/inhomogeneous/biomimetic applications I would assume. E.g. if you can't get the whole product done in "biological cell factories" maybe your can still do some of the sub-structures (if you can place your stuff well enough in XYZ).

It is both a privilege and responsibility to live here.<br><br>Secondly: If I found a dilithium crystal during one of the excavations here - I'm working on a wood shed site, in fact this very morning - I'd quietly bury it back over again, intuitively recognising that the outcomes for the area would not be good.<br><br>Other Tom raises an excellent point. Of course standardisation of the built environment is a key feature because our culture views people as economic units. It is in fact the very polar opposite position of disenssus. Even those people whom lead different lives from the cultural norms have been absorbed into the dominant culture. The built landscape was the easiest way to achieve that. Force everyone to live in similar arrangements and they will conform - because they have no other choice. I've always considered that the need to dominate is actually a sign of the underlying brittleness of a culture, because if it was acceptable to the majority, the culture wouldn't need to dominate.<br><br>I was having this very discussion last night about the imminent shut down of the car industry here. Not only is it sheer dumbness from a strategic point of view – Sun Tzu and Wu Tzu would have something to say on the matter – but it will put 250,000 people out of work and they are not economic units, despite what the ideology of our culture like to paint them as.<br><br>You can see this process in action this week as our Prime Minister berated Aboriginals for wanting to live in remote communities as: A lifestyle choice. Read between the lines and what he is threatening is for them to conform to the dominant culture or risk losing their government benefits. In addition to that he is threatening the vestiges of that Aboriginal culture which derives meaning from the land itself that the tribes are associated with. But the legal system as it stands blocks access to that very land which was once theirs. The comment was deeply disturbing.<br><br>Anyway, no better instruction could be found on the matter than the city of Canberra - which because of the sheer homogeneity of the built landscape - I find to be personally quite unsettling.

Community building sounds like a good idea but I live in a defense industry Republican stronghold that loathes our current community organizer in chief. They are good people just dependent on war-making products such as missiles and drones for their livelihood(think Hannah Arendt). WE know those fancy contracts are going away but when is the question. I didn't think they could make up money this long and get away with it but apparently citizenship is not what it used to be. I have a bad feeling about our labeling these rag tag refugees all over the world as terrorists giving us permission to eradicate them with our precision munitions. We are not even trying to make friends. We think you buy friendship. In my town, LESS is not on the radar screen. The Chamber of Commerce is expecting more "development" and our Congressperson is always pushing for NASA and DOD budget increases. Maybe they will never run out of money.

Without a physical body that interacts with the wider world, I suspect no self-awareness can emerge and without this there can be no self-purpose. In effect, all an AI can amount to is an extremely complex machine bound to its initial 'training', remaining incapable of conceptualising an 'I'. I also suspect that the mortality of a body is also a significant factor, and - although I hate to use the term - even if we mimic intellect in a machine, can we ever create a 'soul' in one? "<br><br>I've thought about this, too. The thing is, I can only ask questions. What is it that animates a body? Is it the consciousness, or is there a life force that is a different thing? I tend to think there is definitely a something which animates. But I am not sure it is the soul. If we are composite beings, of how many basic parts are we composed? As Rumi asks, "What is the soul? If I could taste one sip of an answer..."<br><br>I do not think we can ever make a machine that approaches the complexity of a body, and even if we could, I do not think that the mind (consciousness) arises spontaneously out of physical complexity. Nor do I think consciousness can ever be manufactured. <br><br>If we could create a viable physical body, what about the life force? And if we had that, while I don't think we can create consciousness, it is possible that a conscious entity could come inhabit it.<br><br>The author of the book My Big Toe proposes that there can be no such thing as consciousness without free will. I believe he is right. Motivation itself is the divide between animate and inanimate things. Every living cell acts with motivation.<br><br>I have wondered if our own bodies are extremely complex machines, although that seems unlikely. I am not sure it is really possible for our bodies to be running on autopilot. It seems there ought to be a governor. Then, too, there is an interface between that which is not really physical such as the emotion of hope or despair, that then impacts the body, such as the immune system. <br>It's amazing how little we know, and people speculate according to their preferences.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c949811017504737449 title="comment permalink">3/14/15, 6:24 PM</a><br><br>

These required: a designer, an NC programmer, a mold machinist, a parts machinist, a mold assembler and a mold loader. Each of these jobs were in excess of $75k per year in salary or wages + OT.<br><br>Using a 3D printer to print these complex molds works effectively, as I have actually done this repetitively. The net result is the designer prints the mold, and the mold loader loads it. Thus the NC programmer, mold machinist, parts machinist and mold assembler are permanently asked to leave the building. I know - I was instructed as engineering manager that I had done a "great job" - now go lay those guys off.<br><br>That is 4 jobs on 2 shifts or eight $75k per year jobs gone from the system due to 3D printing 'efficiency' when correctly applied.<br><br>Cui bono? Well, I didn't get a raise, and the overhead was decreased by 66% which went directly to the bottom line, not to mention selling off over $2,000,000 of used equipment that was no longer needed.<br><br>The funny thing is, as machinesand 'expert systems' replace us, they are not taxed, so again, cui bono? These "excess employees" seem to be another externalizing of business costs when you boil it down. But as the robots and 3D printers and software and computers are NOT TAXED, the digital wave washes a lot of folks out into the frothing unemployment sea, sans paddle or even raft.<br><br>No - I no longer work there, but we were the first to execute it correctly and it will happen in other places too.

It's when the dissonance is half-conscious or wholly suppressed that it's most uncomfortable. When you find your mind trying to turn away from some such issue, pick up a notebook and a pen, ask yourself what it is that makes you uncomfortable about it, and write the first thing that comes into your mind, without editing or censoring the output at all. You may be astonished with what comes out. <br><br>Andy, German is a marvelous language!<br><br>Tony, have you read <i>The Emperor's New Mind</i> by Roger Penrose? He makes a strong case for the suggestion that AI research is basically barking up the wrong stump. <br><br>Ed, adaptation in place is basically the name of the game at this point; I've noted already that the way things seem to be shaping up, those who haven't yet moved out to a rural farm probably won't have time or opportunity to do so. <br><br>Thomas, yes, I've seen it. I probably should have included that in there among the examples of prosthetic reality, as it's a corker. <br><br>JABA, I don't recommend using the "you need to do X so that people don't dismiss you" argument -- it makes you sound rather like a concern troll, you know. If my occasional mistakes keep readers on their toes and remind them that they need to think and do research for themselves, all the better. <br><br>Travis, "the George Carlin of Druidism" -- now that's a new one! Thank you. <br><br>Loon, the thing is -- as you know -- abstractions also have their beauty. It's the use of them as a flight from the concrete that's the difficulty here. <br><br>Carnegie, the thing I've seen is that people start out all gung-ho over the 3-D printers and so on, and then notice that they're just pushing buttons and waiting for the thing to work, while the guy over there at the lathe is having all the fun wielding the cutting tool and sending shavings flying. Pretty soon they're off the 3-D printer and learning how to use the lathe. <br><br>Lewis, no argument there -- and I'll let the Twain quote pass, because it's Twain. <br><br>Greg, I'd encourage you to choose a name that doesn't need to be translated -- SAHD doesn't communicate much to the acronym-challenged.<br><br>Jason, good heavens, no need to apologize!

In that case, yes, the publisher's probably your best bet. <br><br>Latefall, that chart is stunningly dishonest -- no one with the least background in the intellectual history of the Middle Ages would agree with such a claim (and you'll notice how casually the chart erases the Muslim world, India, China, etc., all of which had very different trajectories). If I wanted to do another post on the way that the myth of progress has been used to falsify the shape of the past, that graph could be exhibit A. <br><br>Cherokee, the more I hear about the way things are going down under, the more I shake my head. It almost makes me wonder if Australia has become convinced that if it wants to be an important country, it has to act like the United States, right down to the clueless head of state...<br><br>Thriftwizard, I know it's not what Tolkien had in mind, but I saw Mordor up close the first time I went past an oil refinery. Vast black towers with flames rising from the summit, the fumes, the general air of desolation and biocide -- it's shaped my imagination of the Plateau of Gorgoroth ever since. <br><br>Dave, do you recall the good advice of the old-time stock market player? "The market can remain insane longer than you can remain solvent." The same is true <i>a fortiriori</i> of the money system. Hang onto it while it's still useful; it may still be useful for longer than you expect. <br><br>Mark, Ravi Batra was talking about that in the late 1980s, as I recall. <br><br>Oilman2, exactly -- and you've noted some of the perverse incentives that make it profitable for companies to replace employees with machines. I'll be talking down the road a bit about how those could (and should) be reversed.<br><br>Gloucon, people in the peak oil scene have been talking about the make-believe numbers on oil reserves coming out of Riyadh and other Middle Eastern capitals since the late 1990s. The whole world these days is a gigantic poker game, and everybody's bluffing about what they have -- that's simply the hand we've been dealt, to push the metaphor a bit further.

We've been having an ongoing conversation for 8 years now about the future, climate change, peak oil, etc. The question is what to do about it on family scale. Moving out to the cabin in the woods or the rural farm plot was not going to happen for various reasons. We love our current home and neighbors and moving would mean new house problems and new neighbors - the great unknown. <br><br>I think this struggle is real for most people and if I had a magic wand if would be spouting out compassion for all of us.<br><br>JMG would you like some reports from the field? <br><br>Went to a different Home Depot yesterday - one in the rich home area - and there was a representative from Makerbot there demonstrating their 3D printer called the Replicator http://www.makerbot.com It was oozing out colorful plastic figurines. It sells for the low low price of $2,899.00 And there are 12 different colors of plastic you can use to make your trinkets. Bright garish plastic, but hey won't that look good somewhere on the mantel?<br><br>Had a friend go to the Adobe software conference last week. The chief marketing officer for Coca Cola was there and her presentation was on how Coke doesn't sell soft drinks, they sell........(drumroll)......happiness! Everything they do is to make people feel happy. She gave many examples of their past marketing on this. Coming soon their push button machines where you can mix all their products together to customize your own drink, will work with an app on your smart phone so you can save your drink recipes and share them with friends! The machine will know your soda choices and you can bluetooth link your phone and the machine to have it dispense automatically! Oh, the possibilities are endless.<br><br>Lastly, in rural PA school districts, there is a new initiative called 1 to 1. This is a great name, no? It means 1 iPad to each child and the child has unlimited use of the iPad all day and zero paper textbooks. Everything is done on the iPad. This starts in Kindergarten. In other school districts, the expectation is children bring their own devices and they can use them all day including at recess and lunch. Well, haven't the school staff made the management of children so much easier? When this technology push started a decade ago, I said to a teacher friend that teachers should be pushing for how children need people, not tech and how teachers can teach skills that tech can not. If the teachers went along with all this tech, then their jobs would be eliminated because the classroom would just need monitors/babysitters, and the tech would do all the teaching and tracking of scores. My friends response was "Well that is a dark thought.". Yeah, well, classroom monitors at $15/hour are cheaper than teachers at $80K a year so it will be done for cost reasons soon, I'm sure.<br><br>Thank you for you generosity in sharing your thoughts with us!!!<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c589576491061388108 title="comment permalink">3/15/15, 5:36 AM</a><br><br>

By actually productive ,I mean that they create some kind of physical or knowledge return that equals the resources that can be purchased with the paycheck from that job. In the U.S. we have had a fully intermediated economy for so long that we have mostly forgotten what an actual exchange of labor for resources really is. Back in the 90's there was limited amount of discussion about this in the main stream media as we were outsourcing manufacturing jobs and a few economists and pundits would debate the sustainability of the "Service Economy", or the even trendier "Knowledge Economy". but as the number of people who engage in manufacturing and farming dwindles this debate has all but disappeared. Most people now accept that any job they do is real and entitiles them to the resources that we get from the paycheck. <br> In fact we have acheived an "Alice in Wonderland" employment world where the further removed a job is from real work, the more highly rewarded in money it is. One only has to compare an Organic Farmer to a professional athlete, financial analyst or reality television star to see the reality of this statment. Where the resources come from to compensate folks who work in un-usefull jobs is of course a huge topic that is covered at length by many authors and this blog in particular. But I believe this is one of the biggest tricks of all, that millions of people can go to work each day and curate twitter feeds, analyze sports, or be full time high school athletic directors, and in aggregate that can make up a real economy. In reality the jobs most people do in America are no different than the homeless guy who stands at the freeway offramp with a cup, except they are better paid, and the homeless guy is not fooled about his situation.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c1607526740715010838 title="comment permalink">3/15/15, 9:09 AM</a><br><br>

If you read the Tanach (Bible) in approximately the order in which the books were composed, you can see a gradual transition from collective responsibility and generationally inherited divine rewards and punishments to complete individual responsibility.

I'm eternally grateful for your deep wisdom, erudition, humor and life-changing insights and perspectives.

Here are eight reasons why it's worth holding off. <br><br>1. 3-D printed homes. While this is an idea that is still in prototype, the potential of this technology is staggering to consider. Not only could it significantly reduce building costs and construction time, it could also create design opportunities that have never before been possible.<br><br>The 3-D printing process for homes is emerging in a couple of different ways. One idea on the drawing board right now is to use a huge 3-D printer that is brought in by semi-trucks and set up on the building site. Cement trucks would then be used to load the printer with building materials. A second possibility currently being researched at MIT would involve much smaller printers working together as a 3-D printing team to print the building in concert (which frankly sounds much more practical). <br><br>Whole article here: http://www.alternet.org/economy/8-surprising-reasons-why-now-might-be-worst-time-history-buy-home<br><br>I must also give a shout out to Curtis for his comment describing quantitative easing as some "terrible, futuristic laxative". it still makes me laugh every time I think of it.

I don't think Mr. Greer ever said individual solutions are enough. But we live in a context where we are unlikely to get top-down effective change. In this context, individuals doing something is better than nothing. <br><br>(Correct me if I'm wrong on this portrayal of your comments, Mr. Greer.)<br><br>2. Individuals' behaviour and actions can spread through diffusion. If a person does something successfully and can teach others, sell it to others, give it away to others, etc., then it could quickly become a larger movement. Experimentation plus diffusion at this point seems to be our best way forward. That might be a community change, but it might not.<br><br>3. Being the change you want to see removes from your opponents the ability to charge hypocrisy. Most of us recognize the tu quoque fallacy. Example:<br><br>A - Using less is great! <br>B - But you don't use less, therefore your argument is invalid!<br><br>...Is fallacious <i> logical </i> reasoning but points out a huge <i> moral </i> reasoning problem. I'd also add since environmentalists are a smart bunch that they should recognize that people will use the charge of hypocrisy to disarm the movement. That's what critics have done to Gore. For all its failings, his documentary should have had an effect, but didn't because of this reason. <br><br>I agree that big changes would be excellent. The fact that we in North America don't have straight forward carbon taxes with set increases, or a Roosevelt inspired mass retrofit program, makes me grind my teeth at our collective stupidity.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c5903637424629408185 title="comment permalink">3/15/15, 5:46 PM</a><br><br>

His answer was, (basically, I'm paraphrasing) - "Wherever I already was familiar with the land/climate and where I had personal contacts. Those things are enormous advantages and take time to build up." He also said he's much rather have a smaller farm closer to a metropolitan area than 200 acres three hours away. The point being that, as JMG has said many times, adapting in place may very well be better than being on the rural farm. <br><br>@Denys, re: reluctant spouse. My husband is not sure how "on board" he is with "all this", but he supports me in doing/purchasing what I've done for preparedness (books, tools, gardening &amp; permaculture training, ER supplies, etc). At times I've been frustrated with the fact that I'm the one doing the majority of the work on any &amp; all preparations, but I'm grateful for the fact that we can talk about it, that he sees what the risks are &amp; that he thinks it's worthwhile to prepare. He's just not sure it's going to happen in the next decade, so it falls to me now....<br><br>I think we "Prepper" types can be very happy with a spouse who maybe isn't "all in" but who is supportive. If you don't have that much, not sure what to tell you. If you have kids, divorce doesn't accomplish much in this scenario (IMHO). <br><br><br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c9189793638901585534 title="comment permalink">3/15/15, 9:31 PM</a><br><br>

Incidentally, it is however being noticed and spoken about, so who knows whether this is the new normal or merely an aberration?<br><br>The present federal government here is certainly one of the first to pursue the policies of its supporters at the expense of all others. It is a strategy of sorts, I guess, and possibly appears quite valid to them. Anyway, they've forgotten that 95% of the eligible population turn out on voting day to have their say (or people get fined - it is compulsory to vote after all). The interesting thing to note is that the party that forms the federal government (i.e. the majority of the lower house) are slowly losing the governments in each state one by one. I believe that there is another state election in NSW shortly.<br><br>All that aside, what really interests me is that in the upper house, 18 of the 72 senators (each state equally gets 6 senators and each mainland territory gets 2) represent either minor parties or are independents. Interesting times indeed to see the major parties losing their grip on the middle ground.

I've had conversations with people who are quite Republican about the hidden costs of cheap gas, like aircraft carriers and endless wars, and they to some extent agree with me if we talk about just money and not something completely abstract to them like climate change or Hubbert's curve. <br>In my area of southern New England a lot of people are gradually going off the grid because there is no other way, they are poor. At my local watering hole most of us grew up in small towns and many of us are gardeners or hunters or foragers, etc. The other night we talked about getting more organized, combining our skills into a small bartering network. <br>I'm thinking that as this way of living spreads, new political or social abstractions will follow, and that in the meantime there is little point in arguing. <br>I can only imagine what it's like for people with kids in school, in an age when your kids entire future, the difference between homelessness and success is supposed to be getting them into the right preschool, and the idea that we will all have to be more self educated is anathema. It seems to me that all the focus in education is on the competition for scarce jobs, and nothing about how to live for the majority that won't have those jobs.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c3822983184639495294 title="comment permalink">3/16/15, 10:18 AM</a><br><br>

One does not know who made any one thing which is bought, or if it was a machine or a group of people making widgets in a 4th world sweatshop. This has especially extended into what we eat, where there now exists a poultry muscle group called the "nugget", which people eat similar to a gizzard or liver.<br><br>Before and even during the initial stages of the industrial revolution, one knew the watchmaker, shoe repairman, butcher, dairy farmer, etc. (or at least the distributor of their wares within the city). Today, products are built across the globe (thanks to cheap oil) by faceless corporations with public relations and marketing departments whose job it is to "put a face" on the corporation, ie 'branding'.<br><br>Sole proprietorships have a brand already - the owner - but are penalized tax-wise - hence their rarity. So there are huge, global industries today that make a living trying to make the general public believe that a corporation shares virtues/values/personhood with their customers. In effect, to anthropomorphize the corporation due to the disconnect and resulting cognitive dissonance that corporations have by virtue of their being an artificial construct. A cobbler does not have this issue nor the disconnect - he is what he says he is, and it is apparent to all.<br><br>That being said, as the world inevitably swallows cheap oil and is left with only the caviar equivalent, this more expensive energy cannot support these anthropomorphizing industries, or globalism or many other things considered 'normal' today. And these same 'normal things' would be viewed as insanity by most people from the late 19th century, IMHO. <br><br>I just imagine a farmer from 1895 encountering a box of chicken nuggets or watching a commercial for beer or ED or any number of 'normal' things - the word "incomprehensible" doesn't do his expression justice, most likely.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c4731439878864039471 title="comment permalink">3/16/15, 5:04 PM</a><br><br>

Here in Texas, one of the burgeoning enterprises is the "RV Park", where one can pull in their RV and get water, sewer, electric and cable internet for $350-500 per month. With many unable to make the $1500+ per month cost of suburban housing and monthly tax escrow, these RV Parks are growing immense within an hour or so drive of many cities. This is very much a transition from more to much less.<br><br>I also think that many today have reached saturation point in terms of technology (I-phone crap comes to mind here, where nothing has really been new or substantially better since the 3G I-phone rollout). My kids don't use electric can openers or buy self-warming seats in their cars nor do they choose McMansions - opting for simpler and smaller from both practical and economic rationales. I personally have thrown out scads of cheap chinese widgets and gadgets in the last 15 years - simply easier to crank it by hand than to spend 3 hours trying to understand the poorly written manual, illogical control panel or even the impossible assembly of many "essential gadgets" ostensibly purveyed as "labor saving".<br><br>My children believe I was severely short changed by paying for their college educations - uniformly, they say that their education, while helpful to a degree, did little more than teach them to memorize effectively. After viewing the things they were taught, I agreed. Yet there are no alternatives to college that are less expensive. Apprenticeships are non-existent and every job requires some type of government "certification".<br><br>Both red and blue voting stalwarts sense that the machine is broken or at least the cogs are out of whack - but there are only red and blue allowed as choices, with the occasional blue masquerading as green or the occasional red masquerading as white. The payoff in politics is just too lucre-filled to attract altruistic people.<br><br>The red/blue game is having attendance issues (note resurgence of George Carlins POV lately).<br><br>Less is making a comeback sans Ned Ludd, by either necessity or choice.<br><br>Hypercomplexity is beginning to perplex and confound many.<br><br>It takes a while for people to let go of their paradigms, especially when the next set are not quite visible.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c4323984053986509427 title="comment permalink">3/16/15, 5:28 PM</a><br><br>

I think Tom's method for finding common ground with people who have different pictures of the world is very practical. I'm also heartened by his description of the first stirrings of an informal community of exchange and support. It cheers me because it sounds like the way Americans, going back to the time of de Toqueville, used to recognize a shared need and cooperate with their neighbors to fill it. It's probably no accident that this report comes New England, where old ways of grassroots organizing are not forgotten.<br><br>I wanted to link to a story about a different style of cooperation on the Left Coast. Today's San Francisco Chronicle has an article about the keepers of the Lands' End Labyrinth (under City Exposed in section C). Unfortunately I no longer have the physical paper to refer to, and the online version is paywalled. I'm summarizing it to illustrate two points: the emerging religious sensibility that JMG wrote about a while back, and the fact that people are still looking for ways to connect with others and make a contribution, but the ways they do it are sometimes different from the past.<br><br>Circa 2005, a local man laid out a large (about 35 feet across) labyrinth in the Chartres Cathedral pattern on a bluff overlooking the ocean at Land's End in San Francisco (northwestern corner of the city, customarily a free zone for benign quiet outdoor activities). He gathered rocks at the site to mark the lines. A couple of times people moved the rocks or chucked all of them away over the cliff, and he laid it out again. <br><br>When he moved away, a woman who liked to hike there took over maintaining the labyrinth, which amounted to moving back the rocks into the original pattern when people rearranged them. At one point after someone messed it up thoroughly, a complete stranger who liked to walk it announced a work day on Facebook to repair it. About twenty people showed up and by the time the regular keeper arrived, the work was nearly done. She recently went on vacation, and on returning discovered that someone had turned the labyrinth into a maze. She put the (eighteen inch wide) paths back.<br><br>All this labyrinth making, walking and repairing has been completely unofficial. There's an older rock labyrinth of comparable size in a park in the East Bay hills, but it doesn't have a view of the ocean.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c2351093142316815474 title="comment permalink">3/16/15, 11:21 PM</a><br><br>

For us, moving costs including taxes would be $40,000+ and then all the infrastructure to get set up again, and we might run out of time. Also, community will be just so important and can take a long time to rebuild if people in the new location aren’t interested.<br><br>Not sure about you but our 800m2 block is enough to self-supply (off-grid) all our own water, solar water heating, solar electric and most cooking needs. I think decline will happen slowly enough that I’m more worried about malnutrition than calories. We have cruddy soils but I produce enough food for at least 8 people to avoid serious malnutrition on an otherwise grain/dried legume heavy diet and even supply a chunk of our calories. A small inner city block would be much more restrictive. Suburbia’s main problem is lack of woodlots for space heating (and houses which mold when unheated) but the inner cities are no better and we’ve used our saved moving money to absolutely minimise our space heating needs. <br><br>The size of a suburban home as well as the block can be an advantage– in a collapse scenario, room for plenty of food stores to cover temporary shortages, a small library, rooms for boarders, and storing tools all seem to be efficient uses of space. Boarders in particular can help pay bills and it is more efficient to cook and heat communally than in several separate dwellings. In our area, very few people carpool at the moment but I think carpooling will make it affordable to travel into the city for as long as the jobs last. As the jobs go, the garage will come in handy for running several home businesses.<br><br>The final scenario I’ve contemplated is Detroit – lots of empty foreclosed houses and not enough people even to support small home businesses. However, even then I’d still rather be in the suburbs where I can ‘adopt’ the yards of a few foreclosed houses rather than dependent on shaky government services in the inner city where most of the ground is concreted. Eventually there may be serious problems with roaming gangs in the suburbs, but I figure that is where having a good neighbourhood community comes in.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c6157405890449022922 title="comment permalink">3/17/15, 1:07 AM</a><br><br>

Is there no public transportation to the job, or possibility of ridesharing?

Beginning way back in the Great Depression Blacks and whites from the South who had migrated north looking for work and found themselves unemployed took to planting vegetables and fruit on vacant lots. It is a tradition that has continued to this day and has blossomed greatly in the past few years. Check out TakePart.com. Their article says that as much as 200 tons of produce is produced annually on these urban farms. I've actually read somewhere that it is much higher. The city is apparently on board because it is helping the property values in the affected neighborhoods. We always hear of poor Detroit as a cautionary tale, but just maybe they have something to teach us about "collapsing in place."<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c7062254470459849615 title="comment permalink">3/17/15, 4:28 PM</a><br><br>

It kind of makes sense; for a given list price, you'll have a smaller payment. However, sellers KNOW this! So, the list price rises to equalize the same affordability of payments. So what's the difference? If interest rates rise, and you want to sell, you need to cut your asking price back to the same affordable payment! Instant equity loss, but you're still stuck with the same payment.<br><br><a href=the-prosthetic-imagination.html#c1044156162084942911 title="comment permalink">3/18/15, 4:14 PM</a><br><br>
