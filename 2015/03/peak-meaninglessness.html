<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week’s discussion of externalities—costs of doing business that get dumped onto the economy, the community, or the environment, so that those doing the dumping can make a bigger profit—is, I’m glad to say, not the first time this issue has been raised recently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The long silence that closed around such things three decades ago is finally cracking; they’re being mentioned again, and not just by archdruids.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of my readers—tip of the archdruidical hat to Joe McInerney—noted an article in
<i>Grist</i> a while back that pointed out the awkward fact that
<a href=http://grist.org/business-technology/none-of-the-worlds-top-industries-would-be-profitable-if-they-paid-for-the-natural-capital-they-use/ >none of the twenty biggest industries in today’s world could break even, much less make a profit</a>, if they had to pay for the damage they do to the environment. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course the conventional wisdom these days interprets that statement to mean that it’s unfair to make those industries pay for the costs they impose on the rest of us—after all, they have a God-given right to profit at everyone else’s expense, right?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That’s certainly the attitude of fracking firms in North Dakota, who recently proposed that <a href=http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/28/us-usa-north-dakota-waste-idUSKBN0L11Z420150128> they ought to be exempted from the state’s rules on dumping radioactive waste</a>, because following the rules would cost them too much money. That the costs externalized by the fracking industry will sooner or later be paid by others, as radionuclides in fracking waste work their way up the food chain and start producing cancer clusters, is of course not something anyone in the industry or the media is interested in discussing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Watch this sort of thing, and you can see the chasm opening up under the foundations of industrial society. Externalized costs don’t just go away; one way or another, they’re going to be paid, and costs that don’t appear on a company’s balance sheet still affect the economy. That’s the argument of <i>The Limits to Growth</i>, <a href=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/02/limits-to-growth-was-right-new-research-shows-were-nearing-collapse>still the most accurate</a> (and thus inevitably the most reviled) of the studies that tried unavailingly to turn industrial society away from its suicidal path: on a finite planet, once an inflection point is passed, the costs of economic growth rise faster than growth does, and sooner or later force the global economy to its knees. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The tricks of accounting that let corporations pretend that their externalized costs vanish into thin air don’t change that bleak prognosis. Quite the contrary, the pretense that externalities don’t matter just makes it harder for a society in crisis to recognize the actual source of its troubles. I’ve come to think that that’s the unmentioned context behind a dispute currently roiling those unhallowed regions where economists lurk in the shrubbery: the debate over secular stagnation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Secular stagnation? That’s the concept, unmentionable until recently, that the global economy could stumble into a rut of slow, no, or negative growth, and stay there for years. There are still plenty of economists who insist that this can’t happen, which is rather funny, really, when you consider that this has basically been the state of the global economy since 2009. (My back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest, in fact, that if you subtract the hallucinatory paper wealth manufactured by derivatives and similar forms of financial gamesmanship from the world’s GDP, the production of nonfinancial goods and services worldwide has actually been declining since before the 2008 housing crash.)</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even among those who admit that what’s happening can indeed happen, there’s no consensus as to how or why such a thing could occur.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the off chance that any mainstream economists are lurking in the shrubbery in the even more unhallowed regions where archdruids utter unspeakable heresies, and green wizards clink mugs of homebrewed beer together and bay at the moon, I have a suggestion to offer: the most important cause of secular stagnation is the increasing impact of externalities on the economy. The dishonest macroeconomic bookkeeping that leads economists to think that externalized costs go away because they’re not entered into anyone’s ledger books doesn’t actually make them disappear; instead, they become an unrecognized burden on the economy as a whole, an unfelt headwind blowing with hurricane force in the face of economic growth. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus there’s a profound irony in the insistence by North Dakota fracking firms that they ought to be allowed to externalize even more of their costs in order to maintain their profit margin. If I’m right, the buildup of externalized costs is what’s causing the ongoing slowdown in economic activity worldwide that’s driving down commodity prices, forcing interest rates in many countries to zero or below, and resurrecting the specter of deflationary depression. The fracking firms in question thus want to respond to the collapse in oil prices—a result of secular stagnation—by doing even more of what’s causing secular stagnation. To say that this isn’t likely to end well is to understate the case considerably. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the real world, of course, mainstream economists don’t listen to suggestions from archdruids, and fracking firms, like every other business concern these days, can be expected to put their short-term cash flow ahead of the survival of their industry, or for that matter of industrial civilization as a whole. Thus I propose to step aside from the subject of economic externalities for a moment—though I’ll be returning to it at intervals as we proceed with this sequence of posts—in order to discuss a subtler and less crassly financial form of the same phenomenon. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That form came in for discussion <a href=../../2015/02/what-progress-means.html>in the same post two weeks ago</a> that brought the issue of externalities into this blog’s ongoing conversation. Quite a few readers commented about the many ways in which things labeled “more advanced,” “more progressive,” and the like were actually less satisfactory and less effective at meeting human needs than the allegedly more primitive technologies they replaced. Some of those comments focused, and quite sensibly, on the concrete examples, but others pondered the ways that today’s technology fails systematically at meeting certain human needs, and reflected on the underlying causes for that failure. One of my readers—tip of the archdruidical hat here to Ruben—gave an elegant frame for that discussion by suggesting that the peak of technological complexity in our time may also be described as peak meaninglessness. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d like to take the time to unpack that phrase. In the most general sense, technologies can be divided into two broad classes, which we can respectively call tools and prosthetics. The difference is a matter of function. A tool expands human potential, giving people the ability to do things they couldn’t otherwise do. A prosthetic, on the other hand, replaces human potential, doing something that under normal circumstances, people can do just as well for themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most discussions of technology these days focus on tools, but the vast majority of technologies that shape the lives of people in a modern industrial society are not tools but prosthetics. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Prosthetics have a definite value, to be sure. Consider an artificial limb, the sort of thing on which the concept of technology-as-prosthetic is modeled. If you’ve lost a leg in an accident, say, an artificial leg is well worth having; it replaces a part of ordinary human potential that you don’t happen to have any more, and enables you to do things that other people can do with their own leg. Imagine, though, that some clever marketer were to convince people to have their legs cut off so that they could be fitted for artificial legs. Imagine, furthermore, that the advertising for artificial legs became so pervasive, and so successful, that nearly everybody became convinced that human legs were hopelessly old-fashioned and ugly, and rushed out to get their legs amputated so they could walk around on artificial legs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then, of course, the manufacturers of artificial arms got into the same sort of marketing, followed by the makers of sex toys. Before long you’d have a society in which most people were gelded quadruple amputees fitted with artificial limbs and rubber genitals, who spent all their time talking about the wonderful things they could do with their prostheses. Only in the darkest hours of the night, when the TV was turned off, might some of them wonder why it was that a certain hard-to-define numbness had crept into all their interactions with other people and the rest of the world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In a very real sense, that’s the way modern industrial society has reshaped and deformed human life for its more privileged inmates. Take any human activity, however humble or profound, and some clever marketer has found a way to insert a piece of technology in between the person and the activity. You can’t simply bake bread—a simple, homely, pleasant activity that people have done themselves for thousands of years using their hands and a few simple handmade tools; no, you have to have a bread machine, into which you dump a prepackaged mix and some liquid, push a button, and stand there being bored while it does the work for you, if you don’t farm out the task entirely to a bakery and get the half-stale industrially extruded product that passes for bread these days. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course the bread machine manufacturers and the bakeries pitch their products to the clueless masses by insisting that nobody has time to bake their own bread any more. Ivan Illich pointed out in <i>Energy and Equity</i> a long time ago the logical fallacy here, which is that using a bread machine or buying from a bakery is only faster if you don’t count the time you have to spend earning the money needed to pay for it, power it, provide it with overpriced prepackaged mixes, repair it, clean it, etc., etc., etc. Illich’s discussion focused on automobiles; he pointed out that if you take the distance traveled by the average American auto in a year, and divide that by the total amount of time spent earning the money to pay for the auto, fuel, maintenance, insurance, etc., plus all the other time eaten up by tending to the auto in various ways, the average American car goes about 3.5 miles an hour: about the same pace, that is, that an ordinary human being can walk. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If this seems somehow reminiscent of last week’s discussion of externalities, dear reader, it should. The claim that technology saves time and labor only seems to make sense if you ignore a whole series of externalities—in this case, the time you have to put into earning the money to pay for the technology and into coping with whatever requirements, maintenance needs, and side effects the technology has. Have you ever noticed that the more “time-saving technologies” you bring into your life, the less free time you have? This is why—and it’s also why the average medieval peasant worked shorter hours, had more days off, and kept a larger fraction of the value of his labor than you do. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Something else is being externalized by prosthetic technology, though, and it’s that additional factor that gives Ruben’s phrase “peak meaninglessness” its punch. What are you doing, really, when you use a bread machine? You’re not baking bread; the machine is doing that. You’re dumping a prepackaged mix and some water into a machine, closing the lid, pushing a button, and going away to do something else. Fair enough—but what is this “something else” that you’re doing? In today’s industrial societies, odds are you’re going to go use another piece of prosthetic technology, which means that once again, you’re not actually doing anything. A machine is doing something for you. You can push that button and walk away, but again, what are you going to do with your time? Use another machine? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The machines that industrial society uses to give this infinite regress somewhere to stop—televisions, video games, and computers hooked up to the internet—simply take the same process to its ultimate extreme. Whatever you think you’re doing when you’re sitting in front of one of these things, what you’re actually doing is staring at little colored pictures on a glass screen and pushing some buttons. All things considered, this is a profoundly boring activity, which is why the little colored pictures jump around all the time; that’s to keep your nervous system so far off balance that you don’t notice just how tedious it is to spend hours at a time staring at little colored pictures on a screen. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I can’t help but laugh when people insist that the internet is an information-rich environment. It’s quite the opposite, actually: all you get from it is the very narrow trickle of verbal, visual, and auditory information that can squeeze through the digital bottleneck and turn into little colored pictures on a glass screen. The best way to experience this is to engage in a media fast—a period in which you deliberately cut yourself off from all electronic media for a week or more, preferably in a quiet natural environment. If you do that, you’ll find that it can take two or three days, or even more, before your numbed and dazzled nervous system recovers far enough that you can begin to tap in to the ocean of sensory information and sensual delight that surrounds you at every moment. It’s only then, furthermore, that you can start to think your own thoughts and dream your own dreams, instead of just rehashing whatever the little colored pictures tell you. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A movement of radical French philosophers back in the 1960s, the Situationists, argued that modern industrial society is basically a scheme to convince people to hand over their own human capabilities to the industrial machine, so that imitations of those capabilities can be sold back to them at premium prices. It was a useful analysis then, and it’s even more useful now, when the gap between realities and representations has become even more drastic than it was back then. These days, as often as not, what gets sold to people isn’t even an imitation of some human capability, but an abstract representation of it, an arbitrary marker with only the most symbolic connection to what it represents. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is one of the reasons why I think it’s deeply mistaken to claim that Americans are materialistic. Americans are arguably the least materialistic people in the world; no actual materialist—no one who had the least appreciation for actual physical matter and its sensory and sensuous qualities—could stand the vile plastic tackiness of America’s built environment and consumer economy for a fraction of a second.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Americans don’t care in the least about matter; they’re happy to buy even the most ugly, uncomfortable, shoddily made and absurdly overpriced consumer products you care to imagine, so long as they’ve been convinced that having those products symbolizes some abstract quality they want, such as happiness, freedom, sexual pleasure, or what have you. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then they wonder, in the darkest hours of the night, why all the things that are supposed to make them happy and satisfied somehow never manage to do anything of the kind. Of course there’s a reason for that, too, which is that happy and satisfied people don’t keep on frantically buying products in a quest for happiness and satisfaction. Still, the little colored pictures keep showing them images of people who are happy and satisfied because they guzzle the right brand of tasteless fizzy sugar water, and pay for the right brand of shoddily made half-disposable clothing, and keep watching the little colored pictures: that last above all else. “Tune in tomorrow” is the most important product that every media outlet sells, and they push it every minute of every day on every stop and key. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That is to say, between my fantasy of voluntary amputees eagerly handing over the cash for the latest models of prosthetic limbs, and the reality of life in a modern industrial society, the difference is simply in the less permanent nature of the alterations imposed on people here and now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s easier to talk people into amputating their imaginations than it is to convince them to amputate their limbs, but it’s also a good deal easier to reverse the surgery. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What gives this even more importance than it would otherwise have, in turn, is that all this is happening in a society that’s hopelessly out of touch with the realities that support its existence, and that relies on bookkeeping tricks of the sort discussed toward the beginning of this essay to maintain the fantasy that it’s headed somewhere other than history’s well-used compost bin. The externalization of the mind and the imagination plays just as important a role in maintaining that fantasy as the externalization of costs—and the cold mechanical heart of the externalization of the mind and imagination is <i>mediation</i>, the insertion of technological prosthetics into the space between the individual and the world. We’ll talk more about that in next week’s post. </div>

I direct my students' attention to it and then add that populations usually take a full generation to respond to changing conditions, such as exceeding carrying capacity or falling beneath it. I then ask them how long a human generation is. The usual answer is 20 years, meaning that it took until 2007 for humans to respond (the official start of the recession in the U.S. was December 2007, so it works). I then tie it into the law of Barry Commoner that you cited in last week's essay, "there is no such thing as a free lunch; eventually, all debts have to be repaid." I tie all of that together by saying that the period of economic difficulty we've been experiencing for the past seven or eight years is the result of our paying our debt back to nature and that paying that debt back will take the rest of the generation, about 15 years. I don't think they're ready to hear that it will take the rest of their lives and their children's and grandchildren's, although a few of them are figuring that out on their own.<br><br>"Even among those who admit that what’s happening can indeed happen, there’s no consensus as to how or why such a thing (secular stagnation) could occur. On the off chance that any mainstream economists are lurking in the shrubbery in the even more unhallowed regions where archdruids utter unspeakable heresies, and green wizards clink mugs of homebrewed beer together and bay at the moon, I have a suggestion to offer: the most important cause of secular stagnation is the increasing impact of externalities on the economy."<br><br>Paul Krugman discusses it, but he has no idea, either, although he mentions three suspects. The most commonly discussed is that technological innovation has slowed down, or at least stopped producing effects that lead to economic growth (this looks a little like what you wrote last week). Another, and his favorite, is that corporations and others of the global elite are hoarding too much cash and not spending it, especially on their employees, who would spend it even more. The idea that the problem is too much consumption and not too little appears to be outside of his analysis. Finally, he does worry about a shortage of one resource, people. He has posted that <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2014/06/the-hipcrime-vocab-why-slowing.html rel=nofollow>slowing population growth can be a problem for the economy</a>. He acknowledges that too many people is a problem, but that the economy is set up for growth and will fall over like a bicycle if it doesn't continue to move. How to keep the economy upright without growth seems to be beyond him, too.<br><br>As for externalities coming home to roost, that's not on his radar. Neither is running out of resources other than people. As I've written before: Peak Oil?

As you may know from my comments, I am a big fan. I think his hope, or wish, at least for some of the countries like China that, in the 70s, still had not gone all in on the energy overdose, was that they would choose to regulate the quanta of energy alloted per capita, thus avoiding the kind of "speed/time trap" you reference here, as well as the idea that, after, as you put it, an inflection point, a tool starts to deliver diminishing returns, until, especially if it is an institutional tool--say, the medical system--it exists mainly to promote its own existence.

The World3 program did not make predictions; it generated entire families of models, depending on initial presuppositions, which demonstrated that no matter how you twist and turn the matter, limitless growth on a finite planet ends in disaster. So far, the "standard run" model has tracked events very closely, and it will be interesting to see whether that continues to be true; still, it's a source of wry amusement to me to watch how many people try to shove <i>The Limits to Growth</i> into a predictive straitjacket, rather than recognizing the actual points it made. <br><br>Bob, good heavens -- do you happen to know where in Thoreau's work that appears? I want to cite it. Thanks for quoting it!<br><br>Steven, that's a very good summary. And of course if someone's nervous system is numbed and dazzled by all those dancing pictures, they probably never get around to noticing just now much more richness they could experience by unplugging from the machine, slowing down, and experiencing life. <br><br>Justin, the image of toll booths on the road to experience is a keeper!

What has happened instead is that money is mistaken for value (such that things are only valuable or valued if they have a monetary figure attached to their value - sex with a prostitute is valued in monetary terms, and is thus valuable; while sex with your life partner isn't), and the economic map is being mistaken for the territory (so economists insist the real world behaves exactly the same way the highly simplified models economists use to start explaining economic value flows to themselves do). In the same way, people focus on the various economic markets as a be-all and end-all without stopping to think about the various distribution problems the markets themselves were created to solve (for example, the housing market was created as a way of resolving the problem of distributing shelter to people; the food and grocery market was created as a way to solve the problems involved in distributing nourishment to a population; etc etc etc). We're so distracted by the abstractions we've created as problem-solving tools that we've lost track of the original problems we were intending to solve with them.<br><br>In the same way, corporations started out as a problem-solving tool - they're intended to solve the problems of organising large numbers of people and distributing resources of time, money, and attention in such a way as to create value. But what's happened is the popular conception of what a corporation is has skipped all those other steps, and just shortcut to "a machine for making value"; this combines with the assumption that all value has to be monetary, and thus you get corporations being regarded as essentially machines for making money for shareholders, <i>and nothing else</i>. So of course the shareholders in various corporations are going to clamour for the right to have their companies externalising their expenses - this is, to their minds, what the company is for. (The corporate CEO who launders their personal extravagances through the company accounts is merely indulging in this tendency to an extreme). <br><br>I would argue the vast majority of the societal problems we're seeing at present have come from this tendency we have of mistaking the map for the territory; of mistaking the problem-solving tool for the solution to the problem; of mistaking the machine for the person; the mechanical for the personal.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c6065542362315177363 title="comment permalink">3/4/15, 9:25 PM</a><br><br>

I notice this in our words where abstractions keep replacing 'reals' at some cost to both brevity and clarity (e.g. buses become transit vehicles, hospitals become wellness centres, schools become educational institutions etc.) - but it seems to pervade everything - increasingly we operate at further and further remove from the 'hands-on' physical processes that actually make things work.<br><br>2) On the topic of secular stagnation, it seems that the period following the oil crisis of the 1970's has generally been marked by slow growth (even in the flawed GDP metric) and much of the 'growth' there has been has gone to the wealthy. <br><br>But maybe only way to make there appear to be growth while at the same time not crashing into commodity shortages, is to direct almost all of the 'growth' to people who are already so wealthy that they won't actually try to spend (consume) any of their income, they will just plow it back into more 'investments' (driving up prices, but not increasing the demand on actual resources).<br><br>But the amount of money now in the hands of the wealthy has reached such absurd levels relative to the size of the real economy (see negative interest rates on government bonds around the world) that I wonder how much further this process can run without suffering some sort of break or schism. <br><br>Still, you might have said the same in the early 1990's (and many did) and the system staggers on decades later so who knows? - a long descent indeed.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c1039382919593358661 title="comment permalink">3/4/15, 10:31 PM</a><br><br>

Last week I was thinking how techno-progress in a market economy not only requires the externalization of costs, it requires the destruction of the commons. If I put too many sheep on the common pasture, the range is degraded and my neighbors may show up, faces blacked with stove ash, and burn my house down as a lesson. If however I know there is money to be made in the clothing business, I as the Lord can enclose the pasture, evict the commoners, send the shiftless lazy bums to work at my textile mill with for slave wages, and make a killing. If the range is degraded, I enclose more. If the Blacks or the Diggers show up, I have the King send in the army (or police humvees, if you will) So, in a way, we externalize community (and destroy handcrafts such as spinning yarn and weaving) And of course the shift from agrarian common life to market based city life is touted as such progress! Notice that the word "commoner" now has such derogatory connotations. I wonder if progress also requires increased hierarchy as well. Maybe Industrial Civilization is one gigantic act of enclosure.<br><br>After reading this weeks essay and thinking about how lost we feel in our techno-whiz bang prosthetically mediated lives, the image that came to mind was MC Escher's Ascending and Descending http://www.mcescher.com/gallery/most-popular/ascending-and-descending/ <br><br>When we are in the image, we go round and round, always trying to decide if it is up or down. Only if you pull back and look at the whole picture, do you see it's a crazy illusion that leads nowhere, but way down at the bottom, a stair leads OUT.<br><br>I am glad pornography was mentioned. IMHO this is one of the most insidious forms of mediation, on two levels. The words greek roots of the word are porni (prostitute) and graphein (to write). So essentially it is pictures of prostitution, if you will. There are all sorts of moral and ethical considerations such as the objectification and exploitation of women. I heard this show on NPR. They were talking about the sense of touch, and how the tiny hairs on our bodies are evolved to send a signal for pleasure in response to a touch, specific to the speed and pressure of a caress. Obviously porn removes tactile interpersonal intimacy and replaces it with a digitally induced artificial dopamine rush. And the internet took it out of run-down theaters and disreputable video stores and made it mainstream and free for all!<br><br>I suppose both Marxists and Capitalists want to convert nature into machines and their products and externalize the costs. They just argue over who should own the machines. Both systems fail in a finite world.<br><br>Corporations were a problem solving method, to concentrate capital for a specific purpose for a specific time period. Like the Plymouth Company chartered to expropriate timber, furs, and such to England. The real problem comes in when they become LLCs, insulating the shareholders from personal loss and damages, which puts externalization of steroids. Give them the rights of actual human beings, and now your in uncharted waters. (Here there be dragons!) Also the fact that the nation was founded as a Business Enterprise may have just as many ramifications as our baggage with slavery.<br><br>Apologies for being long winded, but so much was interesting.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c8647349015485039538 title="comment permalink">3/5/15, 12:22 AM</a><br><br>

It feels weird, given my relatively far-left wing political orientation, but I have always been a lover of antiquities and, as a linguist, "linguistic necrophile", genuinely interested only in dead languages (that's also why I, as a sinologist, have ended up with the specialization on Classical Chinese).<br><br>Self-critically, however, I must admit, that the time spared by machines (which I am no fan of) would be mostly used for reading non-fiction books (as a typical bookworm, and a mad philologist), or to translate something or write something. Although I cannot say I do not like manual work, although I have outdoor hobbies and love walking through the country, and although I enjoy gardening, processing of food, making wine etc., in those precious moments of free time, I often prefer to cut through the symbolic jungle of letters and sounds, signs and semantic structures - which, in the end, is again a very limited section of reality.<br><br>As for the internet (I do not own a TV set), I try not to spend too much time with it. For a philologist, it indeed is a marvelous TOOL, with all those primiary texts, paper on-line. linguistic corpora, or philologist's tools. On the other hand, I know I could do well without that. Deliberately, I refuse to rely on electronic dictionaries and on on-line resources, building a library on the subjects of my interest, including paper reference books, which for my students may look old fashioned. Often, I do not take my computer with my when I go away from my home or office, but take only a book, a small dictionary and a notebook, and dedicate free evening to old-school philology - translating, excerpting, whatever. And you know what? I am convinced that this approach takes you much closer to the text, enabling you also to "touch" and "smell" it and to focus on it properly, in a slow way.<br><br>Also, it is known that using electronic dictionaries leads to considerably lower capability of remembering the word - it is very quick and effortless; if you look up the same word in a paper dictionary 50 times, you may be sure you will remember it well. And of course, younger (or less conservative - I am not especially old) colleagues and students tend to employ these tools and prosthetics, not really tools: they do not want to say that real linguistic competence is to know it all by heart, to be a walking dictionary and grammar etc. What would do all these younger people when electronics goes away?<br><br>Be it as it may, I doubt that philology will be of any interest in times of crises, and thus it makes no difference. At least, I chose the same approach to sowing, cutting, mowing - no motor-equipped tools - except for a drilling machine, as there are no hand-powered drilling machines at hand and you would hardly drill a hole into concrete with them, heh.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c9044596028511781414 title="comment permalink">3/5/15, 2:21 AM</a><br><br>

One of this blog's main projects seems to be stripping naked the emperors of our age... unless they were already naked, which might be the point :)<br>Let us hope that meaning will not be found in violence, as the recent news would suggest (a Korean extremist slashing the symbol of US authority abroad in the face ? One of the US's most fond protectorate's President taking a stance too violent for even the Us's President himself to condone ?). Humans need pressure valves, and violence is one of them.<br><br>Maybe the contradiction between the narratives we have to live in and the narrative that we can infer from reality is one form of inner violence, and the response to that will be to find meaning in outer violence... It is common knowledge among psychologists that sometimes abused victims say they'd prefer some punctual physical violence over continuous verbal violence, since the latter is harder to make sense from. I think it is horrible to have to even think about comparing one form of violence with another, but it is also important to have in mind that what happens inside us sooner or later finds its way in how we relate to the outter world... And how or where we find meaning is one of the most important elements of our inner lives, after all.<br><br>In this respect, having to find meaning in passively going through the 120 episodes of the latest fad in TV series every week might be a form of self-inflicted violence... Humans are adapted to a certain scale of narrative content, a certain scale of social group size. And adapted to telling stories as well as hearing them, not just passively going through them all the time.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c7248126911944579503 title="comment permalink">3/5/15, 3:15 AM</a><br><br>

We decided that one of the things that is causing this malaise is the fact that so much of what we do now is an abstraction of a real activity.<br><br>"Social" media is an abstraction of real social activity. Paypal and online banking are abstractions of cash, which itself is an abstraction of items of value. Email is an abstraction of a hand-written letter, Twitter and texting are abstractions of actual communication. Even much of what we do for work produces intangible results. I was a graphic designer and I would "draw" using Adobe Illustrator, which is an abstraction of artistic mediums, to make digital graphics for websites, which is an abstraction of artwork. My husband creates business processes for computer programs used in digital transactions, which is so abstract as to be completely obtuse. <br><br>The practical outworking of all of these layers of abstraction is that there is a complete lack of anything tangible to hang onto. Friends, money, work products, artwork, communications etc... are comprised of 1's and 0's hanging out in the ether. There is nothing to hold on to and nothing to take pride in.<br><br>I'm not proud of my digital artwork, for all of the labor that I put into it, it doesn't seem real, and it isn't real and any normal sense of the word. I am proud of sweaters I knit, they're useful, and sometimes they're beautiful (although I may have to do some unraveling and re-knitting to get them to beautiful), but most importantly, they're REAL.<br><br>I like the idea of "Peak Meaninglessness" it captures what is going on out there very nicely.

In that sense, replacing a lost limb becomes a tool. As a stellar real-world example, you might look back to the early 1800s dentures craze. People with perfectly healthy mouths and who definitely did not need it, were having all their teeth removed to have a "perfect" set made for them.

She originally started making bread to save money back in the mid seventies, about twenty five years ago she acquired a Kenwood food mixer. Before Ken came into her life she made an OK but not exceptional loaf, after Kenny the bread was as good as any I have ever eaten and much better than most. Of course mum was not a professional baker so this is not surprising. Progress, that is technological progress it seems to me is now a process that replaces skills with hardware. The problem with skill is that it takes time to acquire and it's not possible in one lifetime to acquire all of the skills needed be wholly independent of other people, hence the need for society. Interestingly for the first two million or so years of human existence progress, evolutionary progress if there is such a thing was a process of replacing hardware, biological hardware with skills. In this way turning a bipedal chimplike creature into us. It's got to make you wonder quite what we're currently turning ourselves into.<br>Breaking news from the BBC.

After 2 feet of heavy, wet snow in November, which took out one apple and my sole productive peach tree, we had unusually warm weather December through late January, when temperatures plummeted. And we took a direct hit by the January blizzard that dodged a bit east of Boston, followed by 3+ months worth of snow within 3-4 weeks. The winds after the blizzard continued very high, which meant that no sooner had one trudged through thigh-deep snow, the newly tramped path was blown back over. We may also have broken some temperature records here on the coast. When I moved here, our winter lows never got below -15. Our coldest morning a couple weeks go registered -24 at 6:30 am. By 7am or so, it was already -21, which leaves me wondering what it was at 4 or 5 am, typically the coldest times in mid-winter. <br><br>As if nonstop shoveling and lugging buckets of hot water from kitchen to barn weren't enough, my arab mare developed a dry, nonproductive cough right around that time. In case it was due to the hay (2014 was a very wet year which increases the mold spore content), I added soaking 30-40 pounds of hay with hot water to my daily routine, so she wouldn't inhale the spores, as well as adding expectorant herbs to her dinner mash. The cough hung on until last week, when we had our first nights above zero since January, when it turned into a nice, wet sneeze. Arabian airways are extra large, which enables them to suck in vast amounts of hot desert air and gives them great endurance. Unfortunately, large aways are not efficient for warming frigid air, which apparently caused her brochial passages to seize up. Happily, she doesn't appear to have suffered any permanent damage and I suspect living in a herd would have offered protection from the worst effects of the cold. Anyway, one chore has been lifted, thank goodness.<br><br>My garden areas are now buried under 5+ feet of snow drifts. At work, we joked the other day about looking for crops that will grow in snow. I will be focusing this year on my peruvian purple potatos, since they cannot be replaced. Any extra space will likely go to crops with very short growing seasons. <br><br>In the meantime, a cyberfriend in Alaska wrote wondering where they'll start the Iditerod this year, due to lack of snow. It used to start in Wasilla, and then moved north from there in search of snow. Now, 350 miles to the north, Fairbanks is no longer reliably snowing enough. She suggested Boston...<br><br>The good news here is, no lives or roofs were lost. My outside work has switched from shoveling paths to shoveling trenches to see if I can protect the barn from flooding. The other good news is we seem to have entered a quiet week with some slow thaw days. Time will tell. <br><br>In the meantime, most extraneous, non-survival, activities have fallen by the wayside, replaced by shoveling and naps. It's amazing how much energy working in subzero temperatures sucks out of you. Time will tell which activities will re-appear as time and energy begin to recover.<br><br>Mary<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c1230135594824520084 title="comment permalink">3/5/15, 7:04 AM</a><br><br>

This included a couple sets of brake shoes a year, and over several years I replaced virtually every component except the front wheel and brake levers. I broke the rear axle once, probably while carrying that bag of garden lime. After that I built a small trailer. And my groceries were only a few dollars more than they would have been without the bike: $40-$50 per week. <br><br>And when comparing my current vehicle ('86 1-ton Toyota, 27 mpg) to walking, I have to think about what I carry on a regular basis. An old farmer told me once: "Never come home with and empty truck." Half the time I do anyway, but I try not to. There's free or nearly free building material, fuel, compostables, edibles, and tools out there. I know petroleum is a false economy, but in terms of cost per value of stuff I bring home, I think I'm doing well. <br><br>For instance, today, a friend wants me to visit, and it's a 1 hour drive, but if it wasn't for the snow in my way I'd pick up 1/3 cord of hardwood blocks and pay $7 for it on the way. <br><br>That's the problem with most cars: They're empty.

Is something we can address personally. The sequestering of atmospheric carbon is something most, if not all, of us can do by ourselves and as groups right now. How?....wait for it....TREES!! Yes lowly trees,which are made of carbon. Forest being the largest sequestering groups of trees and other woody perennials, followed by orchards, which is where my focus is. Orchards sequester large amounts of carbon, tons and tons and then some, throughout their lives. Did I mention they also offer food? I won't go too into this here it is a large subject, but I encourage folks to look into it. Fruit trees have a climb, peak, and decline in the amounts of carbon sequestered throughout their lives. My main interest (with a Oregonian hat tip to the Arch Druid) is Hazelnuts. Hazelnut trees like to be cut down to the ground every twenty years or so, thus bursting fourth with eager new shoots, absorbing atmospheric carbon as they grow. If one were to turn the removed crowns into bio-char, you could potentially lock up carbon for eons and beyond.<br>Another great thing about trees, is that almost anyone can plant them anytime, virtually anywhere, today! If everyone reading this blog planted ten, twenty, a thousand trees a year, that would make a world of difference to a world of things! Considering how much carbon we all produce and how much wood products we all use, we are almost morally obligated to do this!

The gasoline part is obvious, but the part sex plays on making us consumer slaves is like the elephant in the room.<br>I think the greatest obstacle in transitioning to a LESS society is that, in America at least, those who practice LESS will find themselves way out on the borderlands, not only as consumers, but also in the dating "game." Finding a mate is so central to our wellbeing that as long as movies and advertising define what a "good man" or "attractive woman" is, a more nuanced definition of success or integrity will be lost on the vast majority of people. <br>I am not going to buy a bread maker or a BMW, and as a single man I can attest that the LESS way will certainly repel most single women, who see it as "poverty." I do not mean to make this only a male problem either, as women certainly face their own problems with LESS. Those of us who choose LESS must accept being outliers, in any conventional sense. <br>I felt it was necessary to bring this up because the fear of being less "successful" socially is the best leverage the business world has in making us obey the consumer ethos. It is the greatest headwind working against a more sane way of life. For most people, the thought of life out on the fringes is too daunting.<br>Unfortunately, I think Thoreau has become a cliche to many, a name many refer to but few have carefully read. <br>Maybe if everyone was required to spend a month in the woods on their eighteenth birthday and read Economy, the first chapter of Walden, it would make them more thoughtful people for the rest of their lives.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c7655346711578568602 title="comment permalink">3/5/15, 8:01 AM</a><br><br>

I often wonder if this phenomenon isn't the basis of our culture's inability to see beyond next week. Thus, there are people who, instead of recognizing its obvious insanity, find no problem with the idea of injecting radioactive fracking waste into our groundwater. This quarter's profits now are all that matters.<br><br>The other is the British critic Raymond Williams. He wrote that, instead of being too materialist, we are not nearly materialist enough. And followed with:<br><br>"It is impossible to look at modern advertising without realizing that the material object being sold is never enough: this indeed is the crucial cultural quality of its modern forms.

Thoreau points out that if he stopped eating so much he could stop working so hard, and would be less hungry.<br>Also, to go off-topic: Long ago in the discussion of Magic I mentioned the concept of Dark Epistemology, but despite some ribbing couldn't explain what it meant. Thanks to some interviews by JMG I now have the language: The online rationalist community is a collective of amateur Theurges with two idiosyncrasies. One is the belief that Thaumaturgy is a fraught field, at best comparable to an emergency medical operation such as an amputation, and at worst the most dire sort of magical malpractice. Their second quirky belief is that all traditional ritual practices are inherently Thaumaturgical. The irony is that their belief that all wizards are Thaumaturges of a black stripe is probably what prevents them from looking to magic instead of reinventing the wheel.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c6877546517951365062 title="comment permalink">3/5/15, 8:16 AM</a><br><br>

The idea of “peak meaninglessness” really spoke to me personally and describes my experiences as our family goes through voluntary collapse. What I've discovered, quite by accident, is that those very human activities you mentioned, such as making bread and other “simple, homely, pleasant” activities, are what give meaning to my life. <br><br>If I spend my days wandering aimlessly from bread machine to computer to TV-–such that without them it would take me days to recover natural sensory experience --what meaning does my life have? It wasn't until we started changing our way of living that I realized I had reached my own personal peak of meaninglessness. Something had to give. Now that I've gotten some distance from that peak, I can see it for what it was, and every day I savor the depth of meaning I now have in my life - such as making pancakes from scratch with my homeschooled son this morning with eggs I collected from my chickens yesterday. <br><br>Of course I am taking some time to read the little colored pictures that make up your blog post this week, but nowadays time spent in front of the computer makes up only a small part of my life. Plus, reading your words each week certainly does add meaning to my life! I choose what I ingest carefully.<br><br>Part of this collapse we’re currently undergoing certainly will involve the personal collapse of many people, and I hope they discover, as many of us here have, that the collapse of meaninglessness can also bring the return of meaning into our individual lives. <br><br>Kelly<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c4278386916188065439 title="comment permalink">3/5/15, 9:01 AM</a><br><br>

Somewhat contrary to the article's headline, the actual finding reported in the <i>Grist</i> article is, "Of the top 20 region-sectors <i>ranked by environmental impacts</i>, none would be profitable if environmental costs were fully integrated." (emphasis added)<br><br>In other words, it's not the twenty biggest industries in e.g. revenue or employment, but the twenty most damaging ones, that would become unprofitable if they had to pay for the damage they do. That's rather less surprising. <br><br>Also, they're not listing entire industrial sectors per se (one might read it and think shipping, energy, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, mining, automotive, etc. as separate industries on that top 20 list, but it appears that's not the case), but regional industry sectors, so that for instance coal power generation in eastern Asia and coal power generation in North America count as two separate entries in the list.<br><br>The finding is still significant (and could still make the stronger statement true, if the most damaging industries are also the biggest ones, and/or if all the biggest industries are piggy-backing on the most damaging ones to a sufficient degree). But as usual, definitive answers about the true costs of most things in a complex interconnected economy are more elusive than we wish they would be. It could very well be true that the entire industrial economy would be unprofitable if its natural capital costs were internalized, but showing such things definitively remains a challenge. For instance, one must determine present internalized values for units of non-renewable resources, which is inherently problematic. A value of infinity brings all meaningful computation or comparison to a halt, but any finite valuation can only be arbitrary and can eventually lead to a contradiction.<br><br>In other news: it appears to me that all of our Squirrel Case Challenge entries have been outdone; indeed, put to shame; by Pornhub's satirical tech offering from this week. For old-fashioned propriety's sake I won't describe it or link to it, but googling "Wankband" will reveal all.<br><br>Finally: The new book is a wish fulfilled for me, for exactly the reasons you describe.

In fact, what's actually happening is that prices for many things are going up, because the Canadian dollar's purchasing power is way down, because of the oil price crash.

Whenever an extreme weather event, such as a heavy snowfall, temporarily shuts down the city (i.e. halts all travel by car, truck or bus) forcing people to walk or ski if they want to go anywhere, I've noticed that a sort of collective euphoria sets in, as if people just awoke from a dream and were being taught how to live again. I'd see them out walking in the middle of the street, without an agenda, just wanting to be outdoors to experience the wonderful mystery of Winter and greet their neighbors. If anyone was foolish enough to drive their cars and ended up stuck in a snow drift people from all over would come running to their assistance, get behind the bumper and start pushing until the car was freed, laughing and cheering loudly when they succeeded. (Of course the driver would end up stuck again a few blocks on and the scene would repeat itself.) There were some, of course, who would complain about the inconvenience but most seemed to relish these holidays forced upon the city by Mother Nature and wish they would happen more often. Its these experiences that convince me- and give me hope- that as alienated as people may have become (with "amputated imaginations", as you put it) in this techno-crazed world we've created there seems to be a living soul buried deep inside everyone that can awaken, as if from a dream, and find its way back to a truly fulfilling, meaningful, non-destructive way of life. Unfortunately we here in Minnesota got a snowless winter this year. Thanks to climate change all the big storms moved to the east coast, yet somehow I finds this comforting too. There are some things that we will never be able to control, only learn to adapt to. The sooner we accept this the better it will be for all.

But I am wiser than that. I have learned that the swiftest traveller is he that goes afoot. I say to my friend, Suppose we try who will get there first. The distance is thirty miles; the fare ninety cents...Well, I start now on foot, and get there before night; You will in the meanwhile have earned your fare, and arrive there some time tomorrow, or possibly this evening, if you are lucky enough to get a job in season.

Everyone had a telephone, but only one in the house. Since this was long before cell phones, and because everyone spent most of their time in the barn, or fields calling someone to arrange a visit was an exercise in futility. So it was common to just go visit, or stop by the neighbors to borrow something without calling ahead as most people do now. This had many beneficial side effects ( or just natural situations that were later negated by the externalities of the telephone.) <br> One of these was the simple uncomplicatedness of not having to arrange things in advance etc. Another was that people ( even doing dirty farm work) rarely dressed as if they were ready for bed( except after visiting hours ( a nod to Jim Kunstler here.) It gave you a much closer and more intimate realtion to your neighbors as you would just roam their farm or house looking for them when needed. Also the custom of these time ( and earlier) was that if you showed up when they were working you were expected to pitch in and work too, as long as you were around. You were no longer a visitor or spectator in their lives, but a participant. The list of benefits to this arrangement goes on and on.

I say to my friend, Suppose we try who will get there first. The distance is thirty miles [to Fitchberg]; the fare ninety cents. That is almost a day's wages. I remember when wages were sixty cents a day for laborers on this very road. Well, I start now on foot, and get there before night; I have travelled at that rate by the week together. You will in the mean while have earned your fare, and arrive there some time to-morrow, or possibly this evening, if you are lucky enough to get a job in season. Instead of going to Fitchberg, you will be working here the greater part of the day. And so, if the railroad reached round the world, I think that I should keep ahead of you; and as for seeing the country and getting experience of that kind, I should have to cut your acquaintance altogether."<br><br>Later in the chapter "Sounds," Thoreau rhapsodizes from page 108 to 113, on the Fitchberg railroad. Evidently, he had rather mixed feelings. <br><br>But I love the book. Three days suspension in the 10th grade for a case of silly insubordination presented me with golden hours spent reading the book cover to cover.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c1437175659419215420 title="comment permalink">3/5/15, 9:51 AM</a><br><br>

I have always preferred the satisfaction of hands on labor and hobbies vs newest iphone, video game, fastest car etc. I have never been able to successfully defend myself against the castigation of my peer group, when my proclivities are brought into the light, other than to joke that I am an engineer and a luddite, making me akin to the crazy cat lady in their eyed. secretly during these discussions, I find myself thinking "why would I spend money on these trifles that are nothing more than glorified entertainment distraction devices? why would I continue to deny myself the pride and pleasure of having hobbies and satisfaction of living my life more on my terms than by the latest apple product release?" I listen to these people talk of theirnlives outisde of work and it sounds horribly boring...tv and buying things....entertainment instead of production. <br>thanks to this latest series of blog posts, I finally have the words to turn the discussion in a productive direcction, instead of just cracking self depricating jokes and trying to change the subject. now I can couch the issue in terms of tools vs prosthetics. for example I want to learn to use a slide rule this year as it is a long lasting, non battery powered tool, as opposed to a calculater- battery powered prosthetic. <br>thank you JMG for your exquisite essays each week.

But I feel I should point out what seems like a contradiction. You wrote something that seems completely at odds, with what you wrote in this month's Well of Galabes blog.<br><br>"Whatever you think you’re doing when you’re sitting in front of one of these things, what you’re actually doing is staring at little colored pictures on a glass screen and pushing some buttons."<br><br>"You could as well say that a poem is explained by saying that it consists of black marks on paper: a true statement, but one that misses most of what’s meaningful about the phenomenon."<br><br>On the one hand, I could not agree more with the general sentiment of this week's blog. I find myself living an increasingly less mediated life. I can count the times we have ordered take out this year on one hand (and that was mostly because the sink was backed up), I make my own bread, I garden, I prepare herbal remedies, I try to unplug as much as possible, and I do things by hand that most people prefer a high maintenance machine for. I'm always looking for ways to do things more simply and directly, avoiding prosthesis if you will.<br><br>However, I think there is something to be gleaned from exploring what seems like a contradiction between the sentiment expressed in your two blogs. I keep decreasing my electronic media consumption and while I don't argue about the signal to noise ratio out there, I think on a certain level your argument in this weeks blog too closely resembles the one you criticize in galabes. I think people are doing more than looking at colored images on a screen, just as people reading poetry are doing more than staring at black marks on a page. Though perhaps it depends on the particular medium. I grew up with video games, but the older I get the more it seems that the people who still play them are just looking at colors and pressing buttons. But I would not say that applies to me reading this blog and commenting. <br><br>Then again, perhaps it is an error of logical typing on my part.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c7549167677694553204 title="comment permalink">3/5/15, 10:46 AM</a><br><br>

And I'll still take credit for rephrasing your point in terms I find more direct :^)<br><br>In trying to make a living outside the Corporate Matrix, I've run headlong into externalization. The non-profit I'm now working for insists on calling me an "independent contractor," thereby externalizing responsibility for the provision of my healthcare, savings and taxes onto the gov't and I. Robert Reich recently wrote about this corporate trend: <a href=http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/02/23/why-were-all-becoming-independent-contractors rel=nofollow>Why We're All Becoming Independent Contractors</a>. But, even as we take on a greater load, we're being given greater freedom from the mind control. The more responsibility I've taken on, the more confidence I have in my own self-reliance. Ergo, I feel less dependent on the mainstream society. It has also put me in touch with people I never would've encountered before, broadening and strengthening my social support network. <br><br>In this way, Capitalism seems to be opening the door for the next seral stage in the succession of human civilizations. (Can you tell I'm reading "Overshoot?") Marx had the same theory, although he was far too sanguine about the process and the result. This is what gives me hope for the kids being taught in our crumbling schools. If all they learn is that the system doesn't work for them anymore, they'll be smarter than I was when I graduated (which was dumber than when I started school). They'll know enough not to buy into the American Dream. They'll reject pseudo-materialism, making them less likely to choose the corporate or the (officially) criminal path.<br><br>But even after that intellectual obstacle has been hurdled, there's still an emotional gauntlet to negotiate. The friends who would've been most supportive of my choice to simplify are apparently too busy to socialize anymore. The friends I'm still in touch with are less receptive to this viewpoint. My parents, with whom I'm living and on whom I've become increasingly dependent emotionally, don't approve of my decision. Hopefully, I'll bust through this rough patch soon, but it highlights the social barriers to escaping the civil religion of Progress. When the people most inclined to help you escape are stretched too thin to lend a hand, you're pretty much on your own. Ironically, I think that's the situation those of us inclined to escape least want to be in.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c982148273474685489 title="comment permalink">3/5/15, 11:02 AM</a><br><br>

First, they do not require that one use a premade "mix". I've made many, many bread loaves in a machine, and used whole wheat flour, dry yeast bought in bulk (one teaspoon per loaf), water from my well, and a bit of salt and oil. But why use a machine rather than do it by hand? To bake bread without a machine one needs to learn to recognize when the dough has the right level of moisture. One also needs to be around to monitor the rising of the dough, somehow keeping it warm for hours, and then move it to the oven, then removing from the oven when done. Most people have trouble being around and paying attention that long, and might want fresh bread in the morning or when they return from work. If the machine means the difference between homemade bread (from picked ingredients) and commercial bread, isn't the homemade choice a plus?<br><br>That said, in recent months I've gone on to keeping a sourdough culture and processing it by hand. It takes planning ahead, but I only bake bread once in 10 days or so so I find the right days. E.g., take the starter out of the fridge Friday morning, add water &amp; flour, add yet more Friday evening, then spend some time Saturday morning mixing and kneading, then monitoring the slow rise, and baking in the late afternoon.<br><br>I've also used the "no knead" recipe a number of times, that does not require any special equipment, nor that one have a sourdough starter. And of course does not require kneading, if that's a problem.<br><br>I should also report that most bread machines are built to break and to not be repairable. E.g., the paddle that kneads the dough is made of plastic that soon cracks. Or the drive belt stretches over time and a replacement is not available. Been there done that. Some brands and models are better.<br><br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c8136993302012073127 title="comment permalink">3/5/15, 11:02 AM</a><br><br>

Quote JMG: “…so long as they’ve been convinced that having those products symbolizes some abstract quality they want…” This is very true, but it is by no means limited to the realm of shabby consumer products. Having grappled with it for a bit (and it’s well worth doing so), I’m beginning to see it as a deeply ingrained pattern that is at the heart of nearly every activity that people in industrial society engages in these days. Not only is any activity you’d care to name bent towards creating or acquiring something that is utterly symbolic in nature, but the symbolic value itself is consistently and systematically derived from the odd fact that the symbolic object or action for all practical purposes always amounts to exactly the opposite of whatever it is that it is supposed to be symbolizing. It is a remarkably persistent and ubiquitous pattern, and it fields examples galore: People routinely submerge themselves in debt (anti-wealth) in order to acquire objects that symbolize wealth, they submit themselves to e-dumbuh-cation at increasingly clueless institutions to obtain papers that symbolize the very capacity for thought that gets mercilessly butchered in the process, they strive to symbolically save the environment with even more technological complexity, create symbolic health care systems that makes everybody sicker, and attempt to symbolically return to nature by substituting food and material from plants and animals with green marketed crap that comes straight out of the laboratory. It is equally persistent on a smaller scale, in the way most people make decisions, respond to situations and otherwise go about the business of their daily lives. I would invite readers to look out for it wherever they go. I for one find my workplace to be the far better arena for observing this, as it is more frequently taken to its logical extreme in that particular setting. It has a definite batesonian flavour to it, and as such the third leg of the tripod will necessarily be the insistence that the conflict between the two injunctions must never be addressed.<br><br>I belive this particular thing deserves its own name. Suggestions, anyone?<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c3137188772218469531 title="comment permalink">3/5/15, 11:17 AM</a><br><br>

These are not to my taste, either. I’d like to add though, that the part about the lights bouncing on the screen is not about reducing and activity to its fundamental core, but rather about reducing it to a blunt narrative about basic physical components, and that is not in any way the same as “core” or “essence”. That particular point needs to be made, because it is precisely the act of mistaking the latter for the former that throws open the gates to the pit of nihilism, and having the differences between the two clearly in mind is arguably the best safeguard we have against it.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c8947959935877694140 title="comment permalink">3/5/15, 11:49 AM</a><br><br>

During the discussion I pointed out that video games are a wholly useless activity, since it doesn't really train your senses. He argued back saying that he experienced the fifth ring during some game sessions, where he dominated his opponents by pushing all the right buttons without even thinking about it. I asked him how that was related to the void state that Musashi talks about, and he responded that it was very similar because his hand eye coordination was so perfect that he could commit the action without thinking. I pointed out that the void state and his gaming literally couldn't be similar. He asked why and I pointed out that when a martial artist is fighting they're on their feet and using at least five senses – sight, hearing, smell, touch, and spacial. Not to mention that you're using your whole eye, tracking natural colors, natural sounds, and objects in three dimensions. I asked him how this could possibly be similar to sitting in one spot while drunk or high (as most gamers are), staring at a screen designed to stimulate your senses, and pushing buttons. He had no answer.<br><br>I've started teaching him meditation to show him a glimpse of the unconnected world.

No, I didn't do either. What I did was ask my husband to sharpen them. He used a file and muscle power, same as I did. But since they aren't his tools (he has plenty of his own tools to keep sharp and does that), my asking him to sharpen them represented an externalization of the cost associated with sharpening (my time and effort). Even as tiny an externalization as that still puts the experience at a remove from me. I was depriving myself of the meaningfulness of doing the work myself, of understanding exactly why a sharpened tool works better, of the connection between the work and the result.<br><br>So yesterday I took up the file and the tools and figured out how to put an edge on my garden tools. In the case of my favorite hoe it was long past time to do that. It no longer had an edge at all. No wonder it was so ineffective last year. When I was done, the hoe had a nice sharp edge, ready for work next month. But I gained something more than a sharp hoe, more than the knowledge of how to sharpen it when it next needs it. Each time I learn how to do something myself, unmediated, it feels real and meaningful. I would have lost out on the sense of meaning, of the connection between work and result, if my husband had sharpened the tools, even though I could have used the tools for their intended purposes.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c6061671934905348914 title="comment permalink">3/5/15, 1:30 PM</a><br><br>

Yes I used to have a Bread Machine, bought it about 10 years ago and used it all the time. Never really liked the screwy shaped loaves it made.

Into the cold oven (electric) for maybe another half hour, then I turn on the oven, when it's up to temp I set the timer for 35 minutes. Presto! 2 nice loaves of bread. The texture is much better than the same exact recipe made in the machine! And no stupid cavity in the loaf from the paddle. Much easier to clean the loaf pans than the pan for the machine.<br><br>Once I forgot and let the first rise go for over 2 hours, still great bread.

In doing so, we use a sort of PEROEI (Personal EROEI) as a basis.<br><br>Yesterday, son wanted to purchase a gizmo for the bees that is designed to drain directly into mason jars as the honey is produced. It was $250 - so we had the sit down. PEROEI would not be impacted with this "amazing new beehive design" - one still wants to check the health of the bees and the hive regularly. Not looking in on them is just nutty in the age of Monsanto. So that is not going to be an advantage.<br><br>Next, would it allow us to avoid buying a centrifuge? Well, not really, because eventually you have to split hives and such. Centrifuge required when getting into each box. <br><br>Additionally, at $250 per 'self harvesting' hive, compared to $25 per hive to make a nice Langstroth, we could increase production more with the same money.<br><br>Then what about the other issues - such as breaking the glass jars in transit from the bee area? And then cleaning them up, because they get nasty in the sun and dust and rain. We don't have many black bears around, but coons sure go for any honey they can smell and not get stung in doing so. This has coon and possum madness written all over it.<br><br>And then, we are stuck buying these special parts for this thing in perpetuity.<br><br>So, from a PEROEI standpoint, this makes no sense - the old way fits better into raising, gathering and delivering honey at lesser overall expense and risk.<br><br>Second discussion was on putting in another well - turns out that this huge sunk cost has a long payout. Based on rainfall over the last 4 years, putting in above ground rain catchment cisterns will net the same amount of water as we are after with the well. Wells require pumps and power and $12,000 just to dig. <br><br>Cisterns cost $3500 and the guttering and valving $300 - placing them on the high ground means gravity fed water pressure without a pump working.<br><br>From both cash and PEROEI - cisterns win for us, especially in the maintenance, time and cash departments. Yes, constructing them will take a couple of weekends, but the well would take one weekend to get in and then there is the maintenance and the power it uses. Cistern maintenance consists of draining a single valve every few months to drop out the sediment - no puling the pump or screen out as i conventional well.<br><br>And lest we forget, the cash we use is all from trading our time to someone else - renting ourselves out for salary or hourly wages. Free time IS free money. <br><br>For us, PEROEI seems to let us work out what makes sense to do and what is just a bell, whistle or "conventionally accepted" approach or technology.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c1405242383763175331 title="comment permalink">3/5/15, 3:48 PM</a><br><br>

The only thing this is good for is making money selling "home-knit goods" perhaps. So the machine gathers dust in the back room, along with the treadmill she bought because her doctor wanted her to walk 10,000 steps a day; and she wonders what in the world is wrong with her that she can't bring herself to do *anything*!<br><br>Pat, with a half-done hand-crocheted hat waiting for me to have a spare minute.

If somebody were sitting on the couch reading a book of Robert Service poems, and said that he was experiencing the Alaskan tundra, then it would be appropriate to point out that, no, strictly speaking, he was reading a bunch of printed words on paper a long way away from Alaska, and the experience of doing so is not the same as the experience of being in Alaska. That's the difference I was pointing up in this week's post.<br><br>If the reader on the couch were to talk about his experience of the poetry as poetry, on the other hand, it would be beside the point to insist on the black marks on paper, other than to marvel at how so simple a set of stimuli can produce intense esthetic experiences. In the same way, if you want to talk about watching little images on a glass screen as such, without confusing it with other kinds of experience or treating it as a substitute for the latter, that's a subject for discussion all its own. <br><br>Stuart, I can sympathize with the babies, too.

That's another story.) of the environmental and ecological problems that we face in the world today. Derrick Jensen apparently thinks that Hardin's seminal 1968 essay was not profound. He mentions that indigenous tribes would never allow any of its members to overexploit an important common resource.<br><br>The problem with Derrick Jensen's claim is that it assumes that adequate information about the status of a common resource is available to everyone. This fact is simply not true in any but the simplest cases. In the modern world, the externalities of an economic activity are often obscured, sometimes deliberately. When those externalities are obscured, groups of people can exploit a resource without having any sense at all of the deleterious consequences of their actions. This is where the tragedy comes in.<br><br>(2) Derrick Jensen focuses on bringing the present highly destructive industrial economic system down "by some means". I sympathize with his melancholy, horror and desperation.<br><br>However, when you factor in human nature, it seems evident that a person would usually do better by setting an example in their own lives for others to follow instead of beating their head against the brick wall of the juggernaut of economic growth, industrialization and wanton exploitation.<br><br>Living simply, not having too many children, learning basic crafts and repair skills, learning organic gardening, disengaging from a good portion of the fossil fuel based economy, etc., while encouraging others to do the same is more likely to be effective than sabotaging industrial equipment, although there may be cases where such activities have their place.<br><br>Is this similar to your complaints about Derrick Jensen?<br><br>In spite of this, I admire Derrick Jensen.

Each Well needs several hundred semi-truck loads of water, sand, and drilling mud for the Hydro-fracking procedure (something not necessary for a conventional Natural Gas well which would only need drilling mud). Since each semi-truck on average does one-thousand times the damage of an average car to the road surface, the idea was that the normal taxes on natural gas production needed to be increased to pay for the damage which would be done to the roads. The Natural Gas producers argued that they wouldn't making any profit if the taxes were increased, they eventually won from what I remember. What did increase since then is that the State passed a ten billion dollar bond along with a sales tax increase, which is being spent on the State Highways. ...So for a little while the natural gas companies will get to pretend they're not losing money, and the State of Arkansas will pretend that the natural gas companies aren't tearing up the roads and costing the State money. <br>On another note.

This does make a dense, hearty loaf, but good. I usually knead it a bit in the bowl before the first rise. The other trick when making it this way is to have a somewhat wetter dough than you would with a fully kneaded, part white flour bread. Also, in a cold house, quick-rise yeast works pretty well. <br><br>Saturday is often a cooking day (making ahead for the week and doing more complex recipes) so I start the bread first before getting into chopping vegetables or whatever. When the house is cold, the first rise can take up to two hours and the second rise in the pans an hour. When you're doing other cooking, the kitchen heats up, of course, so that's another advantage of scheduling this way.<br><br>I also often cook (but don't make bread) after supper so we have "home-made fast food" the next day when we come home hungry.

Very thought-provoking. You've expanded the concept of 'externality' the limit---to not only mean the pushing of costs onto someone or sometime else, but also to include the foolish sacrifice of human potential. whatever we call it, modern life surely creates a deep emptiness when we separate ourselves from our food, nature, and each other. And I can't help but think our current 'free market capitalism' ethos puts the separation process on steroids by making everyone else our competitor. Even waiting in line or driving in traffic makes us competitors, and more separate and alone.

As I read this post, I play and sing a haunting dog latin (gibberish) refrain: "Samia dostia, ari aditida, tori adito madora..."<br><br>In this post JMG is onto something but doesn't quite spell it out. Eventually, all that work - the bread making, the beer brewing, the harvesting - has to be <i>for</i> something or it will feel like suffering. Many people today do the work to get their bread but are not sure what they're doing it "for" other than a night of computer games.<br><br>Traditionally there are two things that have worked consistently across all cultures, often combined: socialization and music. The harvest was culminated with a great harvest festival, the spring day with a spring song, and you could really lose yourself in the moment, compared to the many things we do today where we try to achieve that effect but often don't quite get there. Our obsession with immortalizing times of happiness (with photographs, videos, et cetera) may contribute to this feeling of unwellness as I'm not sure such times were ever meant to be experienced in anything but the present moment.<br><br>Alan Watts wrote that his ideal afterlife would be an eternity of losing himself in moments of his own creation and imagination, experienced vividly in a sort of dance (or something like that, I never really understood Watts).<br><br>The point is, playing instruments like the mountain dulcimer, even alone, can be a "for" that all your work allows you to do. It's meditative. You can lose hours doing it and finish smiling without the slightest tinge of guilt. If you're a good player, you make other people nearby happy. I was surprised to learn in one of Ruth Goodman's documentaries that far more people in the past took up some kind of music even though fancy instruments such as pianoforte remained privileges.<br><br>Other people will find more appropriate "fors." Maybe computer games are okay for this. I don't know, but it doesn't seem like it.

"Flower Cigarettes" she said "but you smell them, not smoke them." <br><br>Sadly I don't even know the names of the flowers in the rolled leaves, but those tubes of pedals were the most wonderful thing to smell!

I realized tonight that so many artificial things and materials smell awful or wholly uninteresting.

There is no accounting for taste, but lets be blunt, none of our concoctions have ever matched a fragrant flower for beauty of aroma. <br><br>The sense of smell had to be simply cut off for people to not notice that detail about us not being materialists. Car companies long ago notices that the shape of the car was most important to how it sold. The look, appearance, image of the thing. We are idealists, but with very confused (or would this be discord?) ideals. Of course what would that matter to American Materialists?

You need to make bread is flour, water, yeast, and salt. If you do it the Italian way of making a well on the counter with you flour, you don't even need a bowl. And in a pinch, you don't even need an oven. I make tortillas often just using a cast iron skillet to cook the rolled out dough.

That increasing complexity has costs associated with it that are externalized, eventually leading to collapse of one or more systems on which the costs of complexity are externalized.<br><br>There are two other kinds of progress you mentioned at the beginning of your essays on progress, namely economic progress and social progress. I wondered if these two kinds of progress also exhibit increasing complexity leading to externalizing of costs leading to breakdown of the essential systems being forced to bear those costs.<br><br>It seems to me that increasing intermediation resulting from social progress also involves externalizing costs. For instance, medical insurance is a form of intermediation between doctors and patients. Many people laud universal medical insurance as progress. However, insurance creates costs to externalize. Insurance companies build office buildings and replace them on a whim. They require an increasing use of paper forms and later, computers and internet and must externalize those costs. I can think of other kinds of social progress that work similarly and, like insurance, link up with increased technological complexity and its effect.<br><br>Economic progress seems to be measured as increasing GDP. That too involves an increase of externalization, often through increased technological complexity. Increasing intermediation also increases the GDP, as when people go to paying jobs and then have to hire out cooking, cleaning, and care for family members.<br><br>Does this make any sense, even in the very rudimentary form in which I've developed it so far? It seems to me that all these forms of progress connect together through different sorts of increasing complexity and resultant externalization of costs.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c7654960220328077137 title="comment permalink">3/6/15, 9:49 AM</a><br><br>

I've heard that turning the light on in the oven - with the door closed - gives off a good amount of heat."<br><br>- yes, all good ideas. I often put my bowl of activating sourdough mix overnight near the wood stove or in some other warmish place. And after the kneading, let it rise in the (propane-fueled) kitchen oven that's been briefly on, has the (60 watt) light bulb on, and/or in which I also placed a covered pot full of hot water and/or am simultaneously cooking something on the range above it. The oven is an insulated box. Rather poorly insulated relative to, say, a "haybox cooker". But it's still a good box to create local warmth in. With sourdough, unlike fast-acting yeast, the rise of the dough can still take 3-5 hours, but what's the rush?<br><br>BTW when I replaced the kitchen range a few years ago I selected a model (out of only two available in the USA) in which the oven can be used even while the electricity supply is absent. Light it with a match, and it has no "glow bars" - and no "pilot light" either. Of course the range top can also be lit with a match. Little details like that can make a big difference in a future of intermittent grids.<br><br>As far as kneading, I find that I "need to knead" the sourdough quite a bit in order to absorb enough flour into it (a bit at a time) to make it less runny while rising. Otherwise it flows over the top of the pan, etc. Perhaps there is some other mixing trick I need to learn, to achieve that without a longish kneading session.

Gravity is a wonderful thing and the energy cost of pumping water from ground level back uphill only a small head / elevation is negligible compared to that of bringing water up from a long way underground. Personally I'd follow both above and below ground water storage methods for long term systems, but favour the above ground storage as you can see what is in there and vary your usage accordingly. That is how it is done down under.

Over time, that play resulted in collections of materials: settings/maps, lists of characters, creatures, story elements like enchanted artifacts, rules for resolving various special situations, adventure "modules" and so forth.<br><br>Those original inventors promptly packaged those collections up as "official authorized" source materials for everyone else to use to play the game. Thus tabletop role playing as we still know it today was born.<br><br>But it never thrived. Not really. Everyone knows that was because it was a thing for nerds (back before nerds were ever even slightly cool), but there was another hidden problem. It rarely worked well. The progress and outcome of most games didn't make the players feel their characters were the adventuring protagonists they were supposed to be. (The many flavors of dysfunction that could ensue are hilariously documented in the comic book "Knights of the Dinner Table," among other places.)<br><br>When it did work, it was often because groups of players learned to break the official rules in various and often rather fundamental ways. Different ways of breaking the rules led to different styles and philosophies of play, generating heated debate over which ways were appropriate. These debates could never be resolved because the basic assumption behind them, that the published materials were a reasonable starting point for all such departures, remained (and remains) taken for granted.<br><br>After much trial and error, I worked out my own philosophy of play, disregarding not only major parts of the rule books but also the basic assumptions behind them. Later, once I'd run numerous successful game "campaigns," I too had notebooks full of original maps, creatures, story elements, and so forth. I thought, "I should publish these for others to use," and then I realized the problem. That would be re-setting the same trap I'd escaped from. The content of those books was the <i>output</i> of our play, just as the original D&amp;D source books were the output of those first D&amp;D games. Put less charitably, they were the <i>waste product</i> of our shared creative fun times. And trying to use someone else's waste product as your input, your fuel… is not going to work well, in general.<br><br>This is an unimportant example in the greater scheme of things, but it makes a good metaphor for understanding more important system breakdowns. Whenever I see a system struggling with perversely persistent problems, I now look for an output being mistakenly used as an input, or at least, a by-product being confused with the desired output.<br><br>For example, in the American education system, the educated student should be the main result, and the various evaluations and ratings of the student along the way should be a by-product to be discarded once the process is complete. Quite the reverse is true instead. Imagine the relative fates of two teachers, one who graded thoroughly but failed to educate, and another who educated thoroughly but failed to grade. The former will likely retire after a long career; the latter won't last a semester.<br><br>Even more pervasive: the redirection (beginning many decades ago) of the various kinds of social gatherings named "parties," from a shared endeavor to entertain one another to the shared passive consumption of pre-made entertainment such as recorded music and (later) video. The activity had to be re-designed to adapt to using what should have been the output—the entertainment—as the input. The step from there to everyone sitting in the same room watching and listening to their own hand-held devices was a small one by comparison.<br><br>Unfulfilling? Yeah; that follows pretty obviously.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c7385103098584987333 title="comment permalink">3/6/15, 3:00 PM</a><br><br>

A microwave oven is actually a useful cooking tool, but it's not a robot chef. Most people using microwave ovens, I've found, don't even know how to change the power level setting, which is a bit like using a conventional oven but keeping it heated to 500 degrees F no matter what you're trying to cook. Rapid cooking at high intensities is something microwaves are terrible for (which makes the early marketing to the contrary very unfortunate); ironically, they're best for applying small amounts of heat gradually. A double boiler is often a good low-tech substitute, but the microwave is more flexible. And yes, you do have to be aware of how microwave heating variously affects starches, fats, proteins, cell walls and so forth. Don't nuke carrots if you're not planning to mash them.<br><br>Something else that can be used as a tool or misused as a prosthesis: cookbooks. (Showing that the problem isn't unique to high-tech artifacts.) It's hard to learn to cook without using recipes, but if the cook thinks what they're ultimately learning is how to correctly follow recipes to achieve the correct results (which unfortunately is often how the subject is presented), it becomes an intimidating rather than fulfilling activity. Given the seeming choice between turning the task over to a robot, and acting as a recipe-following robot themselves, it's no wonder that so many choose the former option.<br><br>A cookbook that's been put to really good use is full of hand-written annotations. Not that a treasured notebook of family recipes (somewhat like those role playing game sourcebooks) can't be a wonderful end product of decades of kitchen experience, and an immeasurably valuable legacy tool. It's just that it mustn't become a straitjacket.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c8642353724556200401 title="comment permalink">3/6/15, 3:23 PM</a><br><br>

I can just imagine Emerson's relief at hearing Thoreau's plans to build a cabin - 'Yes, of course, old chap, take as much land as you want. I think the FAR side of the wood would be best.. maybe near the pond? Excellent, off you go, God speed, let me know if you need to borrow a spade or a hammer..'<br><br>All of Walden is a tirade against Peak Meaningless, which unknown to Thoreau, had not actually peaked yet. He was mad as hell at at it just as it was getting into its stride. His entire experiment at Walden Pond was an attempt remove as much of the mediation of 19C 'modern' life as possible, 'to front only the essential facts of life' and therein find out what life really means..<br><br>And yet.. his experiment at Walden lasted only two years. He decided that he had several more lives to lead, and this was only one of them. I think, from my reading, that he concluded that the stripping away of the 'meaningless' and the cultivation of the 'meaningful' happened principally in the mind, and did not depend on living in a cabin in the woods. Whew, that means I can stay in the suburbs. But, he recommends a quiet mind that recognises that what society offers is merely smoke and mirrors. What we can do without - those expensive prostheses - makes us stronger and more fully human.<br><br>'Cultivate poverty like a garden herb... Do not trouble yourself much to get new things, whether clothes or friends. Turn the old; return to them... It is life near the bone where it is sweetest. You are defended from being a trifler... Superfluous wealth can buy superfluities only.

To me this is upside down. Honeybees can bloody well take care of their own business...if we're not screwing up their business whenever we feel like it.<br><br>From my comment:<br><br>"Zee Germans have a word - yeah, OK, in any other language it'd be 2 or 3 words - for a concept that seems to be getting missed here in the comments section: "Nestduftwärmebindung". It introduces the notion of a combination of heat and scent that provides a beehive with its unique, nurturing and disease-resistant "nest atmosphere," which should not be disturbed. In this view, it is incumbent upon us a beekeepers to respect the bees' need to maintain this nest atmosphere and to design hives and management protocols that disrupt it as little as possible."<br><br>This point seems to get missed whenever Langstroth-style hive managers pop in to educate everyone else on the subject.<br><br>I don't know what the long-term success of the Flow Hive will look like, and I certainly acquiesce to as much in the rest of my comment, but if nothing else, this new hive is excellent at getting to the honey without disturbing the nest atmosphere.

That which is missing is what I will hesitantly call "internalities", or the act of reaping profits from activities in which you did not participate. While we can see that burning oil has many serious externalities in the form of pollution, there are also many internalities associated with it's "production", or more accurately it's "extraction". Under the current paradigm we can't for example say that the depletion of the Saudi oil fields are a cost put onto future generations, that oil belongs to the Saudi's or whoever else managed to make the oil somehow there's. But how can they make that resource there's? That oil was created by biological/geological processes which took place long before the first human even came into existence. I think a large amount of the modern world's delusions come from the fact that we seem to just skip over the act of converting oil, soil, minerals and any number of different things into the private property of human beings without ever taking into account that these resources where created by natural processes that those who received ownership usually had no involvement in and in most cases took time on geological scales to be built up. By overlooking this we don't just fall into the trap of thinking there must always be some new resource just waiting to be discovered that we can loot, we miss the fact that a majority of the economic activity which has occurred over the last maybe three hundred years has been based upon the humans laying claim to resources which they did not create and burning through them in an amount of times which is infinitesimal compared to the what was required to make them.

Put less charitably, they were the waste product of our shared creative fun times."<br><br>What an intriguing distinction you have drawn. Art in general is the output of creative play, and an observer of art experiences something very different than the creator did. On the one hand, I would not want to disparage every sculpture and drawing as being inferior to the act of sculpting and drawing -- with no viewer, nothing gets communicated. On the other hand, I can easily conceive of the recorded facsimiles of live performances as waste products of the performers' shared fun times.<br><br>Whether you are producing or consuming live art, you are participating in a shared ritual act. Some performances are even designed to draw observers into trance, blurring any distinction between observer and performer. Balinese Barong dances, Senegalese masked dances, and American Pentecostal and Baptist services all fit that bill. As does moshing at a punk concert.<br><br>As with your creative role-playing, the deadening seems to come in when we try to capture the evanescent joy of a living activity by recording it. The rules and maps or sights and sounds can be captured, but not the joy and play. Thus the need for laugh tracks.<br><br>The whole genre of art called film could be considered the waste product of actors, directors, designers, composers, etc. playing together as both artist and audience. (More charitable than calling it group masturbation.) Similarly, the whole genre of art called literature could be considered the best approximation anyone has come up with for capturing the experience of live storytelling down on paper.

In fact, the very same criticism sparked off when the printing press was invented. People who'd get lost in virtual realities and such. And just as funny, some of these reservations were.. ahem.. PRINTED.<br><br>But concerning the so-called time-saving things, you've hit the nail on the spot.

Today, our productivity is a multiple of what it was, say, 60 years ago.

I disagree with Watts, for whatever that's worth (and it may just be a matter of different tastes): the thought of losing myself in moments of my own creation doesn't interest me much, as it sounds a bit masturbatory for my tastes. I prefer those moments that are created in conjunction with others -- human, nonhuman, or superhuman, take your pick. <br><br>Val, if I had the time, I'd get into old-fashioned photography of the basement-darkroom variety, and quite possibly the make-your-own-photographic-paper variety as well. That sounds fun, and if photography's going to survive, that's most likely how. <br><br>August, I've long been convinced that the whole schtick about how horribly hard it is to do things yourself is purely the creation of marketing flacks. Over and over again, I've found that doing things myself is simpler, easier, more pleasant, and produces better results. <br><br>Ray, an excellent illustration. If you pay attention to your sense of smell, though, you're very quickly going to start noticing human pheromones, and then you'll be aware of how people actually feel at any given moment -- and we can't have that.

So happy to have stumbled upon this blog and am enjoying and gaining so much from this particular pixel-gazing. I have read through about 7-8 back-blog essays and somewhere you (or maybe one of the commenters) posited that hopefully, in or after the coming collapse, that technology that actually does serve a useful function-we will find a way to keep going, those that are prosthetics will fall by the wayside. I also hope this is true. I hope some form of the internet will last as I do get a lot of both enjoyment and helpful information from it that I wouldn't otherwise have access to. This blog being one of those things.<br><br>"Peak Meaninglessness" Good grief, I certainly hope we are at the peak, but I suspect societies will find just a few more outlandish ways to push that envelope further in our last ditch effort shut our eyes and stop up our ears against coming collapse. "Dancing on the edge of a volcano".<br><br>I wanted to add to the list of mediations one that I discovered and still feel is the most horrendous and insidious one for consideration: babies' and children's toys. I first thought about the detriments of mediation when my first son was a baby and I was trying (like every over-anxious helicopter first-time parent!) to find (at no expense spared!), educational and stimulating toys that would entertain and educate/expand his little sponge of a mind. The more advanced and new the toy was/is, the less the child gets to do with it. It pretty much plays with itself, no child needed. No wonder they always discarded the toy after 2 minutes and played for hours/days with the cardboard box it came in! In the end, crayons and paper, pots and pans on the kitchen floor, "helping me cook", and cardboard boxes were the best toys ever. But I do feel I was smart or just lucky in seeing this mediation in the toy market early enough in his life. It does bother me that a whole generation of kids are growing up with these toys that do it all themselves. They are horrifically stunting at a time when our next generation need to be expanding. <br><br>Now as a TA/co-teacher in the Art dept. for a primary school here in Hong Kong, I see the same thing. When we have no planning time and have to come up with a project in a pinch, we give them colored paper scissors and glue or simply paper and crayons. They make amazing things and focus for hours, but the school is crazy about inculcating them into higher level processes, and especially digital art apps. (Fun for my AV picture, not so good for the kids' creative processes. you just take a photo-push a button, then push another button on app and it does the art for you). I find this very worrisome and in this aspect can only welcome a collapse that will save my students from a sterile app-filled future. Luckily, my boss/co-teacher and I are on the same page and have minimized this digital boom in our Art Room.<br><br>And lastly: I have also stumbled upon another bunch-o-pixels/ internet site called Biotechture, which builds 'Earthships', self-sustaining sort of 'Hobbit-homes' out of recycled materials and was wondering if you, JMG, or You-all, commenters have encountered these, and what your thoughts on them were. (?)<br><br>Thanks, again. I look forward to these essays every week.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c8497493677983973830 title="comment permalink">3/7/15, 6:50 PM</a><br><br>

I trust you're getting copies for all your friends. ;-)<br><br>Strovenovus, delighted to hear it. <br><br>SacredEater, nope. If I do that, online literary theft being what it is, some bozo will download those 25 essays, package them up, and distribute them to 10,000 or so of his closest friends. Now of course some bozo will no doubt do that anyway, online literary theft being what it is, but at least this way he's going to have to take the trouble to find a copy of the book. <br><br>SLClaire, that does indeed make sense. Hmm! Definitely something more to mull over. (And may I thank every one of my readers who's contributed to the discussion for helping me take what was not much more than a half-formed thought and unfold it -- the last three weeks of comments have been remarkable even by this blog's high standard.)<br><br>Stein, I don't think he intended to be a hermit. He was conducting an experiment, not trying to fit himself to a definition. <br><br>Bob, no need -- it's been tracked down. Many thanks. <br><br>1ab, for all that that's a joke, I have no idea what people are thinking when they babble on about how wonderful it will be when all their household appliances are hooked up to the internet. It's bad enough when somebody hacks your computer -- do you really want them to start hacking your refrigerator, your teapot, your hot water tank, etc., etc.? <br><br>Lewis, fascinating. I didn't know about that. <br><br>Myriad, that makes a huge amount of sense. The version of D&amp;D I enjoyed the most was the one in the little staplebound booklets, with barely enough of a rule set to give you a framework to go by -- from there on in, it was an exercise in collective storytelling. The more ornate the rules and supplements got, the less it interested me. <br><br>As for microwaves and cookbooks -- no argument there. Anything that externalizes your own decision making process is likely to turn into a harmful prosthetic promptly.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c1044065902290045652 title="comment permalink">3/7/15, 6:55 PM</a><br><br>

Spot on.<br><br>However, your last paragraph might be overstating the case. The process of making an entertaining film or writing a good novel can be a creatively rewarding act, but usually it is hard work far more than it is entertainment for the creators. When it does verge into entertainment for the creators, audiences tend to notice, and describe the work as "self-indulgent," or in extreme cases make the comparison you did, to masturbation. Most fan fiction and some "art" or "experimental" films are examples.<br><br>But using an output product as an input isn't usually problematic. (I should have been clearer on that.) I enjoy the "waste product" of trees, bakers, performers, and filmmakers on a consistent basis. It tends to go wrong when an output is used as an input to essentially the same activity. Sequels and adaptations. "Entertainment news." Those recipes in magazine ads that use an already packaged prepared food as the main "ingredient."

In support of what you said, I offer these memories ...<br><br>My wife and I are old enough that we were already well into our elementary school years when a few private homes in our neighborhoods got the first TV sets, and we were already both spending almost all of our free time outdoors by ourselves or with our age-mates (without any close adult supervision). So neither of us ever developed much of a TV habit, even as a 'teen or in college. <br><br>We did have a TV in the house when our children were young, but we greatly limited the times that it would be turned on. Later, once our children had left home, we hardly ever turned it on ourselves. We stopped watching it altogether around 1985, out of sheer boredom. <br><br>Many years later, one of our children told us, out of the blue, that he thought one of the best things we had done for him and his brother as children was to keep them from watching much TV.<br><br>Also, our own parents had been very frugal (since they were poor, and their parents had been much, much poorer than they) as we were growing up. So we, too, have always been very frugal, and we never liked to go shopping for anything. Thus TV advertising always struck us as viscerally repellent, rather in the way that seeing a leech feeding on you after a swim in a pond is repellent. As TV advertising became more and more impossible to ignore, we turned the TV on less and less -- until finally we chucked it out altogether.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c7982999954496824717 title="comment permalink">3/7/15, 7:58 PM</a><br><br>

In fact, it's hardly a coincidence that so many people are in that state of mind; it's been a part of the thaumaturgy of the reigning paradigm for quite a while -- remember Maggie Thatcher's "TINA"? In its various forms, that message got through to all too many people: that There Is No Alternative to the dominant paradigm that doesn't leave us freezing and starving in the dark. In the meantime, the relentless drive to concentrate more and more wealth in the hands of fewer and fewer (another integral part of the paradigm) has had the natural consequence of squeezing the rest of us harder and harder. The streets of our cities are becoming littered with "human turnips" who have nothing left to be squeezed out.<br><br>John Michael, you've recommended Green Wizardry as a way out of the trap, and indeed there's good work going on in that community. It seems to me that there's another aspect of the trap that needs to be addressed at the same time, or even before ordering a green wizard's cap. I'm referring to what your colleague Carolyn Baker calls "inner transition". As I read Angelus' comments, the first step he needs to take is believing in himself, that he has the inner resources to make the transition, and that there is indeed a viable pathway to be taken, obscure as it may seem at this point (again, Angelus, apologies if I've misread you).<br><br>Angelus, one other thought: you mention having friends who are in the same trap. You might find it useful to get together occasionally with them, specifically to talk about your plight, and begin to share both frustrations and ideas for possible steps to be taken. A difficult journey can be made easier when shared with friends. (And occasionally, what's impossible for one is easy for two or three.)<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c929779643048745259 title="comment permalink">3/7/15, 8:28 PM</a><br><br>

If that goes through, you're in the endgame all right, and a lot of people are going to lose everything and then some when the final bubble goes. <br><br>Karim, a prosthetic is a very good thing when it's used the way prosthetics were meant to be used -- as a way to replace some part of human potential that's been lost. I use reading glasses these days, for heaven's sake, and am delighted with them, as middle age has its usual effect. <br><br>Deborah, I've always been saddened by the immense waste of talent and creativity that goes on in fanfic. Women have been so thoroughly trained in our society to doubt their own creative abilities that it's probably inevitable that they would turn to rehashing the characters and settings of TV shows and the like, instead of letting their own creative visions soar -- but I wonder how many great novels have never been written because their authors never found the confidence to break out of the fanfic rut and do something that was wholly their own. <br><br>Dagnarus, it's a valid point -- it's not just that costs are being pushed onto those that didn't incur them, benefits are being seized by those who didn't earn them. That may want to get a more detailed discussion as we proceed. <br><br>Jason, he's always welcome to add a few words here!<br><br>Ed-M, exactly.

Full disclosure: authors generally get a better cut from direct publisher sales than they do from ordinary bookstores, and a vastly bigger cut than they get from Amazon sales (those discounts come out of the author's royalties too).

Even Dante's imagination was not equal to the task of making heaven interesting in a literary sense. Perhaps man's psyche is only fired by process and struggle and never is satisfied by a result that would lead to stasis. After all, human struggle in one way or another is what has gotten us in the mess we are in.

When you say you filled up the Troll Bingo cards, I thought you were just being funny.<br><br>In terms of disruption, I have been but not in the way that would come as obvious. <br><br>Yes, we homeschool, and yes we have the permaculture the property and have a two forest gardens and a vegetable garden.My children can sew their own clothes, cook food, and do higher math and write essays. I have been an active community volunteer for 14 years as we live on one income and not two. <br><br>What has happened around us over the past decade in our rural area an hour drive to Philadelphia, is the cost of living has doubled (including property taxes) and people are driving further and further for better paying jobs. Few people actually live here anymore other than retirees. If they have children, the school demands more and more of their time in sports, music, and other special activities. It is not unusual for kids to to be at the school not just all day but all evening too for at least a few months out of the year.<br><br>So when people get together, even at churches, the mood is tense and it is not unusual for people to scream at each other. Yes I said scream. They will "lose it" over the smallest of details and lash out at the people around them. I have witnessed this at scout meetings with adults, meetings we had with teachers at the school (when my kids were in school), ladies at church, commissioners meetings, the post office, the voting booths, and any kind of school play or sports event (this includes homeschool events too - not just the public school stuff).<br><br>Maybe the reasons they are screaming are the not the reasons I listed above - that the good life they thought they would have as adults is barely holding itself together. Maybe most people here are just incredibly socially stupid and/or mentally unstable. I'm not sure. One this is for sure - Gone are the days "if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all." Never mind don't scream it at other people and make threats at them too.<br><br>What I have had to do for over a decade now, is disrupt these scenes. Even prevent them from happening when I am able. I've found myself woefully unprepared for the waves of negative emotion people throw out and the force they use when they do it. I've used a variety of techniques to do this and now have developed a sixth sense to see who it is who will jump off the ledge first. It is exhausting. I can't have my guard down for one second when out in groups. And knowing that some people carry guns all the time, makes me ill.<br><br>Perhaps this is what life is like on the way down? Maybe when it bottoms out here like what you have said about where you live JMG and people are used to being without, it won't be like this? <br><br>So the disruption I do isn't something I can wave around while it is happening - look I helped someone express themselves without screaming at someone else today! And we learned how to compromise and find solutions together! I certainly won't tweet about it because the one thing I want people to keep is their dignity. I don't care to get the credit for doing it either.

The role of originality in art is a vexed question. Although I agree with some of your points, I'll point out the subtitle of the book I mentioned, "Television Fandom and the Creation of Popular Myth."<br><br>Revisiting a familiar story and characters from a different point of view is a form of art whose existence depends on being derivative. When I read The Dark Knight Returns graphic novel, I was gobsmacked by the cultural and moral sophistication of Frank Miller's revisionist take on Batman. The power of the book for me was absolutely dependent on my memories of DC comics I had read as a child. I brought the graphic novel to my father and told him, "This is great." He couldn't make head or tail of it. I realized afterward that when my father was a boy, Batman comics did not yet exist. All the cultural references that The Dark Knight Returns assumes were lost on him. <br><br> The tens of thousands of Madonnas in European painting aren't judged by how original they are. Many worthwhile works of art have made use of characters and situations that originated in familiar myths, legends, and fairytales. All the Greek tragedies, Shakespeare's tragedies, Marlowe's and Goethe's Fausts are stories about characters that someone else imagined. Today's audiences didn't grow up with Bible stories or the myths of any culture. Most of their shared stock of stories is much younger.<br><br>It's exceedingly difficult to create a wholly original work of art that audiences can grasp and respond to. The emphasis on originality is one reason why a lot of art, music and architecture that critics like is unpopular. If the content is original, the form needs to be very familiar, and vice versa. Otherwise the artwork will have to wait a generation for the audience to catch up to it. A lot of the emotional resonance in art comes from the associations that the audience brings to it. <br><br>One can, of course, go too far in the other direction, creating works of art that wholly consist of references to other works of art. This kind of reworking is characteristic of declining civilizations, and we see it in a lot of movies and TV commercials today.<br><br><br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c4560944870998896453 title="comment permalink">3/8/15, 4:22 PM</a><br><br>

I would only nit-pick your use of that horrid word “consumer” as a description of what an audiance does. Do you really “consume” art, or anything else, you experience?<br>Also, I'd mention that in live performances, the audiance is a participant to some degree in the creation of the art because their feedback, even if non-verbal, can affect the on-going performance. As an occasional stage performer in my youth, I was always more or less aware of the audiance whose response would influence more or less my acting.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c5868575216497472806 title="comment permalink">3/8/15, 4:56 PM</a><br><br>

At least that's my experience among the well to do white greenies I interact with. A good antidote to that is to learn Spanish and make your acquaintance with local immigrants.

Our basic human drive to create things and to shape our society as both artisans and citizens, has been amputated, and we are left with the role of consumer. As consumers we have NO power. All we get to do is choose between a limited number of options at the big box store that have been selected for us by those who wish to make money from us.<br><br>When we create our own needs and wants, whether that be a house or a pair of socks or a loaf of bread, we get to shape our own surroundings, bend materials to our own preference, create something that shouts, 'This is Me!!' Now that is power and self-expression indeed.<br><br>This may be a ridiculously obvious point to you, who has pursued this lifestyle for so many years, but it feels like an outrageously radical idea to me right now - I knew I was being sold a bill of goods by society, but with the help of your essays I am only now just starting to add two and two together. Society is conspiring to make my life powerless and meaningless by taking away my will to shape my own environment. I am so appalled that I let myself be taken in by this, and I am not surprised that the whole population is depressed and irritable. Of course we are. We evolved over millions of years to adapt our environment with tools, and to create complex societies with speech. And now we have created machines which mean we don't have to use our exquisitely developed bodies anymore, and we sit alone in our houses watching screens instead of interacting with our fellow humans.<br><br>I am just speechless with indignation about this. I am going to have to go and dig in the garden until I calm down.

I was once contacted by a grad student in sociology, who claimed that the first use of the phrase "fluffy bunny paganism" he could find on the internet was in a post I made in the early 1990s to alt.magick on Usenet, so -- if he's right -- it's just possible that I'm the original Grand Master of the Fluffy Bunny Path! <br><br>That said, I certainly appreciate Thor and his kindred hammer-wielding Indo-European deities, and have poured the occasional libation to them, but my approach to trolls is somewhat different; I find them entertaining, and sometimes educational -- I think I've mentioned here before that my trolls are a very sensitive indicator of the latest trends in cornucopian and apocalyptic nonsense -- so I read those that interest me, chuckle, and then delete the lot. <br><br>Gloucon, heck of a good question -- that was, ahem, a few years ago, and at that age I was mostly reading illustrated kiddie SF published by Scholastic Book Service. (Some of which was by major SF writers; in a junk shop a little while back, I found a book from SBS, <i>Lost Race of Mars</i>, written by Robert Silverberg, which I'd read back in the day.) All I recall from the original seasons is that it seemed pretty hokey; my memories of the show at this point focus on the endless reruns on early Seventies afternoon TV, which my friends liked, and I found educational in an inverse sort of way -- by then I was reading pretty much every word Andre Norton ever wrote, to mention only one fave, and I found the TV show embarrassingly bland and two-dimensional. <br><br>Sgage, and then National Geographic comes back with its current issue, insisting that anybody who criticizes GMOs is right up there with believers in the flat earth. Sigh...<br><br>Unknown Deborah, there's a vast space between so original that nobody can relate to it, and so derivative that it doesn't mean a thing if you didn't watch the original TV series, and it's in that space that most art actually takes place. I agree that works of art that are entirely based on other works of art are a sign of decline, and I'd class fanfic in that category -- but I also note, as I commented earlier, that fanfic is mostly a women's genre, and the self-relegation by women of their own creativity to fringe activities of that kind is a very common way that women cooperate in their own oppression. <br><br>Shane, yes, I'm aware of that -- and it's not just wage slavery that I'm thinking of. The entire attitude toward machines in industrial age America copies the rhetoric of slavery, with the machines filling the role of the slaves; think of the endless chatter about robots who will do your housework for you sometime very soon, and it's hard not to see them as "house machines," contrasted with the "field machines" out there laboring away in the factories. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Mojoglo, thanks for this!<br><br>Jo, excellent! Yes, that also follows; the bargain that industrial society offers its inmates requires them to hand over their own power, so that they can get a machine to exercise that power -- or a simulacrum thereof -- for them. So you get fantasies of omnipotence paired with a complete loss of actual power over your life and circumstances. Yes, it's appalling; the good thing is that now that you've woken up to it, you can do something else with your life. <br><br>KL Cooke, that's astonishing. When bread machines start ordering their own spare parts and putting the price on your credit card, you'll know that doom is near at hand!<br><br>Jeffrey, oh, I don't know. Some of the ones who email me from time to time already seem to emit a pale greenish aura. <br><br>Cherokee, I hope the poor nematodes don't suffer digestive upsets from the bread! Do you think you might sprinkle some herbs good for digestion on top of the pile, so they can feel better? ;-)<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c7802379106434024765 title="comment permalink">3/8/15, 10:53 PM</a><br><br>

(I don't know how!) I agree completely with what you said about industrialization and the end of slavery, but let me offer a bit of geographical and familial history that informs my attitudes to this day.<br>I live in a multi-county area of southern Alabama that was settled in the last decade of the eighteenth century and the first decades of the nineteenth century by English and Scots-Irish immigrants from North and South Carolina and Georgia who crossed the Chattahoochee River to essentially "squat" on Indian land before Alabama was even a territory. These settlers were largely poor, and of course, white and only a few of them ever participated in the slave economy. Add to that the fact that Andrew Jackson very soon came in and removed the Indians to what became Oklahoma and you had a virtual paradise for a "yeoman" farmer who was willing to work. By the time of the war there were lots of small to medium sized farms here but still no significant manufacturing or railroad presence. As a result the area was largely ignored by the Union Army in any strategic sense and was left alone. The pain for the region existed in the bodies of its sons that were sacrificed to the cause! (My great grandfather was born in 1862 and was given the name "Sterling Price" in honor of the Confederate General.) <br>Fast forward to my childhood: I was born in a hospital in 1952 but the first house I lived in was a log house that was probably close to a hundred years old at the time. My dad installed the first glass windows and wired it for lights and a small refrigerator. (And no there are no pictures that confirm this, but I'm not running for President anyway! HA!) <br>The house was surrounded by cotton fields all of which had to be picked by hand. The "hands" that picked the cotton were any people of any color who were willing to pick cotton and be paid by the pound. The children of the farmer--me and my siblings--were expected to pick too, but what we would have earned went to buy school clothes, shoes and textbooks. The point of all this is to say that I see the attitudes of the South to this day as largely urban vs rural. Two counties to my west is the home of Harper Lee, author of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. I have always contended that had she been raised in North Alabama she could not have written that novel. And I do fervently hope that in the collapse that comes there are still mechanical cotton pickers and fuel allocated to operate them because if I were to have to return to picking cotton by hand to feed myself I would be one hungry old man!<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c6660960466195369016 title="comment permalink">3/9/15, 3:01 AM</a><br><br>

Vastly inferior to written SF, shallow, unoriginal, and lacking in ideas. I was also irritated that the women on the show had nothing interesting to do; it was no worse in that respect than most TV of the era, but I expected better from a show that was supposed to be set in the future and got props for enlightenment. <br><br>When I was in elementary school, my father brought home hardcover science fiction from the library and a few paperbacks. I was a bookworm and tackled all the print that came into the house. By the time Star Trek aired, I had been reading novels and short fiction by Asimov, Heinlein, Simak, Van Vogt, Bradbury and others for years, and found it considerably more challenging intellectually and emotionally.<br><br>I do remember a Star Trek episode that came up to my standards, and it's one of the fan favorites, The Trouble with Tribbles. That had an actual scientific idea in it, and they worked out the consequences, which is one measure for distinguishing real SF from space opera.<br><br>I dimly remember earlier in my young life a show called Science Fiction Theater, which was not a series but an original play every week. I was pretty small and it was mostly over my head. I also remember a TV play called Murder and the Android which was a serious piece of work; I would like to watch it again.<br><br>Most so-called science fiction on both the small and big screens is either monster/horror/fantasy, an action movie or a Western in an exotic setting, or uses sci-fi tropes for color without any effort to make the scientific underpinning consistent and accurate. The big blue aliens in Avatar (which was a more decent movie than most) had big blue human feet, down to the number and shape of their toes./rant<br><br><br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c6740407849753784985 title="comment permalink">3/9/15, 4:23 AM</a><br><br>

My kids are very creative. They got some paper and made a monopoly board with countries of the world, called it monopoly worl war. One kid sketches all the time or builds. Playmobile castles combined into one big castle with soldiers, rocks, go game beads. Always doing war games on paper and with knights, soldiers, etc. The older one has read 20-30 stephen king, similar asimov, harry potter , fairy tales, etc. and started writing own book and writtten lots of inventions.<br><br>On batman. I read lots of comic books up till 11 years. Amazed that most US films now are superhero or similar. All directors from our generation. According to spengler madonna, mary cult occurred parallel to satancult. People feared evil in self, goblins, witches and clung to holy saints as salvation. Ritual sacrament development got them away from that. Protestan treformation brought back this helplessness, created, as we see in 19thcentury england,in US bible belt, bible fetish. Since church authority, sacraments gone only bible is holy. Also this brought heroism, self righteousness of US anglosaxon culture to justify self against one's sins.<br><br>So from madonna worship of middle ages to usa film culture and simplistic global heroism mind set militarily is a direct line. <br><br>I was explaining history via spengler to my son the other day, telling himabout harry potter,early christian magical culture apocalyptic cave feeling vs. Roman body centered polis ahistorical and modern <br>technical faustian limitless free will concept. It is too much to absorb. Point being that history is our invention, reality perception is different over time and with each culture. Religions were very much secret ritual, oraltradition, as in harry potter, passed down, all disappeared from jesus time. Islam, early christian, astrology, sufism, all similar mind set, franken-germanic chrisitanity just using christian forms, but really adifferent thing altogether. Free will vs. submission. So everything is how you think, not what. Doctrine was basis of magical religion, borderless brotherhood like jewish, catholic. Romans had local god,polis as identity. We formed nations with national church then reformation freed us to become purely rational like buddha, confucius, atheists all.

And bears are disruptive as hell, just sporadic - like typhoons. If I am running a honey operation for other than personal consumption, then there are things like Top Bar Hives that simply do not work on a larger scale. <br><br>A LOT of beekeeping is checking the hive, particularly in summer when they tend to swarm. Top bar hives allow this, but they do not fit in a commercial centrifuge - makes harvesting a royal pain. I, like my grandfather before me, prefer getting into the bees so that you can see how they are doing. In this age of CCD, this is imperative.<br><br>My way may not be what everyone agrees with, but Langstroths work if you don't allow overcrowding. The only way to do that is to open the box.

This is not the case in many commercial ops - particularly those used strictly for pollinators. It is a wonder the bees survive the trucking alone when used as pollinators.<br><br>I am open to other ideas, but as we are going for more than personal consumption, certain compromises with the reality on the ground are required.

We get so darned good at making things "rational" (calculable) that we forget what it means. Just as your cybernetic genitals would allow, uh, greater precision, so too does the bread machine completely take everything that matters out of the bread making. We pay for the privilege of alienating ourselves from creative work. (I know you're not a big Marx fan but I suspect you find his writings on alienation insightful and a far cry from the authoritarian he would become.)<br><br>I'd like to propose a related idea to peak meaninglessness and the irrationality of rationality. Here are my "data points:"<br><br>- An advertisement for a tankless water heater in the mail. The advertisement promises that heating your water will be "40% more efficient." A bullet point below this says, "ENDLESS HOT WATER so you never have to take another cold shower." Putting aside that there's no such thing as endless hot water, it's ridiculously easy to see the contradiction. It's not just a rebound effect either: it's essentially saying, be more efficient to waste more.<br><br>- A recent documentary that I watched called "Just Eat it." If you're in Canada you may be able to watch it for free here: https://www.knowledge.ca/program/just-eat-it. I showed it to my students in my sustainability course and like me were aghast at the following statistic: about 40% of all the food we grow in North America is wasted. We've become "efficient" at growing with pesticides, artificial fertilizers, monocultures, feeding grain to animals, and the like that we have never had more food per volume at any point in history. We also have more ways, old and new, to prevent our food from going bad. And yet here we are throwing nearly half of perfectly good food out, wasting along with it all the packaging, farm inputs, transportation miles, and the like. <br><br>I think we can call this "Efficiency for what?" or (even better since it echoes Weber better) "The inefficiency of efficiency." <br><br>Oh, a few more asides:<br><br>If you want an easy way to make bread but are lazy as I sometimes am, try looking up "No knead bread." It takes almost a day to make, but requires very little work. I calculated I could make one delicious, 25% whole wheat loaf for about 30 cents (organic flour, water, salt, yeast, and the energy of the oven). I'm not sure if could be adopted to a solar oven but it might be worth a shot!<br><br>Mr Greer has often said that young people are more aware of the problems he discusses than older generations. My sustainability course has shown that to be the case. I have students extolling used clothing, turning doors into tables, and gardening, and actually doing these things with good results.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c1957278843384859266 title="comment permalink">3/9/15, 12:43 PM</a><br><br>

That was long before cotton had supplanted tobacco in the southern agrarian economy. In 1838 a transplanted New Englander, Daniel Pratt, built a factory for the production of cotton gins on a creek in Autauga County just north of Montgomery, Alabama. By 1860 his plant was manufacturing 1500 cotton gins per year and shipping them all over the world, even as far as Russia. At first he had to depend on Sheffield steel from England, but later on he provided the capital to establish the enormous steel production capacity that led to the growth of Birmingham, Alabama. Whereas there is no denying that the North had far more of almost everything than the South, except, as Rhett Butler said in GONE WITH THE WIND, "arrogance and cotton", it is an incomplete telling of history to talk of Eli Whitney without balancing things with the story of Daniel Pratt. Of course, Pratt may be the preeminent industrialist of the antebellum South.<br>What matters to me, though, in considering the Civil War is whether, had I been alive at the time, would I have been willing to lay down my life for the Southern Cause. It has always been, at least to this point, an exercise of "if" history with no real meaning. But in light of this blog, I may have the choice to make, as unthinkable as that is. When the collapse comes it surely will not be symmetrical and states left on their own, like Alabama, that now receive much more back in dollars from Washington than they send, will fall on some pretty hard times, at least in the short run. This matters to me because I have paid into Social Security for over forty years and I need that money as do 95% of those who draw a check.<br>The Supreme Court of Alabama is presently involved in a "nullification" battle with the national government over the legality of same sex marriage. It is inconceivable that the Supreme Court of the United States will allow the State of Alabama any wiggle room at all on this, but we live in interesting times. I will only predict that a less than emphatic ruling by SCOTUS on this issue will be the "legalistic" beginning of the collapse.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c3350769009561664291 title="comment permalink">3/9/15, 4:35 PM</a><br><br>

One thing I noticed early on is that everything in <i>Star Trek</i> had already been done in print back in the days of the pulps -- the only thing differentiating the TV show from a Hugo Gernsback-edited pulp story was the shape of the starship (for some reason most of the spacecraft on Gernsback's covers looked like Art Deco locomotives). <br><br>Ed, good. I had a similar reaction to reading Spengler: other modes of history talk about what, Spengler explains why. <br><br>Shane, I went back to college to finish my BA in 1991. At that time every student got a free internet account for email and Usenet access, and I decided to check it out; you can still find a few things of mine online under my email handle of the time, grimoire@u.washington.edu . When I graduated, the account went away, and I didn't bother to get back online for most of a decade, at which point it was starting to become necessary to have email access to keep my writing career on track. I still find the internet rather dull, and have to discipline myself to keep up with email and the like. <br><br>Shane, the people who settled the Northeast shared close cultural and religious ties to the people central to England's industrial revolution, so it's no wonder that industrialization in the Northeast happened so readily. Of course there was another factor: with the opening of the Midwest, everyone who didn't like the industrial process had an easy out, and headed west to homestead. So it was a much easier proposition. <br><br>Rita, I wish I could say I was surprised. Thanks for the story; I hope that kid, seeing the zero score, muttered an expletive under his breath and became even more convinced to live his own life. <br><br>Curtis, I've been told that there's a saying current in Russia these days: "Everything Marx said about socialism is false, but everything he said about capitalism is true." That more or less sums up my take on his work; he combined a cogent though flawed critique of capitalist political economy with a hopelessly naive fantasy of what would replace it. As for the irrationality of rationality, that's good -- I suspect that underlies C. Wright Mills' useful phrase "crackpot rationality," which he used for the pursuit of irrational goals by utterly rational means. <br><br>Michael, exactly -- none of us can have clean hands. That's simply part of the predicament we're in.<br><br>Kaitain, thank you. I prefer to use locally owned full service bookstores myself, but not everyone is fortunate enough to live within range of one.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c1190927445667884896 title="comment permalink">3/9/15, 6:58 PM</a><br><br>

That work was a revelation. First they take your tools; then they privately own the tools to exploit you; then they make the tools to make prostheses.<br><br>I've also read some of his current intellectual interpreters regarding his ecological thought. They (and Marx) had some surprisingly cogent and useful things to say, particularly about "metabolic rift" - the idea that ecosystems in one place are depleted to enrich another (temporarily), or the failure to capture wastes and to allow it to pollute instead. (Marx, apparently, was as aghast at our use of clean water to flush wastes, as you were in Green Wizards!)<br><br>John Bellamy Foster, one of his interpreters, wrote a fascinating essay on this in "The Ecological Rift" called " Imperialism and Ecological Metabolism," discussing the wars and imperialism lead over bat guano.

In fairness, it had not yet "come out" that "Civil Disobedience" had influenced Tolstoy, Gandhi, and ML King Jr. Yet someday, we may find a more useful set of truths there, in CD, than in Walden.<br><br>But I would humbly point out another book to precede Civil Disobedience; a book I saw reviewed in WoodenBoat magazine: "Shantyboat, A River Way of Life" by Harlen Hubbard. From Wendell Berry's introduction:<br><br> And if the Hubbard's went, like Thoreau, to the wilderness, their life there has been no simple moral experiment. They are, after all, a married couple, who have become permanent settlers in their woods. For those reasons, their life has raised and resolved issues at once more practical and more complex than Thoreau's life at Walden Pond. They have made a more demanding journey, and got farther from Concord, than Thoreau ever did. The Mississippi River in winter flood is a more difficult wilderness than Thoreau encountered at Walden Pond or on his summer canoe trips in the Maine woods. The difference is that Thoreau's stay at Walden resulted in a change of moral viewpoint, a new sense of "economy", the Hubbard's long river journey downriver and their much longer stay at Payne Hollow have resulted in a liveable life.<br> Because it was so long and difficult, requiring them to be so thoroughly practical, the Hubbard's river voyage was not just an encounter with a formidable kind of wilderness; it was, paradoxically, an encounter with domesticity. Shantyboat is an account of life amid the elements: the backlands and backwaters, weathers and currents that require human skill to be great because human control is so small. But it is, by the same token, and even more, an account of domestic life. There is no way to distinguish this book's concern with the great, intricate, mysterious life of the rivers from its concern with the human household of the shantyboat. The boat conveys its household into the wilderness. From its windows carried down the wild currents "by the inexorable law that governs drifters", the world is newly seen and understood. But also newly understood are the meanings of being married, of having neighbours, of the skills and arts by which people house, feed, and please themselves, and care for one another. <br><br>***<br><br>I don't propose we all do just what they did, but why could we not, with carefully limited scope, bring a little sense of art (if not always Beauty) to our reconciling with Earth? To me, this is what is on the other side of the Peak Meaninglessness Curve. (Well, one of the things.)<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c2530024652436124056 title="comment permalink">3/9/15, 9:01 PM</a><br><br>

More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Curtis, most interesting. I haven't read much from the modern interpreters of Marx, mostly because there are only so many hours in a day and I have no shortage of things I want to study; still, it might be time to revisit that down the road a bit. <br><br>Shane, the faster industrialism happens, the more violence is involved. That much seems clear enough. <br><br>Gloucon, like most pop culture phenomena in modern times, <i>Star Trek</i> attracted its audience by rehashing a set of timeworn conventional notions behind a spraypaint-thin facade of avant-garde originality. That's been the ticket to success on the grand scale for a good many decades now. Roddenberry sold the show to the network as "Wagon Train to the Stars," and of course that's exactly what it was -- well, that, combined with a Cold War morality play with the Federation as the United States (it was, after all, the USS Enterprise, not the Federation Star Ship or what have you), the Klingons as the Russians, the Vulcans as the Japanese, the Romulans as the Chinese, and Kirk as a wish-fulfillment fantasy General Westmoreland who always succeeded in pacifying his extraterrestrial Vietnams. Tell people they can be original and avant-garde by believing everything they want to believe anyway, and you can generally count on a thumping pop-culture success and an enduring fan base; do anything else, and you're facing a long uphill trudge. <br><br>Mark, thanks for the reference!

It tends to reinforce an us/them tribalism, which can boost morale but doesn't help encourage the mindset that will let us connect with our neighbors -- which, in turn, puts us in a position to start talking about <i>why</i> we do all the strange non-consumer things we do, and maybe get someone else taking steps in the LESS direction.<br><br>I think what I mean is, even when shaking one's head at somebody's flashy new purchase, it's important to remember that under all the plastic and indoctrination is a person, who wants to be satisfied (just like we all do!) and is doing what they have been told will help.

As is often the case with British TV, the emphasis was on good writing and good acting, rather than glamour, special effects and violence. The science and tech were up to date and integral to the plots. The story lines featured corporate intrigue and politics; characters had some depth; the viewpoint was fairly egalitarian with regard to class and gender.

One quick anecdote: I have over the past 20 years worked where I had intensive contact with the public. The two things I like doing best are reading and talking. As the larger numbers of "snowbirds" have descended on the area I have enjoyed getting acquainted and asking them what they think of their decision to retire in the sun. I don't think I can remember a single one who regretted their decision. However, I have known some who had to go back North so that their children could look after them. They were all sad to go. One of the things that they all mentioned was how much better the roads are down here--not many potholes or cracked pavement. Formerly, I had worked as the office manager of a bridge construction firm and the owner, a civil engineer, had explained to me that the reason is that when the Federal Highway Administration settled on a standard for asphalt they picked a middle range in quality and price which was a boon to the sunbelt and not so good for the people in the snow who contributed most of the taxes. The Southern Senators would never have stood for treating the South differently and all these years later rationality has not been added back to that decision. Most Southerners are unaware of the crumbling infrastructure of the North, but it is now beginning to settle in here as well.

I work with teachers and greatly empathize with the pressures they experience from their administrators, who of course are pressured by school boards, who are pressured by the rest of us, to turn out students who can "perform" on standardized (now computerized) tests. Districts spend vast sums on sets of laptop computers so students can take these tests simultaneously, and administrators then demand that teachers use them in instruction both to get students used to the testing medium and to make the investment seem less frivolous. While computer technology can be a useful learning tool, teachers are NOT being trained on how to use it in a professional manner to achieve real, worthwhile learning goals, but instead are being expected to use the educational equivalent of microwave meals- scripted, pre-digested "curriculum products"- with predictable results. Public education in general is just another heavily intermediated industry, not because most teachers wish it to be the case, but because they are also trapped in this juggernaut.<br><br> I work on a subversive little project for elementary school mathematics teachers that tries to encourage teachers to first understand that both they and their students are capable of independent thought and reasoning, next that they as teachers can and should encourage this, and finally that there is joy for everyone in doing so. And we train teachers to cite chapter and verse of the infamous Common Core Standards to justify to administrators, parents, and the public these heretic practices. :) It's my tiny contribution of sand to the educational industrial machine's gears. <br><br>--Heather in CA<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c2258913776689446723 title="comment permalink">3/10/15, 9:35 PM</a><br><br>

Media technology is perhaps the most dangerous prosthesis, as you hint at -- neuroscience has shown that, amongst regular TV watchers, seeing the characters of your favourite show come on-screen lights up your brain as though you’d just met with a real, human friend. Watch “Friends” instead of having friends; short-term, they cure loneliness equally well. Fiction as prosthesis for human contact!<br><br>I’m guilty of that one, I suspect. It’s with written fiction, rather than television, but I suspect the principle applies to some degree. That or I am simply a voracious reader and massively introverted. I may have to go on another media fast, soon. Hmm.<br><br>At least I do not play video games. It seems for some people, they are a prosthesis for life itself. Ran Prieur, who was a thinker I once respected, seems to have given up playing Thoreau and just smokes pot and plays video games all day -- and claims this is a good thing. Games, you see, provide a cleaner and clearer sense of accomplishment than anything one could do in everyday life.<br><br>Of course, one could say that vicariously sharing in the adventures between the covers of sci-fi and fantasy pulps can do the same. I really need that media fast, don’t I? Last time I only went offline, and my life did not change. It occurs to me now I need to be much more aggressive about this.

My dear mother bought the TV on a shopping trip that she made alone, and as a surprise to us. The set was a table model and had a completely black glass in front of the picture tube and looking back it had the look of a flat screen TV that didn't appear for decades. Being the late sixties version of a geeky adolescent I remember being quite impressed with my mother's shopping acumen. (Truth was the merchant had had the model on the floor in the small town ten miles from our town and people thought it too odd to accept. He gave mother a good deal which turned out to be fortuitous for us.)<br>Anyway, the entry of the Jet Set TV into our house came just before the premiere of Star Trek that fall. It was all Fantastic! All my classmates watched and we had noisy discussions about each episode the next day at school. (Oh, by the way, the set that we had was black and white.)<br>Not many weeks into the season there was a tree limb that fell onto a transformer quite near our house and the TV was on at the time and it got fried in the power surge. My older brother had become acquainted with a new resident of our town, a technician at the local PBS TV station who also ran his own radio and TV repair shop. He took the TV in and after looking it over, the technician gave up on fixing it. Turns out it was a hybrid of vacuum tubes and transistors and replacing those few circuit boards at that time was going to cost more than mother had paid for the set. He let my brother have another table model for a very good price so we were able to remain in the TV business so to speak.<br>The TV repairman told us that the sensitivity of those circuit boards was probably the reason the set had failed. He thought that an old vacuum tube set in the same circumstance would have weathered the power surge. <br>In my mind, the fragility of the supposed new technology represented by the Jet Set, along with the Utopian vision of the not so distant future espoused by Star Trek, created a goodly amount of cognitive dissonance for me. I watched the original series Star Trek later in reruns and in color, but I watched as a skeptic. I thought most of the characters were well-written and having all the virtues and vices of present day humans. What we were supposed to believe was that against the backdrop of an all-powerful and benevolent technology that human beings would somehow evolve into something better than they are at present--the definition of Utopia! Later I was a fan of TNG, but the assessment still applies. As entertainment, though, the Star Trek franchise is more palatable to me than all the dystopian visions out of Hollywood in the last few decades. Ironic, isn't it that the true believers of that fantasy future represented by Star Trek would call this blog "dystopian?" What I would tell them is that if we do not learn to live sensibly and peacefully on this earth as we find it and ourselves TODAY there is going to be no trip to the stars for mankind.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c6829052434252275531 title="comment permalink">3/11/15, 3:08 PM</a><br><br>

I also happen to be the lead author on the study commissioned by the state of North Dakota in setting their new TENORM disposal rules. <br><br>http://www.ndhealth.gov/EHS/TENORM/ArgonneStudy/ANL-NDDH%20TENORM%20Landfill%20Study%20%28ANL%20EVS-14_13%29%20Final%20Report.pdf<br><br>Hopefully the link works but if not you should be able to quickly find it by googling the exceptionally long and dull title: Radiological Dose and Risk Assessment of Landfill Disposal of Technologically Enhanced Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (TENORM) in North Dakota<br><br>I can assure you that the 140 page report is about as thrilling to read as its title foreshadows. That said, the cliff notes version is that we used very conservative assumptions and validated risk assessment methodologies to identify the best way to handle and dispose of this waste while protecting human health. I can assure you that we were not paid by industry or lead by the state to come up with a specific answer and we allowed nothing but the science to determine the answer. <br><br>All that said, I have enjoyed your latest series of posts and generally agree with the general ideas presented. I'm not sure I completely buy the supposition that all technological improvement leads to increased externalities or that accounting for the cost of externalities of all technologies would make them unprofitable though. I think if we are able to improve our ability to account for externalities we would find that certain suites of technologies would show positive returns and others negative. Unfortunately the lack of proper accounting leads to suboptimal choices which does lead to many of the problems you have suggested. <br><br>Keep up the good work and I look forward to your future posts.<br><br><a href=peak-meaninglessness.html#c8398806136319968809 title="comment permalink">3/11/15, 3:48 PM</a><br><br>

Castles and moats and loyal subjects. I think this explains the enforcement of false happiness and pleasantness we are all supposed to be putting on at our workplaces and in any media discussions--nothing is wrong, nothing to see here, move along--until they have fortified with clean renewable energy, bio-intensive organic farming, clean water supplies, and security systems to keep everyone else out.<br><br>Sad to say but our govt allows farmland in protected farmland areas to be sold as estates for giant homes and lawns if the owners merely bail some hay or keep a few chickens to sell eggs at the farmgate. This is the worst case scenario of tax evasion and farmland destruction, and it prevents those of us who have farming and green wizardry skills from access to the good land in the Agricultural Land Reserve. Estates and wineries are often combined, with massive inputs of dirty technology to setup their renewable systems, and of course drawing huge amounts of water from the public rivers for irrigation systems, which basically killed most fish in those areas this summer. This is from what is called a 'Liberal provincial government' in Canada, but which is actually a government devoted to the accumulation of dollars from razing the forests and selling off crown land in order to 'balance the budget' while waiting for fracking projects to make millions. Even trying to buy land out in the hinterlands is difficult in terms of not being able to obtain any guarantees that forest above the habitable land won't be totally clearcut, increasing the risk of flashfloods and landslides (which have already happened here in the last 15 years and have wiped out entire communities). So yeah, trying to figure out how to get on the land again to begin again, but that denial thing doesn't help. Most folks still want the luxury lifestyle but want to put the infrastructure in their own house (massive solar set ups, electricity to power water pumps and other devices) and they do not want to think about a low impact lifestyle. I might be a step ahead in that I grew up in a low impact lifestyle -- cabin in the north with nothing more than a wood stove and a latrine--and I loved it. Most other folks just don't know how to do it. <br><br>Anyway, I can see lots of castles popping up around the desirable locations. All I want to do is take a course from Rob Roy and get out there and build my own earth house (too many forest fires now around here for a wood house).
