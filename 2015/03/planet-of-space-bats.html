As my regular readers know, I’ve been talking for quite a while now here about the speculative bubble that’s built up around the fracking phenomenon, and the catastrophic bust that’s guaranteed to follow so vast and delusional a boom. Over the six months or so, I’ve noted the arrival of one warning sign after another of the impending crash. As the saying has it, though, it’s not over ‘til the fat lady sings, so I’ve been listening for the first notes of the metaphorical aria that, in the best Wagnerian style, will rise above the orchestral score as the fracking industry’s surrogate Valhalla finally bursts into flames and goes crashing down into the Rhine.<br>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I think I just heard those first high notes, though, in an improbable place: the email inbox of the Ancient Order of Druids in America (AODA), the Druid order I head. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I have no idea how many of my readers know the first thing about my unpaid day job as chief executive—the official title is Grand Archdruid—of one of the two dozen or so Druid orders in the western world. Most of what goes into that job, and the admittedly eccentric minority religious tradition behind it, has no relevance to the present subject. Still, I think most people know that Druids revere the natural world, and take ecology seriously even when that requires scrapping some of the absurd extravagances that pass for a normal lifestyle these days. Thus a Druid order is arguably the last place that would come to mind if you wanted to sell stock in a fracking company.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nonetheless, that’s what happened. The bemused AODA office staff the other day fielded a solicitation from a stock firm trying to get Druids to invest their assets in the fracking industry. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Does that sound like a desperation move to you, dear reader? It certainly does to me—and there’s good reason to think that it probably sounds that way to the people who are trying to sell shares in fracking firms to one final round of clueless chumps, too. A recent piece in the Wall Street Journal (available outside the paywall <a href=http://davidstockmanscontracorner.com/after-31-billion-fee-bonanza-wall-street-gets-indigestion-on-busted-energy-loans/ >here</a>) noted that American banks have suddenly found themselves stuck with tens of millions of dollars’ worth of loans to fracking firms which they hoped to package up and sell to investors—but suddenly nobody’s buying. <a href=http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/100000-Layoffs-and-Counting-Is-this-the-New-Normal.html>Bankruptcies and mass layoffs are becoming an everyday occurrence</a> in the fracking industry, and the price of oil continues to lurch down as producers maximize production for the sake of immediate cash flow. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Why, though, isn’t the drop in the price of oil being met by an upsurge in consumption that drives the price back up, as the accepted rules of economics would predict? That’s the cream of the jest. Here in America, and to a lesser extent elsewhere in the industrial world, four decades of enthusiastically bipartisan policies that benefited the rich at everyone else’s expense managed to prove Henry Ford’s famous argument: if you don’t pay your own employees enough that they can afford to buy your products, sooner or later, you’re going to go broke. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By driving down wages and forcing an ever larger fraction of the US population into permanent unemployment and poverty, the movers and shakers of America’s political class have managed to trigger <a href=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2015/03/shale-gas-orgy-production.html>a classic crisis of overproduction</a>, in which goods go begging for buyers because too few people can afford to buy them at any price that will pay for their production. It’s not just oil that’s affected, either: scores of other commodities are plunging in price as the global economy tips over into depression. There’s a specter haunting the industrial world; it’s the ghost of Karl Marx, laughing with mordant glee as the soi-disant masters of the universe, having crushed his misbegotten Soviet stepchildren, go all out to make his prophecy of capitalism’s self-immolation look remarkably prescient. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The soaring price of crude oil in the wake of the 2005 global peak of conventional oil production should have served notice to the industrial world that, to adapt the title of Richard Heinberg’s excellent 2003 summary of the situation, the party was over:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>the long era in which energy supplies had increased year over year was giving way to an unwelcome new reality in which decreasing energy supplies and increasing environmental blowback were the defining themes. As my readers doubtless noticed, though, the only people who willing to grasp that were out here on the fringes where archdruids lurk. Closer to the mainstream of our collective thinking, most people scrunched shut their eyes, plugged their ears with their fingers, and shouted “La, la, la, I can’t hear you” at the top of their lungs, in a desperate attempt to keep reality from getting a word in edgewise. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For the last five years or so, any attempt to talk about the impending twilight of the age of oil thus ran headfirst into a flurry of pro-fracking propaganda. Fatuous twaddle about America’s inevitable future as the world’s new energy superpower took the place of serious discussions of the predicament into which we’ve backed ourselves—and not for the first time, either. That’s what makes the attempt to get Druids to invest their life savings in fracking so funny, in a bleak sort of way: it’s an attempt to do for the fracking boom what the fracking boom attempted to do for industrial civilization as a whole—to pretend, in the teeth of the facts, that the unsustainable can be sustained for just a little while longer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A few months back, I decided to celebrate this sort of thinking by way of the grand old Druid custom of satire. <a href=../../2015/01/march-of-squirrels.html>The Great Squirrel Case Challenge of 2015</a> solicited mock proposals for solving the world’s energy problems that were even nuttier than the ones in the mainstream media. That was no small challenge—a detail some of my readers pointed up by forwarding any number of clueless stories from the mainstream media loudly praising energy boondoggles of one kind or another. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m delighted to say, though, that the response was even better than I’d hoped for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The contest fielded more than thirty entries, ranging from the merely very good to the sidesplittingly funny. There were two winners, one chosen by the members of the
<a href=http://www.greenwizards.org/ >Green Wizards</a>
forum, one chosen by me; in both cases, it was no easy choice, and if I had enough author’s copies of my new book <i>After Progress</i>, I’d probably just up and given prizes to all the entries, they were that good. Still, it’s my honor to announce the winners: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
My choice for best squirrel case—drumroll, please—goes to Steve Morgan, for his fine gosh-wow sales prospectus for, ahem, <a href=http://spaceoilenergy.blogspot.com/2015/01/new-energy-venture-to-mine-oil-in-space.html>Shares of Hydrocarbons Imported from Titan</a>. The Green Wizards forum choice—drumroll again—goes to Jason Heppenstall for his hilarious parody of a sycophantic media story, <a href=http://barbarianmindzone.blogspot.co.uk/ >King Solomon’s Miners</a>. Please join me in congratulating them. (Steve and Jason, drop me a comment with your mailing addresses, marked not for posting, and I’ll get your prizes on the way.)

<div class=MsoNormal>
Their hard-won triumph probably won’t last long. In the months and years ahead, I expect to see claims even more ludicrous being taken oh-so-seriously by the mainstream media, because the alternative is to face up to just how badly we’ve bungled the opportunities of the last four decades or so and just how rough a road we have ahead of us as a result. What gave the fracking bubble whatever plausibility it ever had, after all, was the way it fed on one of the faith-based credos at the heart of contemporary popular culture: the insistence, as pervasive as it is irrational, that the universe is somehow obligated to hand us abundant new energy sources to replace the ones we’ve already used so profligately. Lacking that blind faith, it would have been obvious to everyone—as it was to those of us in the peak oil community—that the fracking industry was scraping the bottom of the barrel and pretending that this proved the barrel was full. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Read the morning news with eyes freed from the deathgrip of the conventional wisdom and it’s brutally obvious that that’s what happened, and that the decline and fall of our civilization is well under way. Here in the US, a quarter of the country is in the fourth year of record drought, with snowpack on California’s Sierra Nevada mountains <a href=http://www.wunderground.com/news/california-snowpack-below-record-low-benchmark>about 9% of normal</a>; the Gulf Stream <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/03/23/global-warming-is-now-slowing-down-the-circulation-of-the-oceans-with-potentially-dire-consequences/?tid=rssfeed">is slowing to a crawl</a> due to the rapid melting of the Greenland ice sheets; permanent joblessness and grinding poverty <a href=http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/for-most-families--wealth-has-vanished-172130204.html>have become pervasive in this country</a>; the national infrastructure <a href=http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-us-economy-is-under-threat-because-of-its-neglected-infrastructure-10125082.html>is coming apart after decades of malign neglect</a>—well, I could go on; if you want to know what life is like in a falling civilization, go look out the window. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the mainstream media, on the occasions when such things are mentioned at all, they’re treated as disconnected factoids irrelevant to the big picture. Most people haven’t yet grasped that these things <i>are</i>
the big picture—that while we’re daydreaming about an assortment of shiny futures that look more or less like the present with more toys, climate change, resource depletion, collapsing infrastructure, economic contraction, and the implosion of political and cultural institutions are creating the future we’re going to inhabit. Too many of us suffer from a weird inability to imagine a future that isn’t simply a continuation of the present, even when such a future stands knocking at our own front doors. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So vast a failure of imagination can’t be overcome by the simple expedient of pointing out the ways that it’s already failed to explain the world in which we live. That said, there are other ways to break the grip of the conventional wisdom, and I’m pleased to say that one of those other ways seems to be making modest but definite headway just now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Longtime readers here will remember that in 2011, this blog launched a contest for short stories about <a href=../../2011/09/invasion-of-space-bats.html>the kind of future we can actually expect</a>—a future in which no <i>deus ex machina</i> saves industrial civilization from the exhaustion of its resource base, the deterioration of the natural systems that support it, and the normal process of decline and fall. That contest resulted in an anthology, <i>After Oil: SF Stories of a Post-Petroleum Future</i>, which found a surprisingly large audience. On the strength of its success, <a href=../../2014/01/return-of-space-bats.html>I ran a second contest in 2014</a>, which resulted in two more volumes—<i>After Oil 2: The Years of Crisis</i>, which is now available, and <i>After Oil 3: The Years of Rebirth</i>, which is in preparation. Demand for the original volume has remained steady, and the second is selling well; after a conversation with the publisher, I’m pleased to announce that we’re going to do it again, with a slight twist.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The basic rules are mostly the same as before: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Stories should be between 2500 and 7500 words in length; </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They should be entirely the work of their author or authors, and should not borrow characters or setting from someone else’s work;</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They should be in English, with correct spelling, grammar and punctuation; </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They should be stories—narratives with a plot and characters—and not simply a guided tour of some corner of the future as the author imagines it; </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They should be set in our future, not in an alternate history or on some other planet;</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They should be works of realistic fiction or science fiction, not magical or supernatural fantasy—that is, the setting and story should follow the laws of nature as those are presently understood;</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They should take place in settings subject to thermodynamic, ecological, and economic limits to growth; and as before,</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They must not rely on <a href=../../2011/09/invasion-of-space-bats.html>“alien space bats”</a>—that is, <i>dei ex machina</i> inserted to allow humanity to dodge the consequences of the limits to growth. (Aspiring authors might want to read the whole “Alien Space Bats” post for a more detailed explanation of what I mean here; reading the stories from one or both of the published After Oil volumes might also be a good plan.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This time, though, I’m adding an additional rule: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Stories submitted for this contest must be set at least one thousand years in the future—that is, after March 25, 3015 in our calendar. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s partly a reflection of a common pattern in entries for the two previous contests, and partly something deeper. The common pattern? A great many authors submitted stories that were set during or immediately after the collapse of industrial civilization; there’s certainly room for those, enough so that the entire second volume is basically devoted to them, but tales of surviving decline and fall are only a small fraction of the galaxy of potential stories that would fit within the rules listed above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’d like to encourage entrants to consider telling something different, at least this time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The deeper dimension? That’s a reflection of the blindness of the imagination discussed earlier in this post, the inability of so many people to think of a future that isn’t simply a prolongation of the present. Stories set in the immediate aftermath of our civilization don’t necessarily challenge that, and I think it’s high time to start talking about futures that are genuinely <i>other</i>—neither utopia nor oblivion, but different, radically different, from the linear extrapolations from the present that fill so many people’s imaginations these days, and have an embarrassingly large role even in science fiction. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You have to read SF from more than a few decades back to grasp just how tight the grip of a single linear vision of the future has become on what used to be a much more freewheeling literature of ideas. In book after book, and even more in film after film, technologies that are obviously derived from ours, ideologies that are indistinguishable from ours, political and economic arrangements that could pass for ours, and attitudes and ideas that belong to this or that side of today’s cultural struggles get projected onto the future as though they’re the only imaginable options. This takes place even when there’s very good reason to think that the linear continuation of current trends isn’t an option at all—for example, the endlessly regurgitated, done-to-death trope of interstellar travel. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let us please be real:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>we aren’t going to the stars—not in our lifetimes, not in the lifetime of industrial civilization, <a href=../../2007/09/solving-fermis-paradox.html>not in the lifetime of our species</a>. There are equally<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>good thermodynamic and economic reasons to believe that many of the other standard tropes of contemporary science fiction are just as unreachable—that, for example, limitless energy from gimmicks of the dilithium-crystal variety, artificial intelligences capable of human or superhuman thought, and the like belong to fantasy, not to the kind of science fiction that has any likelihood of becoming science fact. Any of my readers who want to insist that human beings can create anything they can imagine, by the way, are welcome to claim that, just as soon as they provide me with a working perpetual motion machine. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s surprisingly common to see people insist that the absence of the particular set of doodads common to today’s science fiction would condemn our descendants to a future of endless boredom. This attitude shows a bizarre stunting of the imagination—not least because stories about interstellar travel normally end up landing the protagonists in a world closely modeled on some past or present corner of the Earth. If our genus lasts as long as the average genus of vertebrate megafauna, we’ve got maybe ten million years ahead of us, or roughly two thousand times as long as all of recorded human history to date: more than enough time for human beings to come up with a dazzling assortment of creative, unexpected, radically <i>different</i>
societies, technologies, and ways of facing the universe and themselves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s what I’d like to see in submissions to this year’s Space Bats challenge—yes, it’ll be an annual thing from here on out, as long as the market for such stories remains lively. A thousand years from now, industrial civilization will be as far in the past as the Roman Empire was at the time of the Renaissance, and new human societies will have arisen to pass their own judgment on the relics of our age. Ten thousand years from now, or ten million? Those are also options. Fling yourself into the far future, far enough that today’s crises are matters for the history books, or tales out of ancient myth, or forgotten as completely as the crises and achievements of the Neanderthal people are today, and tell a story about human beings (or, potentially, post-human beings) confronting the challenges of their own time in their own way. Do it with verve and a good readable style, and your story may be be one of the ones chosen to appear in the pages of <i>After Oil 4:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Future’s Distant Shores</i>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
The mechanics are pretty much the same as before. Write your story and post it to the internet—if you don’t have a blog, you can get one for free from <a href=http://www.blogspot.com/ >Blogspot</a> or <a href=http://wordpress.com/ >Wordpress</a>. Post a link to it in the comments to The Archdruid Report. You can write more than one story, but please let me know which one you want entered in the competition—there will be only one entry accepted per author this time. Stories must be written and posted online, and a link posted to this blog, by August 30, 2015 to be eligible for inclusion in the anthology. </div>

I have a story that I began, but never completed, for the previous one and it just so happens that it satisfies your new criterion...<br><br>Regarding your observations of lifestyles, modern choices thereof, and the systemic impacts of said choices, I admit to giving much thought to these points of late. Not only in terms of resource use and depletion, but also in the social networks (or lack of such) characteristic of today. My mother-in-law is now in hospice. She lived alone about two blocks from our house in this small WI town we call home. This past winter, I shoveled her driveway before heading off to work each morning after snowfall. Now, because of her medical needs in these last days/weeks/months, she is in a facility (but still here in town, which is good). I went to visit her today after work, the first time I'd been to her new place since she'd been moved there from the hospital earlier this week.<br><br>I confess to mixed feelings. Walking through the hallways, as nice as the facility is, and intellectually acknowledging the need for places providing trained 24/7 care, I could not help seeing a storage place for people waiting to die, somewhere to put them out-of-the-way of the busy world, which cannot stop to deal with folks who have now ability to provide any useful service any longer. And yet, I am too part of that same system, even as I try to mitigate its influence.<br><br><a href=#c1018318378961479823 title="comment permalink">3/25/15, 5:48 PM</a><br><br>

The whole blog entry is worth a read, but one interesting portion is to note that a huge amount of effort spent on quote-unquote "Science" these days boils down to nothing more than statistical analysis. We are not <i>discovering</i> and <i>understanding</i> things these days so much as counting tally-marks. As Adam Curtis points out, and any honest scientist will admit, statistical correlations by themselves can never tell us the "why" of things. When one's imagination is limited -- as JMG explained earlier, our society takes great pains to replace our wide-ranging imaginations with controllable prosthetic ones -- then the benefit that one derives from statistical correlation analysis is sharply limited to only what you can already imagine. The failure of science has in some ways been engineered by the economic and oppressive dictates of a society desperate to cling to the status quo and avoid change. Thus we have put statistical blinders upon science, limiting its vision to an actuarial one. Of course the "science" of economics went down that road a long time ago.<br><br><a href=#c4454616536019203331 title="comment permalink">3/25/15, 7:39 PM</a><br><br>

Although, now that you've mentioned your cheeky name substitution technique, I’m beginning to see the series in a whole new light. hehe! Very cheeky and very amusing. The second series of his books were a very similar story to the first series, so you may not have missed much. Same, same, but different is an apt review.<br><br>Unsolicited representations are usually made by organisations trying to unload worthless paper whilst that paper is still apparently worth something. Yes, I can well imagine that the AODA's endowment fund is heavily tied up in fracking stocks seeking high yields! hehe! I did advise you to diversify your holdings earlier, so don't blame me when it goes belly up. hehe! Sorry, I'm just being silly.<br><br>Congratulations to Steve and Jason - both very excellent entries and I applaud their efforts. I still smile remembering the image of the dodgy Lego robot on the sea shore bravely facing the incoming waves. Too funny. Well done both of you!<br><br>When you write in this week’s blog of the failure of the imagination, I must confess that realisation only dawned on me the other day that with near zero interest rates, your government can effectively keep printing money for quite a while - until its poker bluff is called - because the cost of servicing that debt is negligible. It would have been far wiser for the decision makers to have poured that money into infrastructure projects - whilst those tokens were still worth something - but then that act may well driven inflation and caused a loss of wealth in the big end of town. Sad - a truly lost opportunity. I suspect that they are well aware of that outcome, it isn’t like it hasn’t happened before. Keeping prices down keeps the rabble in check – for the moment anyway.<br><br>You know, I'm not very good at fiction. I tend rather to write about the things that I see and do in the real world and I barely have enough time free for that. I went out today and picked up some seconds and down grade steel for the new wood shed. It is amazing how cheap this stuff is - get it while you can is my thinking and build for the long term. <br><br>The fracking thing here (coal seam gas) is slowly getting toasted too which is good news.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: The new blog entry is up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Rats that eat cars</a>. Yes, this is a true story as a rat ate certain critical components in my vehicle. Who'd have thought that was even possible? Anyway, the rats are starting to get the upper hand here and I'm pondering long term solutions to this and how best to live with them. My money is on the rats long term as they show true intelligence and cunning. The blog also has photos of some of the beautiful coastline to the south west of the farm which is under threat from rising ocean levels and storm surges - not that the locals seem to notice - although it is sort of hard to ignore as you can see in the photos? Dunno. Also autumn is planting time here so there are all sorts of things going on with plants. Excavations for the wood shed have also continued too. Lots of good fun stuff and cool photos.<br><br><a href=#c504137305599859404 title="comment permalink">3/25/15, 8:08 PM</a><br><br>

It took me forever to read through your post today, because I kept stopping and composing stuff in my mind.<br><br>I'll have a nice entry for your challenge worked up in a few days. I'm writing the second half of a novel, and I thought I'd put up a chapter--but it's set in 2045. OK, so then I thought, look back on the legacy of that novel's outcome. Bingo!<br><br>The second half of your first paragraph this week is so quotable !And that got me thinking too.<br><br>To those of us who have been watching the collapse of industrial civilization unfold, it has been like watching a car accident in slow motion. We see the driver's head go through the windshield in 2008 (Lehman shock), and he goes rolling onto the pavement later that year, with the ambulances arriving very quickly, where the medics immediately start applying treatment--not anything that would actually save his life (to hobble on as a cripple in his declining years), but to make him appear to be healthy (QE). His family (the US public) gets wind of this and protests, but are ignored, as treatments profitable to the hospital are applied repeatedly. We are told that he is doing very well, with the rigged machinery showing a healthy pulse and other vital signs, and never mind he's on artificial respiration. The inevitable signs of decay keep showing up, with intermittent bloating and deflation.<br><br>If the press were still functional, we would have a fiasco reminiscent of Terry Schiavo. Instead, we have Photoshopped images of him on crutches, smiling; and quotes from him on his progress. We are told that our prayers will help his further recovery, and his family believes that if we all pray heard enough, a new medicine will come along that will really help him.<br><br><a href=#c8553553534079150776 title="comment permalink">3/25/15, 8:08 PM</a><br><br>

I am NOT bringing this as a counterpoint to JMG's statement above that most people are now too poor to do just that. On the contrary: this bit of news proves wrong those who have been saying that the decline in miles driven in recent years was due to young people losing interest in driving, since after all they've got smartphones and social media. Bzzz! As soon as oil prices declined, driving IS up. The catch is that with the temporarily low price, well below costs, oil extraction is plummeting. When the oil market gets "rebalanced" again, prices will rebound and driving will decrease again. And those who bought a guzzler now will be sorry (and drive even less).<br><br><a href=#c8086152417107156871 title="comment permalink">3/25/15, 8:36 PM</a><br><br>

As long as the waste stream was at least 20% solids, it would be self-sustaining, anything more would produce excess energy.<br><br>Both of these are based on solid science but nutty economics. They may produce net energy on a marginal basis, but they would require a major infrastructure overhaul that would negate any benefit for a very long time -- except, the effluent from the purox process is sterile, which is why it was originally developed.<br><br>The most intriguing proposal I've come across is using the differential in osmotic pressure between saltwater and freshwater. You could use that to draw water into towers, and then release the water through electric generators. There, the problem is you are consuming fresh water, and there aren't too many areas next to salt water that need electricity and have an abundance of fresh water.<br><br><a href=#c796845212941309353 title="comment permalink">3/25/15, 8:37 PM</a><br><br>

In the best case as JMG stated the world will have temporarily stabilized in a new normal state starting to reabsorbe co2 (That is equivalent to say it will be at "peak climate change"). In the worst case something like the Permian Extinction will happen again with several chained waves of die off happening. At the time life was almost wiped out from the face of the planet and almost all oxigen in the atmosphere burned. For 100000 years afterwards there is no trace of life in rocks, then reappeared taking 1 million years to get back to "normal" with completely new species.

At this point I don't have any good ideas that have passed beyond the vague, but I still hope to attempt writing a story for this contest. The 1000+ years restriction definitely makes it more of a challenge, but an intriguing one. I found that even imagining a story occurring in a place 40-50 years in the future (my After Oil 2 story) was challenging.<br><br>I found many of the other stories in the first two After Oil anthologies thought-provoking, and I thank the authors for their contributions. <br><br>One observation I (and two others to whom I gave one) have about the published anthologies so far is that the majority of authors--and main characters in the stories--are male. I'm not invoking blame, for I think this is simply a reflection of the fact that many more men entered the contest than women. But still, I do admit that I would like to hear more women's voices in post-petroleum fiction anthologies. Therefore, I encourage more women writers who read this blog to enter the contest for After Oil 4.<br><br><a href=#c6597836446815542331 title="comment permalink">3/25/15, 10:14 PM</a><br><br>

Those car-eating rats are probably the wave of the future; we'll know that we're in trouble when they no longer limit themselves to eating the tasty bits, but haul away the metal to sell for scrap. <br><br>Patricia, I'll look forward to your story. As for the accident metaphor, the only thing I'd add to it is that the patient proceeded to climb back into a newer, faster, and even more unsafe car, and the sound of squealing brakes is being heard as another hard encounter with another windshield approaches...<br><br>Robert, a knowledge of past cultures and extinct civilizations is highly useful just now, you know!<br><br>Cathy, I don't mind at all. You've got a publisher lined up for that, don't you, once it makes the transition from blog posts to print? <br><br>Moshe, of course -- but you'll notice that so far, at least, the increase in gasoline consumption hasn't been enough to make prices go up. It's fascinating to watch a classic overproduction crisis unfold in so textbook a manner. <br><br>Wizard, why not give it a try? You might surprise yourself. <br><br>Beneath, quite a few of the stories in <i>After Oil 3</i> have female protagonists, but you're right that women are still underrepresented in the field of deindustrial SF. I would be delighted to see that change; all it'll take is more women writing stories for these contests, and more authors of any gender exploring a wider range of stories and characters -- which is what I'd hope to see as this fairly new field of SF begins to map out the territory ahead of it.<br><br><a href=#c801105892049413002 title="comment permalink">3/25/15, 10:18 PM</a><br><br>

We also had hospice in the nursing home, so mother had "eyes" constantly checking on her around the clock. I had never spent any time in a nursing home other than a short visit to someone. I must say that I was immediately impressed with the way the nursing home was run and the unbelievable dedication of the staff.<br>It became evident that by contrast to the comfort of the patient which is the goal of the nursing home staff, the staff in a hospital is focused on treating the narrow set of symptoms and getting the patient out the door.<br><br>The nursing home is completely open to the family of the patients around the clock. Entry is gained by a code that has to be entered on a key pad by each door. This open access to me is essential. Alabama has had a law for many years now that no physical restraints of any kind can be used on patients in nursing homes. This came about because of some abuses that had occurred. <br><br>The point of all this, though, is that if you are going to go into a nursing home this would be the right time. I do not see how the system can be maintained a decade or two into the future and beyond. The cost here is around $6200 per month and the awesomely dedicated caregivers are not the ones making the big bucks. There will not be people to hire for these jobs so the whole system is economically unsustainable.<br><br>My mother left school after the seventh grade in order to become the "primary caregiver" for her beloved grandmother who was dying of cancer in 1944/45. In the future, we may have to return to caring for the aged and infirm at home which has been the pattern throughout most of human history.<br><br><br><a href=#c6378527367872245577 title="comment permalink">3/25/15, 11:41 PM</a><br><br>

But, this was mainly possible because both husband and I were able to earn an income from home. The removal of productivity from the domestic sphere is what has produced the need for so many families to outsource caring (paying too much for poor substitutes)...

Mailshots, even less so. I'd be as glad as anyone to see the back of "fracking", but your story says more to me about lazy selling techniques than anything else - anyone who bothered to do cursory search on druidism would know that they did not have the right product to sell.<br><br>That being said, the Church of England, still a wealthy organisation - was found to hold stocks in certain outfits whose practices were very dubious to the Christian ethic - the problem with a large organisation with clever money men working in their own silo to maximise the savings of the church. Hopefully the bad publicity incurred has led to more oversight of the management of their savings!<br><br>Now for the real reason for posting: I was waiting for the discussion to turn again to the importance of narrative in opening people's minds to peak oil before mentioning a book that played a very formative role in mythinking, and perhaps helping make me receptive to the "Archdruid report" when I eventually found this blog. That would be Mark Chadbourne's Age of Misrule trilogy. Whilst not a contender for your space bat challenge, it had a lot to say to me about coping with the collapse of modern industrial civilisation. Essentially the creatures and gods of ancient lore return and as magic regains power, technology fails, and the heroes swashbuckle their way through the transition. The prologue is particularly worth quoting at length:<br><br><i>And now the world turns slowly from the light. Not with the symbol clash of tanks and guns, but with the gently plucked harp of shifting moods and oddly lengthening shadows, the soft tread of a subtle invasion, not here, then here, and none the wiser. Each morning the sun still rises on supermarket worlds of plastic and glass, on industrial estates where slow trucks lumber in belches of diesel, on cities lulled by the whirring of disc drives breaking existence down into digitised order. People still move through their lives with the arrogance of rulers who know their realms will never fall. Several weeks into the new dark age, life goes on as it always has, oblivious to the passing of the Age of Reason, of Socratic thought and Apollonian logic.<br>No one had noticed. But they would. And soon.</i><br><br><a href=#c3816971836436572279 title="comment permalink">3/26/15, 1:47 AM</a><br><br>

The Energy Information Agency (EIA) recently estimated that in 2015, the US will reach an oil production level of 9.3 million barrels per day — a mere 300,000 barrels shy of the 1970 zenith that peak oil proponent M. King Hubbert famously predicted in 1956.<br><br>It is possible that the massive boom in fracked “tight oil” from shale formations will “reset” US peak oil nearly fifty years after it supposedly occurred.

It was peak of conventional oil that Hubbert was speaking about (even Wikipedia admits that!) but completely misstating an argument is par for the course in the article. <br><br>They then go on to do what has consistently not worked with regards to dealing with climate change - a call for scaremongering: "climate crisis is so dire that it will take nothing less than a “war-like” mobilization of the public sector (state planning, punitive taxes, and massive subsidies for clean energy) to shift our economy away from fossil fuels."<br><br>What I find interesting is that both the Left &amp; Right can only scaremonger.

The rest, various fees &amp; taxes. No, I don't have PV and don't live off the grid. But there is good natural lighting where I sit to read, and my water heater, house heating, and stove are all natural gas. So maybe the energy usage is just being shoved elsewhwere.<br><br>Then, I was idly googling for WWII-era home front data for personal reasons and came across the civilian gasoline rationing figures: 3-5 gallons/month. 5 gallons is nearly a fill-up for my little 1998 econobug. Tried it on 3/8 of a tank and 5 gallons put the gas gauge hard against Full. Will start tracking usage by filling up at the same time every week, but I'd be surprised if the car takes any more than 5, and probably less.

The ban is on magical or supernatural fantasy. As long as the portrayal of magic in your story remains within the laws of nature as currently understood, having characters who practice magic, divination, or the like in the course of the story is as reasonable as having characters who engage in farming or hunting, say, or who worship gods or spirits. Magical practices have been pretty much universal in human culture so far, and will doubtless be so in the millennia to come. <br><br>R_df34, nah, I specified the genus, not the species. It's entirely possible that <i>H. sapiens</i> won't make it for too many millennia to come, but I'd look for the emergence of new species of the genus <i>Homo</i> from relict populations of <i>H. sapiens</i> in isolated refugia, as normally happens in the course of evolution. <br><br>Beatrice, if you want to do a story about Amazon warriors a thousand years in the future, by all means -- a new twist on an old theme can still be the basis for a good story.

Which is to say, the big problem is getting the fuel, because in the case of muons, they decay in about 1/500th of a second. If that weren't bad enough, while they catalyze fusion reactions at room temperatures, they tend to be lost after about 100 reactions; however, it takes about the energy of 500 reactions to create a muon, which is like an electron but 207 times more massive. So unless you can find a reliable source of muons, it's definitely a squirrel nut case.<br><br>And oh yes, while I'm never quite sure how long my stories will be when I start them, if it does end up being within the requisite length, I do plan on putting the "episodes" together and submitting People of the North as an entry in the contest.<br><br><a href=#c7960026619795607361 title="comment permalink">3/26/15, 10:42 AM</a><br><br>

On the other hand, it seems to fit in the guidelines, because it it involves sci-fi technology that does not serve as a dei ex machina that lets people dodge the consequences of growth.

As Cherokee notes, this will allow the servicing of government and private debt to continue longer that a rational person might believe. One might expect, and the pundits lead you this direction, that with all this free money being wished into existence and injected into the economy, that the spectre of deflation would not continue to loom and that the world economies would be stimulated to growth. In the beginning, I wondered why they didn't spread the money to the class of people who would spend it (a la "Helicopter Ben" Bernanke), rather than invest it. The rich, who have actually been the recipients, have for the most part, just 'invested' this money. I've come to believe that the false axiom that I had been laboring under in my musings was that the goal actually was to stimulate the economy and keep inflation at the desired 2% range. I've come to believe that the reason that all this stimulus has gone entirely to the rich is precisely <i>because</i> they don't spend it, <i>because</i> they 'invest' it. Their investments make no claims on the physical world, they simply add to the digital 'tally' that these folks hold claim to and allow them to maintain their position and status. If this stimulus money were distributed to the less well off, that money would <i>immediately</i> be converted into claims on physical resources, that would cause a raft of serious repercussions in this resource constrained world. This reasoning has led me to believe that the increasing inequality that we have been experiencing is in large part driven by the need to prevent aggregate demand on real, physical assets from increasing, while maintaining the status quo and servicing the debt based monetary system that is the basis of the power and status of the wealthy. The fact that things have now reached the point of an absurdity like a negative interest rate, lead me to the conclusion that this shell game has very little time left in its hourglass.<br><br><a href=#c4423149773987985791 title="comment permalink">3/26/15, 11:20 AM</a><br><br>

I think I finished The Long Descent last month, or the month before. I very much like your take on the basket of predicaments facing industrial society—your voice is one of the only that strikes me as being entirely realistic and rational about what lies ahead.<br><br>I'm currently a post-secondary student in Massachusetts, and one of the courses I'm taking is all about labor studies—unions, working conditions, and inequality in industrial society. It's been a good class overall; nothing groundbreaking ideologically, but it's interesting to learn a little bit about the nuts and bolts of organized labor. As you might expect, resource depletion and blowback from the natural world, as you and the peak oil community are so eager to discuss (and as I'm so eager to listen to) are not mentioned in the course, and never have been. Understandable in a course that focuses on the relationship between owners and workers, but regardless, it got me thinking a little bit.<br><br>As somebody who was first politicized by reading Noam Chomsky, the concepts of privilege, exploitation, and oppression are nothing new to me. They certainly resonate. However, the narrative from the far-left doesn't often seem to incorporate mention of the ideas that might be found on The Archdruid Report about why so many people are suffering right now. For the most part, this suffering is chalked up to the use and abuse of power relations, and that makes a lot of sense to me. But after listening to both this narrative and yours (“yours” as a placeholder for the greater sphere of ideas you and other peakists work with), a certain amount of cognitive dissonance starts to creep in. I mentioned my labor studies course because this is probably the time of week when the dissonance really kicks in full-throttle nowadays, as somebody who has been almost exclusively interested in the peak oil story as of late (and who hasn't been reading as much Chomsky, for example).<br><br>So, my question is this (and I apologize for the long buildup): where should we draw the line between systemic exploitation and the turbulence caused by the three E's when analyzing the current set of dilemmas pressing down on the non-privileged masses? I have no doubt that both play important roles, but I've been having some difficulty synthesizing these two perspectives into one cohesive outlook. Have you written about this specific intersection in the past? I would love to hear your thoughts.<br><br>Thanks a lot,<br>Sean<br><br><a href=#c8903377367603574819 title="comment permalink">3/26/15, 11:30 AM</a><br><br>

Thanks for the real-life squirrel case, btw -- that's definitely a classic. <br><br>Kayr, granted, but as much as I like LeGuin's work -- and she's been among my favorite F&amp;SF authors since I first read the Earthsea trilogy at age 11 -- I'd like to see plenty of other women writing their own stories. Perhaps you'll contribute a story?<br><br>John, glad to hear it. <br><br>Greg, hmm. I'd tend to say no -- remember that you have to keep the cryogenic facility powered, supplied with spare parts, etc. for a thousand years, which is quite a feat, and then you'd also have to have people on the other end of the process with the knowledge base to thaw your sleeper out in such a way that he or she ends up alive, rather than fatally freezer-burned or what have you. If you can make a case for some such thing without resorting to handwaving or unobtainium crystals, I'll reconsider -- but I'd rather see something that sticks a little closer to scientific fact. <br><br>Patricia, remember that the occasional off topic comment is welcome, but a series of them might be better suited to the Green Wizards forum.<br><br>Wagelaborer, oog. These people would be easy pickings for some fanatic in jackboots...<br><br>Dltrammel, many thanks! <br><br>Matt, exactly. If all that hallucinatory money were to start chasing real wealth, we'd have hyperinflation in no time -- thus the various gimmicks to keep it safely confined to paper of various kinds. The question is how long that can be kept up as the supply of real wealth continues to decline. <br><br>Sean, that's a topic for an entire post, not just a brief comment -- and I'll consider it. The very short form is that the more severe the actual shortfalls become, the more frantically the privileged struggle to claim an unfair share of what's left, and the more extreme the imbalance in the distribution of wealth becomes. I've written on this in a number of previous posts, but it probably deserves another look. <br><br>Avalterra, yes, I should have said something about that, shouldn't I? The contract is a standard book contract, with an equal share of the royalties on the book's sales going to each author whose story is included in the book; there's no advance, but my story in volume 1 has already brought in more than I'd have gotten from all but the top end of SF short story markets, and it'll keep on paying royalties until the book goes out of print. <br><br>James, thank you.

And this time, it’s not just the Neocons that are pushing this; this is a bipartisan act of mindboggling stupidity with plenty of pseudoliberal Democrats on board as well. <br><br>http://thesaker.is/us-house-votes-348-48-to-arm-ukraine-russia-warns-lethal-aid-will-explode-the-whole-situation/<br><br>In response, the Chechen government is saying it will send military aid, including weapons, to Mexico and to Hispanic separatists in the Southwest US, which is former Mexican territory that was seized in the 1840’s and which the Mexicans still claim is rightfully theirs. The following is an official press release by the speaker of the parliament of the Chechen Republic:<br><br>http://fortruss.blogspot.ca/2015/03/chechen-parliament-speakers-riposte-to.html<br><br>He writes: <br><br>“The Ukrainian state arose out of the Soviet Union. It was together with the Ukrainians that Russians, Jews, Georgians, Chechens, and Armenians rebuilt that post-war Ukrainian Soviet Republic. Not one American dollar was spent of the development and rebuilding of Ukraine after WWII. Since ancient times, Moscow and Kiev built the state together; to this day, Russians and Ukrainians are fraternal peoples.<br><br>From this it follows that the US has no business advising Russia how to conduct itself with neighboring and friendly people. The supply of weapons to Ukraine will be viewed by us as a signal to act accordingly. We will begin delivery of new weapons to Mexico to resume debate on the legal status of territories annexed by the US, namely the American states of California, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and portions of Wyoming.<br><br>We reserve the right to hold conferences in Russia, Mexico, and America with agendas about the liberation of these states from the US, and the supply of weapons to the partisans there.”<br><br>And finishes by warning the US government:<br><br>“Russia is too big a bite for you. Chill.”<br><br>We have discussed on this blog the very real likelihood that foreign governments will start bankrolling and sending weapons to insurgents and dissidents in the United States in response to all those “color revolutions” and rent-a-coups sponsored by the CIA and NGO’s with ties to the US political and intelligence establishment. We have also discussed the likelihood that countries like Russia and China are already stirring the pot by pushing anti-government propaganda aimed at right-wing dissidents in the US and EU. It looks like the Russians and their allies are starting to openly hit back for all those color revolutions and rent-a-coups by openly backing both Hispanic separatists and right wing dissidents in the United States. One wonders what other groups the Russians, Chechens and other Russian allies others are aiding as well.<br><br>When I read this, I had a real “oh, crap!” moment. It looks like the blowback is coming home to roost and its going to be nasty. What comes around goes around, and I think that Americans are not going to be very happy being on the receiving end of all those dirty tricks our government, military and intelligence community have been playing aboard. <br><br>So add this to all the other nasty consequences coming down the pike as discussed in this post and others. To paraphrase Guillaume Faye, America is facing a convergence of catastrophes, all self-inflicted.

Forget any money for new construction projects at all. If it hasn't already begun or the money already been budgeted, no new construction at all by MO DOT as of 2017. By then the entire budget won't even be enough to maintain the current network that MO DOT maintains!<br><br>MO DOT's plan to address this is to designate a fraction of the network, those roads that connect the biggest towns to each other and to other places out of state, to be maintained so as to preserve them in reasonable condition.

I can see a dim outline of some things humans would have to think about. <br>When children explore the woods, they'll find some ancient stone walls and foundations, and maybe some plastic shotgun cartridges and bottles. If there are any archaeologists around, this may be the cave art they ponder. <br>The local ecosystem is likely to be something we would not recognize. It would be the same landscape of rivers and hills, with a new array of flora and fauna living on it. All over the northern hemisphere, species have been migrating north, so we can only expect this to continue. This is a sad legacy, to erase entire ecosystems from living memory. A New England forest may resemble the coastal North Carolina of today. <br>I've been wondering, JMG, wouldn't it be especially disturbing and sad to a Druid, to change the whole cast of characters in a nature based religion? It would be like losing all your friends. Sure, you can make new ones, but it is a terrible loss. (Forgive me if this belongs in the other blog)<br>If humans make it another 1,000 years, once they've found their way to a stable, locally resource based system, it would have to be a very conservative society, I think. I don't mean conservative, like contemporary "conservatives" defending a rapacious system of plunder. I mean conservative, as in deeply skeptical of every huckster and demagogue who will lead us to something bigger and better. The burden of proof needs to be on those who want a sustainable life to change, not on those who stand in the way of "progress." It seems to me that a religion and mythology based on local nature would make people tremendously resistant to some Ayn Rand hero leading us to the next catastrophe. (I feel kind of ridiculous stating the obvious to an Archdruid, but I'm just thinking out loud)<br>A matriarchal society might be more skeptical of the warrior ethos and the general fascination with all things military. I have noticed that, in our present age, women are more opposed to military adventures than men, minority women most of all. In the run up to the invasion of Iraq, every woman I talked to was vehemently against it. They were thinking of externalized costs, like working class young people being disabled for life.<br><br><a href=#c8996733899041400780 title="comment permalink">3/26/15, 4:14 PM</a><br><br>

If they won't break down in a compost pile, then they won't break down at all.<br>Robert, <br>I'm going to be as gentle as possible about this, but the biggest issue with New England and the Northeast in general is the culture. I know you don't see yourselves this way, but people in the rest of the country, particularly the West and South, positively see red when dealing with you and your culture. You all come across as abrasive, rude, and even combative. Secondly, you all come across as very closed and cold to outsiders. I know you all get defensive about it, but it is how you are perceived. Culturally, New England and the Northeast seems a very difficult place to break in to and assimilate in to. I imagine that is why there's been so much outflow of people in this area during the late 20th early 21st century. Of course, people now no longer have the luxury of living where they want, based on superfluous reasons like pleasant climate and mild winters. Now people have to live in places capable of supporting them. Our two largest states will be virtually uninhabitable, with Florida submerged and California dehydrated.

I know that there have always been animosities there for centuries, back to Roman Imperial times, as well as other conquests, and capitalism, through the EU is just another.<br> As this was in 2011, I'll need to dig out what has happened since his book was published. <br><br><br>“ This was a notable difference from Hungary, where left-leaning people I'd met generally saw the EU as a counterbalance to nationalism, but it (the Romanian's lifestyle) was rooted in Romania's peasant culture and evils like Ceausescu. These young, modern, urban people were intensely proud that country dwellers still raised their own crops, ploughed with horses, made their own wine, butchered their own pigs, produced their own cheese, and retained some knowledge of how to harvest traditional medicines from the forest; this culture was threatened by EU regulation and the free-market ideology espoused by their government...<br> Now people in Brussels are saying these pigs should be sent to an abattoir, where a pig can be killed by electricity. What's the point of that? Is it better for the pig? And the peasants must pasteurise their milk, buy a license to sell it to their neighbours, they won't be allowed to sell tuica juice from the cherry tree in their own garden.<br> THEY WANT TO TURN US INTO WESTERN EUROPE...<br> Our government is embarrassed by the fact that we still have peasants here, said Alexandria. They think it's backward, primitive. They are trying to force us off the land so foreign multinationals like Monsanto, can grow modified crops here.<br> NO CAPITALIST GOVERMNENT WANTS ITS PEOPLE TO BE SELF-SUFFICIENT—self-sufficient people don't go shopping.”<br>They are trying to make us dependent, to take away our freedom, so we can be controlled.”<br><br><a href=#c414342262478795891 title="comment permalink">3/26/15, 7:27 PM</a><br><br>

Mind you they look like the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=echidna+image&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=919&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DyYVVY_eNoWg8QWrnYCYCw&amp;ved=0CBwQsAQ" rel=nofollow>Echidna</a> which are actually on the farm here and to be found nosing and digging about the place - they love any hot weather. As a fun fact: They're a monotreme and the only other one is the platypus! A very cool but not widely repeated party trick.<br><br>Yeah, well interest rates can't go up can they? That is why the housing market is going up too. Chasing yields, but it doesn't reflected in official inflation figures. Oh my, but aren't we all being played for fools. I reckon at this point in time, inflationary pressures (where a portion of the population aren't actively benefiting eg. housing) would cause a riot - the decision makers must be aware of that outcome? Maybe? It is a dangerous game to play on such a massive scale and I don't believe that there is a winning outcome for those that hold the preponderance of power and wealth - I find it to be quite strange that they could be so clueless.<br><br>Still, economics ranks second to military authority so maybe such a game can be played over the long term? I wonder if another culture has tried it before? I've never heard of such a policy in a major power, but you never know. The real problem becomes, how do you replace your military assets because sooner or later they'll need replacing or repairing or whatever. Ouch.<br><br>I personally would have gone for infrastructure and rode the inflationary pressures as it would have brought down asset (real and intangible) values - but then that would have caused a hit to their pockets wouldn't it? Silly, silly people. The rats would not have made that mistake.<br><br>Hi Matt,<br><br>Exactly spot on! Of course that is why we don't see hyperinflation when historically that is the outcome of such a policy. They talk about deflationary pressures here but house prices and lease costs keep going up as a certain small segment of the population is rent seeking. They'll put themselves out of business is what they'll do and at that point they'll discover that what they're holding are actually tokens.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c6185156635455356797 title="comment permalink">3/27/15, 3:06 AM</a><br><br>

After all if we were capable of power the world with fossil fuels before it's absurd to think that we are incapable of coming up with a way to power our civilization into the future. That is of course until you take into account that the majority of what went into running the world on fossil fuels was millions of years of geology which we had nothing to do with. I'm coming to the conclusion that part of the reason why were in the mess we are currently in is that we just can't really get our head around the the fact that most of what we do is reliant upon the operations of nature, which we can influence, but not control. More than this, at least in my own head, the easiest way to conceptualize that our ways of doing things is dependent upon the natural world playing along, is to anthropomorphize nature. This of course does not gel well with the idea that natural world is all just dead matter.<br><br><a href=#c2658810892551487204 title="comment permalink">3/27/15, 4:26 AM</a><br><br>

The climate is atrocious, library services laughable and I can't believe I am living in a town with no bookstore. In addition, the town is roughly divided between persons whose ancestors came from Poland, Ireland and Italy. The Poles indiscriminately dislike everyone not Polish, the Irish don't speak to non-Catholics and the Italians run the place. <br><br>I love it here...because, those cold, insular northeasterners leave me alone. This town places no restrictions on what you can grow in your yard, although livestock is not allowed, a good idea considering our harsh winters. I can read any kind of abstruse book I like without someone accusing me of being a culture vulture wannabe. In CA, conservative Central Valley, anything I did for myself, from cake baking to sewing to gardening was bound to hurt someone's tender feelings. I could take salsa to the company picnic but not a home baked cake. If I was wearing a homemade shirt I must not tell anyone. Mow your own lawn and you are accused of taking income away from worthy immigrant yard services. I privately consider myself a refugee from what I call the conservative cultural conformity police.<br><br>Furthermore, this state, county and town support a level of public services which would be unheard of in wealthy California. I am retired and not in need of subsidies, but I am nevertheless grateful for the lack of roving bands of desperate homeless persons, for the fact that garden tools are not being stolen out of my yard, and for the absence of panhandling. And, despite the comparatively high property taxes which support those services, rents and house prices are far, far lower than anywhere on the West Coast, and, I might also mention, buses run till 11pm, also unheard of in any WC town I know about except for SF, LA and Portland.<br><br><a href=#c6374530310368131423 title="comment permalink">3/27/15, 8:24 AM</a><br><br>

The distortion of the political process is one of those, because capitalism leads to increasing disparities of wealth, which allow the rich to buy elections and manipulate the political process for their own benefit.

Since 2009, I have been researching and character developing a novel set roughly two thousand years in the future in the south west of Western Australia. <br><br>I've decided after reading your latest post to flesh out a section of the story from a different POV and submit it here. <br><br>As to the topic of your post, the less important one, the one about the current collapse of society as we know it or something, in Australia we currently have the collapse of the mining boom, and mining magnate Andrew Forrest suggesting that the major iron ore companies essentially form a cartel to cap production to revert the dramatic drop in prices and save their, ahem, assets.<br><br>The reason for this drop in iron prices: over-production. Over-production used by magnates such as Andrew Forrest, Gina Reinhardt and Clive Palmer in our country to get filthy rich. They have all become so brazen in their self serving political fiddling (Palmer is actually a Federal MP) exclaiming loudly and often to know what was in the best interests of the country. <br><br>Obviously it was in the best interest of our country to extract as much as possible of arguably the most valuable ores mankind has ever managed to manipulate and sell it as quickly as possible. all the while try to lower local wages, extort indigenous land managers, fight tooth and nail against attempts at wealth distribution and and then send the nation broke. <br><br>Phew, I'm so glad for people like that, and they make make pretty craters too.<br><br>Cheers, guys <br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c1489653504547025669 title="comment permalink">3/28/15, 6:18 AM</a><br><br>

A mere wet year does not undo the drought and the long term effects of global warming in California. Get out while the gettins still good! <br>I'll do a shameless plug for my region, the South. The South is one of the most diverse parts of the country, with immigration and African Americans moving back from other parts of the country. Many parts, including the upper South, have ample rainfall and are predicted to continue having ample rainfall as global warming picks up speed. The people are famous for being welcoming and hospitable. If you embrace the South, it will embrace you back. We have rich biodiversity. The cost of living and tax burden is among the lowest in the nation. Real estate prices are low. Since the U.S. is becoming a third world country, the South, as its poorest area, is best equipped to survive with flying colors. We've struggled so long that we're more resilient than wealthier regions. The South is used to dealing with unretractable problems like poverty, etc with grace and dignity. We make no pretence about a non existent, classless, egalitarian society, unlike some regions. We have a long history of resisting the dominant American culture, and are the most culturally unique area of the country. We are the spiritual home of the African American experience in America. As collapse happens, we don't have as far to go. We industrialized very late, so traditional, non industrial traditions are still alive in some areas, and not as far removed as areas that industrialized sooner. We have a deep and abiding tradition of being "our brother's keeper" which can seem stifling, yet in a future where community and connections will be more important, being able to depend on others and reciprocate in kind will be vital.<br><br><a href=#c5265274105728872488 title="comment permalink">3/28/15, 7:20 AM</a><br><br>

How much do they spend on lobbying and campaign contributions relative to other businesses? Their clout is a measure of their control of water resources. Secondly, as JMG has mentioned, the further into a crisis people get, the more committed people are to maintaining the status quo in the teeth of reality. Therefore, I expect business as usual to continue until crisis hits. Judging by the current actions, California is sleepwalking into a crisis. I've heard from people that ornamental watering was entirely suspended in droughts in the 70s and 80s that were not nearly as severe as this one. Therefore, even if you prepare as much as possible, setting up greywater and rain catchment systems, you still have to contend with all your neighbors that didn't.

But the same wiki page says that "According to the California Department of Food and Agriculture, California agriculture is nearly a $36.6 billion dollar industry that generates $100 billion in related economic activity." That would be about 1.8% of the state GDP, generating another 5% of the state GDP in "related activity".<br><br>Moreover, if the food from CA stopped coming, all of us will pay more for food (from where?), and Californians too will have to pay for food imported from elsewhere.

As JMG said, the opportunities for a good outcome were lost 30-40 years ago, now it's just crisis mitigation.<br><br><a href=#c5912485243092684204 title="comment permalink">3/29/15, 12:52 AM</a><br><br>

No seriously, this should be a truly fine rant...<br><br>It was with much interest that I read the recent back and forth discussions / comments on your blog about the current drought in California. As a person who lives in a part of the world that is - and will be again - subject to the threat of a drought most years, it would be most useful to share some experience of that with the good people of California. (I was trying a letter to the editor mode of writing, but I believe I will now revert to another mode of writing!)<br><br>Wake the frack up people! There, I've said it and I feel much better now.<br><br>In even the worst droughts here, it does rain at some point during the year. Surely you all have roofs over your heads? Then collect the water that falls onto that roof and store it in a - woo woo high tech - water tank for later use. How hard can that be? Every inch of roof space here collects rainfall - best of all it does not require any ongoing energy as it is all gravity fed. If you have that rainfall flowing out into the local gutter and away from your house and property - then you have only yourself to blame when you and your garden go thirsty!<br><br>How much water do you need anyway? Most of you lot whining about this harsh cruel world probably use 20 times the amount of water that you actually need to survive anyway - there is a whole lot further you can fall before you're facing dying of thirst. Oh my azaleas are dying - how awful, it is a real tragedy! How long was that last shower? Did you really need to wash those clothes you wore for only an hour? Honestly people - get real! Did you even think to leave any water out for the birds, reptiles or insects - whom may actually know what it means to be truly thirsty because of peoples actions?<br><br>As to agriculture, well when top soil gets depleted of course plants require more water. As well as having lots of active biology, top soil also has a neat trick of holding water. What do you expect? When fruit, grains and/or vegetables are taken from a farm - of course minerals are disappearing from that farm. Do you people think that somehow Harry Potter (never read or seen) magically replaces those minerals? Most industrial agriculture doesn't replace the full spectrum of minerals lost - so every year a little bit more disappears. Then we flush them out to sea in our manure - just where we don't need them. Well done people!<br><br>Pah!<br><br>Double Pah!<br><br>And when we speak of GDP, why is it that few people ask: why is possible that GDP is increasing when we actually produce less goods and services every year.<br><br>That's right, because we include Consumption in those GDP numbers. So when some company Down Under theoretically purchases management fees and interest from a related party company in Singapore (Chinese controlled?) or Switzerland (US controlled?) to hide away their actual profits and shift them off to a low company tax haven so they avoid paying local taxes (remember this is all theoretical, although it is worth noting that apparently related party transaction with Singapore, Switzerland and Australia exceed the real world trading of goods with China by a very considerable margin) - then those management fees expenditure are possibly counted towards the local GDP numbers. Seriously, I'd have to suggest that the Emperor is currently wearing very little clothes and possibly feeling a little bit chilly.<br><br>So when people say, agriculture is only a small percentage of GDP, then that may be true, but don't bet the farm on what GDP actually means because when it is stripped away of all the tomfoolery and skulduggery it doesn’t smell so well to me.<br><br>Frack!<br><br>I feel much better now. Deep breath, hold and release. hehe!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c882780064667854365 title="comment permalink">3/29/15, 3:10 AM</a><br><br>

Almost all those people don't have a place to put a water catchment container. I live in a surburban lot and have 4 50 gallon barrels under drain spouts. I can't get a 1000 gal cistern into my backyard and city won't allow it in the front yard. Water table is 300 ft down so no well drilling. In the winter none of the water is running into the street, it all stays on my property and some of my neighbors too. <br>I can do all these things, like short showes, less laundry, not watering grass, but most everyone else isn't. Last night a left a note<br>On someone's door that waters their grass everyday, they're only suppose to water it twice a week. <br>San Fran gets all its water from a reservoir in the serrias that is very low.

Californians are not totally unaware of what you have to say about freshwater and soil conservation. Most are not interested, but some people have changed habits and small steps are being taken in public policy and laws both locally and at the state level. <br><br>My brother and his wife live in a part of the state that gets its water from the California Aqueduct. I suggested some things their condominium association could do to reduce water use and they were totally uninterested. My county gets its water supply locally and is paying more attention. Homeowners can fairly easily install rain capture systems and landscape with less thirsty plants, but if you rent an apartment, which about half the population does, you can't even install a low flow toilet without permission.<br><br>Unlike JMG and many others, I'm moderately optimistic about how California is going to deal with endemic drought. Media awareness is high, our legislature isn't deadlocked, useful things can be done at every level of society, some measures don't require hugely expensive new infrastructure, and the problem is setting in at a rate that allows some mitigation. I see the mitigation happening. <br><br>Another reason I'm cautiously optimistic is that the population of California contains a lot of people who moved here to find work and will move out if they can't keep it (including immigrants from other nations). The state's population always falls during recessions. Those who remain will be less prosperous for sure, but there will be fewer of us. California contains several bioregions and the mountain counties are barely populated. No one really knows what the state's carrying capacity will be in the future.<br><br><a href=#c7383120103554836521 title="comment permalink">3/29/15, 2:05 PM</a><br><br>

So, 50% goes into the sea, 10% goes to the cities and 40% to agriculture.<br><br>The southern San Joaquin Valley was semi-desert, and irrigation has caused salinity problems. It will, and perhaps the rest of the San Joaquin may, have to be abandoned as agricultural land. Many growers have switched from low water demand fruit to high water demand nuts which can be mechanically harvested and reduce labour costs (increased profits). This should be reversed, or better, dry land grain crops introduced.<br><br>The Sacramento Valley will remain agriculturally viable in all but the worst droughts. The Sierra are some of the highest mountains in the lower 48, and intercept any moisture coming their way and divert it to the Central Valley; that's why Nevada is so dry. Like many civilizational problems, there are good technical and behavioral solutions.

I haven't read the actual laws, but the legal principle is that a rain barrel impairs the natural flow of water to those who have a legal right to the water. Rivers fed by melting snow in the mountains can run many miles across dry land, and no one is allowed to dam them. And, in a legal sense, a rain barrel is just another dam. <br><br>Here's a discussion of the issue in Washington state: http://daily.sightline.org/2011/07/14/legalizing-it-your-rain-barrel/<br><br><br><a href=#c8555535581176448597 title="comment permalink">3/29/15, 4:50 PM</a><br><br>

It does so while employing less than 4% of the work force in the state.”<br><br>I think this is an important fact. Back in 2008 I found USDA data for an article I wrote for ToD that contained the following ratios. [Unfortunately the link to the original data is now broken. Even then the latest agriculture data I could find was from 2002. The dollar value of US GDP for 2002 is still available. GDP is changed since then but the ratios will not be so very different, although biofuel will now figure as a category for continent-wide numbers.]<br><br>USA, Gross domestic product (2002) was 10.98 trillion USD: Agriculture generated less than 2% GDP.<br>Quote from my USDA source “Valued at $200 billion in 2002, agriculture includes a wide range of plant and animal production systems… “ [From pie chart] slightly over half [money value] is provided by livestock, slightly less than a quarter by horticultural crops and, less than a quarter by primary production, grain and oilseed crops, Soya etc. (the remainder comes from cotton and other commodity crops).<br><br>Note that ‘primary production’ crops provide almost all the base of calories and protein that the US population depends on. For example, little of the meat you eat has obtained most or any of its calories and protein directly from grass/herbage. A significant proportion of grain and Soya is fed to livestock or exported. <br><br>The ‘inverted pyramid’ that is the US food system explains in part why gardening to obtain high-nutrition fruit and vegetables can make a difference to the family health (and budget) especially in transitional arrangements when money income is both low and precarious and food stores provide poor nutrition. (Check out health statistics for ‘First Nation’ enclaves across N America – they are very poor. Official handouts of food prevent starvation but promote ill-health.) This ‘inverted pyramid’ incidentally explains much of the “10 calories of fossil fuel needed for every calorie you eat”. True for USA, but a much more favourable ratio in much of the world.<br><br>Similarly and not unconnected, the ‘inverted pyramid’ for food has its much larger economic brother in the GDP family, i.e. fossil fuel, and in particular petroleum. Nate Hagens has a good video lecture on this latter point: see the little yellow chart 17 minutes into his long lecture, and see what happens when the cost at the base of the inverted fuel pyramid raises say from 5% to 10% of GDP.

Even still they have plenty of choices: Use less, get water from elsewhere, build a desalination plant, encourage rainwater collection in urban areas. etc...

Just sayin...<br><br>I'm not so sanguine, because I reckon admission of the problem is a good step in the right direction. The powers that be here built a massive desalination plant and I'll tell ya, it cost a whole lot of cash. How are the finances going in California? Could they afford that infrastructure - it was in the billions here? And I'll tell ya what, that plant uses a whole lot of electricity.<br><br>Absolutely correct, no one really knows, but where do the migrating people go and how do they get there during a recession? Those are tough questions.<br><br>Hi Glenn,<br><br>Streams do not necessarily make it to the ocean. They may on your island, but if they are held for farm dams or over extracted they may just peter out before they even reach the ocean. During the last drought here the mighty Murray River did not even make it to the lakes at the end of its run before it hit the ocean and they turned very saline...<br><br>Well it also depends on the varieties of trees that they plant and the shading of those trees. Agriculture tends to get a bit frightened by a 20 foot tall lemon tree as they are hard to pick from, so they deliberately stunt their growth. However, too little shading and the trees let too much light onto the ground which increases soil temperatures and evaporation. That also leads to decreased future rainfall. Trees with too small a root stock are also a drama as they can't tap into natural ground water sources and constantly require watering during extreme weather – unless they’re deliberately stressed which drops fruit yields to nothing. You don't see grafted trees in a natural forest, you know. Just sayin...<br><br>Imagine if I said to you that you had to swap wheat for millet? What would be your response?<br><br>Hi nuku,<br><br>Laws are only effective if they can be enforced. Who is going to know if you have a rain water tank in your backyard and very few farmers collect water from urban runoff. That law sounds completely silly to me and there would be a riot here if that was attempted. There is no town water supply where I live anyway and never will be. Australia has a culture of backyard rain water tanks so it has been long established. I remember as a lad they tried to ban rain water tanks but it wasn't very successful.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c8244848400443458030 title="comment permalink">3/30/15, 3:21 AM</a><br><br>

Only 50% is impounded behind various dams to start with. Yes, the Sacramento, the Eel, the Russian, the Napa the Trinity &amp; etc. still flow into the sea. Now, the Colorado, which meanders through and forms the borders of, many states and finishes through Baha California in Mexico is indeed overdrawn at all levels and does not usually reach the sea.

I have to say, that for me, the south comes in 3rd. Perhaps it is just what you get used to in your formative years, but I like being able to speak direct and to the point, meaning what I say and saying what I mean, getting responses and answers that are in the ballpark of reality. Of course, there are great people everywhere, but I did find it frustrating how difficult it is to engage southerners in conversations about anything that really matters, (and I admit that I am far more philosophical than most people) and also found them nearly impossible to make friends with. In my more critical moments I started to wonder if it wasn't so much that it was difficult to get to the real person beneath the surface but that surface was all they got. All of that is something of an exaggeration, as there were exceptions to all this, but neither is it true that northerners are strident all the time.

Of course, many Californians moved to other western states rather than moving back East (out of the frying pan, into the fire, particularly for other arid states) It's not going to be pretty anyway you slice it, eventually, they'll have to start fighting over water.

I hope that rant made you feel better. I know it got me thinking. I greatly respect your personal experience carefully conserving water while growing food on a homesteading scale in a very challenging environment, but I think you've got the shoe on the wrong foot with regard to both the seriousness of the drought in CA and its importance to readers of this blog. I did some research to get some references for the scale of the problem, but am suffering great frustration with properly inserting the links with my ancient tablet, so I apologize for my sloppiness here, but:<br>According to a California Agricultural Statistics review (easily googled), this state produces 95 % of all the processing tomatoes grown in the US, 94 % of the broccoli, 99 % of the almonds and walnuts, 95 percent of the garlic, 94 % of the processing strawberries, similarly high percentages of many stone fruits, nuts, and other veggies...The list goes on. I think people in this country might notice if these became unavailable or soared in price, not to mention our export partners. This is also not to mention the grain and alfalfa that is grown here to feed animals, which we also tend to like to eat. A recent slate.com article, titled "The C-free Diet", concurs, sharing an analysis that if the drought becomes more catastrophic than it already is, our American diet is likely to become even more "expensive and grainy" than it already is. Worse, young and poor people tend to disproportionately eat fewer fresh foods when they go up in price, further weakening our most vulnerable.<br><br>Ok, so CA agriculture tends to be pretty important to people in the US, at least those who like to eat. So we better get on that water conservation, right? Well... According to the UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences (Go Aggies!), which has a California Water Blog with a post entitled "Challenging Myth and Mirage in California's Drought", Australians do the best job of any prosperous economy with a dry climate in urban water conservation. Well done, you guys! If we did a similarly brilliant job here in CA, we would accomplish a net water savings equal to...6% of our agricultural water use. Hrrmmm. We're going to need a lot of water barrels... Agriculture consumes 80% of the developed water sources in the state. So we're not just talking about a few dead azaleas here, we are talking about serious threat to the diets, or at the very least the food budgets, of tens, maybe hundreds, of millions of people, which is not likely to be addressed successfully with shorter showers. Many farmers are getting zero water from their irrigation districts this year (no snowmelt from the bare mountains), leading them to pump instead from aquifers which are rapidly depleting. The ground is literally sinking in many places in the Central Valley as we suck the underground lakes and rivers dry. The same UCD water blog I cited above, claims that the only way to achieve a really meaningful amount of "net new water" for the state is to fallow several million acres of farmland, which well may happen soon as market forces do what they do.<br><br>Yes, individual conservation action is absolutely a moral imperative and almost all of us have a long way to go with it, but it's not more than a drop in the bucket (sorry, couldn't resist) with regard to the scale of the problem. I don't think anyone here is claiming that this crazy industrial ag system is a good idea, but it's what millions of people currently depend on, and it seems to me that observing this sort of slow-motion crash is quite pertinent to the overall project of this blog. The sort of thing we all might want to get a "fracking clue" about.<br><br>But of course, that's just my perspective. (I hope this hasn't come off as a rant. I'd hate to open my mouth and put my foot in it.)<br>--Heather in CA<br><br><a href=#c5606939922329036977 title="comment permalink">3/31/15, 1:36 AM</a><br><br>

I live in SoCal and work for a state agency that manages the water quality aspect of our water supply. I have a front-row seat and am face to face with the idiocy every day. You don’t know the half of it. <br><br>I really didn’t know that much about water management when I first started back in the early 90s. But, over the years as I’ve worked in and explored the water management system, I’ve been absolutely dumbfounded at the stupidity and hubris. Infrastructure and management systems were apparently built with an East Coast climate mindset. Instead of collecting and recharging rainfall runoff, flood control and runoff systems (built mainly before environmental actions of the early 70s) were designed to send flood waters to the ocean as quickly as possible. Larger river beds and stream beds armored with concrete and fenced off. At the same time, aqueducts built to move water hundreds of miles? Yes, it boggles the mind. Conserving water and being thoughtful? “How boring and tedious is that?” Just not sexy enough, not grand enough, doesn’t provide the necessary ego boost. Conservation and mindfulness are just too unaesthetic and pedestrian (nobody walks in LA), and besides it would require people to do something other than buy and consume.<br><br>In addition, there are several powerful and influential interests (land developers, farmers, ranchers, Chambers of Commerce, and the like) that can affect local, regional, and statewide decisions. Water managers are expected to provide the water needed to support the dream, not tell users that it might be a good idea to curtail their appetites or modify operations. Managers who do make such unappealing suggestions are soon looking for employment elsewhere. It wasn’t until this last dry period that ground water pumping in the Central Valley was finally required to be monitored! Still, some things have been done to address water supply (recycling, desalting), but many of those are energy-intensive. There are conservation districts and most water agencies have some form of public education and outreach. Rain barrels, drought-tolerant vegetation, shorter showers, etc. are all encouraged, but, so far nothing with any bite regarding rationing or cutbacks. As others have pointed out, about 80% of water use in the state goes to agriculture, including a significant amount of the water-intensive sort. Gods forbid we take a longer view or consider ecological factors.<br><br>Chris, you’re talking reason and common sense, but it always comes back to people’s belief systems. Who was it that said, “you can’t reason someone out of something they weren’t reasoned into.” People didn’t come to America, and especially California, to be told “no,” to have someone talk to them about limits. What a buzzkill. They came here to hit it big, to live the high life, to have their tropical gardens and palm trees, and lush expanses of green grass…swimming pools with scantily clad people. This is the end of the rainbow and people want their pot of gold (remember, in California, gold was literally washing down out of the mountains) as promised in the advertisements. “So, don’t tell me about diminishing returns.” “Just have a positive attitude, dude. Chill. They’ll think of something.”<br><br>Sigh, what the frack, indeed. Another dry day nearer to that encounter with the brick wall.<br><br><a href=#c4993700320608787919 title="comment permalink">3/31/15, 1:46 PM</a><br><br>

Riparian rights, meaning the right to take water from a flowing stream, are strictly enforced, go with the land title, and older-established rights take precedence over younger. It's possible to buy land with a year-round stream flowing through it and have no right to use any of that water. I don't know about restrictions on collecting precipitation that falls on one's own property, but I've never heard that you can't do it at all.<br><br>What happens in my county isn't very important. There are fewer of a million of us and most of us either work somewhere else or operate dairy ranches. However, we are a leading indicator of what prosperous West Coast liberals will spend money on. <br><br>In Marin County rain barrels are for sale at big box home improvement stores. They are not big sellers. You are supposed to install low flow toilets and shower heads in housing when it's sold, but enforcement is spotty. I expect water capture and reuse to be the next big thing here. Grid-connected solar power generation and organic food are the current big things, seen everywhere and readily available from many suppliers. Our district's representative to the state Assembly listed water use and policy as one of his main interests in the biography he distributed on a recent visit to town. <br><br>Local agencies and nonprofits have begun promoting groundwater<br>recharge and flood control via permeable pavement, swales, rain gardens and greywater systems, both as voluntary retrofits and mandatory in some new construction. There is going to be tax money and ratepayer money spent to improve and expand existing reservoirs, but it has to compete with deferred maintenance on roads, bridges, and sewers, and underfunded public pension plans. <br><br>There is organized resistance to building more housing in Marin, and water shortages are both a reason and an excuse for that. My water district tried to spend money on a fossil-fueled desalination project and got a lot of pushback. Their job has an inherent conflict of interest because the more effectively they promote water conservation, the higher rates they have to charge all users.<br><br><a href=#c866929533674108696 title="comment permalink">3/31/15, 3:10 PM</a><br><br>

I was trying to make the point that the State made a deliberate choice to leave some in stream flow; they had learned something from the Colorado.<br><br>"I still don't understand how your point is relevant to the discussion about agricultural production"<br><br>I left that part out, sorry. The major Ag. corps are going to lobby to tap the remaining in stream flow rather than reduce use or crop land area. It will be a huge fight, and they have lots of political clout.

The Colorado River compact was made based on a river flow baseline from an unusually wet period of perhaps 40 or 50 years.

For extra fun, read "The Last Days of the Late, Great State of California" by Curt Gentry in 1968, it's a little dated now, but perfectly describes the state and it's influence up to the time it was published.
