<div class=MsoNormal>
Let's take a moment to recap the argument of the last two posts here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> before we follow it through to its conclusion. There are any number of ways to sort out the diversity of human social forms, but one significant division lies between those societies that don’t concentrate population, wealth, and power in urban centers, and those that do. One important difference between the societies that fall into these two categories is that urbanized societies—we may as well call these by the time-honored term “civilizations”—reliably crash and burn after a lifespan of roughly a thousand years, while societies that lack cities have no such fixed lifespans and can last for much longer without going through the cycle of rise and fall, punctuated by dark ages, that defines the history of civilizations. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably necessary to pause here and clear up what seems to be a common misunderstanding. To say that societies in the first category can last for much more than a thousand years doesn’t mean that all of them do this. I mention this because I fielded a flurry of comments from people who pointed to a few examples of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>societies without cities that collapsed in less than a millennium, and insisted that this somehow disproved my hypothesis. Not so; if everyone who takes a certain diet pill, let’s say, suffers from heart damage, the fact that some people who don’t take the diet pill suffer heart damage from other causes doesn’t absolve the diet pill of responsibility. In the same way, the fact that civilizations such as Egypt and China have managed to pull themselves together after a dark age and rebuild a new version of their former civilization doesn’t erase the fact of the collapse and the dark age that followed it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The question is why civilizations crash and burn so reliably. There are plenty of good reasons why this might happen, and it’s entirely possible that several of them are responsible; the collapse of civilization could be an overdetermined process. Like the victim in the cheap mystery novel who was shot, stabbed, strangled, clubbed over the head, and then chucked out a twentieth floor window, that is, civilizations that fall may have more causes of death than were actually necessary. The ecological costs of building and maintaining cities, for example, place much greater strains on the local environment than the less costly and concentrated settlement patterns of nonurban societies, and the rising maintenance costs of capital—the driving force behind the theory of catabolic collapse I’ve proposed elsewhere—can spin out of control much more easily in an urban setting than elsewhere. Other examples of the vulnerability of urbanized societies can easily be worked out by those who wish to do so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That said, there’s at least one other factor at work. As noted in last week’s post, civilizations by and large don’t have to be dragged down the slope of decline and fall; instead, they take that route with yells of triumph, convinced that the road to ruin will infallibly lead them to heaven on earth, and attempts to turn them aside from that trajectory typically get reactions ranging from blank incomprehension to furious anger. It’s not just the elites who fall into this sort of self-destructive groupthink, either: it’s not hard to find, in a falling civilization, people who claim to disagree with the ideology that’s driving the collapse, but people who take their disagreement to the point of making choices that differ from those of their more orthodox neighbors are much scarcer. They do exist; every civilization breeds them, but they make up a very small fraction of the population, and they generally exist on the fringes of society, despised and condemned by all those right-thinking people whose words and actions help drive the accelerating process of decline and fall. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The next question, then, is how civilizations get caught in that sort of groupthink. My proposal, as sketched out last week, is that the culprit is a rarely noticed side effect of urban life. People who live in a mostly natural environment—and by this I mean merely an environment in which most things are put there by nonhuman processes rather than by human action—have to deal constantly with the inevitable mismatches between the mental models of the universe they carry in their heads and the universe that actually surrounds them. People who live in a mostly artificial environment—an environment in which most things were made and arranged by human action—don’t have to deal with this anything like so often, because an artificial environment embodies the ideas of the people who constructed and arranged it. A natural environment therefore applies negative or, as it’s also called, corrective feedback to human models of the way things are, while an artificial environment applies positive feedback—the sort of thing people usually mean when they talk about a feedback loop. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This explains, incidentally, one of the other common differences between civilizations and other kinds of human society: the pace of change. Anthropologists not so long ago used to insist that what they liked to call “primitive societies”—that is, societies that have relatively simple technologies and no cities—were stuck in some kind of changeless stasis. That was nonsense, but the thin basis in fact that was used to justify the nonsense was simply that the pace of change in low-tech, non-urban societies, when they’re left to their own devices, tends to be fairly sedate, and usually happens over a time scale of generations. Urban societies, on the other hand, change quickly, and the pace of change tends to accelerate over time: a dead giveaway that a positive feedback loop is at work. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice that what’s fed back to the minds of civilized people by their artificial environment isn’t simply human thinking in general. It’s whatever particular set of mental models and habits of thought happen to be most popular in their civilization. Modern industrial civilization, for example, is obsessed with simplicity; our mental models and habits of thought value straight lines, simple geometrical shapes, hard boundaries, and clear distinctions. That obsession, and the models and mental habits that unfold from it, have given us an urban environment full of straight lines, simple geometrical shapes, hard boundaries, and clear distinctions—and thus reinforce our unthinking assumption that these things are normal and natural, which by and large they aren’t. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Modern industrial civilization is also obsessed with the frankly rather weird belief that growth for its own sake is a good thing. (Outside of a few specific cases, that is. I’ve wondered at times whether the deeply neurotic American attitude toward body weight comes from the conflict between current fashions in body shape and the growth-is-good mania of the rest of our culture; if bigger is better, why isn’t a big belly better than a small one?) In a modern urban American environment, it’s easy to believe that growth is good, since that claim is endlessly rehashed whenever some new megawhatsit replaces something of merely human scale, and since so many of the costs of malignant growth get hauled out of sight and dumped on somebody else. In settlement patterns that haven’t been pounded into their present shape by true believers in industrial society’s growth-for-its-own-sake ideology, people are rather more likely to grasp the meaning of the words “too much.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve used examples from our own civilization because they’re familiar, but every civilization reshapes its urban environment in the shape of its own mental models, which then reinforce those models in the minds of the people who live in that environment. As these people in turn shape that environment, the result is positive feedback: the mental models in question become more and more deeply entrenched in the built environment and thus also the collective conversation of the culture, and in both cases, they also become more elaborate and more extreme. The history of architecture in the western world over the last few centuries is a great example of this latter: over that time, buildings became ever more completely defined by straight lines, flat surfaces, simple geometries, and hard boundaries between one space and another—and it’s hardly an accident that popular culture in urban communities has simplified in much the same way over that same timespan. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One way to understand this is to see a civilization as the working out in detail of some specific set of ideas about the world. At first those ideas are as inchoate as dream-images, barely grasped even by the keenest thinkers of the time. Gradually, though, the ideas get worked out explicitly; conflicts among them are resolved or papered over in standardized ways; the original set of ideas becomes the core of a vast, ramifying architecture of thought which defines the universe to the inhabitants of that civilization. Eventually, everything in the world of human experience is assigned some place in that architecture of thought; everything that can be hammered into harmony with the core set of ideas has its place in the system, while everything that can’t gets assigned the status of superstitious nonsense, or whatever other label the civilization likes to use for the realities it denies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The further the civilization develops, though, the less it questions the validity of the basic ideas themselves, and the urban environment is a critical factor in making this happen. By limiting, as far as possible, the experiences available to influential members of society to those that fit the established architecture of thought, urban living makes it much easier to confuse mental models with the universe those models claim to describe, and that confusion is essential if enough effort, enthusiasm, and passion are to be directed toward the process of elaborating those models to their furthest possible extent. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A branch of knowledge that has to keep on going back to revisit its first principles, after all, will never get far beyond them. This is why philosophy, which is the science of first principles, doesn’t “progress” in the simpleminded sense of that word—Aristotle didn’t disprove Plato, nor did Nietzsche refute Schopenhauer, because each of these philosophers, like all others in that challenging field, returned to the realm of first principles from a different starting point and so offered a different account of the landscape. Original philosophical inquiry thus plays a very large role in the intellectual life of every civilization early in the process of urbanization, since this helps elaborate the core ideas on which the civilization builds its vision of reality; once that process is more or less complete, though, philosophy turns into a recherch<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>é</span>
intellectual specialty or gets transformed into intellectual dogma. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Cities are thus the Petri dishes in which civilizations ripen their ideas to maturity—and like Petri dishes, they do this by excluding contaminating influences. It’s easy, from the perspective of a falling civilization like ours, to see this as a dreadful mistake, a withdrawal from contact with the real world in order to pursue an abstract vision of things increasingly detached from everything else. That’s certainly one way to look at the matter, but there’s another side to it as well. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Civilizations are far and away the most spectacularly creative form of human society. Over the course of its thousand-year lifespan, the inhabitants of a civilization will create many orders of magnitude more of the products of culture—philosophical, scientific, and religious traditions, works of art and the traditions that produce and sustain them, and so on—than an equal number of people living in non-urban societies and experiencing the very sedate pace of cultural change already mentioned. To borrow a metaphor from the plant world, non-urban societies are perennials, and civilizations are showy annuals that throw all their energy into the flowering process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Having flowered, civilizations then go to seed and die, while the perennial societies flower less spectacularly and remain green thereafter. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The feedback loop described above explains both the explosive creativity of civilizations and their equally explosive downfall. It’s precisely because civilizations free themselves from the corrective feedback of nature, and divert an ever larger portion of their inhabitants’ brainpower from the uses for which human brains were originally adapted by evolution, that they generate such torrents of creativity. Equally, it’s precisely because they do these things that civilizations run off the rails into self-feeding delusion, lose the capacity to learn the lessons of failure or even notice that failure is taking place, and are destroyed by threats they’ve lost the capacity to notice, let alone overcome. Meanwhile, other kinds of human societies move sedately along their own life cycles, and their creativity and their craziness—and they have both of these, of course, just as civilizations do—are kept within bounds by the enduring negative feedback loops of nature. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Which of these two options is better? That’s a question of value, not of fact, and so it has no one answer. Facts, to return to a point made in these posts several times, belong to the senses and the intellect, and they’re objective, at least to the extent that others can say, “yes, I see it too.” Values, by contrast, are a matter of the heart and the will, and they’re subjective; to call something good or bad doesn’t state an objective fact about the thing being discussed. It always expresses a value judgment from some individual point of view. You can’t say “x is better than y,” and mean anything by it, unless you’re willing to field such questions as “better by what criteria?” and “better for whom?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Myself, I’m very fond of the benefits of civilization. I like hot running water, public libraries, the rule of law, and a great many other things that you get in civilizations and generally don’t get outside of them. Of course that preference is profoundly shaped by the fact that I grew up in a civilization; if I’d happened to be the son of yak herders in central Asia or tribal horticulturalists in upland Papua New Guinea, I might well have a different opinion—and I might also have a different opinion even if I’d grown up in this civilization but had different needs and predilections. Robert E. Howard, whose fiction launched the series of posts that finishes up this week, was a child of American civilization at its early twentieth century zenith, and he loathed civilization and all it stood for. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is one of the two reasons that I think it’s a waste of time to get into arguments over whether civilization is a good thing. The other reason is that neither my opinion nor yours, dear reader, nor the opinion of anybody else who might happen to want to fulminate on the internet about the virtues or vices of civilization, is worth two farts in an EF-5 tornado when it comes to the question of whether or not future civilizations will rise and fall on this planet after today’s industrial civilization completes the arc of its destiny. Since the basic requirements of urban life first became available not long after the end of the last ice age, civilizations have risen wherever conditions favored them, cycled through their lifespans, and fell, and new civilizations rose again in the same places if the conditions remained favorable for that process. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Until the coming of the fossil fuel age, though, civilization was a localized thing, in a double sense. On the one hand, without the revolution in transport and military technology made possible by fossil fuels, any given civilization could only maintain control over a small portion of the planet’s surface for more than a fairly short time—thus as late as 1800, when the industrial revolution was already well under way, the civilized world was still divided into separate civilizations that each pursued its own very different ideas and values. On the other hand, without the economic revolution made possible by fossil fuels, very large sections of the world were completely unsuited to civilized life, and remained outside the civilized world for all practical purposes. As late as 1800, as a result, quite a bit of the world’s land surface was still inhabited by hunter-gatherers, nomadic pastoralists, and tribal horticulturalists who owed no allegiance to any urban power and had no interest in cities and their products at all—except for the nomadic pastoralists, that is, who occasionally liked to pillage one. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The world’s fossil fuel reserves aren’t renewable on any time scale that matters to human beings. Since we’ve burnt all the easily accessible coal, oil, and natural gas on the planet, and are working our way through the stuff that’s difficult to get even with today’s baroque and energy-intensive technologies, the world’s first fossil-fueled human civilization is guaranteed to be its last as well. That means that once the deindustrial dark age ahead of us is over, and conditions favorable for the revival of civilization recur here and there on various corners of the planet, it’s a safe bet that new civilizations will build atop the ruins we’ve left for them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The energy resources they’ll have available to them, though, will be far less abundant and concentrated than the fossil fuels that gave industrial civilization its global reach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>With luck, and some hard work on the part of people living now, they may well inherit the information they need to make use of sun, wind, and other renewable energy resources in ways that the civilizations before ours didn’t know how to do. As our present-day proponents of green energy are finding out the hard way just now, though, this doesn’t amount to the kind of energy necessary to maintain our kind of civilization. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve argued elsewhere, especially in my book <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i>, that modern industrial society is simply the first, clumsiest, and most wasteful form of what might be called technic society, the subset of human societies that get a significant amount of their total energy from nonbiotic sources—that is, from something other than human and animal muscles fueled by the annual product of photosynthesis. If that turns out to be correct, future civilizations that learn to use energy sparingly may be able to accomplish some of the things that we currently do by throwing energy around with wild abandon, and they may also learn how to do remarkable things that are completely beyond our grasp today. Eventually there may be other global civilizations, following out their own unique sets of ideas about the world through the usual process of dramatic creativity followed by dramatic collapse. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s a long way off, though. As the first global civilization gives way to the first global dark age, my working guess is that civilization—that is to say, the patterns of human society necessary to support the concentration of population, wealth, and power in urban centers—is going to go away everywhere, or nearly everywhere, over the next one to three centuries. A planet hammered by climate change, strewn with chemical and radioactive poisons, and swept by mass migrations is not a safe place for cities and the other amenities of civilized life. As things calm down, say, half a millennium from now, a range of new civilizations will doubtless emerge in those parts of the planet that have suitable conditions for urban life, while human societies of other kinds will emerge everywhere else on the planet that human life is possible at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
I realize that this is not exactly a welcome prospect for those people who’ve bought into industrial civilization’s overblown idea of its own universal importance. Those who believe devoutly that our society is the cutting edge of humanity’s future, destined to march on gloriously forever to the stars, will be as little pleased by the portrait of the future I’ve painted as their equal and opposite numbers, for whom our society is the end of history and must surely be annihilated, along with all seven billion of us, by some glorious cataclysm of the sort beloved by Hollywood scriptwriters. Still, the universe is under no obligation to cater to anybody’s fantasies, you know. That’s a lesson Robert E. Howard knew well and wove into the best of his fiction, the stories of Conan among them—and it’s a lesson worth learning now, at least for those who hope to have some influence over how the future affects them, their families, and their communities, in an age of decline and fall. </div>

I hope you’re going to expand on the notion that civilizations explore an idea to the point where they’re done with it. Possibly on the other blog, following on your concept of ideas coming from the “theosphere,” which change over time?<br><br>One non-essential point I’d like to quibble with: the notion that civilizations have a thousand-year lifespan. I’ve come across some work that expands the 80-year cycle documented by Strauss and Howe to a 400 year cycle (five 80-year cycles that are distinct stages of working out an idea.) This seems to fit with the industrial revolution, the modern corporation and the integration of banking into every facet of life. If this notion holds water, there might be a larger cycle of five or seven of these 400 year cycles that is the actual life cycle of a civilization, giving a 2000 or 2800 lifespan. The latter is intriguing, since it suggests a start of our civilization with the end of the Greek Dark Ages and the founding of Rome. In other words, the Axial Age would be the start of our civilization, not the Renaissance which the 1000 year time-span suggests.<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c2327716446172157678 title="comment permalink">7/29/15, 5:41 PM</a><br><br>

I was glad to see that your use of the word "urban" was not necessarily synonymous with "city". I grew up in a rural area where civilization has grown farms to a superhuman scale and created desolate rural communities where a majority of the population now survives only with the aid of food stamps. I have met people in Detroit who, because of their daily contact with the failure of our civilization, are more in touch with realities of a human scaled natural environment than some rural dwellers who travel by car 20 miles to the nearest grocery store. For me, your use of the the words "urban" does not necessarily imply a geographic location as much as it embodies a set of values that places human simplification above the complexity of nature.<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c8357754984848281650 title="comment permalink">7/29/15, 5:51 PM</a><br><br>

Modern Western civilization picked itself up out of the dark ages in the century following 1000, so it's coming up on its millennium in the century ahead of us. Similarly, the post-Mycenean Greek dark ages ended around 600 BCE, and classical civilization ended with a bang not long after 400 CE -- I would describe Byzantium as something new, though rooted in the classical experience, and you'll notice that its history ran quite precisely from the fifth century to the fifteenth. The thousand year lifespan really does fit history better than the alternatives. <br><br>JP, of course.

It's a lot more uplifting than JMK or Cluborlov, even when it's kind of a downer. I lfind it safe to read, no racism or sexism. So thank you very much!! for all of your hard work. <br>My family and I went last weekend to Chaco Canyon, in NW New Mexico, and so I've been thinking a lot about the ends of civilizations. I wish I could talk to my family members about what is going on in our world, but they are all believers in Progress and don't see the end, even when it stares them in the face. They seem to think I am a paranoid doomsday type of person. Why save water, there's always more, why not use paper products, don't you know you have to wash dishes? Why use a clothesline, a dryer is so much more convenient. Gee, Ma, you really like to work hard, don't you Ma? Though, a funny story. Back in the 80's, when I was having my kids, I used cloth diapers and hung them on the clothesline, as we had no dryer, more due to poverty than anything else. I happened to be at a party with some kind of hipster types and they were talking about cool solar stuff so I interjected that I used a solar dryer. Wow, so cool, they said. How does it work? It's a clothesline, I said, innocently. Immediate loss of interest among the environmental hipster contingent. Wow, how could I be so uncool? The whole thing really cracked my husband and me up.<br>I see your points about those who live in cities and those who don't, and it seems to me that now all people live as if they lived in cities, even if they don't. Rural areas have been so colonized by cities. I lived in a very rural part of Ireland when I was a junior in high school, 1970-1971. It used to amaze me how unconsumeristic the people were, no one went shopping for pleasure!! My cousin there thought I was nuts because I thought it would be cool to go to Limerick sometimes. I never went, because I was 16 and didn't have transportation, but I just wanted to be in an urban environment every once in a while. I guess I liked the energy.<br>Anyway, thank you for this very special space, Mr. Archdruid Sir, I so appreciate it.<br>Eilis<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c8717521423705925885 title="comment permalink">7/29/15, 8:21 PM</a><br><br>

It was done in hopes that my sister-in-law living on her own would get some "real life" experience, find a job and learn to provide for herself. Now only four months later, my sister-in-law is moving back home and she has decided that since her mother could afford to pay for her apartment those four months, that her mother should just give my sister-in-law that money. <br><br>In the USA today, and most likely around the world, a lot of people are angry at those who take, and demand hand-outs. While I would like to think that the value system of those who demand handouts is impaired, I am inspired to think by this series of posts that it is more a product of our current civilization and being so detached from seeing the natural world.

A direct hit would have simplified a lot of complexity. <br><br>On another topic: I am slowly changing from a completely mechanized woodworking shop to a hand tool woodworking shop. I have noticed a different feeling about the wood as I work. When I run a piece of wood through the table saw (3 or 4 seconds) there is no time to notice the quality of the wood unless I hit a knot or some other large anomaly. When hand sawing and planning a similar piece most every nuance of the wood is noticeable, how the grain changes from one section to another, minute differences of hardness and the tactile hardness of the wood surface.<br><br>I would imagine the same change of the senses will occur adopting from our present life to one less complex and closer to the earth.

Modernism was explicitly and loudly devoted to an ideal of utopian progress. One of the great statements of the modernist approach to architectural design was Adolf Loos' 'Ornament and Crime,' where he writes stuff like: "the rate of cultural development is held back by those that cannot cope with the present,” and this gem: "Behold! What makes our period so important is that it is incapable of producing new ornament. We have outgrown ornament, we have struggled through to a state without ornament. Behold, the time is at hand, fulfilment awaits us. Soon the streets of the cities will glow like white walls! Like Zion, the Holy City, the capital of heaven. It is then that fulfilment will have come.”<br><br>So why was he so opposed to ornament? Well, because utopia is perfect - ideal, abstract, and, of course - etymologically speaking - no place at all. If you put ornament on your building, then it becomes something particular, something emplaced, something real; it descends from the realm of ideal forms. This is why the modernists were very big into abstract geometry (see Le Corbusier and Ozenfant's 'Purism,' for example, where they equate "purity" with geometrical abstraction and regard this as the highest aesthetic sensation).<br><br>Now compare this with the principles of traditional architecture in the West, where ornament was ubiquitous. And what form did it take? Almost always some sort of botanical form or another: the ecinthus leaves of Corinthian columns, the arboreal tracery of Gothic cathedrals. Gothic architecture in general, in fact, is absolutely reflective of the natural environment of northern Europe where it was developed. (Similarly, Islamic architecture reflects desert environment to which it is indigenous - e.g., domes that connote the vastness of the desert sky.)<br><br>So traditionally, architecture provided the very sort of stimulation which you describe as lacking in urban environments. But with Modernism, starting about 100 years ago, this knowledge has been forgotten - or discarded, perhaps. And this discarding is PRECISELY because of the progressive utopianism that came to dominate the practice. And bound up with this, too, was the metaphor of the machine. Le Corbusier famously called the house "a machine for living in."<br><br>Nowadays, architects don't know what the hell they're doing. They continue to revel in abstraction, but without any real conviction; you get the sense that they don't believe in the utopianism that motivated the modernist project in the first place, but they just don't know what else to do. Returning to the knowledge that guided builders for over two millennia, of course, is out of the question - that wouldn't be progress! And so the quality of the built environment continues to decay, a rather fitting metonym for the civilization as a whole.<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c5769871488955963692 title="comment permalink">7/29/15, 9:03 PM</a><br><br>

Your column struck a strong chord with me, especially regarding the artificial environmental in which most of us live. I recall giving a talk to a civic group on recycling some years ago and having a prominent attorney confide to me that he had never contemplated what happened to his garbage, only that "little men took it away." More recently I have struggled to convince fellow professionals of the consequences of a major mixed use development. After all, it was a "wonderful" project. Of course, the idea that such a development would merit inclusion in some regional public transit system was just "dreaming." <br><br>We cannot possibly operate this or any similar civilization on "renewable" energy, a fact I shared with a faith-based group this week. We might be able to envision an alternative future with very different land uses, development patterns, work force, and a hundred other changes, but our political leaders are instead debating Uber. I'm going to keep sharing and challenging and trusting in our younger generations to recognize the emerging realities. Meanwhile, I'll keep coming back here for the excellent wisdom you provide!<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c8280297571759151779 title="comment permalink">7/29/15, 11:27 PM</a><br><br>

This generation will optimize every aspect of the civilization... and burn it all. It will then blame the following generations for not being well off, organized, efficient, integrated as they were. It will see who come after, as they try to scrape a living and salvage something from the languishing great party, as negative souls incapable of keeping the buzz going.<br>It also seems to me that the golden age of a civilization actively favors people with narcissistic- psychopathic tendencies, like my father. They are the best in aligning to Utopia acritically and supporting it to the end with total disregard to consequences (my father for example truly hates environmentalists... While living confined at home at the center of his artificial empire). He does not see nature any more.. wants to solve a problem with pine needles blocking water by cutting the trees. There are countless examples of him and his peers creating lies and telling them to each other to collectively escape any responsibility and dumping it consistently on someone else so they can keep considering themselves "the good actually the best guys that ever lived".<br><br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c3182197451586042868 title="comment permalink">7/29/15, 11:49 PM</a><br><br>

Your articles always make me think, and I want to write it down before I get busy or forget.<br><br>Every so often a media crew shows up at my door, the rural-living foreign Shinto priestess. They want to know why I am doing this. In recent years, I've had information to share with them that I consider vital. Japan's traditions have great value, especially as we face a future with diminishing resources, and we really need at least to have people who maintain some of these traditions so that the knowledge can be shared when it becomes critical to survival. But not only that. How many people surrounded by all these fine material goods technology brought us really call themselves happy? Even if they are so thoroughly urban that they have never ever heard that there may be trouble ahead, it frequently becomes obvious even to them that wealth beyond a minimum required for health does not equate happiness. In the past, people seeking spiritual answers would go to the wilderness deliberately. Jesus is just one. In the Edo Period of Japan, there was an entire industry built up around taking city people out to Mt. Fuji for a spiritual journey, and they made little replicas of the mountain back home so they could retrace their journey in meditation. I find the Fuji-ko liturgy to be highly evocative of what I see in my frequent treks on the mountain.<br><br>That's what I kept telling anyone who approached me with a camera and notebook. But that's not what they wanted to hear. The times I've made it all the way onto TV or into magazines, it's been puff pieces, where I was said to have had a yearning for some trivial aspect of Japan. On one TV show, I was specifically asked not to talk about spirituality but to say "I liked the miki (communion)."<br><br>Just before I moved out of Tokyo, I was questioned by the Federal Security Bureau on a trip to Siberia. For the life of them, they could not see why anyone would want to come spend time in Siberia. I had to be there on some materialistic quest (and indeed there were many such people with business visas). How could I explain to someone in Siberia what it was like to live in a fantasy society, a children's storybook world, all sanitized, with no connection to the basics upon which our lives depend, where people dropped their candy wrappers on the street because the candy wrappers were "dirty" and "nature" would take care of them somehow, trusting our government to keep the supermarkets full and the lights on (if they thought about it at all), where the most loudly contested issue at the time was that the rice the government had had to import because of a weather-induced shortage did not taste as good as domestic rice. Oh, they were furious about that. <br><br>In Siberia, at that point in time, friends were looking a bit skinny. When queried, they explained, "We have enough potatoes! You don't like potatoes? Well, then you lose weight." Virtually everyone in Siberia down to the FSB officers was involved in some form of food production, usually through their family's dacha on the outskirts of cities, and at least for the potato harvest. I was in Siberia for relief. Others from Japan were too, with one friend taking troubled youths for a month in summer to give them a grounding in healthful reality and a society in which people cooperated. The Siberians, for their part, would just laugh at us. They were jealous of Japan's material success, living as closely involved with capricious nature as they were, and could not see the price that had been paid by Japan to reach its level of development.<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c5720157155438754054 title="comment permalink">7/30/15, 12:30 AM</a><br><br>

I'd just like to sketch in a few lines on the non-civilised side of human experience, as anthropologists have come rather a long way from the "stuck primitive" model, without the rest of the academy taking much notice. The first thing to say is that peoples living a materially simple lifestyle, as described by ethnographers over the past 200 years or so, were not unaware of the civilisations within a day or there's walk away. They, and their cultural forms, are more accurately understood as deliberate political/social/philosophical stances, or as well-formed "cultural refusals", than as "being stuck." As such, they are also, often, more culturally dynamic, and responsive than assumed, and the idea of their comparative cultural longevity may not be well-founded. <br><br>I'd also like to add that urban centres often have more "atomised" populations, individuals torn out of or otherwise shaken loose from family and community ties (once the defining characteristic of a slave), and I wonder if this doesn't add another layer to its peculiarities (ie, in addition to the distance from the natural world). People embedded in a web of relations are unique, non-fungible, necessary to one another... Atomised individuals in urban civilisations, so much.<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c770335125297546874 title="comment permalink">7/30/15, 12:34 AM</a><br><br>

It's easy to imagine that humanity is starting over and over from zero, but that is far from true. Nomadic tribes often produce portable art that civilized people admire: jewelry, carpets, basketry, quillwork. Also epic poetry and fable.<br><br>Let's say the beginning of the human race came with language and the control of fire, regardless of whether it was homo sapiens or one of our relatives who did that. Most of human existence to date took place in the Old Stone Age, which lasted for hundreds of thousands of years if I'm not mistaken. Horticulture and agriculture developed independently in various places two to ten thousand years ago (maybe earlier in New Guinea). Several of those places developed writing systems a few thousand years after they adopted agriculture. Dark ages by definition lose the writing, but they don't lose the knowledge of gardening and animal husbandry. Where the climate and soil allow, the resumption of city life can happen relatively quickly, if the time scale one measures by is not a single lifespan but the dozens or hundreds of generations in which technological progress seems to have consisted of fancier flint knapping, better clothing and the invention of fishnets, dugout canoes and atalatls. Not that I'm dissing better clothing and dugout canoes; they can make the difference between life and death.<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c1234055137071077994 title="comment permalink">7/30/15, 12:48 AM</a><br><br>

I take walks along fields filled with sheep and long windy beaches and nature reserves. This is quieting for the soul of a busy urbanite. I fiind time to develop new hobbies in listening to music or get closer to my family,otherwise hectically involved in urban life and entertainment, work schedules. We all live in our own little worlds(not like a family farm). In an urban industrialized environment relationships are atomized, our soul becomes alienated from each other and from itself. Since twenty years starting due to office stress I have developed routine of balancing myself through yoga, tai chi, esoteric sciences like astrological psychology, nutrition, etc. The human body is the last remaining natural environment in the urban setting where one can stop the positive feedback loop of the industrial ideology. The techniques for this were created in the ancient civilizations, by gurus, monks, hiding in forest ashrams and monasteries from the city. A city person does well to apply such techniques to remain part of his or her own nature and to understand other human beings in their essence, as only natural environmental component left. As well as music, literature, history, poetry I research internet blogs discussions to discover what other people in my age and situation have experienced emotionally and done about it. This is helpful like global village idea. Everyone has similar experiences.Alienation is reduced. I was researching heart chakra yesterday and talk about relationships and discovered highheart or thymus chakra between heart and throat chakras, which concentrating upon in the course of day and night I felt very strongly. This is supposed to regulate nexus between pure feeling in heart and communication in throat, giving a person a personal concept ofmeaning in life or intent. Every topic, including esoteric development gets boring after 20 years, but I never seem to stop learning about my internal nature.

You mention that some commenters gave examples of non-civilisations which did not last for a millennium, and I suspect that many of these fall into the same category as those civilisations, such as those of the Aztecs and Incas, which had a strikingly shorter lifespan - societies whose trajectory was cut short by clear external causes. On the other hand, the thousand-year cycle may not be the longest one in play; the histories of Egypt and China and our own connections to classical Greece and Rome may suggest something about chronological *families* of civilisations. Or perhaps not; beyond the thousand-year mark everything might settle down into a more linear pattern. (By linear I don't mean to imply any kind of direction, except through time, only that we wouldn't expect to see any larger repeats than already discussed and the histories of individual societies will be largely contingent on their own particular circumstances and inheritance from those before.) We only have the Holocene to go on, so it's hard to tell.<br><br>There's another, simpler explanation for the mental and cultural blindness to the frailties inherent in civilisation - not that the two are mutually exclusive - which is that generals are always fighting the last war, and people tend to stick to behaviour that has served them well in the past. That serves for modes of thought as well as actions. In an overarching sense, the consistent technological and economic expansion over the past two hundred years has negated the need to figure out *why* growth happens - so people not only fail to understand it, but fail to grasp that it requires an explanation. Hence the conviction that growth will soon return. (Cultures, like natural selection, have a bad habit of making predictions only on the basis of most recent events.) On an individual level, meanwhile, though it may look suicidal from the perspective of people who read the Archdruid Report, for as long as civilisation does exist the people arguing about iThing Six vs iThing Ninety-Two might well be acting in the most adaptive way available to them - until it's not.<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c8533127662030510844 title="comment permalink">7/30/15, 3:15 AM</a><br><br>

I've also noticed a schizophrenic tendency in our history that lauds and romanticizes wild nature (as well as Indigenous people) but at the same time is determined to wipe them out. The problem is that Native Americans refused to die like they were supposed to. They continue to survive, on the rez or on the fringes of urban society. And they are still despised, while their ancestors are celebrated and praised. There have also been counter cultures throughout our history (the back to the land movement in the 70s is just one of them) who abandoned much of the dominant culture's wasteful practices and "went native". These too have been vilified, ridiculed, and sometimes eliminated (like some of the boathouse communities on the Mississippi River near where I live).

The example of Rome indicates that urban life can transmogrify in a zombie fashion. Rome never became a ghost town, and it never even shrank into a single village. Rather, it became a town (perhaps poorly integrated, under the aspect of a mosaic of contiguous villages), of a distinctively sick sort, with a population in Carolingian times of 20,000 or 30,000. (On the eve of the 410 A.D. sacking - the first of three big sackings - the population had been something like 700,000 or 900,000. The high civilizations of Athens and Florence were in cities of this same, Roman-dark-age, 20,000-or-30,000-inhabitant, scale. But the difference between classical Athens, or Renaissance Florence, and 8th-century Rome is radical, the comparable population sizes notwithstanding.) <br><br>When I say "distinctively sick", I have in mind the fact that the Forum was eventually pillaged by local people for its stone. It was not the Goths or Huns who reduced the Forum to its current half-dismantled condition, but locals - people who spoke a kind of Latin, and were duly mindful of ecclesial-cum-civil authority, but were indifferent to their civic heritage. We have here a culture which lives in a built environment and yet is a kind of "living dead": an uncivic zombie of a city, exploiting the mere material accoutrements of a now-departed civilization. <br><br>The fate of the Forum contrasts with the fate of the Athenian Acropolis. In Athens the Parthenon stayed intact until the 17th century, I would imagine for the bulk of this extended period because of the stabilizing influence of that new, post-Roman, civilization which was Byzantium. We indeed would have an intact Parthenon to this day, except that some 17th-century, post-Byzantine, military people used it for the storage of gunpowder. <br><br>I suppose that if our impending global Dark Age does not come on too quickly, people equipped with powerful digital computers will be able to figure out how to reassemble those scattered marble fragments on the Acropolis into the original Parthenon. It is a mere matter of jigsaw puzzle assembly, such as has in the case of the disintegrating Qumran scrolls been solved. :-) <br><br><br>Hastily, <br>now having to go back to studying maths-physics, <br><br><br>Tom <br><br>((((PS: I say "maths-physics" because my own response to the impending Dark Age<br>is to dabble a little in Latin, but more fundamentally to try to set up<br>a maths-physics tutoring business, and eventually to write some minor physics-of-radio<br>papers helpful to hams.<br><br>Tom = VA3KMZ ))))<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c299562661305533927 title="comment permalink">7/30/15, 8:56 AM</a><br><br>

I spent my childhood living with nature during my childhood in Upstate New York. My brother, mother, father, and I had a small garden in the back yard, and a free flowing creek behind the yard, so I knew where food and water came from. Then my family moved to suburban Buffalo, and later suburban Baltimore, where my experience living with nature directly conflicted with my social experience of living in American suburbia, where people thought I was crazy and had no problem with bullying me as a reminder. <br><br>I reacted to doubling down on my studies, and coming to the conclusion that suburban American culture is both scientifically and morally disgusting, a culture of insanity and slow death. So, I invested my time and energy in an effort to make urban American culture a more sustainable place. Sadly, however, when condensing my four years of living and working in Baltimore, the urban poor there are really not looking for the truth they are just living in an angry victim mentality. So no urban farms, no sustainable transit, just anger. <br><br>The anger among the inner city poor, justified or not, led to the election of a president with partial African heritage. This, in turn, caused anger among suburban whites. The leaders of these suburban whites are now governors and congress people, people who are doubling down dirty on the American suburban projects. <br><br>I am looking forward to hearing your insights on the direction of the reactionary side of the lowland East Coast of America, which is a mental and moral swamp I have watched some of my best friends get sucked into. I left that place, after seeing the writing on the wall, two years ago, and am currently completing a year of teaching English in Taiwan with less student loans and more fiat monetary savings. It is way too late for me to collapse before the masses do in America, but I want to try to do the same thing in the Philippines as I will soon be headed there to marry my girlfriend and turn her family farm into a sustainable operation. However, I know the weather there in our warming world will be more and more sweltering. I know the human population in the Philippines is multiplying more quickly than the fantasies of a Caucasian teenage suburbanite loitering and wasting away outside a gas station shop along the future Hogan-Trump-Christie Memorial "Parkway" in the "Exurban Shale Oil Acres of Ignorance" subdivision. Somehow, though, I feel more confident collapsing into an uncertain rural lifestyle on the outskirts of urbanizing Manila, and trying to make the best of it, than I do investing my confidence in places like Baltimore.<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c4224402242463300809 title="comment permalink">7/30/15, 9:31 AM</a><br><br>

I didn't comment last week because I was temporarily beyond the reach of the Internet, but this week's post has clarified your ideas and more or less reconciled me to the Cimmerian Hypothesis (or it to me).

You're probably familiar with the acronym WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, Democratic). Increasingly psychology is unveiling ways in which people in these societies differ mentally from the standard models of human cognition, to show that we are the *exception*, not the rule:<br><br><i>To highlight one domain in which American undergraduates differ from most other populations in the world consider a neutral category like visual perception. Looking at the figure below, which horizontal line, "a" or "b", would you estimate is longer?<br><br>A: &lt;----&gt; b: &gt;----&lt;<br><br>If you chose "b" than you are in line with a substantial number of Americans (both undergraduates and children) who chose the same one. In fact, both lines are identical in length. This has become known as the Müller-Lyer Illusion, named after the German psychiatrist Franz Carl Müller-Lyer who first discovered it in 1889. However, if you show the same two lines to people in many non-Western societies (particularly hunter-gatherer societies) they will be more likely to identify the two lines as identical.<br><br>Why would Americans be so susceptible to this illusion? Our environment. Most Americans are raised in a society where horizontal lines and sharp corners make up much of modern architecture. The brains of American children (and, presumably, most children in highly industrialized countries) have adapted to make optical calibrations as a result of their unique environment. The San and many other small-scale forager or horticultural societies don't grow up in a manufactured environment so their brains are unaffected by such illusions.<br><br>A similar difference can be found in what psychologists call "folkbiological reasoning." Cognitive scientists testing children drawn from U.S. urban centers (where most universities are located) have developed an influential developmental theory suggesting that there is a cognitive shift that takes place between ages 7 and 10. As Henrich and colleagues state in their paper:<br><br>"Before age 7, urban children reason about biological phenomena by analogy to, and by extension from, humans. Between ages 7 and 10, urban children undergo a conceptual shift to the adult pattern of viewing humans as one animal among many."<br><br>This shift has been considered a process that all human children go through. The problem with this reasoning, Henrich points out, is that it only applies to one subset of children: those who live in urban environments. Similar cognitive tests of children in Native American communities in Wisconsin and among the Yukatek Maya communities in Mexico showed none of the empirical patterns that the American urban children displayed. The answer, of course, is that urban children grow up in an impoverished environment where they will rarely, if ever, interact with animals other than humans (with the occasional dog or cat kept as a pet). This is a very different environment from many non-Western societies, and certainly from the one our remote ancestors lived in.</i><br><br>http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/primate-diaries/the-weird-evolution-of-human-psychology/<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c6472223460642252196 title="comment permalink">7/30/15, 11:22 AM</a><br><br>

Howard's fiction is particularly apropos for a blog dedicated to the proposition that oil production will peak and lead to a downfall of industrial civilization. From Howard's Wikipedia page:<br><br><i>The oil boom in Texas was "one of the most powerful influences on [Howard's] life and art", albeit one that he hated. Howard grew to despise the oil industry along with everyone and everything associated with it. The oil boom heavily influenced Howard's view of civilization as a constant cycle of boom and bust in the same manner as the oil industry in contemporary Texas. A town such as Cross Plains was built by pioneers. The boom brought civilization in the form of people and investment but also social breakdown. The oil people contributed little or nothing to the town in the long term and eventually left for the next oil field. This led Howard to see civilization as corrupting and society as a whole in decay.</i><br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c8153539718136660892 title="comment permalink">7/30/15, 11:41 AM</a><br><br>

An industrial culture has a steeper slope because it can draw resources from further away and so maintain higher population densities. A non-industrial culture has a gentler slope because it cannot. But both have the same (more or less straight line) downward slope to the right i.e. a few large mega cities and progressively more but smaller other population centers.<br><br>Concerning quality of life and city size: determining “quality of life” involves a value judgment and so is a divergent problem with no absolute solution. That said, the amenities a large city offers over a smaller city increase rather slowly with population size (if I remember correctly about 15% increase for every doubling of population). So even with no change in the future, a moderately sized city or large town is all one really needs to take advantage of what civilization has to offer and avoid most of the immediate its problems.<br><br>As overall population decreases due to less energy being available to feed everyone, we should expect the slope of the population density curve to decrease and eventually revert to something closer to a typical non-industrial civilization profile. The right end of the curve is more fixed than the left however. Rural areas can become less populated, but the possible drop in absolute terms is much less than on the left (large cities) for the simple reason that there are already fewer people in rural areas by definition.<br><br>The conclusion is that its is the biggest population centers that will likely depopulate quickest. Rapid change generally involves more hardship. Given its the large population centers that will see the most change; they are not the optimal place to be. On the other hand, going from having a few neighbours to none out in your rural doom-stead would be pretty traumatic too. <br><br>I'm thinking the sweet spot, to take advantage of the many remaining advantages of civilization in the short term, is probably some place well above (current) sea level, within the orbit (by rail or water) of a small city or large town. I think this is what JMG implied in his 2007 essay. Whether rural is better than urban in this context is another matter. <br><br>I'm guessing any apparent contradiction between this week's essay and that of 2007 essay is the result of the time frame. The last few essays have addressed, among other things, the fact that in the long run most cities are doomed to be a lot smaller or even cease to exist entirely. In the short run (our lifetimes), only some of the contraction in population will take place. The 2007 essay addressed strategies people tend to assume will be good for this short term. JMG conclusion was that remote doom-steads are not necessarily a great idea. <br><br>The fact that cities will disappear as such in the long term does not contradict the suggestion that living in or near smaller cities or larger towns is a good strategy in the short term (meaning most if not all of the rest of one's life).<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c1025770807838561575 title="comment permalink">7/30/15, 3:14 PM</a><br><br>

Their civilization collapsed largely because of that. I doubt there was much voluntary about it. There is also clear evidence of mass starvation, internal warfare and large scale human sacrifice and cannibalism during the last days of the Anasazi.<br><br>Your comment reminds me of some of the recent revisionism about the Mayans, especially The "Maya Forest Garden" by Anabel Ford and Ronald Nigh, which claims the Mayan civilization didn't really collapse, the people simply developed a sudden passion for voluntary simplicity and voluntarily left the cities to return to a state of nature. In reality, as the Archdruid has pointed out, there is evidence of mass starvation, extreme malnutrition, political infighting, revolts by the masses, large scale warfare and massive ecological degradation which accompanied the collapse of the classical Mayan civilization.<br><br>To me, your comment about the Anazasi and Ford and Nigh's claim that the Mayan civilization didn't really collapse seem more like a classic case of projection by middle class Western liberals, who see peoples like the Mayans and Anazasi as acting out their fantasy scenario that the people of our civilization will suddenly become enlightened and adopt voluntary simplicity en masse.

I enjoy cities, I enjoy rural areas, but suburbs -- gah. So I'll let less biased judges consider suburbia's virtues and vices!

The hatred of beauty that pervades modern life is on display in those buildings.<br><br>Goldmund, oh, absolutely. Americans love to romanticize the things they destroy, and lose it completely when something that's supposedly been destroyed and so can be safely romanticized pops up again saying, "I'm not dead yet!"<br><br>Toomas, I'll keep that in mind. Time and resources permitting, I want to chase down some materials on what happens to urban centers during and after collapse, and try to integrate that into the larger model. <br><br>Christopher, one of the reasons I live up in the mountains is a desire to stay out of the lowland urban East Coast! Remember, though, that most of that area is going to become uninhabitable over the next century due to sea level rise, and even before the oceans roll in, collapsing public health and the ongoing dissolution of the rule of law will drive dramatic depopulation through outmigration and simple deaths-over-births demographics. What you saw was a temporary condition, to be followed by abandoned ruins hammered by the waves. <br><br>Pygmycory, the great majority of the 350 million will be engaged in intensive subsistence agriculture in those areas still capable of supporting it, and the conditions under which they'll be laboring will not be such as to provide the necessary surplus for large cities. Most of the rest will be in the areas that won't support field agriculture, supporting themselves as nomadic pastoralists, tribal horticulturalists, or hunter-gatherers, which don't produce such surpluses either. Dark age societies generally abandon the urban form completely as economically unsustainable -- in fact, many dark age kings traveled from place to place so that the economic burden of the court wasn't placed on just one region.<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c2167314235949955368 title="comment permalink">7/30/15, 5:23 PM</a><br><br>

His book <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction rel=nofollow>”A Pattern Language”</a> is one of the great classics of architecture and has influenced a great many other fields, from computer software design to ecology.

So, I suppose the answer to the poorly-formed question that sparked in my mind two weeks ago, viz., why we keep repeatedly creating civilizations when our most basic and reliable mode of existence is small settlements and tribes, would be that the very thought process that induces a tribal culture to start along the urban path precludes any sort of ideological governor-mechanism that would prevent eventual expansion to full urbanization and subsequent collapse.<br>Crossing the threshold from small settlements to towns inevitably leads to cities thence to urban centres seems to create that increased complexity which gives rise to increased opportunities for individual expression and a sense of freedom, or at least the sense of potential, for the individual.<br>Were I living in a Saxon village, in a life tightly bounded by law and social factors, there are a very limited number of potential speciality jobs to be done and very little leeway for exploration and very little exposure to new sources of inspiration. But with increased population and increased concentration, formerly part-time jobs, for instance, making boots, become full-time occupations, and thus the number of specific, specialized occupations rises. Moreover, those occupations produce more comfortable standards of living, along with status of achievement, and intellectual challenges. Concomittantly, the apex jobs, at the top of the social pyramid, become more expansive, requiring ever more assistants, which gives rise to more opportunities for individuals, so a relatively simple government structure under William I, becomes significantly more complex by the time of Henry VIII.<br>Life gets more interesting and the possibilities beckon.<br>Seductive; a devil's bargain, since, even as these individual possibilites open up, they close off the means by which disaster may be averted.<br>Your observation about architecture took me a moment... then I realized from archeology that Vikings, for example, did most of their work in bays in the living quarters of the longhouse, all together, sharing space and time. 500 years later, all these jobs were separated into different workshops, and within different workshops, different tasks were separated into separate rooms. Today, a huge number of us work in a hypercomplex world of individual cubicles with only virtual connections and this is presented as the only jobs worth having.<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c442277715386710026 title="comment permalink">7/30/15, 6:18 PM</a><br><br>

Religion, say: If you live near a majestic inaccessible mountain shrouded in clouds and mist, your gods may well be there. If you’re in the desert and the law of the land is a brutal survival exercise in which you need the strong tribal chieftain to secure food and water, then your god is harsh, merciless and patriarchal. If you’re in low, verdant, fertile land with abundant water, then your gods dwell in a forest, or in an oak tree, or with the river nixies. If you worship the divine in nature, then your religious temples are of nature. Later your mental constructs make an appearance and you achieve a degree of separation and your temples become about shifting stones or piling up boulders to build a mound, but still roofless, open. As you hunker down and separate further, the temples become enclosed, roofed, more ‘artificial’. On a somewhat flippant side note, always found it ironic that the sky-god daddy religions went for dark temples where you couldn’t actually see the sky. <br><br>I can see the stone circles and other European megaliths surviving another few centuries, and then a few more (although, granted, some of Britain’s will likely be submerged).

Civilization is so new that it may just be a matter of working the bugs out -- just as the tendency of early agrarian societies to strip their topsoil and perish has been gradually being countered by good agricultural techniques (or was being so until the coming of fossil-fueled agriculture), the tendency of civilizations to crash and burn may be amenable to some kind of eventual fix.

The physical sky is a distraction if you're worshipping an abstract deity like those of the Middle Eastern monotheisms; you only want access to the sky if your sky god is still rooted in nature, the way (say) Zeus is.

In my opinion, the machine-age aesthetic caught on because less hand craft, more machine craft, and the reduction in costs therefrom appealed to the people financing the buildings. There was a sort of natural selection, if you will, favoring architects that could make elegant buildings without employing legions of highly-skilled, methodical, union tradesmen. The problem of course, is that few architects can make the spare international style, modernism, or post-modernism actually look good. When executed by lesser talents, classical beaux-arts buildings may be awkward, but the detailing is still good. In the hands of lesser architects, modernism just looks drab and the detailing makes you want to steer clear lest you tear skin or clothing. But now very few clients want to pay for well-detailed buildings, and the craftsmen have died off and been largely replaced by assemblers. <br><br>When I went to Barcelona, there were avenue after avenue of gorgeous row houses in the 19th century section. Some of them were fairly sober historical styles, but many were playful designs in what they called the Catalonian modernista movement, and the best of those were by Gaudi. So it isn't accurate to say that no one else was doing what he did. There was a parallel Art Nouveau style practised around the world and the arts and crafts or craftsman style also took place around the same time. Look up Stickley or Greene and Greene, for examples. FL Wright's best work seems to have craftsmen elements, and his worst work seems to tend more towards international style. <br><br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c6601781767213397814 title="comment permalink">7/31/15, 4:30 AM</a><br><br>

I reckon that that country can be more resilient than others. The two factors that I see as a threat are climate change and, especially, mass migrations from countries like India or Bangladesh.

Both of those happen way too often in the esoteric scene once charters and their implied authority come into play, and I could all too easily see the same thing get under way here. I'd frankly prefer it if the Green Wizards Benevolent and Protective Association were to remain at least half a joke, a wry label used by people who would be doing the same things anyway without the framework. <br><br>Melissa, that does look good and ghastly -- and the dumbing down seems to be a popular trend also. <br><br>Mgalimba, you've brought up a very important point, and one that's probably going to be central to next week's post. What happens when the only options offered by the existing order of society are business as usual and collapse, and business as usual is unbearable and getting worse? <br><br>Cherokee, one of the things that makes barbarian warlords popular in eras of collapse is precisely that compared to the cost of supporting a sprawling imperial bureaucracy with its armies of parasitic functionaries, supporting a warlord and his court in the style to which they aspire is actually a really good bargain.<br><br>Donalfagan, oh, I know. Architects are simply one part of a dysfunctional system, and get to choose between cooperating with that system and not making a living. With regard to Gaudi, though, I didn't mean to suggest that nobody was doing the same thing back in the day; I've simply noticed that despite all the praise lavished on Sagrada Familia -- and deservedly -- how many of today's architects are borrowing ideas from it, rather than from modernism? <br><br>Patricia, funny. Me, I'd draw a hard distinction between Cthulhu and Google; I like Cthulhu because he and his minions are so overwhemingly biological, inhabiting the realm of instincts and dreams. What makes Google loathesome to me is that it reeks of the hubris of the allegedly rational conscious mind. As for Rwanda et al., well, yes, and that's likely to be part of the scenery on the way down, too. <br><br>Matthew, now there's a blast from the past. Yes, when I first broke into print I was more or less part of the Llewellyn stable of authors, and contributed to several of their annuals, before we hit a parting of the ways for a while. <br><br>Pygmycory, that's definitely a keeper. I know a woman who spent a year in a dorm designed by Walter Gropius. It was almost unlivable, and the students who had to live there agreed that Gropius should be condemned to live in one of his own buildings for all eternity. <br><br>Halfiore, that sounds like a contender. If Jim Kunstler hadn't already done the same thing, I might consider a "Really Sucky Architecture of the Month" column or something. <br><br>Varun, if charters ever come into play, I'll keep that in mind. <br><br>Sven, okay, you've just made my day. If the Archdruid Report can stand beside Conan stories as a defense against the violent absurdity of modern life, I feel that I've actually accomplished something! Hmm; I'm imagining a short story, "Conan and the Archdruid"... ;-)<br><br>Hugo, I don't know the Bhutanese situation so am not really qualified to comment. Please keep in mind that I've never lived outside of the US, and the world already has too many clueless Americans trying to tell the rest of the world what's going on.<br><br>Mick, no, there I disagree. Trying to architect (is that a verb?) a new dream is like trying to design a new tree.

So I think this needs to be turned into a cultural meme. That's what you're doing here, to be sure, but as I started to suggest last week I also think that the scientific method could be of value in that process.

The academic industry is the last place that's going to embrace this sort of thinking, and the last place that would do anything constructive about it if they did embrace it.

However I am inclined to think it might not be the distortion of society’s model of the world as its fragmentation: we are all so specialised, cogs in the machine, we cannot hope to have a rounded view of the complicated world we live in. I got the impression your earlier poster “Renaissance Man” have might be grasping towards this.<br><br>You refer specifically the built environment, and how it tends to isolate us from the natural environment and shapes us for good and bad, which is something I am reasonably well read in from my training as a town planner. I think there exist plenty of templates of society that could be built to avoid this trap and disprove the hypotheses, we don't (or didn't) have to build modern comfortable societies that are destined to fail through the way you describe. Permaculture, as the name suggests, is intended to be the civilised, comfortable human habitat that addresses these problems. Earlier, Ebenezer Howards Garden Cities are a late 19th century attempt to address the problems of urbanisation and isolation from the natural environment (great idea, but of course his principles were taken outside by commercial land developers, given a good kicking, and remade as suburban sprawl). Anyone interested in permaculture should read Garden Cities of Tomorrow - a peaceful path to reform, this guy had it sussed.<br><br>I was once watching a programme about the alleged settlement that existed in pre columbian amazon basin (their enduring legacy is a soil called terra preta (black earth), containing char and other improvers, much more fertile than the natural amazon basin soil) and an ariel photo was overlaid with a plan of how archeologists thought the settlement was laid out across the landscape. It consisted of modest clusters linked by roads. I nearly dropped my tea because it looked just like a garden city. If it hadn't been for European diseases then maybe this pattern (human ecology to borrow the term from this blog) would have survived long enough to be documented for future reference before, doubtless, modern commercialism knocked it on the head.<br><br>Which leads me to wonder, would a civilised (ecotechnic, to borrow your term) society at peace with itself and the ecology, and don’t bring about their own collapse, always fall prey to a more aggressive society not constrained by considerations long term viability and hence prove the hypothesis correct?<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c4846950587492414563 title="comment permalink">7/31/15, 11:56 PM</a><br><br>

I thumb through the recent pages and find this choice quote which pretty much defines Howard's thoughts on the matter which finds its expression in the fictional voice of Conan:<br><br>"You sit on satin and guzzle wine the people sweat for, and talk of divine rights of sovereignty - bah! I climbed out of the abyss of naked barbarism to the throne and in that climb I spilt my blood as freely as I spilt that of others. If either of us has the right to rule men, by Crom, it is I! How have you proved yourself my superior?<br><br>I found Aquilonia in the grip of a pig like you - one who traced his genealogy for a thousand years. The land was torn with the wars of the barons, and the people cried out under suppression and taxation. Today, no Aquilonian noble dares maltreat the humblest of my subjects, and the taxes of the people are lighter than anywhere else in the world."<br><br>Incidentally, Conan was at that point in the story held in chains by rival kings and a sorcerer to boot! By Crom, he's got some fighting spirit that character!<br><br>On an interesting side note there has been an federal politician down under embroiled in an expense claim scandal whom amongst a few similar abuses chartered a helicopter at $5,000 to get from one city another minor city about 70km away just to save a few minutes when the fast train to that destination would have cost under $10 and taken only a few minutes more.

I am also not Mongolian, but happens to be there on a job. A few observations: The empire of Djingis Khan was not a localized thing, it spanned an enormous land-mass, linking almost all non-American civilization in some way. Ironically, this was the result of a pastoralist culture. I am myself amazed by that, as I tend to agree with you that nomads hardly build those kinds of civilizations - and ultimately the Mongols were assimilate by the Chinese subjects instead of the other way round. Mongolia shows a lot of examples of what happens when a civilizations collapses. It was part of the Soviet Empire and in agriculture they had mega-farms with fairly intensive production. At the time of my visit, I see remnants of Holstein cows in the nomads´herds, and all the fancy breed from the Soviet times have been mixed into a hardy local bread. Interestingly, the supposedly traditional herders I visited last night were less than traditional than I believed. Both man and wife were born herders, but had lived in the city and worked, she as a dressmaker and he as a driver (incidentally he was also a colleague of you of sorts, a shaman). But at retirement they took up herding instead. People seem to be able to move in and out of the civilization to some extent. Meanwhile, I am aware of that those moving out of the prevailing civilization are often strongly dependent on it, or on the scraps of it.<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c2931401581472172711 title="comment permalink">8/1/15, 5:39 AM</a><br><br>

The reason modern architects usually place their square cement cracker boxes in the midst of a gorgeous and purely natural setting is the sharp juxtaposition of the absolute natural and absolute artificial. The balance has to be right, the placement of the box or boxes within and next to the natural feature, (tree, waterfall, desert expanse, sky expanse, what-have-you). As a purely visual piece, (It's subjective, yes) I personally love them when they're well thought out and well executed. There is no ornament, because the surrounding nature is the ornament. These buildings don't work at all in an urban or suburban environment. Even when they are plopped down in a suburb, they're ferociously covered with trees and bushes to try and capture that juxtaposition again.<br><br>I think this aesthetic is not meant to be as permanent a structure as ancient buildings were meant to be. The point is not to last for eternity, but to capitalize on the present, (in terms of a building that would be a few generations, no?) I don't think they build them to last forever to make their mark (like a tom cat!) on history, but to please the current population. <br>So the idea of a building's longevity is also a subjective goal. <br><br>The architects were probably also just having a bit of a play with the cool new materials they could use, that their forbearers couldn't. And just like fashion, we get bored of old looks and we tend to like shiny new things.<br><br>No defense for a buildings lack of function or unliveability; OK, other than, well, how functional or livable do you need it to be? I got my undergrad degree at ASU, in theatre design, and so: spent all of my class time in Frank Lloyd Wright buildings which are like Dr. Seuss drawings, very cool to look at, against the desert backdrop, but ALL suffer from functional problems. 'Epic Fail!'. OTOH: we got our work done, life went on. They could have been more functional, but were probably at least as functional as a Hobbit House, probably more so, and not THAT much worse than a standard box-shaped classical building. The trade-off was living with the 'Art' of the building. Of course, like every other student, I complained but honestly, for me it was worth it. For someone who didn't care about art, or just didn't like that style, it probably wasn't. <br><br><br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c4568560604124686866 title="comment permalink">8/1/15, 10:18 AM</a><br><br>

I love that it's playful and weird. It plays with our expectations of scale. A crumple of aluminum foil or a warped tin box is not new or exciting to us, but a GIANT building of one is. I wouldn't argue that this playful, weird architecture is worth the time, energy or resources it took to build it, maybe yes, maybe no, but I still find them fascinating to look at. Playing with scale, as an artist has always held a fascination for me, like a warping of reality, a doorway to another more magical world. The artificial boxes juxtaposed in wild nature is, for me, another doorway. <br><br>Of course, (maybe it doesn't even have to be said), as with any artwork - when it is being watered down the 2nd, 3rd, or thousandth time, by a commercial designer only out to make money - it's a sad, pale image and it doesn't really count as 'art' (so, IMHO, not really worthy to be a part of the discussion)- any more than a Walmart knock-off of a Macy's knock-off of a Zara knock-off of an Alexander McQueen dress isn't really 'art'. I know: It's subjective, but arguably, the original McQueen IS art, the Walmart version would not be considered so by anyone - even by the designer who was tasked with translating it for mass market. <br><br>Oops, running out of battery, gotta sign off.

No-one has succeeded in growing it anywhere else in the world, for reasons unknown. And now the changing climate is threatening its very existence.

Now I don't use a whole lot of electrical energy here because those sorts of days can be common and are due to very heavy cloud and rain. With 23 panels installed (and there is no limit to the amount of panels that you can install with an off grid solar power system - unlike grid connect systems) you can quickly see that I would require 10 times those 23 panels just to make 3.75kWh. Thats 230 panels that is! It is not cost effective.<br><br>All I'm saying, is that if you are gambling your future on solar power you should be deeply afraid. Just sayin...

It seems that one of the major problems which faces all societies is that there members have free will. For example the people who make up a society all have the capacity to choose to leave that society, whether it be because of a slight, ambition, lack of interest, etc. For this reason I would argue that any successful society must find a method of ensuring that it's members use their will in only a limited way, E.G. not to leave the society, not to subvert the institutions of the society, etc. The methods to do this can be coercive, or remunerative. I would argue that this necessity often leads to a situation where a large societies needs to change course, but there is no consensus amongst the members of the society where that course change should be. Because there is no consensus amongst the members of the society, the society finds itself in a catch 22 where it must change course, but the act of changing course will likely tear the society apart. Looking at our own global civilization if we were to acknowledge that our current economy is to large to be supported by our finite planet it is unlikely that we would have consensus on what to do, it seems more likely that people would seek to use whatever leverage they have to ensure they keep theirs, and the necessary cutbacks should be made by others. While it might be in the best interests of everyone to work together to decrease our collective footprint in an orderly way, everyone has freewill, and this means that anyone can choose to go against this to maximize there own individual benefit. I think this is why everyone keeps running towards destruction, everyone already has consensus on that course, everyone has already been trained to agree with it. Therefore as long as we keep continuing along that course the society which we depend on to live will continue to exist. This probably less of an issue for smaller societal units as it is possible to get everyone together in a single room and have them nut things out.<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c7590537549607665324 title="comment permalink">8/1/15, 7:06 PM</a><br><br>

Agrarian societies are notorious for high or very high fecundity. (That is a high fertility rate per woman. Some hunter gatherer cultures seem to manage a lower or much lower rate.) <br><br>The study that I cited of remote Buddhist communities in Ladakh suggests a potential for population increase but also records specific adaptive cultural factors other than contraception that mitigate fertility rate. These matters could be worth our consideration going forward to an Ecotechnic society, there being no Utopian prospect! Being human is always going to be hard work. <br><br>The other trick for any of us born into an agrarian society is to survive childhood, especially infancy. In Ladakh those who survived into adulthood, however, could expect quite good health– healthier probably than the typical American, being completely free of hypertension for example. And there was no evidence of malnutrition. It all seems like useful data in my opinion.<br><br>Specifically considering your point about harvest failure: regional rather than strictly local storage of 'surplus' grain - 'seven good years' and so on - does require more cultural organisation. Sometimes putting it into the hands of religious organisation (a more balanced supra-order?) seems to have helped the ups and downs. There seems to be a case for thinking about a more religious insurance obligation.

The language and ideology of our politics are models of thinking separated from feedback in the natural world. If politics is the settling of differences with words instead of other weapons, I would think politics is present in any group, including hunter-gatherers. In a politics with feedback from nature, a "conservative" would advocate preservation of our post-Ice Age environment, the status quo. A "progressive" would be able to distinguish between mere political correctness to silence dissent from the prohibition of language that only debases, inflames, spreads cruelty and undermines community. Change would never come for its own sake, any more than words for the sake of words. Change would come only because it works better.

He should indeed be sentenced to life without parole inhabiting the Caltrans District 7 building, or probably any of his other monstrosities. We were stuck in that 13-story glass cube farm with so much glare on our computer screens we had to hold up folders with one hand to shade our eyes &amp; computer screens and type with the other, while sweltering in the resulting greenhouse conditions with insufficient air conditioning. (Windows were not designed to be opened, of course, and the metal "scrim" exterior that was supposed to sense light conditions and raise/lower the cheese-grater metal panels over the windows never worked correctly.) Management insisted no window blinds could be installed as it would "impair the architectural integrity" of Mayne's design; in the first several years, frequent tours of admiring architects &amp; their students from around the world came through, disturbing our work. Any who thought to ask the inmates what we thought of the building came away with a blazing earful, and directives were sent out telling us not to speak negatively about the showcase building. Good luck with that - unionized civil servants can &amp; do speak freely, and management had to give way on installing blinds (at enormous expense) after the unions threatened legal action over the poor working conditions.<br><br>@Caryn, KL Cooke, etc. -- a couple decades back, I was looking at an early rendering in the newspaper [yes, how quaint, but even now I still subscribe to print news!] of Gehry's design for the Disney Concert hall in downtown LA.

Granted, those standards rank pretty high on the abstract, obviously. But yes, they do get born, sometimes in messy ways, mate with other abstractions (fighter jet + virtual reality), then mature, and as they come into contact with reality, they die (fighter jet), or grow old to die a slower end (augmented reality is virtual reality enjoying its stay at one of Abstractionland's luxury nursing home). They also fight together (fighter jet vs drones). There are also symbiotic relationships between abstractions : the tension between fighter jet and drone strike is what keeps the abstraction of air strike alive.

I even have a title. "The Price of WOW". So much of what we deal with day-to-day has so little to do with the actual utility of things. Example: a man's watch. Since men are not supposed to wear a lot of jewelry and are pretty much limited to classic styles of clothing, the watch is considered the primary way to show (real or supposed) success, wealth status and taste. I wear a Casio, water-resistant, quartz calendar watch that retails for $15 on amazon.com. Successful people used to wear Rolexes (with oversized dials recognizable at a great distance) Recently Apple introduced it's weatch, having many functions (although you can't read your email...yet) for anywhere up to $10,000. for the gold version. Is it 900 times better? The same illustrations can be applied to clothing (Armani!), cars (Aston Martin DB 10!), champagne (Cristal!) and even buildings (Gehry! or Trump!). Indeed, in architecture the need for WOW has exceeded the need for the normal functioning of a building (keep the rain out, keep occupants heated or cooled). Naomi Klien has written some great stuff about corporations creating a brand as a cocoon to purvey various comodities. Here is a real aburdity for you. I know a man who is hired by people in the Bay Area that own exotic cars, to drive them (once they are equipped with kots of cameras) to their limit. So not only does the owner have a car that is not suited for the city, but has video proof of how "badass" his car is (without him driving it).<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c5710560417793584877 title="comment permalink">8/3/15, 1:14 PM</a><br><br>

Wrong.<br><br>To lend support to the above joke, in this particular instance I must quote Professor Irving Fisher who trying to explain away his complete lack of prescience in relation to predicting the stock market crash and beginning of the Great Depression in 1929. Apparently in November 1929 he suggested that the whole thing had been irrational and hence beyond prediction. Do you reckon that suggestion was an act of sophistry? Dunno. Maybe the study of economics is not really about people at all – who are quite often irrational? Again, dunno.<br><br>Anyway, moving along to the present day and I noted an article in the paper this weekend: <a href=http://www.smh.com.au/business/comment-and-analysis/economics-feeling-the-bite-of-declining-demand-20150731-giom8v.html rel=nofollow>Economics feeling the bite of declining demand</a>.<br><br>My favourite quote from the article: "It's likely the subject is perceived by students as more intellectually demanding, with less well-prepared students preferring business studies". That comes across as sour grapes. The author makes a number of good arguments about declining student numbers for economic studies at universities, but one thing I read about years ago in relation to marketing and I've never seen a good reason to doubt this maxim:<br><br>- Whatever you do, do not rubbish the opposition as it only brings attention to them as a potential and viable alternative, especially when things are not looking good for you.<br><br>I thought that you may find the article to be a very useful data point. <br><br>Also, I'm mildly surprised that the author of the article - whom I usually enjoy - may not have considered the aspect of economic feasibility in relation to the economics profession itself? Just sayin, but I try hard not to put my customers out of business as that is bad for my own business.<br><br>Very interesting times.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c4282982721513039399 title="comment permalink">8/3/15, 4:46 PM</a><br><br>

Awwwe! I like that Disney Concert Hall! It reminds me of 'Fantasia' &amp; 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice', when the brooms dance around. The real test IMHO, however would be: Are those curved walls applied strategically to produce pitch-perfect acoustics for the music being played inside? (I've never been inside or attended a concert there, so I don't know); Or do they fight the function? Did the sound engineers have to 'fight' the form with tons of interior buffers and walls to get the acoustics good enough? <br><br>&amp; yeah, I'm not a fan of Thomas Mayne. Aesthetically, IMHO, those are by and large: "Broken" indeed. It sounds from your experience with the Caltrans D-7 building, it is broken in more than just aesthetics; Quite a different thing than my minor inconveniences with the Frank Lloyd Wright buildings, (in point of fact, his music buildings at ASU do have pitch perfect acoustics from every single seat in the houses, no costume or wardrobe spaces, which is kind of a 'fail' for a theatre, but great acoustics).<br><br>@Bob Peterson: Thank You for mentioning Naomi Klein's economic explanations in 'The Shock Doctrine'. Another book I found even more explanatory was John Perkins' "Confessions Of An Economic Hit Man". A lot of people don't like this book because he's not a good guy. He's one of the baddies who helped scalp developing countries and expand US hegemony; but his explanation of how the whole IMF, World Bank shell-game has been played again and again is well, TOO plausible to ignore and very, very clear.<br><br>In terms of the "WOW!" factor in Architecture: I think architecture is also an art form, so I don't see a problem with it, unless, it sacrifices it's function beyond minor inconveniences - like GreenGoth's experiences with the Caltrans Building. I do see how, as per the discussions and knowledge of this forum, the State we are in, it can be a debilitating waste of resources which few entities can really afford now. A "WOW" factor is by it's nature ephemeral. So, it's questionable how wise it is to invest the massive sums needed into designing, engineering and erecting an actual public hall or even a private home built for that passing fancy.<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c296013093864563627 title="comment permalink">8/4/15, 12:08 AM</a><br><br>

They receive visitors for trade or diplomacy and sometimes those visitors write accounts of their travels. IIRC, we have an account of a Viking funeral from a Muslim writer. It's pretty rare for another literate traveler to visit the same area centuries later and for both accounts to survive, so additional data are required to establish cultural continuity. <br><br>Other information on non-literate societies before modern times mostly comes from archaeology, and archaeology is full of inference from the material culture to the nonmaterial. However, religious stability is a good indicator of general social stability. Many religions generate recognizable artifacts such as continuity in burial practices, consistent iconography, or ongoing use of a religious site without major modifications. There are other cultural indicators in the artifacts, such as domestic architecture, which gives clues about family structure and the extent of class differences. JMG isn't claiming that these societies are static and unchanging, only that they undergo major disruption less often.<br><br><a href=the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html#c1108798109991739537 title="comment permalink">8/4/15, 6:18 PM</a><br><br>
