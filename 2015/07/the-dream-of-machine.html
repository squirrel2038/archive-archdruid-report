As I type these words, it looks as though the wheels are coming off the global economy. Greece and Puerto Rico have both suspended payments on their debts, and China’s stock market, which spent the last year in a classic speculative bubble, is now in the middle of a classic speculative bust. Those of my readers who’ve read John Kenneth Galbraith’s lively history
<i>The Great Crash 1929</i> already know all about the Chinese situation, including the outcome—and since vast amounts of money from all over the world went into Chinese stocks, and most of that money is in the process of turning into twinkle dust, the impact of the crash will inevitably proliferate through the global economy. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So, in all probability, will the Greek and Puerto Rican defaults. In today’s bizarre financial world, the kind of bad debts that used to send investors backing away in a hurry attract speculators in droves, and so it turns out that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/business/dealbook/panic-among-hedge-fund-investors-in-greece.html?_r=0">some big New York hedge funds</a> are in trouble as a result of the Greek default, and <a href=http://investmentresearchdynamics.com/will-puerto-rico-cause-an-inadvertent-black-swan-derivatives-melt-down/ >some of the same firms that got into trouble with mortgage-backed securities</a> in the recent housing bubble are in the same kind of trouble over Puerto Rico’s unpayable debts. How far will the contagion spread? It’s anybody’s guess.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Oh, and on another front, <a href=https://robertscribbler.wordpress.com/2015/06/29/half-a-million-acres-burned-in-just-one-day-alaska-shatters-record-for-worst-june-wildfire-outbreak-ever/ >nearly half a million acres of Alaska burned up in a single day</a> last week—yes, the fires are still going—while <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/06/25/giant-earthquakes-are-shaking-greenland-and-scientists-just-figured-out-the-disturbing-reason-why/ >ice sheets in Greenland are collapsing</a> so frequently and forcefully that the resulting earthquakes are rattling seismographs thousands of miles away. These and other signals of a biosphere in crisis make good reminders of the fact that the current economic mess isn’t happening in a vacuum. As Ugo Bardi pointed out in <a href=http://cassandralegacy.blogspot.jp/2015/06/the-limits-to-growth-and-greece.html>a thoughtful blog post</a>, finance is the flotsam on the surface of the ocean of real exchanges of real goods and services, and the current drumbeat of financial crises are symptomatic of the real crisis—the arrival of the limits to growth that so many people have been discussing, and so many more have been trying to ignore, for the last half century or so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A great many people in the doomward end of the blogosphere are talking about what’s going on in the global economy and what’s likely to blow up next. Around the time the next round of financial explosions start shaking the world’s windows, a great many of those same people will likely be talking about what to do about it all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I don’t plan on joining them in that discussion. As blog posts here have pointed out more than once, time has to be considered when getting ready for a crisis. The industrial world would have had to start backpedaling away from the abyss decades ago in order to forestall the crisis we’re now in, and the same principle applies to individuals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The slogan “collapse now and avoid the rush!” loses most of its point, after all, when the rush is already under way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Any of my readers who are still pinning their hopes on survival ecovillages and rural doomsteads they haven’t gotten around to buying or building yet, in other words, are very likely out of luck. They, like the rest of us, will be meeting this where they are, with what they have right now. This is ironic, in that ideas that might have been worth adopting three or four years ago are just starting to get traction now. I’m thinking here particularly of <a href=http://waldenlabs.com/how-to-prepare-for-collapse/ >a recent article</a> on how to use permaculture to prepare for a difficult future, which describes the difficult future in terms that will be highly familiar to readers of this blog. More broadly, there’s a remarkable amount of common ground between that article and the themes of my book <a href="http://www.newsociety.com/affil.mvc?Affil=ARCH&amp;Page=../Books/G/Green-Wizardry">Green Wizardry</a>. The awkward fact remains that when the global banking industry shows every sign of freezing up the way it did in 2008, putting credit for land purchases out of reach of most people for years to come, the article’s advice may have come rather too late. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That doesn’t mean, of course, that my readers ought to crawl under their beds and wait for death. What we’re facing, after all, isn’t the end of the world—though it may feel like that for those who are too deeply invested, in any sense of that last word you care to use, in the existing order of industrial society. As Visigothic mommas used to remind their impatient sons, Rome wasn’t sacked in a day. The crisis ahead of us marks the end of what I’ve called abundance industrialism and the transition to scarcity industrialism, as well as the end of America’s global hegemony and the emergence of a new international order whose main beneficiary hasn’t been settled yet. Those paired transformations will most likely unfold across several decades of economic chaos, political turmoil, environmental disasters, and widespread warfare. Plenty of people got through the equivalent cataclysms of the first half of the twentieth century with their skins intact, even if the crisis caught them unawares, and no doubt plenty of people will get through the mess that’s approaching us in much the same condition. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus I don’t have any additional practical advice, beyond what I’ve already covered in my books and blog posts, to offer my readers just now. Those who’ve already collapsed and gotten ahead of the rush can break out the popcorn and watch what promises to be a truly colorful show.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those who didn’t—well, you might as well get some popcorn going and try to enjoy the show anyway. If you come out the other side of it all, schoolchildren who aren’t even born yet may eventually come around to ask you awed questions about what happened when the markets crashed in ‘15. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the meantime, while the popcorn is popping and the sidewalks of Wall Street await their traditional tithe of plummeting stockbrokers, I’d like to return to the theme of last week’s post and talk about the way that the myth of the machine—if you prefer, the widespread mental habit of thinking about the world in mechanistic terms—pervades and cripples the modern mind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of all the responses that last week’s post fielded, those I found most amusing, and also most revealing, were those that insisted that of course the universe is a machine, so is everything and everybody in it, and that’s that. That’s amusing because most of the authors of these comments made it very clear that they embraced the sort of scientific-materialist atheism that rejects any suggestion that the universe has a creator or a purpose. A machine, though, is by definition a purposive artifact—that is, it’s made by someone to do something. If the universe is a machine, then, it has a creator and a purpose, and if it doesn’t have a creator and a purpose, logically speaking, it can’t be a machine. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That sort of unintentional comedy inevitably pops up whenever people don’t think through the implications of their favorite metaphors. Still, chase that habit further along its giddy path and you’ll find a deeper absurdity at work. When people say “the universe is a machine,” unless they mean that statement as a poetic simile, they’re engaging in a very dubious sort of logic. As Alfred Korzybski pointed out a good many years ago, pretty much any time you say “this is that,” unless you implicitly or explicitly qualify what you mean in very careful terms, you’ve just babbled nonsense. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The difficulty lies in that seemingly innocuous word “is.” What Korzybski called the “is of identity”—the use of the word “is” to represent<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>=, the sign of equality—makes sense only in a very narrow range of uses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>You can use the “is of identity” with good results in categorical definitions; when I commented above that a machine is a purposive artifact, that’s what I was doing. Here is a concept, “machine;” here are two other concepts, “purposive” and “artifact;” the concept “machine” logically includes the concepts “purposive” and “artifact,” so anything that can be described by the words “a machine” can also be described as “purposive” and “an artifact.” That’s how categorical definitions work. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s consider a second example, though: “a machine is a purple dinosaur.” That utterance uses the same structure as the one we’ve just considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I hope I don’t have to prove to my readers, though, that the concept “machine” doesn’t include the concepts “purple” and “dinosaur” in any but the most whimsical of senses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are plenty of things that can be described by the label “machine,” in other words, that can’t be described by the labels “purple” or “dinosaur.” The fact that some machines—say, electronic Barney dolls—can in fact be described as purple dinosaurs doesn’t make the definition any less silly; it simply means that the statement “no machine is a purple dinosaur” can’t be justified either. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at the statement “the universe is a machine.” As pointed out earlier, the concept “machine” implies the concepts “purposive” and “artifact,” so if the universe is a machine, somebody made it to carry out some purpose. Those of my readers who happen to belong to Christianity, Islam, or another religion that envisions the universe as the creation of one or more deities—not all religions make this claim, by the way—will find this conclusion wholly unproblematic. My atheist readers will disagree, of course, and their reaction is the one I want to discuss here. (Notice how “is” functions in the sentence just uttered: “the reaction of the atheists” equals “the reaction I want to discuss.” This is one of the few other uses of “is” that doesn’t tend to generate nonsense.)</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In my experience, at least, atheists faced with the argument about the meaning of the word “machine” I’ve presented here pretty reliably respond with something like “It’s not a machine in <i>that</i> sense.” That response takes us straight to the heart of the logical problems with the “is of identity.” In what sense is the universe a machine? Pursue the argument far enough, and unless the atheist storms off in a huff—which admittedly tends to happen more often than not—what you’ll get amounts to “the universe and a machine share certain characteristics in common.” Go further still—and at this point the atheist will almost certainly storm off in a huff—and you’ll discover that the characteristics that the universe is supposed to share with a machine are all things we can’t actually prove one way or another about the universe, such as whether it has a creator or a purpose. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The statement “the universe is a machine,” in other words, doesn’t do what it appears to do. It appears to state a categorical identity; it actually states an unsupported generalization in absolute terms. It takes a mental model abstracted from one corner of human experience and applies it to something unrelated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In this case, for polemic reasons, it does so in a predictably one-sided way: deductions approved by the person making the statement (“the universe is a machine, therefore it lacks life and consciousness”) are acceptable, while deductions the person making the statement doesn’t like (“the universe is a machine, therefore it was made by someone for some purpose”) get the dismissive response noted above. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This sort of doublethink appears all through the landscape of contemporary nonconversation and nondebate, to be sure, but the problems with the “is of identity” don’t stop with its polemic abuse. Any time you say “this is that,” and mean something other than “this has some features in common with that,” you’ve just fallen into one of the corel boobytraps hardwired into the structure of human thought. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Human beings think in categories. That’s what made ancient Greek logic, which takes categories as its basic element, so massive a revolution in the history of human thinking: by watching the way that one category includes or excludes another, which is what the Greek logicians did, you can squelch a very large fraction of human stupidities before they get a foothold. What Alfred Korzybski pointed out, in effect, is that there’s a metalogic that the ancient Greeks didn’t get to, and logical theorists since their time haven’t really tackled either: the extremely murky relationship between the categories we think with and the things we experience, which don’t come with category labels spraypainted on them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here is a green plant with a woody stem. Is it a tree or a shrub? That depends on exactly where you draw the line between those two categories, and as any botanist can tell you, that’s neither an easy nor an obvious thing. As long as you remember that categories exist within the human mind as convenient handles for us to think with, you can navigate around the difficulties, but when you slip into thinking that the categories are more real than the things they describe, you’re in deep, deep trouble. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s not at all surprising that human thought should have such problems built into it. If, as I do, you accept the Darwinian thesis that human beings evolved out of prehuman primates by the normal workings of the laws of evolution, it follows logically that our nervous systems and cognitive structures didn’t evolve for the purpose of understanding the truth about the cosmos; they evolved to assist us in getting food, attracting mates, fending off predators, and a range of similar, intellectually undemanding tasks. If, as many of my theist readers do, you believe that human beings were created by a deity, the yawning chasm between creator and created, between an infinite and a finite intelligence, stands in the way of any claim that human beings can know the unvarnished truth about the cosmos. Neither viewpoint supports the claim that a category created by the human mind is anything but a convenience that helps our very modest mental powers grapple with an ultimately incomprehensible cosmos. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Any time human beings try to make sense of the universe or any part of it, in turn, they have to choose from among the available categories in an attempt to make the object of inquiry fit the capacities of their minds. That’s what the founders of the scientific revolution did in the seventeenth century, by taking the category of “machine” and applying it to the universe to see how well it would fit. That was a perfectly rational choice from within their cultural and intellectual standpoint. The founders of the scientific revolution were Christians to a man, and some of them (for example, Isaac Newton) were devout even by the standards of the time; the idea that the universe had been made by someone for some purpose, after all, wasn’t problematic in the least to people who took it as given that the universe was made by God for the purpose of human salvation. It was also a useful choice in practical terms, because it allowed certain features of the universe—specifically, the behavior of masses in motion—to be accounted for and modeled with a clarity that previous categories hadn’t managed to achieve. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The fact that one narrowly defined aspect of the universe seems to behave like a machine, though, does not prove that the universe is a machine, any more than the fact that one machine happens to look like a purple dinosaur proves that all machines are purple dinosaurs. The success of mechanistic models in explaining the behavior of masses in motion proved that mechanical metaphors are good at fitting some of the observed phenomena of physics into a shape that’s simple enough for human cognition to grasp, and that’s all it proved. To go from that modest fact to the claim that the universe and everything in it are machines involves an intellectual leap of pretty spectacular scale. Part of the reason that leap was taken in the seventeenth century was the religious frame of scientific inquiry at that time, as already mentioned, but there was another factor, too. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a curious fact that mechanistic models of the universe appeared in western European cultures, and become wildly popular there, well before the machines did. In the early seventeenth century, machines played a very modest role in the life of most Europeans; most tasks were done using hand tools powered by human and animal muscle, the way they had been done since the dawn of the agricultural revolution eight millennia or so before. The most complex devices available at the time were pendulum clocks, printing presses, handlooms, and the like—you know, the sort of thing that people these days use instead of machines when they want to get away from technology. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For reasons that historians of ideas are still trying to puzzle out, though, western European thinkers during these same years were obsessed with machines, and with mechanical explanations for the universe. Those latter ranged from the plausible to the frankly preposterous—Ren<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>é</span>
Descartes, for example, proposed a theory of gravity in which little corkscrew-shaped particles went zooming up from the earth to screw themselves into pieces of matter and yank them down. Until Isaac Newton, furthermore, theories of nature based on mechanical models didn’t actually explain that much, and until the cascade of inventive adaptations of steam power that ended with James Watt’s epochal steam engine nearly a century after Newton, the idea that machines could elbow aside craftspeople using hand tools and animals pulling carts was an unproven hypothesis. Yet a great many people in western Europe believed in the power of the machine as devoutly as their ancestors had believed in the power of the bones of the local saints. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A habit of thought very widespread in today’s culture assumes that technological change happens first and the world of ideas changes in response to it. The facts simply won’t support that claim, though. As the history of mechanistic ideas in science shows clearly, the ideas come first and the technologies follow—and there’s good reason why this should be so. Technologies don’t invent themselves, after all. Somebody has to put in the work to invent them, and then other people have to invest the resources to take them out of the laboratory and give them a role in everyday life. The decisions that drive invention and investment, in turn, are powerfully shaped by cultural forces, and these in turn are by no means as rational as the people influenced by them generally like to think. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
People in western Europe and a few of its colonies dreamed of machines, and then created them. They dreamed of a universe reduced to the status of a machine, a universe made totally transparent to the human mind and totally subservient to the human will, and then set out to create it. That latter attempt hasn’t worked out so well, for a variety of reasons, and the rising tide of disasters sketched out in the first part of this week’s post unfold in large part from the failure of that misbegotten dream. In the next few posts, I want to talk about why that failure was inevitable, and where we might go from here.</div>

Perhaps all of Europe (and maybe even the rest of the world too) may be about to face reality.

Also about the Angry Atheists and the Fundamentalists being both subclasses of 'true believers'. Hmm and hmm, its starting too look like the Machine Universe is Creation emptied of living will, emptied of a spiritual living principle. In fact the Machine Universe is very very VERY similar to the Universe as prescripted by God, that whole idea of God as all knowing. Its not even like the idea of God is not implicit, as you point out the vestigial throne in your post, it is more like he is dead. The thrown is still there, waiting for the Overman to take it; grabbing the control board of this great Machine. Universe reduced from God's just kingdom to God's nice car left with the key's in the ignition waiting for humanities legs to grow long enough to, ha, reach the gas. It really seems like the biggest difference in the idea that humans can wield the Machine; while the Kingdom of God's Creation is too full of life and richness to ever be mastered.<br><br>"The Universe is a Machine, therefore it lacks life and consciousness" is the key point because this is the move that differentualtes the Machine universe from Divine creation. "Creation" has life and consciousness. One is tempted to ask, of course, if the universe (that is to say aproximently "all that is") lacks life and consciousness, then how could those words mean anything and how could you mean anything by making that claim? If the universe lacks those things completely they are with out referent or example. Why the denial of Life, and the denial of Consciousness (that most critical aspect of freedom)? I think that this could be the spiritual exhaustion said to be common of late peoples. That spiritual exhaustion coinciding with the flourishing of these mental technologies risen out of a thousand years of diligent refinement of mental technologies reappropriated from the Classical civilization, it leaves the mental technology ungoverned. Extrahuman forces such as the lust for air felt by the long buried dead, never let to recycle into lives cycle, likely turned this cultures quirk into the rather staggering frack job we are left with today. With out that we might have had a civilization of whimsical clockwork gadgets, and even then perhaps humans toward the end wound up like spring loaded trinkets by the end, but not the staggering difference in economic magnitude.<br><br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c8658128361373258106 title="comment permalink">7/1/15, 6:56 PM</a><br><br>

With that said, I would like to comment on the atheism and the nature of the Universe. Atheists tend to pride themselves on rational thinking but the micro/macro physics and construction of the Universe, at least with regards to how modern science define them, leave us with a bit of cognitive dissonance. <br><br>I'm convinced that the Universe is an electrical device. After all, atoms are clearly electrical devices held together with magnetism. Frankly, they are more of an idea than an actually physical structure. If that is the basic building block of the macro Universe then the Universe, itself, must be an electrical device. <br><br>Well, devices do not create themselves - as an inventor, I know this first-hand. What I can not do is connect that knowledge to any of the 1000 or more deities that mankind has invented to explain creation. That makes me an atheist.<br><br>The Apollo rocket was not created by a single person but by over 400,000 people, most of whom had no contact with any of the other 400,000 people toiling towards the same goal yet create it they did.

Had humanity, however, developed a new form of energy - for example, fusion - which was more concentrated and easy to use than oil, and inexhaustible (in practical terms), wouldn't this vision of mankind perhaps be immortal? Wouldn't we actually go to the stars and expand forever, conquering world after world? The way I see it, there are no false nor true visions of mankind, only adaptive and maladaptive ones. And the vision of mankind as a Conqueror of Nature was very adaptive when we had these abundant source of energy at our disposal; and became extremely maladaptive once these began to run out. Following the same line of thought, one can suppose that, if we had a new source of abundant and concentrated energy, that particular vision of mankind would still be alive and kicking.

That dream -- if existed -- was a popular and debased idea of what working scientists such as Newton, Leibniz, Lagrange, and Hamilton were doing at the time. The idea behind classical mechanics is that given a set of initial conditions -- say position and momentum -- it's possible to work out the subsequent trajectory in simple cases. For example, if I throw something into the air with a certain initial velocity, I can predict how high it will go, how far it will go horizintally, and how long it will take. The same with respect to the orbits of planets around the sun. In this sense classical mechanics was a huge success. In the decades and centuries to come the math that made classical mechanics possible -- ordinary and then partial differential equations -- shed light on aspects of the physical universe (electrodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, quantum theory, relativity) But I doubt that Newton -- a working alchemist -- would see the world as an inanimate mechanism.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c3988564816617249247 title="comment permalink">7/1/15, 7:11 PM</a><br><br>

Ever since the "recovery" began, I've been expecting the wheels would fall off and the global economy would go back into a tailspin, but each time the powers that be have managed to glue or duct tape the wheels back on and keep going as though they'd actually fixed the problem. <br><br>Take, for instance, the fracking bubble. It's obviously a bubble of the same sort that was chronicled in Zweig's fantastic book Belly Up: The Collapse of the Penn Square Bank, but on a much grander scale. Yet despite an oil price collapse seven months ago, it has still yet to unravel or even result in decreasing oil production, at least as of yet. The main difference I'm seeing is the radically different interest rate situation; in the early 1980s the Volcker Shock pushed interest rates to nearly 20%, whereas we've been at zero for nearly seven years now. The resulting bubble in nearly everything (fracking being just one example) has been quite long-lived, and it's not impossible it could keep going a while longer. <br><br>Greece is another interesting case. I predict it will cave quickly and accept austerity conditions, either by a 'yes' vote in the upcoming referendum or by Tsipras accepting the deal with a few minor changes, which he's already trying to do despite the referendum. That doesn't change the fact that it's completely insolvent and has to be bailed out in order to pay back its loans from the previous bailout, but the Greeks seem to have been scared enough by the default, bank holiday, and capital controls that they'll probably go back despite the fact that their creditors were forcing them into an economic depression rivaling the Great Depression.<br><br>I'm not claiming that this time really is different in any meaningful way. At the end of the day, the world economic system is a house of cards, and sooner or later something will send it back to earth. But I bet if you polled the denizens of, say, The Oil Drum in late 2009 and asked how long they thought the "recovery" charade could be kept up, very few would have guessed it would still be going.

When I took high school physics the thing that made a big impression on me (even though I was raised to that point by a physicist father) was the realization that material things behaved in ways that could be COMPUTED. Not only does a rock thrown into a well proceed to fall down to the bottom, but if you measure the time to the splash, you can compute the depth of the water level. Wow. The wider implication is that material objects behave in predictable, deterministic ways, down to the last details. I think this is what atheists mean when they say that the universe is a machine: determinism.<br><br>Even the most devoutly religious still rely on such determinism in everyday material life. The remaining arguments include:<br><br>* To what extent can deterministic phenomena be UNpredictable? That's where "chaos theory" comes in. Some very simple deterministic rules, let alone real-world systems such as weather, can indeed produce behavior which cannot be usefully predicted for very long into the future.<br><br>* To what extent do we understand the mechanisms (not machines!) of the universe. Those with enough hubris think that more technology will solve the problems created by some technology. Others think we should be more cautious - but that does not imply a belief in a non-mechanistic universe.<br><br>* Are there things in the universe that are NOT deterministic? This is where the atheists split from others. They say: we havn't seen anything that is convincingly exempt from deterministic behavior. Yes there is a large fraction of humans who say that they've had religious experiences, but that is no enough to convince those who have not had such experiences, or who attribute those experiences to the chaotic behaviors of a deterministic brain.<br><br>Note that we do not have to fully "understand" everything about the universe to notice that it, or at least much of it, behaves mechanistically. Just like Newton stumbled upon the simple mathematical rule that the motion of massive bodies in empty space follows, even though he did not have an explanation for WHY or HOW this "gravity" force operates, especially at a distance. And guess what: we STILL don't have a good explanation for it, even though by now we've refined those rules of motion to include relativity etc. Because we are willing to accept the mechanistic behavior without, er, a mechanism to explain it, it is natural for us to assume that everything else in the universe has similarly deterministic behavior, even if we havn't yet even observed it. This assumption is unproven, but, from my perspective, neither is any competing assumption.<br><br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c1763877420357417028 title="comment permalink">7/1/15, 7:42 PM</a><br><br>

I think it was Victor Frankl who pointed out that these days, nihilism isn't about nothingness; it's about nothing-<i>but</i>-ness. <br><br>Nickelthrower, you've already admitted that an electron is more an idea than an electrical object. Why not take the next step and consider the possibility that the universe is a structure of ideas rather than a machine, electrical or otherwise? As for gods, your Apollo metaphor would make perfect sense to a polytheist, you know. <br><br>Bruno, the difficulty there is that energy is only one of the things we're running out of in a hurry, and unless this new form of energy you're postulating is capable of limitless expansion -- which is true of no form of energy in the cosmos, for reasons ultimately linked to the laws of conservation -- we'd be back in the same fix we're in now, and in fairly short order, exponential growth being what it is. <br><br>AA, you've missed my point, which is that the dream of a mechanical universe -- however popular and debased it might have been -- was on the scene <i>before</i> Newton et al., and arguably inspired and guided both their researches and the enthusiasm with which their conclusions were adopted by Western societies. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, very good indeed; that gets you tonight's gold star. Exactly; change in consciousness comes first, and leads to changes in technologies and the like -- and that, of course, is precisely what I've been trying to kickstart into motion on this blog and elsewhere for the last nine years. <br><br>Grebulocities, it's possible, but at this point so many things are coming apart so enthusiastically that I think we've passed a boundary of sorts. Stil, we'll see. <br><br>Moshe, from my perspective, you're starting from the claim that a few things in the universe are deterministic, and making a wild leap of fantasy to get to the claim that the whole universe is deterministic. Since "deterministic" in this sense means no more than "our quantitative models can reliably predict things in certain cases" -- we don't actually know if those models correspond to "laws of nature," of course -- that seems to me like an astonishingly vast claim to make on astonishingly little evidence. <br><br>Nick, nicely summarized. I hope you're right about the internet. <br><br>Onething, that's because they were sufficiently belligerent that I deleted them, of course. <br><br>Carolyn, I don't recommend trying to talk about the end of the industrial age with people who still believe in the religion of progress; they won't, and indeed can't hear what you're saying.

From the sounds of it, you've run into the worst sort: the kind who're as certain in what they call "rationalism" and the non-supernatural nature of the universe as any religious evangelical is in their own faith, and replace gods and paradises with twisted conceptions of science and dreams of the Singularity. God is dead; all hail rational thinking!<br><br>But this is not what atheism means. At its core, atheism says nothing about *knowing* whether there are gods or forces beyond our ken. That falls to agnosticism - the assertion that we cannot know the answer to a question. Atheism simply refers to a lack of *belief*. I've seen nothing to convince me of the existence of anything beyond the physical world, but I don't presume to *know* (as any science undergrad worth their salt could tell you: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence), so I would describe myself as both - agnostic, and atheist.<br><br>Those who say "the universe is a machine" have simply fallen prey to a lack of rigour in their use of English language. They haven't considered or recognised at any point that a machine must have purpose; the contradiction is therefore inherent in the language but not necessarily in the thinking. "Mechanistic" or "deterministic" are better terms. Whether or not the principle is right - again, I've never seen anything to contradict it; every new insight in the sciences (from the basic principles of chemistry to research in modern meteorology and neuroscience) finds that its subject matter follows basic principles or rules and improves our ability to predict its behaviour. Just as natural selection can be accepted without producing evidence of its workings in every single organism, so the principle of determinism can be taken as a working hypothesis until something comes along to suggest otherwise, without needing to apply it to every single bit of the universe. This doesn't mean it's "proven", and it never will be, regardless of the fact that science does not deal in self-reflection (i.e. scientific principles cannot be used to determine whether science is applicable). Nothing is ever proven.<br><br>Whether or not the principle is right also, in one sense, doesn't matter. The complexity of the universe is such that we can never hope to understand more than a fraction of its workings. Some (often the "rationalists" again) hold that we can break down the universe into its constituent parts and so understand it, but the task is ultimately futile and perhaps self-defeating even if it were not. On a sub-atomic level, perhaps we have deterministic brains, but on a human level, we are people. Personally, I'd rather keep being a person – so I'm not going to start bleating about our lack of free will, regardless of the intellectual arguments. On the other hand, while there’s a logical jump in the argument that “universe functioning according to natural laws with no conscious creator or purpose = universe humans can control”, we must be careful not to make the same jump backwards: the truth of one says nothing about the truth of the other.<br><br>Gods and the supernatural fall beyond our comprehension, yes, and unlike some who call themselves atheists I’m not going to claim to *know* anything in that regard. However, it must be remembered that the potential for such things to exist does not mean they actually do.<br><br>As for intellect: our brains evolved to find mates, navigate complex social systems, extract resources and develop technology in ways that are highly intellectually demanding by the usual standards of primates, though admittedly not philosophy or quantum physics.<br><br>Stars do have many of the properties of living organisms, though they’re missing one critical aspect of life as usually defined, which is that they don’t actively reproduce themselves. At least, as far as we know. But then, we don’t know anything, do we?<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c5567221310001355016 title="comment permalink">7/2/15, 1:20 AM</a><br><br>

Study after study the researchers found that once the story is implanted, nothing they could say or do could change the effect of the story. Even when the narrative was false and they told the subjects that the story they were going to be told was false, people still believed it because of its emotional impact on them.

The concept of the creator of the universe, its purpose in creating, and our purpose for existing are simply beyond the grasp of the human mind. <br><br>I do not attend church and do not belong to any organized religion, so to most of my Christian friends, I am considered an atheist. Since I long ago eschewed discussing religion, I simply let them think what they will. But if they ever eat dinner at my house, they will experience the thanks we acknowledge to the creator for the fact that an animal had to die so that we could eat. Life is not possible without death, a fact that so many people, even those of a religious bent, seem to gloss over. I see God as nature, so I suppose I am somewhat along the lines of a druid, although I know nothing of druidry, other than what I have read here.

One you might call the mechanistic model – in which effects follow causes and physical limits exist. You push something and it moves. That ditch is too wide to jump over – try it and you’ll fall in. The other is the model of the mind. We are social animals enmeshed in a social world, and some of our most sophisticated abilities rest in our ability to model and predict other minds and the social relationships that link them. Maintaining some sanity, power and autonomy in the real world requires managing both of these realms.<br><br>I agree that the obsession with a mechanistic orientation – and the apparent effort to edit out or eliminate the role of other minds in the equation - which you’ve been diagnosing in the past two essays, does have to do with confusing these two approaches, but I wouldn’t put it down to the machine-implies-a-maker point.<br><br>I would say that what we are seeing is the culmination of a long process of moving more and more human relationships from the social-psychological model to the mechanistic model. Long ago analysts noted that bureaucratization and urban living involved interacting with people not as full, fellow human beings, but as simplified, roll-specific mechanoids. You can hand over the change to the clerk the same as you would a vending machine.<br><br>As long as we had rich social lives – as long as our personal economic and social positions relied on our ability to manage social relationships and understand the psychological states of the people around us – the fiction that the clerk was a vending machine didn’t really do most of us any harm. But do we still have those rich social lives? Does it really matter to the corporate drone what his supervisor is thinking and whether or not she likes him or not? The philosophies that guide (and reward) elite thinking – like economics and management – are entirely devoted to making the case that humans are best understood and manipulated in mechanistic terms. <br><br>So we have a kind of cultural insanity, and it is intensified among the most powerful among us. And it is an approach that is turning out to be entirely ineffectual when it comes to managing human and other complex systems – which respond as though they have agendas of their own.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c1755660713914694027 title="comment permalink">7/2/15, 5:43 AM</a><br><br>

Land, resources and the money to obtain them are a significant constraint for most.<br><br>I'm 26, dependent-free and am an engineer at a defense contractor, which is hopefully a secure position for a few more years - probably longer, war is almost certainly going to be a growth industry. I realize that most people can't do this, but my preference is to stay mobile. I generally subscribe to the Club of Rome view that developed countries will gradually start to look more like third world countries - vast slums and no opportunity for most, with the remaining wealthy in gated communities. My goal is not really to get myself a spot in one of those islands of wealth and privilege, but rather to maximize my opportunities in as many different futures as possible. My main priorities are physical fitness and skill development, I do not think that settling down is a good move if you have a somewhat secure place in the money economy. Knowledge and skills cannot be taken away from you or destroyed by climate change, the government or criminals. But maybe I'll be proven wrong, and die as a result, but that's basically the normal state of human existence, so it really shouldn't bother me.<br><br>Regarding the Internet, I generally agree with the premise that there will be some form of the Internet in 2065, but probably not generally accessible and used by governments, militaries and those few corporations still engaged in international trade. However, in the short term, meaning the next decade, I would imagine that the Internet will continue to exist more or less as it does today, just likely with more balkanization and censorship.<br><br>I think that one of the NSA and allied-alphabet-soup-agencies purposes will be to create an imperceptible soft censorship of the Internet, where "this page is blocked" will be a fairly rare sight, but control of what people see on the various online fora that suck up so much of our time is subtly shaped to attempt to mold people's perceptions of reality in a way that those throwing the switches want, which relates to your idea about a mechanistic view of the universe. After all, if you can model human activity in an accurate enough way, and then control the input to the human machines, you can control the output if your model was accurate enough. Or so the theory goes. So I think for a lot of reasons, maintenance of something very like the Internet of today as well as the manufacturing and distribution of devices to access it will have a lot of our dwindling resources allocated to it. I remain hopeful that there will still be room for realistic discussion of the present situation on the Internet, which is why I am optimistic that the Internet will drive a lot of positive change, because I think that the project of soft censorship won't actually block dissenting thought on the internet, it will just keep it hard-to-see on social media.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c3866310974143150944 title="comment permalink">7/2/15, 6:04 AM</a><br><br>

I would have thought Korzybski's "the map is not the territory" had made that obvious for all time. Yet we all fall into the trap of forgetting the existence of the map. Translating from one language to another teaches one immediately that practically every word in one's language is, one way or another, a metaphor that must then be deciphered in order to figure out how to express the same concept in the target language. Most English speakers, especially Americans, rarely learn other languages (since English is for the moment the "world language"), so they don't have it thrust in their faces daily.<br><br>This is why I believe no completely "logical" language can ever be created that is capable of expressing all human communication and thought, despite the efforts of so many (Lojban, Esperanto, Ido, etc.). Because human beings, while capable of logic (with great effort) are not inherently logical beings. Logic is not a natural way of thinking; actually, "thinking," in the sense we're using here, isn't all that natural either. Most human action is dictated by habit, reaction, and emotion. We presume we're thinking, but it's just words running emptily and repetitiously through our skulls. That's why logic wasn't invented as a discipline until quite recently, and why we all putter along doing what we've always done, even though we "know" that what we're doing is likely to lead to real discomfort at some point.<br><br>Thanks for the link to the article on Greenland glacial earthquakes. I hadn't seen that, though I should have expected it.

When you press theist ID folks on their intuitions, you find they have no idea how it is that technologies actually get invented. As someone who has been a part of invention and design of new technologies, it is clear to me that in many ways technologies actually do invent themselves, and the conscious control of a singular inventor (or perhaps at most a handful of people all in-synch intellectually in such an endeavor) is always overestimated. "Purpose," in this sense, comes after the fact of invention, something assigned to a technology after people have had a chance to play with it and see what it can do. If you go back in time to before that particular tech was invented, those you now identity as inventors usually had no idea that the tech would be used in the way it is now used, and the process by which a new tech comes about feels like (from the perspective of the inventor) being swept up in the momentum of the process rather than diligently orchestrating that same process.<br><br>Bottom line is that, at least since Descartes, conscious control of the "self" has been grossly overestimated and irrational/unconscious/uncontrolled actions have been equally underestimated. It is more accurate, in my experience, to say that tech invents itself -- inventors are taken along for the ride.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c8629275102468940860 title="comment permalink">7/2/15, 6:28 AM</a><br><br>

E-Prime does not allow the conjugations of to be—be, am, is, are, was, were, been, being—the archaic forms of to be (e.g. art, wast, wert), or the contractions of to be—'m, 's, 're (e.g. I'm, he's, she's, they're).<br><br>Some scholars advocate using E-Prime as a device to clarify thinking and strengthen writing.[1] For example, the sentence "the film was good" could not be expressed under the rules of E-Prime, and the speaker might instead say "I liked the film" or "the film made me laugh". The E-Prime versions communicate the speaker's experience rather than judgment, making it harder for the writer or reader to confuse opinion with fact.<br><br>Kellogg and Bourland use the term "Deity mode of speech" to refer to misuse of the verb to be, which "allows even the most ignorant to transform their opinions magically into god-like pronouncements on the nature of things".[2]<br>"<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c2050393057503831108 title="comment permalink">7/2/15, 6:38 AM</a><br><br>

Keats' objective correlative). Out of metaphor arises a larger understanding of meaning, a different project entirely than categorical definition. (As a side note, I think that is part of the argument between those that take the bible literally and those that interpret it philosophically or literarily, which doesn't diminish its value, of course, contrary to fundamentalist thought. In my opinion.)<br><br>To me, poetry and botany (and study of ecosystems generally: ecology?) have more in common than one might think, and less in common with a mechanistic view. Botanical categories are more like collections of shared tendencies than mathematical or logical categories, I find, and fuzzy at best. I have heard two ecologists discuss whether a particular landmark oak is a bur oak or white oak based on perceived characteristics. If you ask anyone dealing with plants, whether gardener, botanist or ecologist a question, often the answer begins with "It depends..."<br><br>Which leads one over time to holistic or systems thinking as a habit and a very different view of how the world and universe function. And then when dealing with living beings, whether plant, animal or viral, consciousness, will and volition begin to occur, along with communication (plants communicate chemically, it is beginning to be discovered): well, time for some new models, is all I have to say. <br><br>Speaking of which: what models are we entertaining now that will be born out in the future? That are already changing our culture, our entire frame of reference?

Though his overt field was political philosophy, his revolution there cascaded into the rest of western thinking. For example, one need only consider Bacon's references to Machiavelli to grasp how deep the that revolution struck into the western mind. His revolution targeted a thousand years of theocracy and so sought to undermine every column supporting that structure including God, classical metaphysics, virtue ethics, natural law, rationality, immortality of the soul, etc. A good amount of that was over-reaction! Though these ideas existed long before Machiavelli (consider classical hedonist world views), the politicization of them was novel and gave them a chance for broader social adoption.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c8101600675683964727 title="comment permalink">7/2/15, 7:15 AM</a><br><br>

His bio - "Incompleteness" by Rebecca Goldstein, is well worth a read, if you admire logic at all, because it talks about the struggle to define and describe with clarity our thinking of the world. Anyway, because my head is swimming with "if P then Q" right now, it wasn't too hard to follow you. Reminds me of the Venn diagrams, which we learned in 2nd grade("new math")and so are well engrained. You did a good job of smashing the machine/Universe "equality", and you could also do it thus: "the Universe by definition contains all (the set of the Universe contains all sets)" and "I am not a machine" thus "the Universe is a machine" is incorrect because not everything in the Universe is a machine. Thus their argument also contains a poor definition of "Universe", which would be obvious if they were questioned a bit.<br><br>I've also been reading Jacob Riis' "How the Other Half Lives" (with photos), which gives a shocking reminder of how bad it could get (how bad it's been) in the US when social safety nets don't exist. <br><br>I've also been watching as some poorer neighbors go "under water" economically, and have been helping some with systems paperwork (my social services background helps here) - the wheels have already come off for many, many people and the overturned cart is an ugly, ugly sight.

The thing about crises is that you don't really know you are in one until you are closer to the end of the process, at which point it seems rather obvious. The last financial crisis really started in 2004/2005, with the peaking of the US property market and conventional oil production and the start of the oil price ramp. Financial market liquidity problems began in 2007 and the credit bubble popped properly in 2008. The last place to get the memo was the stock market, which bottomed out in 2009. So this crisis, which everyone now acknowledges as a real crisis, unfolded over several years. Even in late 2007 most people were pretty oblivious to it. <br><br>Goodness knows there are enough crisis triggers in play now - fracking bubble bursting, QE fading, Greece flailing, California drying up, Alaska burning, etc, etc. But my guess is that the story that "all is well" will hold until next year when the political revolving doors start to spin with the election cycle and the narrative falters. And then we'll have another bunch of political hope-and-change-jockeys telling us that all will be fixed if certain buttons are pressed and levers are pulled. So, yes, 2015 is where it really gets going, but 2016 will be where it all gets acknowledged and 2017 will be where it bottoms out and gets explained. <br><br>But, we'll see.

JMG has posited “a purposive artifact” as a partial definition, thus implying the necessity of a creator. I wondered if that definition for a machine should be taken as shared. The first definition that comes up when I type the word in Google is a “device that transmits or modifies force or motion.” Hmm. A weak definition, to be sure, but creator required? I guess that depends on what ‘device’ means- we’ve circled around. For ‘machine’, Oxford gives us “an apparatus using or applying mechanical power and having several parts, each with a definite function and together performing a particular task”. There’s ‘apparatus’ again, similar to ‘device’. Definitions of each of these wiggle back and forth, sometimes implying purpose, sometimes just saying “required for a particular task”. If we can agree that those words are just placeholders, because dictionaries find it undignified to say “thingy”, we can look at the rest of Oxford’s definition and think about the necessity for a creator. To me the relevant bits are “function” and “task”- do those imply an intention? Not necessarily; if we’re looking at any sort of cycle and just describing its parts, we can analyze it as a series of functions or tasks without implying that some consciousness is directing it, e.g. photosynthesis or the water cycle. (Whether some consciousness might direct those is another whole ball of wax…) The definition of machine could thus be neutered into “a more or less complicated thingy by which something is done ”, completely sidestepping who might want or not want the task in question to be done and describing only the process and mechanism. So we are in some sense back to last week’s description of a machine as “a subset of the universe deprived of the capacity to learn”- just a description of one unchanging task accomplishment.<br><br>Now, to me the model of the universe as a machine which meets this definition 1. is incredibly limited and misses the entire experience of existence, and 2. does not exclude a creator, or many creators, or some indescribable force of creation. However, if we are using this limited definition, I can accept the argument that the universe is in some sense a machine which dissipates concentrated energy, and that this definition does not require a creator. I don’t share the view of materialist atheists who use this metaphor/model “the universe is a machine” to describe their whole understanding of the universe, but I also don’t think it necessarily self-contradicts their understanding. What you mean by “machine” matters just as much as your definition of “is”.

The issues right in front of us are mostly financial tomfoolery amongst the big boys, not hard assets. Contrary to popular law, corporations are not people - they can die and the people move on. Commerce will continue to try to drag globalism forward in spite of whatever happens in the finance sector, because the local isn't there to take up the slack (yet).<br><br>Yes, it COULD all melt down in a year. But looking at Rome, it wasn't so, and we are sort of a hypercomplex Rome. Many of us have been aware of this for decades, hoping for an opportunity change as a nation - didn't happen and wasn't really expectation - just hope. Many, simultaneously, decided to collapse - in older parlance, drop out - and find alternative means. I make a decent living, yet by .gov I am counted as long term unemployed because I have no "tax-type-form" filed, not in 10 years.<br><br>I think your sense of "something wicked this way comes" is accurate - astrology-wise there are portents, and things are lining up for some fireworks in many areas. But I don't think it will all happen in a rush - inertia is sort of 'there' no matter the field of study, right? I think whatever it is, it is "slouching towards" our Gomorrah - and slouching isn't very speedy. It will be seen as rapid, because BAU has been pervasive for such a long time.<br><br>It isn't too late to collapse or as I prefer, drop out. It just means you do with less and have to adapt more.

For some, it was their first time out in nature. One evening, we were watching a particularly majestic sunset in a perfectly clouded sky from a rock outcropping with a pastoral valley laid out below. One of the volunteers exclaimed at the grandness of the setting, of all the colors on the horizon; how it was almost as nice as a painting she once saw in a museum. <br><br>The order in which we experience things seems to matter. We see many sunsets. Then we see the painter's painting, trying to communicate an idea about a common experience through the canvas. Or. We grow up in a city where the horizon is obscured and sunsets happen on TV. On a school trip, one time, we see a canvas that captures our attention for a moment and it becomes memorable. Years later, we are reminded of that school trip by a random place. <br><br>In one instance the original event is the anchor. The canvas takes a person back to it. In the other, the canvas representation is the original event. The actual sunset takes a person back in memory to a day once spent in a museum located in a bustling city.<br><br>In a National Geographic special a tribal woman is tossing foraged grain into the air from a hand carved bowl. The chaff and dust blow away in the breeze. The grain is then poured onto a flat rock and is ground by rubbing a rounded stone repeatedly over the kernels. The flour to make a flat bread is created by the grinding action of the two rocks. If, on another day, this woman were a guest in another's house and she were offered bread it would remind her of her own experiences of gathering grain and processing it into a meal.<br><br>Later, wind or water turns a wheel and grain is ground between two large stones that are parts of the machine that is the mill. The farmer takes his harvest by cart to the mill and enough flour to last months is ground in just a few hours. His bread reminds him of long hours planting and tending and harvesting.<br><br>Later still, we go to the supermarket and buy a loaf of bread or a bag of bleached, fortified flour and it stirs nothing in us in terms of its origin, or the machinery used to make it, unless, perhaps, we've been to a pioneer museum. In which case, a particularly nice loaf of bread might make us remember a day we spent in a museum in a small rural town where we learned that flour used to be ground at a mill by a creek nearby.<br><br>Machines arise out of our interaction with the world. Early devices to keep track of time mimicked observations of the movement of the planets. Those people knew the sky and when they looked at their devices for keeping time (the rotation of the earth, the seasonal journey around the sun...) those devices reminded them of the original. A digital watch today reminds us of?<br><br>When many people experience nature today those experiences are processed by minds whose first experiences are of machines. Nature is interpreted to fit into that known world; the world of machines, concrete, steel and food from a can or a box. The harm done to nature is largely unobserved. If it is, in any event, what is happening in nature is only relevant in its relation to people's primary experiences nested in the modern. How do you get someone to see that life isn't imitating art? After all, everything seems to be zipping along all tickity-boo in the machine world of the cities; barring a few, negligible hiccups.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c2646139108927891501 title="comment permalink">7/2/15, 9:11 AM</a><br><br>

They made the statement that a stream or river is a machine for transport of sediment and that for most management situations you have to understand the sediment flow as much or more than the simple water flow. That is, the temptation is to think of water volume per time passing a point is all that matters for understanding creeks/streams/rivers when, in fact, the actual velocity matters a very great deal for sediment transport and deposition and "moving" of the stream channel and erosion etc. Very little was said about why we have sediment to transport in the streams and rivers which seems to be a serious flaw in their approach to management. But with finite human intelligence, it is hard to consider infinitely many variables. I also thought it rather odd that no mention of chaos theory was made in regard to the movement of streams i.e. the movement being limited by boundaries to a degree but not terribly predictable very far into the future due to the complexity of the situation/dependence on initial conditions. All in all a very interesting workshop with many diverse people/interests represented from across the region/watershed.

The Sun is self-regulating, though admittedly not as elaborately self-regulating as a bacterium is. If the rate of nuclear fusion in the solar core increases, outward radiation pressure at the core increases, reducing the net pressure at the core (since the net pressure is the algebraic sum of inward gravitational pressure and outward radiation pressure). This reduces the rate of nuclear fusion. If, on the other hand, the rate of nuclear fusion in the core decreases, outward radiation pressure at the core decreases, increasing the net pressure at the core as gravitation makes the Sun contract. This increases the rate of nuclear fusion. Consequently, the Sun keeps itself in a rather steady equilibrium, at any rate as long as it has its supply of solar-core hydrogen. <br><br><br>Hastily, <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo <br>(Catholic hermit-wannabe (lay hermit, NOT under Canon 603) near Toronto) <br><br>www dot metascientia dot com<br><br>PS: I'd like to thank also you and others for various further things. (1) JMG, it was good that you mentioned a few weeks ago, when you wrote on Napoleon and FDR, and I queried about Theodoric, that Theodoric was just one of a sequence of Napoleon-or-FDR figures in Roman history, each of them (in your analysis) releasing some temporary institutional vigour by reorganizing their enfeebled society. I will have to think more about this. Questions like the following suggest themselves: <i>Compare and contrast with FDR, (a) Constantine, and (b) Diocletian.</i> (2) Cathy McGuire: Thanks so much for sending me papermail this spring, as you assembled papermail contacts for ADR readers by way of a precaution against possible eventual loss of the Internet. (3) Thanks, JMG and Derv, for interesting thoughts on machines last week. Noteworthy were not only JMG's initial thoughts on machines, but Derv's response regarding the decay of decision-making elites. As JMG pointed out a bit before last week, the British political elite of the 1920s and 1930s seem to have taken better decisions than the USA political elite of the post-2001 era. The British were soaked in a machine culture in the 1920s and 1930s, just as contemporary Americans are, so why the difference? One might suggest here that our contemporary machines are opaque to inspection, being magical or slave-like (as a genie-from-a-bottle is a slave): you click on the icon, and some nice thing happens, for reasons you cannot explain unless you are a computer hardware architect, versed both in software and in the physics of semiconductors. In the 1920s and 1930s, a machine was something whose inner workings you as a non-specialist had some hope of inspecting and comprehending - as with the case of the slide rule, to which JMG has now and again referred. - Of course one MIGHT also make the more banal suggestion that elites emerge from elitist educational systems, and that the old British system, with its stress on rigorous studies of classics for members of the ruling class, was superior to what we have now. - Or one might darkly suggest (I myself make much of this) that the root cause for the difference between Britain then and the USA now is a spiritual decline - already underway in the 1920s and 1930s, and yet now reaching a more advanced and debilitating state. (4) JMG, thanks for mentioning the new encyclical last week. I would urge people to read it - there is a lot there, and not just about climate change. (Francis for instance stresses the need for intergenerational solidarity, in the teeth of the current temptation to burden our successors with environmental degradation or financial debt. He also stresses the need to develop a notion of ecology-of-human-socities, intertwined with the more familiar notion of ecology-of-biotopes.)<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c5554622582672110846 title="comment permalink">7/2/15, 11:04 AM</a><br><br>

I do note that in the Univ of Toronto library, possibly in the physics section. we have a promising-looking volume (I ought to re-read it some day), entitled <i>Entropy for Biologists</i>. <br><br>A further addendum (this time to some of the "PS" material in posting from a few minutes ago): The thesis that a cause for the difference between interwar Britain and the contemporary USA is a spiritual decline perhaps gets some corroboration from the more happy example of Judaism. That the Jewish nation has clung to spiritual disciplines from the Babylonian exile onward has meant that it has kept its culture alive in a way not achieved by Babylon, Egypt, Assyria, etc. I would indeed suggest that if Jewish spiritual disciplines stay in place, we will see the menorah and the prayer shawl and fresh Hebrew-language literary production surviving somewhere centuries from now - even though, admittedly, the Jewish state, as a sovereign political entity wedged between Lebanon and Egypt, may in the coming centuries be obliterated. <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br>www dot metascientia dot com<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c1314248774102473755 title="comment permalink">7/2/15, 11:14 AM</a><br><br>

Perhaps I'm taking your phrasing too literally, but following your Druidic interrogation of binaries, there's got to be a spectrum of preparedness between and on either side of the two "states", and one's place on it is determined by so many factors. <br><br>OK I'm surely stating the obvious and taking things too literally...but I gotta admit I'm just made anxious by the starkness of your phrasing. You've done so much in your blogs and books to make "Green Wizardry" clear in all it's multi-facetedness and variable applicability, so when you then hit us with "collapsed or not collapsed" I feel I don't really know where to place myself and family other than "not nearly collapsed enough, I think", hence the anxiety...<br><br>I've a job and a very young family; Green Wizardry-wise I've been devoting as much free time as I could the last year and a half to learning to grow food on our allotment (we're in the UK), and besides that my partner and I are by nature very frugal, good at saving money/food, and are increasingly attempting to learn to make our own stuff and buy less. I would say she is far more naturally in tune with the LESS strategy, but I am the one who reads the Archdruid. Earning a living is the definite weak point for us...if you ask me will I have my job in 6 months time, I just can't answer, and what specifically will I do if it goes away suddenly...I don't know. So are we collapsed? I suppose not...but I feel, my pride feels, that it surely could be worse.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c3055450780842112156 title="comment permalink">7/2/15, 1:10 PM</a><br><br>

Perhaps that underscores what you said about categories.<br><br>My understanding (which may be wrong) of European thinkers at the time in question is that they were not necessarily trying to reduce the universe to the status of a machine. I doubt that many of them could have conceived, for example, that the remarkable properties of living tissue (sensing, healing, moving on mental command) could possibly be accounted for by any kind of machinery. Isn't that why Victorian ghosts were shaped like the outlines of people, because in the living, the spirit had to be coextensive with the body, in order to sense, heal, and push the limbs around when the will or soul commanded?<br><br>I think instead that what they were trying to do was understand the mechanical well enough to establish the limits on what part of nature is machinery, because once that's accomplished, what remains falls undeniably into the realm of the spiritual. The shape of the "ground" of the spiritual would be revealed by the outlines or voids of the "figure" of the mechanical. It was not unreasonable to anticipate, for instance, that mechanistic reasons for the sun remaining hot or embryos growing into their form in the womb might not only not be found but be ruled out, resulting in objective proof (and eventually, greater understanding) of the miraculous; that is, the ongoing actions of God or other spiritual forces active in the world.<br><br>Nature eventually threw them (and us) a curve, by appearing mechanistic if not "all the way down" then at least as far down as we can comprehend so far. In life sciences, metabolism, sensation, locomotion, disease processes, inheritance, growth and development, all in their turn exhibited mechanistic explanations; currently, the frontier of that still-ongoing process is in cognitive neuroscience. That doesn't prove that the universe is entirely materialistic or deterministic, but it does mean that the endeavor to understand the spiritual as the gaps of the mechanistic has been unsuccessful. This could be because the universe is mechanical after all, but I think it's because the dichotomy between the materialistic "figure" and the spiritual "ground" has been a false one from the outset.<br><br>That would make those European thinkers' error not that the universe is mechanical <i>a priori</i>, but that the divine can be isolated or circumscribed.<br><br>I guess we'll see, as this series continues, whether or not this represents a substantial disagreement with your views.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c4835683712572444128 title="comment permalink">7/2/15, 1:19 PM</a><br><br>

As for the 17th c Europeans beginning to think in terms of mechanistic explanations for things, well as a science-y undergraduate I was deeply amused and perplexed by Descartes' idea that the human body was controlled, joystick-like, by the pituitary gland, which, he hypothesized, moved around in its chamber opening and closing valves to direct flows of pressurized hydraulic fluid into the body's muscles, causing contraction and relaxation. In the mid 1600's! What a theory!<br><br>Thinking more as I've gotten older, I've come to see a specific block in current thought about the history of science: more general historians tend to be ignorant (and apathetic) of the science, and historians of science tend to be ignorant of all other history, and view development of thought as completely independent of all else: for them science just develops, and social conditions come in only insofar as authorities of orthodoxy periodically step in to squash its nobility, which, triumphantly, they always fail to do.<br><br>As a result, we the (reasonably informed) public tend to have two histories in our heads, which we almost never connect with one another: historical events like wars, revolutions, etc on the one hand, and development of thought (Aristotle, Galileo, Kant, etc) on the other. In what JMG is bring to our attention, very few seem to consider there may have been a broader social-historical reasons people fled from animistic or divine theories of the world into the prosaics of grinding gears, hydraulics, and mechanical functioning of dead matter. <br><br>As examples, I've been shocked by how few people know Copernicus was a monk, or that his book was read widely even in Church circles and wasn't considered particularly troublesome until decades after his death.<br><br>How many people know the terrible social backdrop of Descartes' time (toward the end of ~100 years of warfare and social disintegration)? That he was an artillery officer and military engineer with the Catholic League in the 30 Years War? That many of his mathematical achievements (the Cartesian plane) came partly out of his more practical work computing trajectories of cannonade fire?<br><br>How many know Isaac Newton was raised during and in the aftermath of the English Civil War? That he survived the Great Plague of London as a young man? Or what a bitter, friendless adult he became? That he considered his greatest works to be on eschatology and alchemy? How many realize Einstein, a professor in Germany, developed and published the Field Equations (100 years ago, in 1915) surrounded by the tumult and privation of WWI?<br><br>There are many such examples. I do actually have some views on *why* the mechanical narrative may have came to the fore---maybe worth something, maybe not. You all, and JMG, can let me know.

The basic model of solar-core fusion reactions survived the challenge of the neutrino-deficit problem a few years ago, so that part is okay. But I gather from a modest read of <i>Sky and Telescope</i> news columns that something pretty basic, elsewhere in the overall solar-physics picture, has in the last couple of years had to be revised: whereas it used to thought that there was only one layer of pole-versus-equator circulation below the photosphere, strong reasons have now emerged for positing two layers. This apparently changes the conception of how magnetic fields get moved around in the solar interior, as the 22-year solar magnetic cycle runs its course. While one does not want to attribute to the Sun the baffling intricacy of a bacterium (with all that scary information technology going on at the level of DNA and RNA - some megabytes of information, I think, being transcribed during mitosis, and impressively large numbers of bits being transcribed even in protein synthesis), the Sun does not look simple. A thoughtful pagan would be inclined to worship the Sun: so vast, so ancient, so stable in its self-regulation! so cunning in deforming the local geometry of spacetime, causing local stellar constellation patterns to get measurably distorted during total eclipse; with such a wonderfully slow and dignified spin, the spin rate varying elegantly from latitude to latitude; with a baffling temperature transition as you ascend from photosphere into corona; with magnetohydrodynamics obstinately resisting the attempts of professors, armed with supercomputing clusters, to create observation-conformant models; and so musical, being (literally, not metaphorically) full of propagating sounds, of so many varied frequencies! <br><br>The Sun is sort of the Huge Ringing Thing, humming in decorous polyphony in the company of its many colleagues in our galactic arm. <br><br>Although the picture of the heavens as mechanical, with the Sun as a rather inert orrery globe, was natural in the paucity of Newton-era observational astronomy, it is not the picture which would now first suggest itself to the lively naive child. A lively five-year-old, seeing spots in solar projection, and being shown some films of the conjectured underlying bulk-matter movements, and hearing a short account of temperature distributions and sound waves, might be instead inclined to reach for biological similes and metaphors. <br><br>Equally, or even more, unsatisfactory is mechanical language when we turn from the sun to the wider vistas of stellar and galactic astronomy, and cosmology. <br><br>One has some sympathy for the ancient Finns, according to whom the universe <i>hatched</i> (the <i>Kalevala</i> apparently talks about "monat", "eggs" - "munad" in Estonian; I don't really speak Finnish). <br><br>Mechanical language somehow deadens things, emptying them of their truth. <br><br>Tom <br><br>www dot metascientia dot com<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c5386000251195030864 title="comment permalink">7/2/15, 2:42 PM</a><br><br>

I thought I'd try to give a view on the intelligentsia's flight from animism.<br><br>The revolution in thought JMG brings up was roughly during and just after the very peak of warfare, witch/heretic burnings, and political chaos of the Wars of Religion and the 30 Years War.<br><br>I see three things bringing about the thought-change: the previously un-heard of power and material devastation of roughly 100 years of warfare, which including depopulation of central Europe by a third to a half. By proportionality to population levels, etc, this period was far worse than WWI and WWII combined, and left Europe shell-shocked and deeply awed by the power of material reality---an awe that in previous ages was given to the divine....or the demonic. <br><br>Second, the revolution in politics, and the definitive subordination of religion to secular power, slammed face-first into the prior worldview where that subordination was reversed.<br><br>Third, the deep rending of almost all old moral certainties, including the irreparable destruction of the (perceived) unity of Christendom that came with the Reformation. Also came the marriage (or maybe exploitation) of Christian ideals with material power and the devastation warfare, which left many people not just apathetic to, but disgusted with anything smacking of high ideals or even a divine presence in the world.<br><br>A few lines of evidence: Read the letters of Galileo. They are dripping with disgust for everything around him, most particularly purveyors of any kind of political or religious authority. In my reading, immersing himself in the simple, predictable workings of non-human things (like the moons of Jupiter) appeared to be about his only joy.<br><br>Or look at the art of Rembrandt (roughly contemporaneous with Descartes, Galileo, Kepler). In contrast to the older Renaissance Jesus----high in the clouds, majestically clothed, with a perfect body----Rembrandt's Jesus is a simple man. The expression is of deep troubles, or deep compassion, or maybe deep love, and he appears to be a man of passivity. The color tone is dark, and the point of view is head on, not looking up. This is a Jesus of the common world, not a Jesus of divine mystery.<br><br>And then think of the presentation of the scientific works. The original engraving on Copernicus' de Revolutionabus (several generations earlier) had both scientific and religious imagery, depicted so to clearly show the proper place of science within the world system, which is organized on a divine principle. So, eg, the tools of the scientist (ruler, sextant, etc) are somewhat lower and to the left of the symbols of divinity (cross, bible, etc), and all underneath the brilliant sun (divinity itself).<br><br>Then look at Kepler's Astronomia Nova, about a century later, in the time period we're discussing. Strikingly, the image engravings are PURELY SECULAR. No sun, no tiara, no cross, no bible. Just math and science symbols.<br><br>Yeah. So something big happened to the social mood in the century between Copernicus and Kepler. I believe it was the traumatic (not to mention physically violent) rending of the western mind from religion, and a consequent reaction of disgust, that caused a sizeable fraction of the intelligentia to cling tightly, tightly, tightly to a purely material, mechanistic worldview.<br><br>This worldview had the advantage of being apolitical and areligious, so had the chance to separate individuals from the social realities of power, politics, and religion------burnings, executions, emerging new orders of politics/religion, social chaos, and the dizzying, wrenching removal of old moral certainties.<br><br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c7872786227539247473 title="comment permalink">7/2/15, 3:20 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not hung up on the "deterministic" vs "random" issue. And as somebody else commented here, a lot of known physics revolves around the statistical behavior of a large number of random events. Thanks to the "law of large numbers" the macroscopic behavior is NOT random. But in any case, the thing that grabs me is that the observed behavior of so many things seems to follow fairly simple mathematical rules. Like that stone falling into the well - it's not that there aren't other ways to measure the depth of the well, it's that the stone accelerates according to a simple equation. This type of behavior of the world around us, to my mind, excludes any "supernatural" influence. If there was such, with so many motivated influencers, the orderly behavior would vanish. Also to my mind living beings are not outside this realm of natural law, just more complicated.<br><br>It also brings up the question of the connection of abstract math, and logic in general, to "the real world" - why is human logic applicable to nature? On that, my guess is that our brains and their built-in logic evolved to make sense of the phenomena around us. Thus it is not surprising that in realms that are far from the human scale, either very small (sub-atomic level), or very large (astronomical), the needed math or logic gets farther and farther from what our brains consider reasonable. Thus the role of probability in quantum mechanics, relativity with its curved space and flexible time, and so forth.<br><br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c2152506000426762302 title="comment permalink">7/2/15, 7:59 PM</a><br><br>

Our being may be some sort of disruption of space. Kind of like an eddy or other organized disruption of the larger current of a stream.

More generally, of course, you're quite right; as e.e. cummings pointed out a good long time ago, "a world of made is not a world of born"...<br><br>Chloe, hostility? Not at all; wry amusement. By the way, the notion that atheism can be described as simply an abstract attitude toward claims about the existence of one or more deities is generally called "dictionary atheism," and the vast differences between it and atheism as actually practiced in the Anglo-American world -- European atheism is a rather different kettle of fish -- has been the subject of lively discussion for several years now. <br><br>Caryn, congrats on the soap et al.! You're not the only one who's mentioned a feeling of unease in the air; we'll see if it leads anywhere. The Google devils (I refuse to grant them the dignity of gods) must be messing with you -- I haven't changed the security here. <br><br>Das Monde, good heavens, no -- what's the point of teasing a machine? As for the decline of civilizations, no, that's a biological thing; machines run until they break down, while living things, civilizations among them, go through predictable life cycles. <br><br>Denys, exactly. The only way to replace a dysfunctional narrative in somebody's mind is to present a functional narrative that's more appealing. That's one of the basic skills of magic, by the way. <br><br>Justin, I've been wondering about those sharks myself. It's really rather odd. <br><br>Lawfish, you might be a Druid -- or you might be something else; there are, thank the gods, many more options besides Southern Baptist and atheist, after all!<br><br>Raven, got 'em, and you're in the contest. I probably should post a reminder to everyone: you've got two months to go to get your stories finished and submitted; the deadline, and it's a firm one, is August 30. <br><br>Cherokee, a lot of mystics have experienced the universe as a single vast organism, so you're following a well-trodden path there!<br><br>William, I'm not sure if today's thinking is oxymoronic or the regular unoxygenated kind, but either way, it amounts to the same thing. ;-) Glad you liked that bit. <br><br>Andy, human beings have created dozens of different ways of dealing with the world. One of the reasons we're so clumsy at dealing with the world in the modern US is that we've limited ourselves to just the two ways you've described. <br><br>Rashakor, oh, I know!

In point of fact, once quantum indeterminacy was proved, the entire philosophy of determinism crashed to the ground. I should probably do a post on that one of these days; it's highly relevant. <br><br>Nick, given your situation, that seems entirely reasonable. <br><br>Brian, good. If a perfectly logical language could be created, it would by definition be very poorly suited to express most human thoughts and experiences, since logic embraces so very small a fraction of the whole range of human existence. <br><br>Bruce, interesting. I haven't taken part in the invention of any technologies, and my background as a writer leads me to see the creative process as one in which the author does have a very active role, though it's often as much a matter of discovery of possibilities as it is one of creating things from scratch. <br><br>Sgage, I rather like "deity mode of speech" -- in Hebrew, as I recall from such Cabala as I absorbed, the true name of the Deity is a form of the verb "to be." A case might be made that only deities have the right to use that verb!<br><br>Adrian, I have some very specific models in mind for the future, as I'm sure you'll have noticed! As for nature's momma, well, yes -- most religions assign nature a mother, though the Abrahamic ones tend to fall short there. <br><br>Redoak, that's an excellent point. I probably need to read up on current scholarship on the spread of Machiavelli's ideas in early modern Europe. I recall that Elizabethan English authors used to like to write his name Machevil, which has its own charms. <br><br>Cathy, the confusion is difficult but it's essential. It's when people grasp that it doesn't matter that they're Americans, all those things are still being done to them anyway, that a potential window for change opens. (Of course what climbs through the window could be somebody in jackboots and an armband -- that's one of the risks of times like these.)<br><br>Nathan, no, actually, we don't agree. I think it's considerably more likely that the federal government will be no more competent at exerting force here in the US than it was in Iraq, and a repeat of the same modes of failure here will more than likely bring the whole structure crashing down. We live in a prerevolutionary society. Nor is anywhere else noticeably safer, especially for American expats. <br><br>Yupped, well, we'll see! Happy birthday, btw -- I hope you enjoy the book. <br><br>Michael, no question there. One Chinese news source is claiming that the PLA might be deployed against Islamic State -- not impossible, if the PLA wants to get some live combat experience, and is interested in squashing any attempt to get a similar insurgency going in Chinese Turkestan. <br><br>Jeannette, fascinating. No, it's not in the book, and it's fascinating to see so forthright a challenge to the "you must hate progress" thoughtstopper. Many thanks for sharing it. <br><br>One Gun, true enough; any of my readers who haven't yet gotten the idea that flexibility, resilience, and a willingness to be poor are good ideas, though, are probably beyond my help at this point.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c7166902661665634740 title="comment permalink">7/2/15, 11:28 PM</a><br><br>

I think the incarnate human -- I prefer that phrasing to "meat suit" since there's far more than meat going into the whole system of the bodymind -- is capable of making, if not wise, then at least wiser judgments; certainly it's capable of making stupider ones!<br><br>Robo, that's one viewpoint, but from my perspective it's rather too anthropocentric -- as though the dust mites on your skin were to consider themselves crucial to the well-being of your body. I'm with H.P. Lovecraft on this one: "We live on a placid isle of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far." <br><br>Over the Hill, true enough -- Barfield's got a crucial point there. The act of observation always presupposes a given sensorium, nervous system, and cultural and personal patterns of configuring raw sensation into meaningful patterns, and so the scientific notion of the passive observer seeing "what's there" is quite simply nonsense from start to finish. <br><br>Heather, oh, granted! And we could have just as much fun taking apart the concept of "universe," which is far from simple, and has plenty of implicit presuppositions hardwired into it as well. <br><br>Tim, I'll consider a post on the vices of English one of these days; it would take that to show why I think English is more problematic than most other languages, and why the things it does well probably shouldn't be done at all. <br><br>Wizzard, er, where did you get the idea that I think it's all going to melt down in a year? My first book, remember, wasn't called <i>The Short Descent</i>. <br><br>Daergi, true enough, and the points you've made all feed into the machine-mindedness of the modern world. What a digital watch makes me think of is how much less annoying it would be if crunched underneath a bootheel, but then I suppose I'm just crabby. ;-)<br><br>Anton, er, we're not talking about the Victorian age; we're talking about a good two centuries earlier, when the rich showed their status by how many servants they had and mechanical toys were associated with people who had to work with their hands. Please check your facts!<br><br>Unknown, now if they'd just said "a river is a flow of sediment as well as flow of water," and avoided the unjustified teleology embodied in the label "machine," they'd have had something useful to say!<br><br>Dammerung, very good indeed. You get tonight's gold star for pointing and laughing at one of the least attractive unclothed emperors in the palace of contemporary thought. I have no idea why anyone takes logical positivism seriously; as you point out, its own basic axioms fail the test they themselves impose. <br><br>Foo Bar, and when the market sneezes and a lot of dust goes away in a hurry, you discover the other reason why the value of twinkle dust is less than meets the eye...<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c4937288929193710991 title="comment permalink">7/2/15, 11:50 PM</a><br><br>

Anglo-American atheism is by and large a very different thing from the European version -- it tends to be much angrier, more dogmatic, and more intolerant -- and even so, I've encountered plenty of pleasant, thoughtful atheists in the US and Britain who aren't obsessed with the idea that it's their duty to destroy religion once and for all. <br><br>Grey, as noted earlier, living things are far more predictable in certain ways than machines are; you don't know when a machine is going to break down, but you can figure out fairly well when the different stages of a life cycle are going to come into play. "Mechanistic" and "chaotic" aren't the only two options, you know!<br><br>Pantagruel, not a single favorite, but a handful. Of my novels, <i>Star's Reach</i>; of my occult books, <i>Inside a Magical Lodge</i>, with <i>The Celtic Golden Dawn</i> a close runner-up; of my collapse-related books, <i>After Progress</i>. <br><br>Sven, fascinating.

There are people who are living off grid, outside the money economy, who are much further along than I am, for example. Still, the point I wanted to make is that the closer we get to the oncoming crises, the less room there'll be for the more grandiose (and more expensive) options, which so many people tend to treat as the only game in town. <br><br>Myriad, actually, the idea that the properties of living tissue were strictly mechanical was in circulation in the seventeenth century; some of the major figures of the scientific revolution of that era, Descartes among them, proclaimed that as necessary truth, even though it took medical science centuries to catch up. Thus I have to disagree with your argument: the founders of the scientific revolution started with an image of the universe as a machine of dead matter in which God and human souls were the ghosts in the machine, and proceeded to build their sciences on that presupposition. <br><br>As for shark attacks and church fires -- hmm.

I don't see that as an accident; unless you do that, the whole mythology of progress falls apart and you're left with just a story of how people in one set of societies chose to think about, and act on, the universe. <br><br>Toomas, thank you for this! Clearly it's been too long since I've read up on the solar sciences. <br><br>Andropos, I think that was a very large part of it. At the same time, there are important continuities between the religious currents of the centuries before the scientific revolution and the revolution itself -- the devaluing of concrete experience, dating back to the Greek philosophers, the rise of Nominalism, and so on. It's a complex picture. <br><br>Ares, funny you should mention that last point. I field a couple of comments a week insisting, usually in the language of dogmatism, that free will doesn't exist and that the idea of free will has to be expunged. That's amusingly contradictory as it stands -- if free will doesn't exist, people who believe in free will have no choice but to do so, and so there's no point trying to change their minds -- but it seems to me that there's something profoundly poisonous underlying the entire crusade against free will, and I always delete such comments out of hand.

Apparently that legend began with Galileo himself, where I guess I read it. Here's what I found out (in case anyone's interested, maybe no one is---from the book "Copernicus and his Successors").<br><br>He was definitely a "canon," which could mean a kind of non-ordained sub-cleric, but could also mean a full priest or monk. But most circumstantial evidence points to his never being fully ordained. Still, he was a man of faith, and during certain stretches of his life being a "canon" actually appears to have been his full-time job. It appears he was once considered for a bishopric, which certainly would have required an ordination. But that never materialized.<br><br>His "de Revolutionibus" was reasonably well read in the highest intellectual circuits. We have pamphlets both praising and condemning it, and records of its being taught in universities, all dating to the decades after its 1543 publication. At first the most strident faith-based condemnations came from protestant areas---though of course those tended to be the most violent and troubled areas just then.<br><br>Some of the early criticisms actually seem very rational! Eg. Copernicus couldn't actually get his mathematical model to work in any usefully predictive way, and he used a variety of ad hoc fixes, including heavy borrowing from Ptolemaic mathematical models.

For one thing, didn’t Greeks and Romans like Democritus or Lucretius reduce the world to a set of physical pieces that ran together along rules, in a machine-like fashion? They created the first machines as well, like the first steam engine (by Hero of Alexandra). What was different about what Enlightenment-era scholars were doing?<br><br>Also, you began by proposing that global superpowers were behaving a certain way because they were treating the world like a machine; do you think machine-thinkers have always been doing this? Foolishness seems to me as old as the hills, and the specific foolishness you cite seem very recent; neither seems to date to the Enlightenment. Do you think it’s an over-abundance of machines in our lives that causes this phenomenon, or the absence of anything more organic? Let me know if I’m misunderstanding your thesis. <br><br>A related question: What is the difference between scientific thinking and machine thinking? This is rather important to me, for I've always found science in its many senses (the pursuit of knowledge, the logical system of investigation, and the wonders we’ve discovered) to bring out the best in humanity. I never saw it as a threat to my religion, as fundamentalist Christians do, nor as a religion itself, as fundamentalist atheists do, but as a vital part of intellectual life and a complement to spiritual enlightenment. <br><br>I hope you don’t mind my piling on arguments and questions – I know you like food for thought.

Then for various reasons found employment in the computer industry. I remember how drawn to programming I was in those early years. Whereas with writing history essays I was encouraged to intellectualize and explore ideas and argue this or that theory, with computer programming the logic either worked or it didn't. It was relatively clear-cut, and problems could be resolved and finalized in ways that intellectual inquiry could not be, at least not fully. Sitting at my computer, writing code to manage databases and perform calculations and spit out reports, I had a temporary sense of being able to control my environment, to play by fixed rules, to get to a resolution. It was quite illusory, of course. As IT got going in the 80s and 90s, the sector generated very large scale automation projects which often went badly wrong, as soon as they ran into all the usual uncertainties of life (vague goals, unclear requirements, mismatched interfaces, changing personalities, poorly calculated budgets, etc). I don't know if this sheds any light on the subject, but I've always considered my own early attraction to computers to be linked to my desire for logical clarity and control.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c5761854670169474829 title="comment permalink">7/3/15, 6:15 AM</a><br><br>

The latter he would assume had "artificers" and had been dropped by the owner. The stone could have been there forever. Apparently the example of the watch (the machine) as an analogy with intricate creatures and plants had been well used before he published his argument. Not surprisingly, as we know, Dawkins took up the argument in his 'Blind Watchmaker' and tries to make the most of the analogy for his purpose. <br><br>This is all history, and a fair bit of it is documented as JMG makes us aware. And the idea of 'the Creator' had been around for much longer of course than science or the dominant machines of our invention. I suppose hypothetically it was easier historically to get the idea of one Creator rather than lots of candidate or contending ones. But I guess many (most?) cultures did not think about existence in this way; that is in terms of Genesis? Thus, the whole tradition formed round conjecturing the 'mind' of a Creator is very much 'our' legacy? I would be interested to know whether the Hebrew were first into the field. <br><br>Incidentally, the logic of 'creation' has a certain potency to this day; we are still not clear whether there has been parallel life creation here or elsewhere. Earth life is all very closely related and looks like one spreading lineage, despite the diversity. <br><br>If none of the disembodied entitities - in the case that any culture sees and acknowledges them as such - are Creators, then we don't see a 'Machine'? Query? It feels to me that in modern times knowledge of what looks like our single biological lineage (Life-singular, and the reasonable guesses as to the date of conception), sends us back to old contentions and modes of thought from our cultural legacy.

But as long as the ghosts in the machine are believed to act upon the machine as was generally accepted and that Descartes didn't deny (e.g. that free will exists and God acts), the universe cannot be entirely mechanical. Odd that they would miss that. Unless by universe they meant the universe apart from human beings and God.<br><br>If so, that's a more fundamental problem. The ineffable aside, "the universe apart from human beings" is hardly a coherent concept, as humans and the world interact constantly and shape one another deeply.

As usual, the conversation follows multiple, parallel paths and I'm struggling to coalesce my thoughts.<br>(JMG and commentators, you are all amazing. I always learn so much from you.)<br>Any activity that is quiet, rhythmic, moderately physical but not too strenuous seems best for ruminating. As our economy unravels I guess one advantage will be that more of us will do the quiet, physical work and fewer will do the multitasking, distracted work. It will be a more fertile ground for thinking.<br>Words, metaphors, maps are not the thing itself, but useful in pointing the way, to communicate and remember what we know through the senses. Everyone at ADR already understands this.<br>I think our cultural psychosis comes from not making our own stories; we consume someone else's stories whether or not they have anything to do with us. This is very recent, at least to the extent that it includes almost everyone in the West except those on the fringes. I have been in so many conversations when an interesting topic comes up and then somebody diverts the conversation to a TV show they think is relevant. This drives me up the wall. I eagerly anticipated someone's real experiences, and then I all I get is a TV show! As Denys commented: "once the story is implanted, nothing they could say or do could change the effect of the story."<br>Another comment that really struck me from Daergi: "The order in which we experience things seems to matter."<br>I grew up with TV and it's frightening to think that my worldview was originally framed by 60s sitcoms before I actually got out in the world.<br>I'm not saying that all mass marketed stories are wretched drivel. There are movies and novels that speak to my experience and expand it. But we live in a culture that discourages people from making their own stories. When we are convinced that this is a waste of time, that we should be too busy for this, we all go crazy.<br>We go crazy because of an unmet, primeval need to directly know the world. Wherever people are together without distraction, once they relax, the stories begin. "Shooting the bull" is absolutely not a waste of time. One can imagine the previous 150,000 years around the campfire. Before language or cave art, we knew things through the senses alone. Our economic decline gives us a chance to reconnect with the other 99% of our collective experience. <br>The wind in the trees, the crisp smell of autumn leaves, the soft crepuscular light of a forest, these are things I "know." A destiny in the stars, or the Singularity, or some other nonsense provides no context for us, nothing to be lived. These are empty abstractions.<br>I always liked Jack Kerouac's definition of literature: That which is written for no other reason than companionship.

I doubt if you could rebut an atheist assertion that the universe is a self organizing system whose evolution is indistinguishable from the evolution of a machine. I believe the resolution to this is to understand that there is a formal logical structure in quantum mechanics, for instance, which we may take as the foundation of science for the sake of argument. One form of this logical structure is found in causality, the notion that causes must precede effects, as an illustration. This would correspond to only one of the 5 bases of knowledge in the classification popular in ancient Greece. Magic and miracles would fall under pistis, one of the other classes of knowledge. Certainly it is not fashionable to talk about knowledge based on well reasoned analysis of experience--after all the medieval scholastics would have probably burned at the stake had they talked about alternatives to knowing God outside the auspices of the Medieval Church. My point is that any formal logical understanding of any Deity/deities is simply not possible, and your knowledge of the same must come from other sources, with all the pitfalls that entails. For instance, to subject the Judeo-Christian God to the limits of ordinary causality would reduce him to the status of simply a technologically advanced ET, something that would not fly well at the local church or synagogue! If quantum mechanics describes nature, then magic and miracles must be called supernatural (or your deities are reduced to the equivalent of little green men in flying saucers from Zeta Reticuli.)<br><br>If your life experiences and thinking them over lead you to draw conclusions that there are things outside of time (i.e., acausal, outside ordinary limits of causality), then you are dealing with the supernatural, something that transcends the ordinary laws of nature.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c6837041697949193900 title="comment permalink">7/3/15, 2:53 PM</a><br><br>

I can't help but note that you said the perceived unity of Christendom ended with the Reformation. But there was unity from around the time of Constantine until 1054, when the churches of the east separated themselves from the papacy. It's not like they are small. Numerically, they comprise the second largest Christian denomination after the Roman. And interestingly, of the 5 original "Holy Sees" of the ancient world, 4 are still Eastern Orthodox. The one which is not, of course, is Rome. Somehow, the very existence of the Orthodox east is almost erased or forgotten.

You would have to be inside the Sun's gases to actually hear anything. (My GUESS here is that you would indeed have to be not even in the corona or the chromosphere, but either in the photosphere or below it.The photosphere is where the solar gases first become dense enough, on our downward journey, to be opaque: it is what we would be tempted to call the Sun's "surface", were we to forget that even the photosphere is gaseous, as opposed to solid or liquid.) When still outside the Sun's gases on our imagined downward journey, we are in the (near-) vacuum of solar-system space. So the right picture here is one in which you have a big sphere of liquid water, sitting in free space, say in the deep interstellar void (we posit angels or demons to keep the water temperature above freezing), with something in or on the water making sound - storms on the surface of the water blob would do the trick, as would a duly submerged opera singer. To the observer outside the blob, all would be silent. For an observer donning scuba gear and swimming on or below the surface of the blob, on the other hand, much would be heard - as indeed we know from common childhood experience under water. (The underwater realm as explored in childhood can be QUITE noisy: rocks struck together make a satisfyingly loud click, for instance, since sound propagates well in dense liquids. Clicking rocks together under water makes a click, when you have your ears under water, pleasantly louder than the banal sound of rocks clicking together in air.) <br><br>It does have to be added that the sounds propagating in the Sun are not necessarily of frequencies familiar from terrestrial music. We can hear down to 50 Hz or 20 Hz or 15 Hz, as the organist presses the absolute lowest keys when accompanying that "sparkling basso profundo from Novosibirsk". I think sound in the Sun is of FAR lower frequencies (not 15 Hz, i.e., 15 cycles-per-second, but maybe just a few cycles per hour). Admittedly, I don't have the number for a typical solar note. This lowness of note, as Bertrand Russell remarked in some different context, is a mere medical matter, devoid of conceptual import. <br><br>One further surprising fact might be noted. Solar matter is in an exotic way dense as you go down deep - far denser than water, and in fact some many tens or low hundreds of times denser than lead or tungsten. (Maw Kerniak, maybe you can give us some numbers??) And yet - this is the surprising fact - even at these exotic densities, we do **NOT** get an exotic state of matter: the Sun obeys the Ideal Gas Law, Pv = nRT, all the way down, just as the column of air in the humble high school Boyle-demonstration manometer does. <br><br>Finally, I note that a hasty Google on <br><br>sound waves in the sun<br><br>brings results.

Middle C is around 256 Hz. Every time you halve<br>that frequency you go down one octave. Since 1 Hz is (256 Hz)(1/2)(1/2)(1/2)(1/2)(1/2)(1/2)(1/2)(1/2), i.e., is 256 Hz halved 8 times, 1 Hz is 8 octaves below Middle C. (Even Boris Shtokolov could not reach THAT note. But apparently if you put a human in the vicinity of a hi-fi woofer, or some similar gear, sounding that dismally low note, the human will not hear anything, and yet will feel strangely uneasy, as a marked emotional reaction occurs for some neurological reason: thus we might be able to fool the credulous into thinking that our living room is haunted by "numinous presences from Beyond", as we charge big bucks for our seance.) Well, in pondering the Sun we have to reach not even 1 Hz, i.e., one oscillation per second, but 0.003 Hz, i.e., one oscillation per 300 seconds. This is easily computed - 0.003 Hz is approx equal to 1 Hz halved a further eight or nine times. So a typical solar note is 8+8 or 8+9 or so octaves below Middle C, i.e., is 16 or 17 octaves below Middle C. <br><br>For Boris Shtokolov, cf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43EWbWDxA5Q, video by <br>khankonchak uploaded 2008-01-20.

My guess is that people will chase every imaginable excuse to avoid giving up on the myth of progress. <br><br>Phil, scientists aren't trained to think in terms of having to make a decision; quite the contrary, their training leads them to put off a final call whenever they're not confident -- which is good in research, and unworkable when it comes down to having to say whether a technology is safe to deploy or not. <br><br>Brian, good! All those are solid questions, and each one of them would probably require a post of its own to answer adequately. I'll see what I can do. <br><br>Ursachi, fair enough!<br><br>Tyler, good. Notice, however, that the idea that the universe could be a gigantic clock didn't catch the European imagination until the 17th century. Until then, the clock was simply one clever device produced by a culture that was no better at clever devices than, say, China, even if it was better at them than Byzantium. Clearly, as the intellectual history of the Middle Ages shows, you can have clocks without thinking of the universe as a clock -- just as you can have windmills without thinking of the universe as a windmill. It might have been interesting if that, rather than the clock, had been the technology that gave the founders of the scientific revolution their model for the cosmos!<br><br>Nathan, but I don't expect empty shelves and the rest of it, for reasons I've discussed here many times. I think the model you're using is far too simplistic, and doesn't take into account the abundant evidence from history of how these things unfold -- and if you say "but it's different this time!" I'm going to laugh myself into hiccups.

That was dignified, impressive -- and appropriate; I don't think it's at all improper to ask atheists to do the same thing. Should the same rule apply to Druids?

The concept "crow" includes the concept "black" and "bird." Is every black bird a crow? Not hardly. <br><br>Onething, it was a central theme of Greek philosophy, and has been very common (though not universal) in western thought since then, to see actual existing things -- say, the mug full of tea on my desk right now -- as somehow less real than the more abstract realities that supposedly underlay those things. To Plato, the idea of the cup was more real than the cup; to a modern scientist, the quantum particles that have been invented as theoretical constructs to explain the behavior of the matter forming the cup are more real than the cup.

Greece failing will not end the world, nor any other country - but will they get smarter and go their own way or stay in the same vortex of idiocy? My bet is minimal change, to hang on to BAU and a silly government, so things just ratchet downward another notch.<br><br>In this country, there is a certain area or two (a wide strip from VA to NY comes to mind) where everything is illusory. I mean most everything is truly illusory and people have little direct contact with each other even living next door. Outside of that zone, things are better, but still the metropolitan areas across the country are replicas of this 'zone of illusion'. The remaining areas are much less illusory, where people interact personally day to day, know things about what is happening in the neighborhood and enjoy life at a slower pace. We don't worry about things like Smartmeters, because there is no pervasive wifi or even cable television.<br><br>Funny, the world was great when I was in my 30's, and internet was text only, cell phones were in a bag and not ubiquitous, and cars got 30 MPG or close to it. My 1984 Accord got 45 MPG with all amenities - so no progress there, even with digital assistance. Collapse and less tech is not only survivable but more enjoyable and likely safer overall.

Paul Henry's challenge in particular was against a machine. <br><br>These stories were real important for me growing up.

"The universe is a machine" should be interpreted as "The universe is in the set of machines", the universe being equivalent to a machine just seems strange. But that is completely unimportant.<br><br>The second would be that whether or not the universe is or is not of the machine family, it can be extremely difficult to reason about machines. For example when given a model representing a set of machines working together it can be extremely difficult to determine whether or not the rules which you use to govern there behavior will ensure that they will never smash into each other or get into a situation where they all block each others progress, this is before you take into account all the real world things which you never knew about or otherwise abstracted from the model. To drone on a bit, this problem turns out to be NP-Hard. It should also be pointed out that generally human machines are designed in a modular way which makes reasoning about them easier. Anyway my point would be that even if the Universe were taken to be one big machine that wouldn't necessarily mean that the Universe could be fully understood. No I do not believe that the Universe is a machine.<br><br>Thirdly, not directly referenced in your post. My suspicion is that as far as intelligence (if not wisdom) possessed by a singular centralized physical being goes, humans likely are in the upper ranges of what is practical there. My suspicion is that higher levels of intelligence require decentralization. I base this upon the fact that most of the better algorithms for dealing with complex problems are based upon simulating multiple agents acting independently, but with limited communication between the agents in order to enable collaboration, an example of this would be evolutionary algorithms.<br><br>Also I'm not certain whether this is relevant or not but are you aware of the case described in this article http://archive.bcs.org/bulletin/jan98/leading.htm, in which an intelligent designer used evolution in order to create a logic circuit he himself did not understand how worked.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c5585896290603567996 title="comment permalink">7/4/15, 8:34 AM</a><br><br>

(By machine I mean a fully determined system -- whether mechanical, symbolic (math), software, etc.). And that is that a sufficiently complex machine's behavior can no longer be determined/predicted by humans. And it doesn't take a very complex computer program at all such that the person who wrote it can't predict what it will do given a certain set of inputs. So in THEORY it's deterministic, but in PRACTICE it's not -- because our intelligence is so profoundly finite. I've worked on software projects with millions of lines of code -- who can grasp that?<br><br>This is part of the history you describe: the Enlightenment started out with relatively simple cognitive machines -- Newton's physics, even with calculus, is within the reach of high school students; Einstein's general relativity not at all, and quantum physics is vastly worse.<br><br>So we have our wonderful machines (cognitive and physical) -- the economy, medicine (the body is just a machine), Gaia is just a machine -- and now we're at the point between choosing between machines we can understand but they don't work because they're too simplistic, or machines that work better but we no longer understand them (or at least their implications!).<br><br>Hubris is a fundamental problem of our age. We think we're smart enough to construct these enormous cognitive machines that will work, and we're not. And we all know what happens to folks with Hubris in the ancient Greek plays -- Zeus zaps 'em with lightning bolts.<br><br>BTW, I'm minded of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem (1931 – a landmark proof of the 20th century with quite a story behind it): that given any non-trivial formal system (e.g. 'machine') there will be states/statements that can neither be demonstrated true/possible nor false/impossible – thus every formal system/machine is 'incomplete'. Its corollary is that no such system can demonstrate its own self-consistency -- indeed Gödel shows that if a system asserts that, that is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that it is INconsistent! The point is that even given a pure 'machine' like mathematics (unbounded by any practical considerations) and unbounded intelligence to contemplate it, there will ever be unknowable realms. So if the dream of the machine is not even possible in the realm of the Ideal, then how much less so when we try to construct them in our 'real' world. (BTW, one of the main reasons Einstein chose to go to the Institute of Advanced Studies was because Gödel was there. They went on daily walks together. The mind boggles at what those conversations must have been like.)<br><br>So Humility in general when facing the World is profoundly needed. I'm afraid as a species we're in for a well-deserved whupping. (The "Dream of the Machine" is turning into a nightmare!)<br><br>One last thought: one of Einstein's great insights is that even though we have two different words 'space' and 'time', he realized that they were really two different sides of the same coin and coined the term 'space-time'. Having separate words for things doesn't necessarily mean they are separate. I was recently reading some Robert Sardello, and he proposed the term 'human-world' for the same reason. It is a profound error of our age that humans and the natural world are two 'separate' things – when we aren’t.<br><br>Nature always has the last word -- she has billions of years at her disposal and we humans don't.<br><br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c7759685142777706628 title="comment permalink">7/4/15, 8:44 AM</a><br><br>

Certainly the body has a stunning array of algorithmic processes; maintaining bodily pH and its options for trying to return to homeostasis in the event there is a problem, for one small example among, no doubt, hundreds of thousands. But I have two, perhaps related, points. First, because what goes into the successful running of a human body is vast beyond our comprehension, it is probably premature and hubristic to be labeling what it is. It may very well be that something like the subconscious mind is required to run a body. <br><br>Second, we are looking at processes of life such as the body or Gaia, and we see that they are alive (jury being still out on Gaia) and we see that they have many fairly determined and chemically dependent processes, and conclude that life works like a machine. But life, a consciousness, can inhabit a suitable body yet it is not the body. I am not my body, or I am not me solely because of my body, although it has a fair amount to do with who I am. Or even, regardless to what extent one considers the mind/body to be a unity, it is still my point that it is not the atoms and molecules and the algorithms by which they run that make up the criterion by which we determine if I am a machine.<br><br>Well, I am the owner of several machines, by which I mean a human-designed artifact which does a task for me, and in some ways my body, my heart beat, is like that, but because there is a mind, a consciousness within it, it cannot be considered a machine.<br><br>It's not just complexity. Which is why I am skeptical any machine we design could become conscious. The only way it could is if a disembodied entity found it suitable and moved in and who knows if that is even possible. In biology as we know it, life comes from prior life, always. <br><br>It seems to me that in asking whether the body, planet or universe is a machine, we are basically asking whether life is real. Spirit.<br><br>+ JMG-<br>Speaking of real, I must confess to being a bit of a Platonist. But I dislike exclusionary thinking. Nirvana is samsara and the other way around. Of course the cup is real and also the most accessible aspect we can work with, at least in ordinary states of consciousness. In my worldview, material things are less real in that they are more contingent and dissolve more readily than ideas or pure consciousness. That is, its current form is less stable, further down the chain of being.<br><br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c1090613396843846203 title="comment permalink">7/4/15, 3:41 PM</a><br><br>

Some of them do get devoured by lions, though it rarely takes three of the big cats to do it. <br><br>Caryn, you and my other readers in and around China -- if you haven't done so already -- need to get copies of Galbraith's <i>The Great Crash 1929</i> and read that puppy immediately, if not sooner. The Chinese stock market is doing an absolutely classic 1929 bubble-and-bust, and the government is sticking precisely to Herbert Hoover's script as well. <br><br>Denys, I wouldn't mind at all -- quite the contrary, I'd be delighted. The whole point of writing that book was to encourage people to do things with it. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, just wait for Putin to start talking about Hope and Change...<br><br>Wizzard, equally, the world was great when the internet hadn't been invented in the first place. Technology doesn't actually make that much difference in how great the world is. <br><br>Prizm, yes, I think it would be a great idea, and I'm glad to hear that you'll be getting to work on it at once. ;-)<br><br>Dagnarus, that's fascinating. Do you realize that you may have just come up with a really original argument in favor of polytheism as opposed to monotheism? It's hard to think of a better example of decentralized divinity than a good old-fashioned polytheist pantheon, after all, with different aspects of existence assigned to different gods. Also, "the universe is in the set of machines" is a far clearer and more meaningful statement than "the universe is a machine" -- equally incorrect, but much clearer. <br><br>Wiliam, that's equally fascinating. What you seem to be suggesting -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- is that those who say "the universe is a machine" have a false idea of what machines are like, and are actually saying "the universe is like my mistaken notion of a machine: simple, predictable, subject to rigid laws, etc." That definitely deserves thought. <br><br>(Name I can't read), I suppose that's one way to look at it. From my perspective, belief is only one of many possible activities of the human mind, and no more important than the others. <br><br>J Thomas, I read about a bunch of people who figured out that World War II was coming. They sold all their possessions, left their homelands and moved to a distant country. They were European Jews, and they moved to the United States; as a result, they didn't get shipped to concentration camps, and their descendants are around today. Sometimes there is indeed a personal solution. <br><br>August, yes, there's a real difference between those who don't happen to believe in any gods, and those who fervently, passionately, devoutly believe that no gods exist and are offended by the fact that people disagree with that claim. It's unfortunate that the same moniker gets applied to both. If you'd like to meet atheists who are just as abusive, self-righteous, and dogmatic as any religious fundamentalist, I encourage you to try being the public head of a Druid order sometime; I can assure you that you'll get quite the show. <br><br>Onething, yes, I'd figured you were a bit of a Platonist; most Western mystics are. Nearly all my training as an occultist and mage had Neoplatonist ideas all through it, and I'm doing a lot of floundering just now as I try to make sense of things from what I suppose you'd have to call a post-Platonist worldview.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c991619966036548842 title="comment permalink">7/4/15, 6:42 PM</a><br><br>

Our understanding of the universe is limited by the models that we can compare it to. For example, take the question of "how does the heart work?" In antiquity they thought it like a furnace, then in more recent times it was a 'simple pump'. Later with the discovery of signalling we get ideas such as the heart being a coordinated set of muscles sometimes with deliberately chaotic modes. As our selection of models increases we apply them to things to get greater insight.<br><br>But the Universe itself is different. Trying to understand the universe ends up in you asking things like, "where did the laws of nature come from?" And we can talk about it being mechanistic here and there, but that does not mean it is a machine. A game board is mechanistic due to its rules but we don't say that the Universe is a game. The Universe has some features of a machine, then so does my hand, but living systems are vastly more complicated. The Universe itself is likely vastly more complicated than the mechanistic method of logical inference we can apply to it. The problem with assuming a mechanistic solution is that the real world is more subtle and we will be excluding whole categories of behaviour because it does not match our view. So, a civilisation is collapsing ... like a building, no it can be in stages, or have reversals, or have surprising communal resurgences, then arrive gently or abruptly at a new level, then forget its past so it can reinvent itself. Or all of the above.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c7400503429057035264 title="comment permalink">7/4/15, 10:32 PM</a><br><br>

For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked, and for the establishment of righteousness, I come into being from age to age."

The ‘precautionary principle’ was in effect ‘disallowed’. (OK; that’s all in the interest of facilitating ‘trade’ and ‘Progress’ i.e. ‘benefit’.) In the case of work where deployment was not expected – genetically engineered viruses for example – the risk assessment was on the likely effectiveness of ‘containment’, where the ‘precautionary principle’ tended to be assumed. <br><br>I take it that Logical Positivism, (or nowadays post-LP thinking?) if we can cut it down to a sentence, is about not accepting conjectures (figurations) of the world as ‘real’ unless they have been shown to be ‘real’ by inspection of evidence measured in line with standards of logical proof. In the case of genetically engineered crops, the assumption was that deployment was expected unless there was ‘knowledge’ that would restrict deployment. Thus any merely ‘plausible’ reason for disallowing deployment was not good enough.<br><br>Take another example of some LP in action (in admittedly a perhaps less stringent post-LP world), that is applied to decision-taking. Most modern medical guidance documents on assessment of risks from a disease condition itself on the one hand, and of efficacy of treatments on the other (for instance in cardiovascular disease), commonly stratify recommendations according to the ‘quality of evidence’ – the balance of contradictory evidence and so on, and ‘net-benefit’. This is always uncomfortable for an individual patient on the receiving end of Applied Statistics obtained from observing populations. Sub-dividing populations on the basis of ‘likeness’ always runs into ‘limits’ because the smaller the study population, the less sufficiently ‘powered’ it is to discriminate a ‘causal’ relationship. (Prof TC Campbell attempts an accessible explanation of this and related conundrums in his book <i>‘Whole’</i>.)<br><br>There is a case IMHO that in Applied Science we run into limits of diminishing relevance. “The more you know, the less you understand” and such like jokes?<br><br>best<br>Phil H<br><br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c900922924362849258 title="comment permalink">7/5/15, 4:58 AM</a><br><br>

Catholicism or other religions that believe in free will would not have led to deterministic science. It is also interesting that Newton was also into Alchemy which is a non-deterministic sort of "science". Many of his collaborators in this were Catholic as far as I know though I have not checked up on Neal Stephenson who is my source for this information(Quicksilver--part one of the Baroque Cycle).<br><br>There are quite a few Neo-Platonists in physics today such as me, Penrose and Ellis, but I think Penrose and Ellis might be dubious of free will and still see the universe as a partially non-material machine. I've toyed around with the idea that if the basic equations of physics (such as the Schrodinger or Dirac equations) were non linear in the time derivative they would have multiple solutions and determinism (even quantum probabilistic determinism) would be undermined. Another possible way to undermine determinism is to postulate (and experimentally find!) places where time ceases to exist or where spacetime has certain singularities so that all equations break down. Two such candidates are centers of black holes and signature changing surfaces (the latter might be quite common around some brains).<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c7919503158372165462 title="comment permalink">7/5/15, 9:02 AM</a><br><br>

As for Kepler's mom, I could only speculate. I love history, but I'm just an amateur. I do know that that area of southwest Germany was affected badly by the 30 years war.<br><br>Ok, I did a little checking and here's some background. With the insurrection of Bohemia in 1618, the religious divisions in the Baden-Wurttemburg area became political, with loyalist Catholics choosing union, and anti-Emperor protestants selecting for themselves a rival leader. With the very Elector of Palatine being chosen as head of the Protestant Union in 1619, this part of the country (the whole Wurttemburg area) came directly into the bulls-eye of the larger powers.<br><br>It looks like Kepler's mom was tried for sorcery in 1616, certainly before things got really out of hand. But she got away for some reason (it looks like she was found innocent! (chuckles)) and fled with her son. But then she apparently chose to return Wurttemberg and was imprisoned again in 1620. This was the same year Wurttemburg was invaded by the powerful Spanish army, which lived off the land and won the region siege-by-siege. Clearly both the leadership and the population were under considerable stress.<br><br>With a backdrop of this level of chaos and insecurity, I can only guess at the specific motivations of the people involved. But I'll say that witch-burnings, reaching a crescendo in Europe just then, was both a popular madness (fear reaction) and a tool of political terror.<br><br>One can surmise that Kepler himself would have had a powerful emotional reaction to the whole affair.

Thanks for the comments, and thanks for reading my long posts! Let me try to take up a few things you said.<br><br>As for how things could be as bad as WWI + WWII, well certainly this can be debated, but let me try to make my case. For a first approximation I would measure it by raw depopulation. In about 100 years of religious/political warfare, central Europe was depopulated by a third to a half or more (look this up for yourself!). Obviously not all of that was direct murder or war casualties; a lot of it would have been indirect effects of huge armies destroying cities and towns, living off the land (in those days, think of what that meant!), as well as trade disruptions of all sorts: trade centers were destroyed, farmers would withhold crops not even knowing who to sell crops to, or if they sold them to the wrong people whether they'd be killed or not, etc etc. Just think for yourself what a 16th c. refugee crisis would look like, as an army (which were getting much bigger by then) cut a swathe through the land, stealing, eating or burning everything that couldn't be taken away.<br><br>In WWI + WWII, of course the total number of deaths was much higher, but remember I said "proportional to population levels, etc". In the worst-hit areas in WWII, anywhere from 8-15% of the population was killed. That is horrible, but it is not the 30-50% of 1618-1648.<br><br>As for primitive warfare not achieving devastation like modern warfare.... I would agree it is harder for pikes, arquebuses, and canon to wreak the destruction of phosgene gas, machine guns, and incendiaries, but regardless of tools, I would say there is basically no upper limit to human destructiveness given sufficient commitment on the part of the perpetrators. Look at the Rwandan genocide: using mostly machetes and with a dysfunctional, inept leadership, they achieved an efficiency of ethnic slaughter roughly on par with the Nazis.<br><br>Not to mention other examples. Read about what Hulagu did in Mesopotamia in 1258. Or what Genghis did at Zhongdu in 1215, when this advanced city and its suburbs had a million people.<br><br>As to your third (I think?) point, indeed I said "perceived" for some of the very reasons you state. Of course I was talking specifically about the cultural background of the Kepler, Galileo, etc. Keep in mind that the world was far, far bigger in those days, and, for the most part, the belief systems present in Byzantium or among the Rus might have been on the moon as far north-west Europe was concerned.<br><br>I would agree that Church involvement in power politics was a huge factor, but also keep in mind that the Popes, though they tried, controlled much of European religion but never fully controlled European politics. It looks to me that the proximate causes of the Reformation can be traced to the Avignon Papacy, where a broad perception grew that the Pope was serving the French crown instead of God and the people. This lead the ideologically devastating Great Schism (starting 1378). With Popes excommunicating Popes and European powers choosing sides, the Pope literally became a joke throughout Europe and the Church's prestige was damaged and never repaired.<br><br>Almost immediately after this came the Renaissance Popes. I am not Catholic, but a Catholic priest once told me that just about the best argument for the divinity of the Catholic Church that it wasn't completely destroyed by the Renaissance Popes. I thought that was interesting.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c2902396318039801002 title="comment permalink">7/5/15, 4:47 PM</a><br><br>

The first (and seemingly dominant right now) is that he kept his ideas secret for many years out of fear of persecution, and had to smuggle a manuscript out of Catholic Poland to get it secretly published in protestant northern Germany, because Catholic authorities would outright prohibit it, and likely punish---or kill!---Copernicus himself.<br><br>The second narrative is that Copernicus, a scholar and expert in the highly mathematical Ptolemaic theory and much else besides, was certainly aware of (with most of the intelligentia of Europe) the Heliocentric model, which had existed since antiquity.<br><br>As a full-time canon and part-time scientist----and not particularly being in a rush until he found out that certain rivals were also developing heliocentric mathematical models----it simply took a long time to develop his theory, especially since he tried (and failed) many times to get the very sophisticated mathematics to work out. He looked around for a publisher in Poland, but couldn't find a satisfactory arrangement---the printing press being just a few decades old by then, quality was low and costs were high. When some students returned from a trip to Germany with books from German publication houses, he was very impressed with the quality, and decided to publish there instead of in Poland. Being quite old (almost 70!) and not being able/willing to leave his other duties and personally travel to Germany, he sent the manuscript with some of his students to Germany to get it published.<br><br>Perhaps tellingly, the famous unauthorized "preface" that some use to argue that religious censorship occurred, was written by a protestant, not by any Catholic authority figure. <br><br>Also, it would be quite reasonable to be impressed with German printing. We have Gutenberg bibles that are in good shape and can be leafed through even today---whereas I have books from my undergraduate days that have brittle pages and instantly-cracking bindings.<br><br>So I'm not going to tell you I know the truth for sure, but I'll say this. As a college student in a scientific field, I was raised with (indoctrinated into?) the first narrative. Later I read more on my own, and I've come think the second narrative makes a lot more sense, even though it certainly still leaves me with some questions. Of course my little narratives here are bare-boned sketches, so please look into it for yourself and make up your own mind!<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c3479836857105780822 title="comment permalink">7/5/15, 5:27 PM</a><br><br>

Modern science (from Newton onwards) is not concerned with mechanistic explanations: on the contrary Newton disparaged Descartes' mechanistic pictures as a bunch of just-so stories and cast them out of the scientific realm on the ground that they could not be used to predict anything. It is true (which confuses many laymen) that scientists sometimes resort to mechanistic descriptions to help themselves formulate their theories, as Maxwell famously did when he envisioned an ether full of wires and pulleys, but this is merely a scaffolding, discarded as soon as it has played its role, i.e., as soon as it has suggested equations. Hence Newton's famous "hypotheses non fingo". Absolutely nobody today thinks of the vacuum in the way Maxwell did yet his equations endure: they, not his mechanical just-so stories, are his contribution to science.<br><br>The essence of modern science is the ability to compute and make quantitative predictions, not to describe, and it takes the form of equations: those are your "structure of ideas". A computable universe must be subject to immutable rules but whether it is a machine is neither here nor there. Thus I don't buy your argument that science is just a manifestation of the mechanistic outlook that gripped Europe from the XVIIth century onwards. As the Maywell example shows, the two can sit comnfortably together but are nonetheless distinct: the equations of Maxwell in and of themselves do not presuppose or describe any machine while conversely the little machines of Descartes were not science as we (since Newton and Leibniz) understand it.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c8531295060894587950 title="comment permalink">7/5/15, 5:31 PM</a><br><br>

The interesting thing for me in that memory was that Denethor was not being directly manipulated by Sauron, but the inference in the book was that Sauron was carefully and subtly mediating the images that Denethor could see in the stone and the ultimate outcome from those images was a sort of hopeless despair for the situation which finally cost him his life.<br><br>I reckon that there is a good metaphor in there about technology and machines. It is also useful to remember the words of Gandalf relating to Saruman's use of the Palantir (seeing stones): "But alone it could do nothing but see small images of things far off and days remote. Very useful, no doubt, that was to Saruman; yet it seems that he was not content. Further and further abroad he gazed, until he cast his gaze upon Barad-dûr. Then he was caught!"<br><br>It makes you wonder how could Tolkien have known that that would be the outcome given the years and technology that the book was written? Very prescient.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c1623894759904318623 title="comment permalink">7/5/15, 6:22 PM</a><br><br>

At this point it might be a bit late to avoid the rush, but anybody who is willing to do the difficult parts proactively can still collapse with some degree of grace.<br><br>I think that the most important thing, and the thing that has frustrated me most often, is humility. Be humble and ready to learn, even (especially) from people that barely can keep their stuff together and seem wrong headed or ignorant of important matters. This is something that with years of intentional cultivation still does not come easy to me, for I can tend to be a ornery smarty pants, and have several times this year planned based on an inflated idea of my own capacity. Looking back my greatest triumphs are, almost always, associated with times of humility and my failures have every one been fertilized with pride. Being humble does not require beating oneself up, but that can also be a natural part of the process of humiliation. Accept humiliation as an opportunity to learn. I have trouble imagining a humble person who is earnest in their good will who would not encounter many folks eager to work with them in a normal day, making a connection is another thing, but I have no clear words on what might guide that.<br><br>Also important is to not give into depression. I have had hard times collapsing and being accidentally and intentionally homeless and such. None of the worst have been physical shortages. Those are very often not deadly, and almost as often make for great stories eventually! Depression is the hard thing, it makes one vulnerable to many other dangers, especially addiction, which goes far beyond drugs, it has many forms. I do not know the answer to this one and get depressed from time to time, but here are some thoughts. When I NOTICE my self being depressed I try to do something productive, in my experience work that requires tenderness has been the most beneficial. Tenderly caring is extremely powerful, the tenderness I want to emphasize. Do not look for relief from inaction or distraction, though rest and recreation can be helpful and are often free or cheap. The other thing that tends to best prevent depression is gratitude, because we are alive and that is wondrous there is always much to be grateful for, but I have lost that shield to resentment from contemplating the unjust too often, for this reason I try to find the examples of people doing good things for the good of it when I feel my gratitude choked.<br><br>The advice I have given has been the best I have been able to learn in the last three years, but I have only learned it well by ignoring it so often, even many times over after having been persuaded of it. <br><br>If the wheels are coming off the cart remember that there will be alot of people having a rough time, each person has a remarkable amount of power through tenderness and gratitude to make it less bad in the circle which they stride that it would otherwise have to be, if they choose to use that power. <br><br>Learning to choose is the most worthy thing to try learning. That plus worm castings, sewing, mycology, gardening, bike repair, and jankey solar thermal. This reminds me of the last big thing I have noticed, in pride I have tried learning too many things at once, I am now saying this to myself as much as to the blog, it is better to focus more narrowly on something to try mastering, if trying to master too many things there will be too little room for spontaneity which teaches too well to dare ignore.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c4094430404133978857 title="comment permalink">7/5/15, 10:26 PM</a><br><br>

First I would point out that as far as I can tell, if monotheism means that there is only one god/spiritual entity, I don't think that there are any monotheistic religions. Most of them have a Satan figure, Angels, Saints, So on so forth. Unless I am mistaken if such entities were considered from a polytheistic frame, they themselves would be considered as being gods in there own right, correct? Based upon this I have come to the conclusion that what distinguishes a monotheistic system from a polytheistic one is not the existence of only a single deity, but rather the existence of, for want of a better term, one single truth which all right thinking being must follow. For example in most of mainstream Christianity there is a trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Some people look at this and say this smacks of "Polytheism" ha ha. But I would say this misses the point, that regardless of whether these are individual gods or not, biblical doctrine makes clear that they all have the basically the same will, where they all agree with each other, and they all work together for there own collective Goal, which is the only correct Goal. Furthermore all the angels are either evil rebellious louts, or they are perfectly obedient to this one correct divine will. Again unless I am mistaken this is different to Polytheism where, at least based upon Greek myth there are multiple gods, which while there might be a head God Zeus, nonetheless each individual god has their own will, which might run counter to Zeus's, and they very well might act upon it. Furthermore just because one individual spiritual entity doesn't follow Zeus to the letter, that does not mean that the entity is the fount of all evil. Or to put it another way there are multiple ways of looking at the world all of which might come into conflict with each other, but that doesn't mean that any of them are necessarily all right, or all wrong. You are doubtless much more knowledgeable about these issues than I am, so I stand to be corrected. Anyway now that that is out of the way, it seems quite conceivable to me that a world could exist in which is ruled over by a distributed God entity, made up of multiple smaller component entities, let's say angels, have a degree of autonomy in carrying out overall reasoning duties, all the entities are locked together in by one single will. Lets call this the ant colony God. I would consider such a God to be while to some degree decentralized still in the balance one single God.<br><br>Following on from that I would also like to point if it were the case that the universe is filled with multiple gods, all of which seek for universal truths individually yet are also influenced by the search of others, it probably would not be a good idea to single out one of these entities and saying "This is the one true god, he has the one truth, and all other other gods/truths are inferior/evil". It might be that taking such a stance would lead to a somewhat insular worldview that when confronted by new circumstances which that god isn't fully equipped to handle, then that god might end up failing where a more humble god would be capable of examining/asking for help from other gods which have certain tools which might help.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c575665554683938995 title="comment permalink">7/5/15, 11:41 PM</a><br><br>

My gradual alienation from science and technology has begun many years ago with the collapse of the Soviet Union that I relate to ecological disasters and catastrophes (Chernobyl, etc). The obsession with machines has not been the sole privilege of the west. The Soviet Union borrowed that logic from Marx, I presume, and then Lenin, who were very fond of machinistic means of production. But the rub is that the Russians, in contrast to, say, Germans, are not so disciplined and diligent people (Marx suspected this). The floppiness that flowered under Socialism eventually brought down the System. <br>I think the same could be said about the Greece. I mean, the southern Europeans are not very keen on technological advances. Theyre ok with their natural resources. Therefore their economies can’t be likened to those of northern countries (where technology does matter).<br>Just a few thoughts.<br>Sometimes I don’t know whether I should translate yours or write mine instead. ;-)<br>Thanks again, and I'm looking forward to your posts.<br>V.P.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c567682182935482580 title="comment permalink">7/6/15, 1:10 PM</a><br><br>

She wondered if holistic/systems/ecological modes of understanding might be preferable to the categorical definitions of a mechanistic science. <br><br>In that spirit, let’s begin with an ecological rather than a mechanistic metaphor - “the universe is a tree” – and see where that takes us. Those who want to draw out this comparison will not start talking about creators, origins, and purposes but rather about biotic relationships - how one thing fits into a larger community of things. The meaning of a tree is not exhausted by what humans might say about it. A tree is also a being for beetles and squirrels and lichens. A full understanding of a tree could only come from making whatever inferences might follow from consideration of its interactions with every being in the neighborhood. Should we want to address the tree’s origins and purposes, our account of them will be identical to the one we would give about ourselves and, indeed, every other living entity in the universe - it evolved from something else over a long stretch of time and strives to live well and long and leave others of its kind behind. Any further investigation of that process will proceed most fruitfully if it stays in the ecological, rather than the mechanistic, realm. <br><br>Humans might still want to measure a tree, delineate its chemical properties, and calculate the velocity of whatever might fall out of it, but notice that those ways of engaging with the tree only become important if you want to subordinate it to human purposes - convert it into lumber, paper, or a food producer. That kind of knowledge is helpful to have, but it has been a mistake - a huge one, it turns out, and one that we continue to make on a massive scale - to treat it as if it is the only valuable or reliable information that our encounter with a tree might generate. We made that mistake as beings who decided - arrogantly, foolishly, and usually while in the thrall of one vision of progress or another - that our purposes alone mattered in the world. Had we cherished as we should have the smell or feel of a tree, had we ever climbed to the top on one and swayed with it in the midst of a rain storm (John Muir did this), had we not disregarded what it was to beetles, squirrels, and lichens - then we would not have found it so easy either to destroy whole communities of them or to remain so blissfully ignorant of the perils that we now face for having done so. <br><br>For a tree to serve as a metaphor for the universe, it will have to be the poet’s tree. The scientist’s tree is machine-ready - it has no value outside the process that kills it, saws it up, and puts a price tag on it. Individual botanists might entertain other kinds of feelings about trees, but those feelings are on a par with moral strictures like “thou shalt not kill” - noble sentiments with no purchase in a world run by real estate developers and four-star generals. The universe appears machine-like because we have made it so. If we are to make it more tree-like, we will do so as poets and ecologists. <br><br>Brian Lloyd<br>occupythehearth@blogspot.com<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c591385854334548739 title="comment permalink">7/6/15, 2:32 PM</a><br><br>

I met someone on Saturday at a farmers market that knew me however distantly - I saw the recognition in them. And then they proceeded to put on the smarty pants act, until they started to seek confirmation of the genius of their humour. At that point I told them that I just chose to ignore it. Seriously, it leaves a poor impression. As you say, humility is a much wiser approach and I applaud your efforts in that direction. Intellectual prowess is a crutch that many people use to feel better about their situation - whatever that situation may be, but in and of itself it should be remembered that it does not put food on the table.<br><br>No matter where you go in life, there will always be people who are smarter, faster, stronger, wealthier, better looking etc. That's life. Your best bet is to work on yourself and your acknowledgement of the necessity for humility is a great step in that direction.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c5498175383596550602 title="comment permalink">7/6/15, 3:18 PM</a><br><br>

It would be reasonable to say, I think, that any culture's claim about what the universe is says far more about the culture than it does about the universe. <br><br>James, it's been a long road. The first major turning point involved my decision to change the focus of my spiritual life from Golden Dawn Hermeticism to Druidry, which was guided by intuitive and emotional issues rather than rational ones; later, a prolonged period of wrestling with Nietzsche, then with Spengler, then with Nietzsche again, made it impossible for me to keep thinking about abstractions as anything more than the ordinary simplifications of a certain primate species' cognitive toolkit; more recently that intersected with systems theory and ecology, and with Stephen Wolfram's "A New Kind of Science," to bring the entire issue of representations and realities into tight focus -- oh, and there's some Schopenhauer in there, too. The irony is that I'm currently doing a lot of work with what might best be described as <a href="http://www.llewellyn.com/product.php?ean=9780738731551" rel=nofollow>a Druid-ized version of the Golden Dawn</a>, while standing the whole Platonic focus of the GD tradition on its head by seeing the abstract ideas as aspects of the perceiving subject rather than of the perceived universe. <br><br>Ivan, hmm! I like that -- default as Kalki, on the white horse of bankruptcy. <br><br>Denys, it does seem plausible, doesn't it? <br><br>Phil, that is to say, ordinary scientific reasoning was hijacked by the desire of a big corporation to get a return on its investment. Gotcha. <br><br>Ivan, Professor Rakovich may not know how to use them, but there are plenty of other people who do! <br><br>Iuval, correct me if I'm wrong, but hasn't it been shown that the decay of indiidual atoms of radioactive isotopes is random in the full sense of the word, i.e., not just governed by unknown or unknowable variables, but actually undetermined in anything but a probabilistic sense? If that's so -- and that's certainly what I've read in books by quantum physicists -- then determinism goes right out the window; even with a perfect data set and limitless computing power, given the state of the universe at time X, you can't accurately compute its state at time X + N if N is more than a negligible interval. <br><br>Olivier64, and when science is practiced in that spirit -- as the construction of mathematical models that enable accurate predictions to be made, without the claim that the model is identical to the universe -- it's one of the truly great creations of the human mind. It's when we start insisting that the universe is the same as our model of it that science becomes just one more source of fatuous dogmas.<br><br>Cherokee, excellent! My guess is that Tolkien, who was a keen and acerbic observer of the technological scene, considered telephones, radio, and cinema, and triangulated from them to a technology that would exploit all the same weaknesses in a more concentrated form. Yes, it's a very crisp metaphor. <br><br>Wizzard, agreed, but I have my doubts that that'll be an option.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c4641977008472014103 title="comment permalink">7/6/15, 10:16 PM</a><br><br>

Learning generally happens on exploded fallacy at a time, anyway. <br><br>Ray, I'd like to encourage you, as time permits, to write either a long essay or a book on the lessons of your experience. I mean that quite seriously; you're a capable writer and have a lot to say that I think people would benefit from hearing. <br><br>Dagnarus, okay, to begin with, equating "god" and "spiritual entity" is exactly what monotheism rejects. The basic monotheist claim is that out of the set of spiritual entities, one and only one is a god, i.e., a being worthy of human worship; all others are either servants of that one god, or his enemies, and in either case you don't worship them. That aside, the rest of your argument corresponds closely to the standard logic of polytheism, which generally rejects the idea that gods are omnipotent and omniscient, and very often the idea that the universe was created by one or more gods as well. Greek Pagan thought is a good example; in Hesiod, the gods don't create the cosmos, rather, the cosmos gives birth to the gods. Nor, as you've noted, is any one god in a polytheist system the sole source and judge of truth, or what have you; rather, there are many overlapping truths, and the truths you follow determine the deities you revere. <br><br>KL, funny. I admit I wonder how they time that. <br><br>Wizard, one of the things that interests me is the way that monotheisms obsess about such details, while polytheisms consider them interesting but not that big a deal. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, probably because Guernica happened much more recently. Brueghel was a major presence in his own time, as I recall. <br><br>Phil, thanks for the link! Yes, it's the same process, and can be described in both those ways. <br><br>Denys, thanks for the data point. Yep, it's a <i>big</i> deal. <br><br>Adrian, oh, I'll write about it; I generally think things through by writing about them. Druidry was a natural jumping-off point for the transition, since a lot of what happened had to do with coming to grips with the difference between the world we experience and the models we make of that world. <br><br>Vic, I'd like to see you write your own posts, in English as well as Russian! <br><br>Brian, it actually depends on the scientist. I've known quite a few ecologists, for example, whose understanding of the tree and its value had nothing to do with its economic role and everything to do with the parts it plays in the dance of the living ecosystem.<br><br>Adam, no, I haven't. (BTW, yes, there's at least one typo in every post here; consider that a deliberate attempt to refute any claims of infallibility on my part!)<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c5750971615968084819 title="comment permalink">7/6/15, 10:39 PM</a><br><br>

I picked it out of 5 almost identical drums as the one with the best sound, and I talked the shop keeper down about $15 on the $100 asking price. When I got it home, closer examination revealed a 6” narrow split in the side, and being by nature a “perfectionist” I decided to return it and ask for my money back (cheeky bastard that I am). In the car, halfway back to the store the thought suddenly came to me: what if the split, the perceived imperfection, is actually what makes that drum superior in sound to the other four? I sat there for quite a long time while the thought percolated through a lot of my deeply held assumptions about the nature of reality, then turned around and drove home a wiser man. I’ve still got the drum and its a reminder that perfection doesn’t always have to be a positive value or goal for me. <br><br>Mistakes, imperfection, indeterminacy, unknown unknowns, black swans are part of the fabric of reality in the universe I live in.

I think it is necessary to take into account when two different groups are using the same word to mean subtly different things. Also on the point of not worshiping any other deities, it has been pointed out by many that in what is now still the world's most populous monotheistic religion Christianity there is a trinity of gods, who are somehow both distinct and the same, all aspects of the trinity are looked upon as deserving of worship. It can be further pointed out that half of christians are Roman Catholics, who practice what to some might look like "worship" of saints, and more particularly the "worship" of the virgin mother.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c1726456397060338429 title="comment permalink">7/7/15, 10:11 AM</a><br><br>

So to me, part of the process of thinking "mechanistically" (though not necessarily scientifically) is disavowing not only the responsibility for caring for other living things, but also one's role and responsibility for causing the death of other living things, whether at the individual or ecosystem level, and refusal to honor those lives and to be thankful for the sacrifices they have made.

Erasmus Reinhold, a fellow professor of mathematics in Wittenberg, reduced the system to a set of Tables, called the Prutenic Tables, that could be used to calculate the ephemerides used by astrologers, farmers, navigators, cartographers, astronomers and numerous others. In the event, it was no better than the existing Alfonsine Tables.<br><br>A number of things happened afterwards, including Tycho Brahe’s inability to measure the parallax of the fixed stars, which he interpreted to mean that the Earth didn’t go around the Sun. Copernicus work would have landed in the compost pile of history except that a Jesuit, Christoph Clavius, included it in his textbook on the mathematics of astronomy that became the standard text well into the 17th century.<br><br>The only time De Revolutionus came under Church fire was as fallout from the Letter to Christina affair (1616), when it was banned “until corrected.” The corrections involved blanking out a few paragraphs and rewriting several sentences.

It has numerous effects, intentional and non-intentional. Further, one has also to consider the aspects of power and exploitation when looking into technologies. Persons like Ivan Illich and Alf Hornborg have spent a lot of efforts on that topic. "I can recommend "the Myth of the Machine" by Hornborg. Hornborg higlights how technology and machines function as tools for exploitation and that they are the primary mean for perpetuating the global social and economic differences. He shows how the unequal exchange underlying machine technology can be exposed by measuring the net flows of biophysical resources such as energy, matter, embodied land (ecological footprints), or embodied labour.

Now, how do the poets, ecologists, and warm-hearted scientists who would treat Nature with appropriate respect, who are attuned to the elegant dance of life, death, and sacrifice ... how do we get those kind of people in a position to make decisions about how the land and the water and the soil are to be used? How do we get decision-making power out of the hands of those who seem dead-set on squandering what is left of the basics of life? Talking together, blogging together - these are a critical first step. Taking it allows like-minded souls to find one another and develop and clarify their thinking. But what is the next step? Talking and thinking are not enough - and this is true whether you are still plugged in to the system as a job-holder and a consumer or whether you have collapsed voluntarily and dug in to a local subsistence economy. Do we not owe it to the trees and the frogs and the rivers and to ourselves as kin to all those things to act in ways that give an ecological perspective some chance of prospering in the world beyond the blog?

Since that square-root isn't an ordinary number, mathematicians call it "i", the unit of "imaginary numbers". So to get a physical result from something containing an "imaginary" part, the wave function is multiplied with a "conjugate" of itself, resulting in a purely real function that is interpreted as a probability distribution. For example the probability distribution for where an election might be in relation to the atom it is bound to. <br><br>So this mathematical framework is a "machine" that works exceptionally well in describing all sorts of microscopic phenomena, including the apparently random decay of radioactive atoms.<br><br>I say "apparently random" because: <br><br>1. even if atomic decays happen at perfectly random times, resulting in "pure noise" in a perfect decay-detector, no such detector exists. All real detectors inject highly imperfect noise at a certain level. So any imperfection in the randomness of atomic decay might be too weak to observe<br><br>2. Your computer can be programmed to produce a pseudo-random signal using a very simple deterministic rule. For example the Wolfram Rule 30. Anyone looking for regularity in such signals will almost certainly fail unless they happen to know the rule, which allows them to "unlock" the regularity hidden in the pseudo-random noise. Modern pseudo-random generators have evolved to the point where they defeat any statistical analysis searching for regularities (correlations) unless the rule is known. <br><br>Einstein and others objected to the interpretation of the machinery, regardless of how well it worked, because while it is easy to test the accuracy of the machine, testing the interpretation is a much more vexed issue. <br><br>To put it in your language, Einstein accepted that the quantum probability-distributions are a very accurate mathematical model, but he objected to the bald assertion that the Universe actually *is* a machine generating perfectly random samples from a probability distribution. <br><br>I have yet to hear of a physicist willing to claim that these questions have been resolved. Quantum mechanics is a unique physical theory in that none of its practitioners really think it makes any sense. It works, sure, but that's another thing.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c2264970758980396803 title="comment permalink">7/8/15, 1:42 PM</a><br><br>

They can become very frustrated and upset with themselves, until they feel like giving up altogether. I have found useful to tell them of the Navajo blankets. The Navajo weavers also insisted on one flaw in each beautifully crafted blanket to remind them of the imperfections of life. If a flaw crept in, they'd keep it, if no flaws crept in before they were almost finished, they'd put one in. Nice to know that such a great idea popped up elsewhere, (as Nuku says with harpsichord crafters). I've found this works with my little artists well, as it gives them permission to create more freely, unafraid of mistakes. Sometimes the warts themselves are what make something beautiful.<br><br>@KittenLopez: Ha! You sound like such a sweetie, I love your posts. In trying to figure all of this out, I hope you are finding time to just shut out the world, put your head down, nose to the grindstone, as they say, and focus on your art and where it takes you. I find that is also a great antidote to the madness of the world.<br><br>Thank You again this week to all commenters and our gracious host - for one of the few places I have to read, re-read and actually think about the concepts being discussed. <br><br>Not going to be online as much for the next few weeks as we are back in our US home base in WY.

One is the collapse of our civilization, which has followed the well worn route described by Toynbee and others. Interestingly, Toynbee actually thought our civilization would be able to avoid such collapse because of the supposed superiority of the Judeo-Christian mindset undergirding it. Oh well...no one is right all the time.<br><br>The other event is the collapse of the biosphere aka the Sixth Great Extinction which is well underway, driven by anthropogenic global warming, and the fouling of our common nest in uncommon ways. Within the doomer world view, there are a range of possible scenarios, some leaving a remnant of human beings around after the apocalypse, others not. All are possible; none certain.<br><br>If it is the collapse of civilization that prevails, there's plenty of room for a (relatively) soft landing for many people. You won't like what that soft landing looks like, for sure. Imagine (for example) a world with no modern medicine - where people have 10 children in the hope that one or two survive to adulthood. That's going to feel different than not having your iPhone handy. But societies live through such hardships, adapting and sometimes even thriving in response.<br><br>On the other hand, if we're talking about total collapse of the biosphere, unless you've figured out how to perform the magick of Gregor Samsa, there will be no future at all for you, or for any of us. Yes, the cockroaches and the jellyfish will do just fine, thank you - and so will the interesting creatures that live at the bottom of the ocean, no doubt. But for surface dwellers like us, there will simply be nowhere to run, baby, nowhere to hide.<br><br>We are certainly living in interesting times.<br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c558556914196778319 title="comment permalink">7/11/15, 6:15 PM</a><br><br>

I feel like when people talk in terms of the universe being a machine is a shortcut for explaining the universe in Newtonian terms.<br><br>The fact that humans tend to think of the universe in Newtonian terms is a relic of the adaptive traits of humans gaining knowledge necessary for survival at a narrow band of size and energy scales in which we can manipulate our environment in order to procreate. The vast majority of the universe exists at size and energy scales other than what humans can manipulate.<br><br> The universe operates in a quantum mechanical and relativistic way. There is no such thing as a single truth, because every truth is relative to the way it was measured. The universe has at its core a property of simply existing as exchanges of information. What we think of as stuff is purely information, and the fundamental property of that information is probalistic and relative, there is no universal answer for any question, because the answer depends on how something is measured and seeming randomness.<br><br>A great example of this paradoxical aspect of reality can be explained by the quantum Zeno Effect. A radioactive particle exists in a superposition of both a decayed and non-decayed state at the same time. Radioactive particles are perceived to decay when the decayed portion interacts with another particle. The strange thing about radioactive decay revolves around probabilities, with the probability of a radioactive decay being detected increasing with time. However, if an observer checks to see if a particle has decayed while the probability is low, and keeps checking it at the same time interval the particle will appear to never decay, because each time the particle is observed, the probability is reset. <br><br>This indicates that observation has an effect on a measurement outcome, and this outcome is relative to the way in which it was measured. This Quantum Zeno Effect denies the existence of a machinistic universe in the Newtonian sense and replaces it with a more subtle, and much more complex and counter-intuitive paradigm. <br><br>Other weird quantum effects are equally counter-intuitive, and by rewiring our understanding to accept these weird effects, we might be able to change our world view, and expand creativity while reducing homocentric biases. <br><br><br><a href=the-dream-of-machine.html#c4152459794846103966 title="comment permalink">7/17/15, 6:52 PM</a><br><br>
