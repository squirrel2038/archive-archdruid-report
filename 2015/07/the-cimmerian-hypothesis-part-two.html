<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week’s post covered a great deal of ground—not surprising, really, for an essay that started from a quotation from a
<i>Weird Tales</i> story about Conan the Barbarian—and it may be useful to recap the core argument here. Civilizations—meaning here human societies that concentrate power, wealth, and population in urban centers—have a distinctive historical trajectory of rise and fall that isn’t shared by societies that lack urban centers. There are plenty of good reasons why this should be so, from the ecological costs of urbanization to the buildup of maintenance costs that drives catabolic collapse, but there’s also a cognitive dimension. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Look over the histories of fallen civilizations, and far more often than not, societies don’t have to be dragged down the slope of decline and fall. Rather, they go that way at a run, convinced that the road to ruin must inevitably lead them to heaven on earth. Arnold Toynbee, whose voluminous study of the rise and fall of civilizations has been one of the main sources for this blog since its inception, wrote at length about the way that the elite classes of falling civilizations lose the capacity to come up with new responses for new situations, or even to learn from their mistakes; thus they keep on trying to use the same failed policies over and over again until the whole system crashes to ruin. That’s an important factor, no question, but it’s not just the elites who seem to lose track of the real world as civilizations go sliding down toward history’s compost heap, it’s the masses as well. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who want to see a fine example of this sort of blindness to the obvious need only check the latest headlines. Within the next decade or so, for example, the entire southern half of Florida will become
<a href=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/come-hell-or-high-water-the-disaster-scenario-that-is-south-florida/article25552300/ >unfit for human habitation</a> due to rising sea levels, driven by our dumping of greenhouse gases into an already overloaded atmosphere. Low-lying neighborhoods in Miami already flood with sea water whenever a high tide and a strong onshore wind hit at the same time; one more foot of sea level rise and salt water will pour over barriers into the remaining freshwater sources, turning southern Florida into a vast brackish swamp and forcing the evacuation of most of the millions who live there. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s only the most dramatic of a constellation of climatic catastrophes that are already tightening their grip on much of the United States. Out west, the rain forests of western Washington are burning in the wake of years of increasingly severe drought, California’s vast agricultural acreage is reverting to desert, and the entire city of Las Vegas will probably be out of water—as in, you turn on the tap and nothing but dust comes out—in less than a decade. As waterfalls cascade down the seaward faces of Antarctic and Greenland glaciers, leaking methane blows craters in the Siberian permafrost, and sea level rises at rates considerably faster than the worst case scenarios scientists were considering a few years ago, these threats are hardly abstract issues; is anyone in America taking them seriously enough to, say, take any concrete steps to stop using the atmosphere as a gaseous sewer, starting with their own personal behavior? Surely you jest. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No, the Republicans are still out there insisting at the top of their lungs that any scientific discovery that threatens their rich friends’ profits must be fraudulent, the Democrats are still out there proclaiming just as loudly that there must be some way to deal with anthropogenic climate change that won’t cost them their frequent-flyer miles, and nearly everyone outside the political sphere is making whatever noises they think will allow them to keep on pursuing exactly those lifestyle choices that are bringing on planetary catastrophe. Every possible excuse to insist that what’s already happening won’t happen gets instantly pounced on as one more justification for inertia—the claim currently being splashed around the media that the Sun
<i>might</i> go through a cycle of slight cooling in the decades ahead is the latest example. (For the record, even if we get a grand solar minimum, <a href=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/aug/14/global-warming-solar-minimum-barely-dent>its effects will be canceled out in short order</a> by the impact of ongoing atmospheric pollution.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Business as usual is very nearly the only option anybody is willing to discuss, even though the long-predicted climate catastrophes are already happening and the days of business as usual in any form are obviously numbered. The one alternative that gets air time, of course, is the popular fantasy of instant planetary dieoff, which gets plenty of attention because it’s just as effective an excuse for inaction as faith in business as usual. What next to nobody wants to talk about is the future that’s actually arriving exactly as predicted: a future in which low-lying coastal regions around the country and the world have to be abandoned to the rising seas, while the Southwest and large portions of the mountain west become more inhospitable than the eastern Sahara or Arabia’s Empty Quarter. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If the ice melt keeps accelerating at its present pace, we could be only a few decades form the point at which it’s Manhattan Island’s turn to be abandoned, because everything below ground level is permanently<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>flooded with seawater and every winter storm sends waves rolling right across the island and flings driftwood logs against second story windows. A few decades more, and waves will roll over the low-lying neighborhoods of Houston, Boston, Seattle, and Washington DC, while the ruined buildings that used to be New Orleans rise out of the still waters of a brackish estuary and the ruined buildings that used to be Las Vegas are half buried by the drifting sand. Take a moment to consider the economic consequences of that much infrastructure loss, that much destruction of built capital, that many people who somehow have to be evacuated and resettled, and think about what kind of body blow that will deliver to an industrial society that is already in bad shape for other reasons. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
None of this had to happen. Half a century ago, policy makers and the public alike had already been presented with a tolerably clear outline of what was going to happen if we proceeded along the trajectory we were on, and those same warnings have been repeated with increasing force year by year, as the evidence to support them has mounted up implacably—and yet nearly all of us nodded and smiled and kept going. Nor has this changed in the least as the long-predicted catastrophes have begun to show up right on schedule. Quite the contrary: faced with a rising spiral of massive crises, people across the industrial world are, with majestic consistency, doing exactly those things that are guaranteed to make those crises worse. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So the question that needs to be asked, and if possible answered, is why civilizations—human societies that concentrate population, power, and wealth in urban centers—so reliably lose the capacity to learn from their mistakes and recognize that a failed policy has in fact failed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s also worth asking why they so reliably do this within a finite and predictable timespan: civilizations last on average around a millennium before they crash into a dark age, while uncivilized societies routinely go on for many times that period. Doubtless any number of factors drive civilizations to their messy ends, but I’d like to suggest a factor that, to my knowledge, hasn’t been discussed in this context before. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s start with what may well seem like an irrelevancy. There’s been a great deal of discussion down through the years in environmental circles about the way that the survival and health of the human body depends on inputs from nonhuman nature. There’s been a much more modest amount of talk about the human psychological and emotional needs that can only be met through interaction with natural systems. One question I’ve never seen discussed, though, is whether the human intellect has needs that are only fulfilled by a natural environment. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As I consider that question, one obvious answer comes to mind: negative feedback. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The human intellect is the part of each of us that thinks, that tries to make sense of the universe of our experience. It does this by creating models. By “models” I don’t just mean those tightly formalized and quantified models we call scientific theories; a poem is also a model of part of the universe of human experience, so is a myth, so is a painting, and so is a vague hunch about how something will work out. When a twelve-year-old girl pulls the petals off a daisy while saying “he loves me, he loves me not,” she’s using a randomization technique to decide between two models of one small but, to her, very important portion of the universe, the emotional state of whatever boy she has in mind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With any kind of model, it’s critical to remember Alfred Korzybski’s famous rule: “the map is not the territory.” A model, to put the same point another way, is a representation; it represents the way some part of the universe looks when viewed from the perspective of one or more members of our species of social primates, using the idiosyncratic and profoundly limited set of sensory equipments, neural processes, and cognitive frameworks we got handed by our evolutionary heritage. Painful though this may be to our collective egotism, it’s not unfair to say that human mental models are what you get when you take the universe and dumb it down to the point that our minds can more or less grasp it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What keeps our models from becoming completely dysfunctional is the negative feedback we get from the universe. For the benefit of readers who didn’t get introduced to systems theory, I should probably take a moment to explain negative feedback. The classic example is the common household thermostat, which senses the temperature of the air inside the house and activates a switch accordingly. If the air temperature is below a certain threshold, the thermostat turns the heat on and warms things up; if the air temperature rises above a different, slightly higher threshold, the thermostat turns the heat off and lets the house cool down. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In a sense, a thermostat embodies a very simple model of one very specific part of the universe, the temperature inside the house. Like all models, this one includes a set of implicit definitions and a set of value judgments. The definitions are the two thresholds, the one that turns the furnace on and the one that turns it off, and the value judgments label temperatures below the first threshold “too cold” and those above the second “too hot.” Like every human model, the thermostat model is unabashedly anthropocentric—“too cold” by the thermostat’s standard would be uncomfortably warm for a polar bear, for example—and selects out certain factors of interest to human beings from a galaxy of other things we don’t happen to want to take into consideration. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The models used by the human intellect to make sense of the universe are usually less simple than the one that guides a thermostat—there are unfortunately exceptions—but they work according to the same principle. They contain definitions, which may be implicit or explicit: the girl plucking petals from the daisy may have not have an explicit definition of love in mind when she says “he loves me,” but there’s some set of beliefs and expectations about what those words imply underlying the model. They also contain value judgments: if she’s attracted to the boy in question, “he loves me” has a positive value and “he loves me not” has a negative one. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice, though, that there’s a further dimension to the model, which is its interaction with the observed behavior of the thing it’s supposed to model. Plucking petals from a daisy, all things considered, is not a very good predictor of the emotional states of twelve-year-old boys; predictions made on the basis of that method are very often disproved by other sources of evidence, which is why few girls much older than twelve rely on it as an information source. Modern western science has formalized and quantified that sort of reality testing, but it’s something that most people do at least occasionally. It’s when they stop doing so that we get the inability to recognize failure that helps to drive, among many other things, the fall of civilizations. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Individual facets of experienced reality thus provide negative feedback to individual models. The whole structure of experienced reality, though, is capable of providing negative feedback on another level—when it challenges the accuracy of the entire mental process of modeling.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nature is very good at providing negative feedback of that kind. Here’s a human conceptual model that draws a strict line between mammals, on the one hand, and birds and reptiles, on the other. Not much more than a century ago, it was as precise as any division in science: mammals have fur and don’t lay eggs, reptiles and birds don’t have fur and do lay eggs. Then some Australian settler met a platypus, which has fur and lays eggs. Scientists back in Britain flatly refused to take it seriously until some live platypuses finally made it there by ship. Plenty of platypus egg was splashed across plenty of distinguished scientific faces, and definitions had to be changed to make room for another category of mammals and the evolutionary history necessary to explain it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here’s another human conceptual model, the one that divides trees into distinct species. Most trees in most temperate woodlands, though, actually have a mix of genetics from closely related species. There are few red oaks; what you have instead are mostly-red, partly-red, and slightly-red oaks. Go from the northern to the southern end of a species’ distribution, or from wet to dry regions, and the variations within the species are quite often more extreme than those that separate trees that have been assigned to different species. Here’s still another human conceptual model, the one that divides trees from shrubs—plenty of species can grow either way, and the list goes on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The human mind likes straight lines, definite boundaries, precise verbal definitions. Nature doesn’t. People who spend most of their time dealing with undomesticated natural phenomena, accordingly, have to get used to the fact that nature is under no obligation to make the kind of sense the human mind prefers. I’d suggest that this is why so many of the cultures our society calls “primitive”—that is, those that have simple material technologies and interact directly with nature much of the time—so often rely on nonlogical methods of thought: those our culture labels “mythological,” “magical,” or—I love this term—“prescientific.” (That the “prescientific” will almost certainly turn out to be the postscientific as well is one of the lessons of history that modern industrial society is trying its level best to ignore.) Nature as we experience it isn’t simple, neat, linear, and logical, and so it makes sense that the ways of thinking best suited to dealing with nature directly aren’t simple, neat, linear, and logical either.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>With this in mind, let’s return to the distinction discussed in last week’s post. I noted there that a city is a human settlement from which the direct, unmediated presence of nature has been removed as completely as the available technology permits. What replaces natural phenomena in an urban setting, though, is as important as what isn’t allowed there. Nearly everything that surrounds you in a city was put there deliberately by human beings; it is the product of conscious human thinking, and it follows the habits of human thought just outlined. Compare a walk down a city street to a walk through a forest or a shortgrass prairie: in the city street, much more of what you see is simple, neat, linear, and logical. A city is an environment reshaped to reflect the habits and preferences of the human mind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I suspect there may be a straightforwardly neurological factor in all this. The human brain, so much larger compared to body weight than the brains of most of our primate relatives, evolved because having a larger brain provided some survival advantage to those hominins who had it, in competition with those who didn’t. It’s probably a safe assumption that processing information inputs from the natural world played a very large role in these advantages, and this would imply, in turn, that the human brain is primarily adapted for perceiving things in natural environments—not, say, for building cities, creating technologies, and making the other common products of civilization. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus some significant part of the brain has to be redirected away from the things that it’s adapted to do, in order to make civilizations possible. I’d like to propose that the simplified, rationalized, radically information-poor environment of the city plays a crucial role in this. (Information-poor? Of course; the amount of information that comes cascading through the five keen senses of an alert hunter-gatherer standing in an African forest is vastly greater than what a city-dweller gets from the blank walls and the monotonous sounds and scents of an urban environment.) Children raised in an environment that lacks the constant cascade of information natural environments provide, and taught to redirect their mental powers toward such other activities as reading and mathematics, grow up with cognitive habits and, in all probability, neurological arrangements focused toward the activities of civilization and away from the things to which the human brain is adapted by evolution. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One source of supporting evidence for this admittedly speculative proposal is the worldwide insistence on the part of city-dwellers that people who live in isolated rural communities, far outside the cultural ambit of urban life, are just plain stupid. What that means in practice, of course, is that people from isolated rural communities aren’t used to using their brains for the particular purposes that city people value. These allegedly “stupid” countryfolk are by and large extraordinarily adept at the skills they need to survive and thrive in their own environments. They may be able to listen to the wind and know exactly where on the far side of the hill a deer waits to be shot for dinner, glance at a stream and tell which riffle the trout have chosen for a hiding place, watch the clouds pile up and read from them how many days they’ve got to get the hay in before the rains come and rot it in the fields—all of which tasks require sophisticated information processing, the kind of processing that human brains evolved doing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice, though, how the urban environment relates to the human habit of mental modeling. Everything in a city was a mental model before it became a building, a street, an item of furniture, or what have you. Chairs look like chairs, houses like houses, and so on; it’s so rare for humanmade items to break out of the habitual models of our species and the particular culture that built them that when this happens, it’s a source of endless comment. Where a natural environment constantly challenges human conceptual models, an urban environment reinforces them, producing a feedback loop that’s probably responsible for most of the achievements of civilization. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
I suggest, though, that the same feedback loop may also play a very large role in the self-destruction of civilizations. People raised in urban environments come to treat their mental models as realities, more real than the often-unruly facts on the ground, because everything they encounter in their immediate environments reinforces those models. As the models become more elaborate and the cities become more completely insulated from the complexities of nature, the inhabitants of a civilization move deeper and deeper into a landscape of hallucinations—not least because as many of those hallucinations get built in brick and stone, or glass and steel, as the available technology permits. As a civilization approaches its end, the divergence between the world as it exists and the mental models that define the world for the civilization’s inmates becomes total, and its decisions and actions become lethally detached from reality—with consequences that we’ll discuss in next week’s post. </div>

He said that standard development was the only way to bring consumer choice to all communities. Nonsense on stilts, obviously; but there was surprisingly little resistance to this steady process of standardized development across the US, and also in the UK now. Actually, I still believe that across local communities there will be lots of particular adaptations to change, but it will all have to be done well away from the main highways and strip malls.

That way I could get a good dose of nature when it would still do me some good.<br><br>One of the apparent ironies of your pointing out that nature is more information-rich than human-built environments is that one of your recipes for "collapsing now and avoiding the rush" is LESS, with the final S standing for stimulation. It looks like the problem isn't stimulation <i>per se</i>, but the artificial stimulation of entertainment delivered by modern technology. Nature by itself can be very stimulating.<br><br>On the other hand, you're being perfectly self-consistent when you point out that everything humans encounter in their built environment was concept first. It fits with your disagreement with Platonism and Neoplatonism that you've expressed on your other blog. There may be an ideal form of every man-made object, but there certainly is no such thing for features of nature.<br><br>I plan on incorporating both of those points when I take my classes on <a href="http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/search?q=field+trip" rel=nofollow>field trips</a> in the future, even when <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2013/04/video-tour-of-michigan-state.html rel=nofollow>my students and I tour a farm</a>.

The rise of market fundamentalism (aka Neoliberalism) declares that this system is capable of solving every problem once the price of every blade of grass, grain of sand, and drop of water on earth is accounted for. I doubt it's a coincidence that this system developed in the urban areas of Europe by the people who fled the countryside (the "Bourgeoisie"). Economists insist that everything we need to know about the world can be determined by studying monetary flows and exchanges, and no other science is valid. This leads to ideas like, for example, a high enough price will call forth more resources, resources are infinitely elastic and substitutable, externalities are the exception, people are rational, and technological innovation can overcome any problem. For people whose food comes from a supermarket and whose every need is catered to by paying some corporation or another, you can see why this model is the only one they are likely to believe.<br><br><a href=#c2843006210380421901 title="comment permalink">7/22/15, 9:09 PM</a><br><br>

"Weird" means "different from the rest." It doesn't, on the other hand, mean "wrong." <br><br>Yupped, the urbanization and standardization of rural culture in the US is to my mind one of the most dismal events of recent decades, not least because it's helped to reinforce the mental monoculture that's dragging us down. As for the Musk toady, oh, granted -- the range of excuses people will come up with to keep on clinging to the dying fantasy of progress toward the stars is really impressive, in a bleak sort of way.<br><br>Angus, thank you! Thanks also for the book tip and the graywater link. As for the Bountiful Energy blog, well, I've seen all kinds of arguments along those lines; I'm waiting for someone to explain why, if renewable energy has such great net energy figures, it's only viable when propped up with massive government subsidies -- the same issue, incidentally, that makes me doubt the identical claims made for nuclear power. If it can't pay for itself, and it can't, there's got to be something wrong with the enthusiastic claims. <br><br>Ben, of course other human societies fail spectacularly. My point is that civilizations <i>always</i> do, after about a millennium, while many (not, please note, all) noncivilized societies sustain themselves in relative stability over much longer time spans. <br><br>Avi, so? If in fact we do all live in a waking sleep, that still doesn't explain the fact that civilizations crash and burn in a millennium while many noncivilized societies last much longer. <br><br>Bill, nicely summarized!<br><br>Pinku-sensei, good. Notice that artificial stimulation is by and large louder, faster, and more heavily loaded with cheap emotional stimuli than natural stimulation, and thus tends not only to drown out the latter, but also to numb the mind and the senses so they don't notice the latter at all. <br><br>Grebulocities, funny. Most of the world's most barren deserts, by the way, get sudden rainstorms now and then that cause catastrophic flash floods. Nice to see the California climate getting into sync with its future... ;-)<br><br>Lynford, chasing after enlightenment, or however you want to describe the goal of the spiritual quest, is a very traditional move in times like these, and has much to recommend it. <br><br>Escape, that's a big one. The myth of money, the myth of the machine, the myth of progress -- those are among the main the delusions that are pushing industrial civilization straight over the cliff. <br><br>Peakfuture, no argument there. <br><br>Vincent, funny -- though I'd be more impressed with Tom Tomorrow if he'd also lampoon the Democratic nonresponse to climate change, too.<br><br><a href=#c6264179296336076226 title="comment permalink">7/22/15, 10:09 PM</a><br><br>

There is of course a major bias in this definition: Most of these skills were preserved from peoples who are still around, or were until recently, and happen to not fit the definition of civilization that was used in this post. These skills are thus no more a part of the "stone age" than the computer I'm typing on, though it is true that they are extremely similar to what is theorized about stone age technology. <br><br>These skills are hard and inefficient. Most of them are not likely to be things a Green Wizard would actually use, and the notion that humans will suddenly start relying on these belongs to a certain type of apocalyptic fantasy. So why would they be important to know?<br><br>Because on a scale of civilized-fantasy to reality-of-nature, these skills represent the extreme of dealing with the complex and non-anthropocentric realities of the world outside of civilization. Thus learning these skills can be seen as a direct way of overcoming the unhelpful habits of thought that pervade modern society--remedial barbarianism, if you will. <br><br>I hung around Primitivist circles before making it here and, despite the annoying apocalyptic rhetoric, the reaction people often had after learning the basics of primitive skills was nothing short of an existential crisis. The skills of appropriate technology are more practical for a gradual decline, but because of this, it seems to me like they might not be quite as useful in breaking away from over-civilized habits of thought. <br><br>So, I'd encourage all aspiring Green Wizards to learn the basics of primitive skills. You don't have to spend years mastering them well enough to actually be able to live off of them, just get the basics down. Primitive skills schools often teach these in a couple week-long intensives, and in my experience, that's enough to cause profound changes in how you think. They can also be learned much more cheaply if a little more slowly from books, local groups, and the internet.<br><br><a href=#c569332158349476523 title="comment permalink">7/22/15, 10:11 PM</a><br><br>

Money talks, and if it tells people to pollute a river, bulldoze a forest, or impoverish vast numbers of people, well, the incentives were clear. Can't ignore those incentives.<br><br>You also remind me of stories about online games like Everquest and Second Life, where players spend vast amounts of time and money building up purely illusory gains. On writer tracked down the player of a very respected and accomplished game character. The player was homeless. She lived in a tent, with few possessions beyond her laptop, on which she played Everquest.<br><br>I also think of the Heaven's Gate cult, hypnotized by the promise of escape from this vale of tears to a Star Trek life aboard an alien spaceship.

I, too, see Business As Usual continuing on until it can't. What's a bit frustrating is that "environmental crusaders" fly on jet aircraft across the country and the oceans, dispersing tons of carbon dioxide at high altitudes where it will persist for years, without a second thought about it. I wonder if they know what they're doing to the environment; I suppose if they did, they'd take trains or ships.<br><br>One of the things I do in the fall, winter, and spring, is go out hunting rabbits with a pack of basset hounds - I'm a whip with the pack, there's a huntsman and several other whips as well. Think foxhunting, but on foot. Once the hunt gets going, I seem to switch into a different kind of awareness. My senses get sharpened noticeably, I can hear people talking 100 feet away, smell tobacco smoke and shaving lotion at that same range, hear rabbits moving, and tell which direction they're going, tell by the way the hounds are barking whether they're on rabbit, fox, or deer (and I can usually smell a fox), if they're going the right way or wrong way on a scent trail, and so on. It's a total shift in awareness and it's like flipping a switch. Oh, and while I carry a whip, I rarely if ever use it, unless the pack has run riot on a deer, and then it's used to make noise to get their heads up and off the scent trail, and send them back to the huntsman. This sport was invented 1000 years ago by monks in France, who also developed the basset hound breed. Of course, the only trails in the woods are those made by deer - and you want to know where the buck is with his harem and steer clear of that area...<br><br><a href=#c7181278321038635033 title="comment permalink">7/22/15, 10:19 PM</a><br><br>

I have to add three things. <br><br>Firstly although our western society developed the skill of rational thinking over millenia, it is simply not how the brain works. The brain is what computer scientists would call associative memory. It compares the pattern of the sensual input to known patterns and accesses the information connected to those known patterns. It his very effectiv doing this. Rational thinking however is formalizing all inputs and then deriving as much new infomation as possible using rules of logic. While rational thinking is done quite ineffective (ab)using only a small part of the brain for it, thinking in patterns and associations is the way the brain works. Since rural and urban people develope completely different patterns and associations, of course they can not understand each others ways of thinking. <br><br>Secondly i want do add a comment to "the map is not the territory". It is quite common that in the Information age people lose the connection to the "territory". A common anecdote is the guy who runs his car into a river, because his navigation system mapped a ferry as a road. In traffic i often have the feeling that the better the graphics on the navigation systems screen are, the less people actually watch the road while driving. I recently talked to a guy who developes computer systems that interchange information to make stuff supposedly more effective (e.g. health data in hospitals). I told him obout observational errors and asked him if they assume that every information their system contains is always true. He said "yes". <br><br>Thirdly, when talking about modeling the world, it is impossible not to talk about verification and validation. Simply said, the first is testing if your model fits your data and the second is testing if the model fits your needs. When conducting rational science, the models developed by research are always verificated, but never validated, because science itself has no purpose that can be used as a validation benchmark. So all the scientific knowledge we have gained in the last centuries is true, and we know that because we have some very good scientists. But we do not have a clue if all of this is any useful. Of course validation is a job for engineers, because they use science to find solutions for real purposes, however that is just theory. If I (as an engineer) validate my work and tell my boss that what our department does is the wrong approach for the problem, we should dissolve the department entirely than i get told that this is not of my concern. So i do not see who in this world actually validates all the nonsense we are doing.<br><br><a href=#c3654837142946164132 title="comment permalink">7/22/15, 10:29 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_b6373a" id=c1805181377760450715></div><b><a href=https://economicilliteracy.wordpress.com/ rel=nofollow>economicilliteracy</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>JMG - I also wonder if there's a cognitive negative feedback loop at work.<br><br>As you've noted, we all walk around with a model of the universe inside our heads; it's the required adaptive mechanism to prevent us from drowning in the complexity of the world. Like all models, it's by necessity an over-simplification of complex systems, and relies heavily on relevance filtering - knowing what to ignore (i.e. to not model) is a critical success factor. Presumably the hominids who decided to not model the behaviour of leopards on the savannah weren't fortunate enough to share their genes with the next generation, but the ones who made the cognitive step of not attempting to model the significance of individual leopard spots did.<br><br>The required cognitive feedback loop allows the model to be updated from real-world experience; if you've never seen that particular four-legged animal before, but it turns out to have a desire to chase and potentially devour you, then updating the model to categorise it as a predator and invoke the "run away!" response is a useful adaptation. But the thing that civilisation allows us to do is to adjust the environment to align with our model, rather than aligning our model to account for changes in the environment; in effect, it weakens the cognitive feedback loop at the individual level.<br><br>As it turns out, my professional experience has brought me into contact with a wide range of people who end up having their cognitive models challenged by on-the-ground reality, and over the past decade the percentage of those people who simply refuse to adjust their internal models to reflect the way the world works has (in my experience) risen dramatically. <br><br>For a normally-adjusted human being, the feedback loop should go <i>outside context problem -&gt; consideration and reflection -&gt; explore solution space for possible responses -&gt; address problem -&gt; update model to reflect reality</i>. Unfortunately there are now an increasingly large number of people who seem to go <i>outside context problem -&gt; cognitive dissonance that reality doesn't accord with the internal model -&gt; get grumpy at Universe for not conforming to model -&gt; take no steps to adjust or change model</i>. This is maladaptive, to put it mildly ... but in my experience, an increasingly common response mechanism amongst far too many people. And the more people who buy into this dysfunctional mode of thinking, the more likely that the negative effects you describe will come to pass for the civilisation concerned.<br><br>One of the most perceptive and concise commentaries on the difficulties of modelling a complex world (albeit in a very different context) is <a href="http://www.furia.com/page.cgi?type=twas&amp;id=twas0496" rel=nofollow>this one</a>, which I've quoted to many people for more than a decade:<br><br>"Our technology increasingly obscures the relevant criteria with the irrelevant, overlaying illusory and ill-fit simplicity on genuinely and meaningfully complex problems. We replace people with numbers, and data with summaries, and paragraphs with quasi-graphs, until we're left with shiny Go/No-Go toggles, and then hope that flipping a coin will count as wisdom if we just do it with a firm enough hand. We push decision-making up the hierarchy while information drains down it. Our systems for progress and compliance will fail in the long term, not just because over-modeling embeds dysfunction and engenders systemic fragility, but more crucially because over-modeled systems untrain their most important users long before they can afford to. The executives make bad decisions based on misconsolidated numbers, and the people who know what the numbers misrepresent slowly forget how to make better ones."<br><br>And thank you for your insights and wisdom in this blog.<br><br><a href=#c1805181377760450715 title="comment permalink">7/22/15, 10:42 PM</a><br><br>

But even without civilizational retardation, perhaps we've just never had the chance as a species to develop the brains or culture required for civilization.

First, primitive skills require you to work with raw materials in their rawest form: lump of flint, rock hammer, chunk of tree branch, length of sinew, here's your new stone axe. That's a great way to get out of the wholly abstract and interact with the sheer reality of matter. Second, there's a certain degree of confidence that only comes from knowing that you could be plopped down without gear in a trackless wilderness and still be able to do okay, and that confidence is worth having. <br><br>Leo, I honestly expect Heaven's Gate phenomena on a large scale in the years ahead. The Rapture business seems to point that way very directly; when somebody tells his kids that Grandma went to heaven to be with Jesus, most people know what that means. It would not surprise me in the least if a lot of Americans found some excuse for suicide as the least uncomfortable way to keep not dealing with the future...<br><br>Stream, millions of years of ancestors laid down the patterns in consciousness that give you that awareness.

Since we are biological and infinitely complex as individuals, despite an incredibly rigid, oppressive environment, the one genius can break down the whole system, matrix style. Truth will out. This is nature. However this genius perceives simply a slightly highe level of complexity, which in its turn becomes the oppressive societal matrix in turn, newton, einstein, jesus, mohammed, buddha, keynes. Thought itself seems to be the problem. We live from constructs. Games , art, creativity he discusses in the book. Seemingly meaningless we need to live in a fantasy world where we invent the rules. Shocking at the start of the book is the description of the massive variety of nonstandard sexual relationships common in primitive societies before monogamous marriage got its way. Another example is dealing with old people. They hung themselves at 70 or were killed and eaten. Dying of sickness without a ritual eating of oneself was considered shameful. This must have reflected earlier experiences having weak people eaten by predators.<br><br><a href=#c4448003891316681260 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 12:21 AM</a><br><br>

Today competition rules the world, however it has led to unsustainable wealth gaps, resource over exploitation and with increasingly less winners than there are losers a system, where mathematically financial collapse is baked into the cake. When growth stops, debts can't be repaid with interest and the game is up.<br><br>Compare this with systems based on symbiosis. Biting ants live inside of otherwise defenseless plants, and when a herbivore tries to eat the plant the ants run out to bite the invader. In return, the plant provides a safe home and a food source for the ant colony. Traditional human agriculture can be similarly symbiotic, we take care of our select plants, fend off weeds and herbivores, and the plants provide for our food needs. Competition is a win-lose situation, where symbiosis is a win-win situation. What we need to do is to develop a symbiotic culture. You help me, I help you, we advance together in a decentralized altruistic system of mutual benefit. Clearly a better way than anything we've tried so far. Does every household need a vacuum, or could one vacuum be shared with four households with no reduction in carpet cleanliness? The possibilities are almost endless.<br><br>In regards, to your other point cities vs. nature, you clearly are correct with this proposition. I've even heard of politicians wanting to evacuate people from all the remote areas to cities so they can be better cared for with greater access to services; and of course, this would result in reduced costs to the government for things like remote doctor visits, utility service abandonment and such.

But its not the cities that confuses us, but what keeps the cities running - energy! With more energy we really can keep doing less with more, or slightly more with a lot more as the case may be in diminishing returns.<br><br>So I escaped one confusion, how we have the wealth and affluence as we experience, and so when I learned fossil fuels were the source, and they were finite, all bets were off for my security. I was just depressed to learn we'd have to wait until after 2030 to run low on oil, before I heard of peak oil, that happily brought up that date a couple decades.<br><br>And further I understand that money as status is the point of confusion that drives this social species, and that money seems to grow in proportion to how much energy we can consume, and when energy peaks out, we have to rely on debt to grow to compensate and keep economic growth alive, and so same problem, but more difficult to see what's behind the money. And Chris Martenson taught me "Assets are variable, while debt is fixed", so net worth is a delusion because everyone can't sell at the same time.<br><br>And the trickiest deception is the idea we can plan for the future, that money can be invested in the present, and produce more money in the future, which we can retire upon, while if you're SURE the economy must crash, no investment is safe, and yet as long as we believe the future can be managed, we can obliviously allow "experts" to invest our money into the speculation casinos. <br><br>But we do have an advantage over past civilizations that fell. We have global connectivity for the moment, so even with the impossibility of comprehending the frantic energy of 7 billion humans, if you want to know something, and if you're a bit careful you have access to a million lifetimes of information to explore, and connect to like minded people who can see the problems and predicaments we face together, and there's a possibility of acting before necessity absolutely demands it, and when our connectivity fails (or as it falls back to a tiny fraction of humanity), there will be scattered people everwhere aware and ready to act, even if in new isolation.<br><br>Still the virtual world perhaps offers unlimited chance to DECOUPLE mentally from the natural world, it also offers voices that can break our hallucinations, as Jesus said "Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear."<br><br>And Dostoyevsky offered in his fiction "We are all responsible to all, for all, apart from our own sins." and "Sometimes even if he has to do it alone, and his conduct seems to be crazy, a man must set an example, and draw men's souls out of their solitude, and spur them to some act of brotherly love, that the great idea may not die."<br>http://tinyurl.com/o8xm8cn<br><br>Its depressing to see we can't change the course of a runaway train, but we still have responsibility to keep a part of humanity above our lowest parts, and change what we can change, like the Serenity Prayer suggests.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer<br><br>Direct observations to nature might teach us that better than Wikipedia, but it doesn't hurt to start from the highest aspirations of humanity before giving up and falling into superstitions and taboos that guarantee our fear and ignorance.<br><br>Ideally there's no need to demonize any one side for being incomplete, like this poem I attempted to hold a tension of two opposites holding humanity together.<br>------------<br>The City:<br> where brick and concrete lie,<br> where people come to feed,<br> where time races and culture rises,<br> where wealth and influence may grow. <br><br>The Country:<br> where woods and pastures lie,<br> where people come to work,<br> where time seasons and culture deepens,<br> where health and relations may grow. <br><br>Between these worlds, We search for our garden.<br><br><a href=#c194810969036897063 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 1:54 AM</a><br><br>

Even in rural environments very few people have any contact with primary nature. Today's modern farmer has very little contact with primary nature. Essentially none. The farm which many people associate with nature is an extremely altered environment. Whatever remnants of nature existing in spaces that could not be plowed or grazed are depauperate of native species and are highly degraded. Many farmers in the Midwest used to pheasant hunt. But the monocultures of corn and soybeans have wiped out much of the grassland habitats these "Chinese ditch chickens" needed for food and cover. Some farmers still deer hunt but this experience is a far cry from requiring real hunting skills as it is more or less bringing the factory to the woods with its dependence on modern technologies that many mistake for the primary event. The commercial significance of the hunt to society, including the glory of trophy, ranks higher in value than maintaining the woods for its own sake. <br><br>And what is the attraction of this degraded secondary nature to even the non farm rural inhabitants? When many now perceive that primary nature worth a visit is some far away place where access is now affordable only to those with the means to invest in airfare or many gallons of gas to distant places on the map. Through commercial intermediaries and again, with all the required gear and technologies to check the boxes between point A and point B with little time to stop and absorb whatever this primary nature may offer in small detail. And of course this primary, pristine nature is often itself degraded in the process of development to make for comfortable access for the masses. Paradise lost as they say. The idea that natural experiences even in degraded places can be had for free close to home is lost to many. <br><br>Another key element in the resiliency of civilization should be considered: the development of hierarchy in human societies. Anthropologists have proven that the most stable and resilient social and cultural unit consisted of the band of not more than about 60 people. With demographic growth hierarchies evolved, adding niches to niches. We should ask whether there is not some ingrained resistance to this development in the mind of man? That there is something within each of us or at least some of us that resists hierarchical development beyond the tribal level into chiefdoms, states, nations and empires? Is this our own human nature to resist? To throw the monkey wrench? To be subversive? Do some of us hear this call? And if so, does this lead some of us to be non conformists? And there are certainly many forms this can take. Nature selects for divergence, for diversity. Even within the narrow confines of advanced civilizations, is there not some deep seated natural tendency within man himself to knock it all back to a sustainable, resilient level? To resist both the rise and the fall? To which civilization resists with might and power. And its obfuscated god for the subduing of subversive spirits? <br><br><br><a href=#c2019748150256228715 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 3:19 AM</a><br><br>

Although he was referring to the cultural constructs, you have made a good case for the the actual physical constructs also being hallucinatory - a concretisation of human intellect. The map is indeed not the territory, and that's a maxim useful for keeping a grip on our own cognitive bias, however it seems that 'civilisation' is a programme that attempts to force the territory into conformity with the map <i>du jour</i>.<br><br>Our attitude to map-making is that it is a process of collating information, that is to say we imagine the map as something being built up. Perhaps it is truer to say in fact that it is actually a process of eliminating information. In this sense, we imagine a map as [paper PLUS information], and forget that it is actually [territory MINUS information].<br><br>Using real cartography as a metaphor for the broader concept of general mapmaking, we can see that different maps of the same territory can be very different depending on what has been omitted. To a large degree I would also argue that map-making is a way to actively filter out the system view of the territory. A topographical map is very different to a political map, where lines represent either contours or electoral boundaries. By seperating the territory into a range of maps, functional linkages cannot be seen. How many maps would one need to align to explain the sharp change of vegetation cover that marches across the island of Hispaniola, for instance?<br><br>Map-making is a process of selecting information, and the selection can be driven by various imperatives, some benign, some more malign, for instance forbidding the inclusion of climate change on the map of Florida.<br><br><a href=#c6212596648647796161 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 3:27 AM</a><br><br>

Founded by Jon Young and his mentor Ingwe in 1983, and with loose ties to the tracker Tom Brown, the movement has spread and been nurtured by local groups all over the US. They bring a profound and healing connection to nature to the children, adolescents, and adults in their communities. Their curricula usually include tracking, nature observation, survival skills like fire making and shelter building, etc. They use storytelling, reverence, and ceremony to encourage the natural spirituality that recognizes the sacred power inherent in birth, death and the turning of the seasons. <br> <br>I’ve gratefully witnessed the journeys of many children and adolescents within the wilderness awareness community. The Waldorf class I taught for 8 years did a vision quest towards the end of their time with me. These adolescents, the oldest in the camp, were treated like the warriors in a tribal village before a hunt- excused from chores, mentored in survival skills, then sent off to for a 36 hour “solo” with no food or fire except what they could provide with a bow drill. The whole community gathered to see them off and to sing them back and hear their stories when they had finished. The maturity, gratitude, and wisdom in their reflections will stay with me always. <br><br>My own son was rescued by the mentoring he received from our local wilderness awareness group. At the age of 10 he was heading for trouble- a combination of ADHD tendencies, a problematic relationship with his dad and an impending divorce. Several men in this group stepped forward to provide him with inspiration, mentoring, and summer Internships/jobs starting from the time he he was 13. Once when he had treated another child badly, they sent him off alone to tend a fire for half a day with a ceremony to welcome him back to the community afterwards. They provided him and his age mates with a rite of passage/vision quest that involved a night alone on a local mountainside complete with a visit from a mother bear and her cubs. <br><br>Now at 21, he can build a bow drill fire in all weathers, construct primitive shelters and forage/fish/ hunt for food. He will head for the nearby mountains for a few days with nothing but a tarp and a fishing pole. He mentors children in primitive skills both at the summer camp he attended since the age of 10 and in an after school program in a nearby inner city. While he somewhat dismisses my Green Wizardry attempts (I’m part of a network that grows much of our food, and experiments with rocket stoves, solar dehydrators, tiny houses, etc.), I feel he’s in a good position to thrive if/when the SHTF. For any readers who want to raise resilient children or connect to nature themselves, I can’t recommend these programs too highly.<br><br>Here’s a link: http://wildernessawareness.org/associates/usa/<br><br><a href=#c8852198776473759893 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 5:32 AM</a><br><br>

We then proceeded to construct physical and mental environments that are not only much simpler than any natural system (predisposing us to hubris), but which are comparatively deficient in negative feedback (thus subtly sabotaging our inborn learning processes.)<br><br>If that's a reasonably accurate, two questions arise.<br><br>First: If our built environments are deficient in negative feedback, does that imply an oversupply, or at least a dominance, of <i>positive</i> feedback? Systems dominated by positive feedback tend to be oscillators; the simpler they are, the more strongly they find loudly resonant frequencies. Could this be affecting our minds as well: a throb or pulse or rhythm of our civilization that is more mechanical and less differentiated that the changing rhythms of nature? If so, what might <i>that</i> be doing to us?<br><br>Second: would this insight have Fermi's Paradox implications about tool-using civilizations on other worlds?

Naturally we adapt to whatever habitat we find ourselves born and raised in, and a person who's lived in a city her whole life will not have the skill set that an Amish farmer has, and vice versa. After all, country tourists visiting NYC for the first time are completely overwhelmed by the noise, the bustle, the constant assault on the senses. Not just because there's more or less than at home, but because it's so different than what they're accustomed to.<br><br>(I'd also say that we didn't stop "evolving" 10,000 years ago; the notion that we did is the basis of the paleo-diet fallacy.)<br><br>That being said, history certainly does demonstrate the blinkered thinking and refusal to face certain realities of every civilization, and the greater adaptability of small groups. But I think that relatively greater adaptability usually demonstrated itself as the ability to simply get up and walk away from a bad place/situation. When a hunter-gatherer group exhausted the game in one area, they went elsewhere. When a drought dried up the river, they walked to another river (or vanished). When a hostile group attacked, they fought back or ran away. A huge part of the inability of an urbanized civilization to do that is simply inertia and investment: a civilization is necessarily large and ungainly, not small and light on its feet. And while a tribal unit can pick up and move from one river or savannah to another, a city can't pick up and go to some empty city. It needs to drag all its civilization along with it, or vanish into the forest.<br><br>And all <i>that</i> being said, with the way things are going, being small and light on your feet is definitely going to be advantageous in the very near future.<br><br><a href=#c1175845444403605696 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 5:56 AM</a><br><br>

There’s another related reason for the fragility of civilized cognitive modeling that you might consider adding to your analysis.<br><br>We did research many years ago for a labor union that was interested in convincing workers to take more of an active role in improving working conditions in their factory/industry. The thing they were up against, as we told them, was that each worker functioned within a “work box” – within which they were very clever at getting their work done, or shirking as the case might be, and they would generally take responsibility for making changes and improvements in small ways, etc. But the larger context of their work box was entirely outside of their control or conception – and unlike the labor organizers regular workers treated their working conditions as pretty much a fact of life – a kind of physical cosmos that just existed without any expectation of (or tolerance for) input from them. The worker’s task was to figure out the rules for succeeding in their little corner of it – and understanding the extent and limits of their scope for action.<br><br>The riddle you are trying to solve in this essay is why uncivilized life-ways seem less fragile than civilized, and while I think you’re right that a built environment creates a sort of intellectual ineptitude, I think an even more important factor is that nature looks after itself better (more durably) than civilization can.<br><br>Whatever delusions we decide to pursue (and non-civilized people can certainly rival us in that) when the context that supports our own box of models is “nature” – we have a fairly limited ability to completely wreck the external system with the tools of non-civilization. Nature goes about it is business willy-nilly, and humans have some leeway to react or not react to whatever reality testing is getting through. In the case of civilization, on the other hand, whether or not we understand, take responsibility for, or manage to maintain that external context of human-built civilization takes on an entirely different character. For a civilization to rise in the first place it presumably must have (by luck or design) a decently robust set of positive feedback loops, internal coherence, homeostatic habits and so on. (Much like nature does.) But as the context of civilization starts to falter, and we follow the very human habit of thinking and acting within the limits of our much smaller box of models – then there is no particular reason to expect that civilization is going to continue to repair and adjust itself successfully – especially if it comes down to our abilities to take that on intentionally. In other words – both non-civilized and civilized humans are generally content to treat the larger context of their lives as a given – beyond their influence and understanding. But the robustness and resilience of the natural world is more durable than that of a civilization. Every human culture could be placed upon a spectrum based on their own mixture of natural plus human-built. You describe civilized urbanites occupying one end of that spectrum, and that puts us out on a limb without nature’s resilience to give us any grounding.<br><br><a href=#c1720248175781171619 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 6:01 AM</a><br><br>

A question that comes to mind is why? We have a few thousand years history of humans repeatedly pulling themselves out of their natural surroundings to arrange themselves into highly-structured, urban societies that then crash and burn. What madness or discontent or drive makes us leave a relatively stable state, in harmony with our surroundings, to go off and construct squalid, festering, doomed-to-fail empires? While living in urban centers deprives us of a healthy connection with the environment we evolved from, being in that natural environment seems to compel us to organize ourselves out and away from it. Having lived primitively in the woods at different times in my life and also having lived in cities, I sometimes imagine my experience to be like a yo yo - traveling towards the one world and being yanked back towards the other. <br><br>I wonder if the answer to my question has something to do with population density. The smaller, more stable communities humans evolved in work because we evolved to be successful in groups of that size. When groups became too large they usually split, but that presumes the existence of territory to expand into. Civilization is what's cobbled together to meet the needs of a denser population that has no vacant territory to expand into. Civilization then would be a slapdash affair meant to cope with the refugees of overly successful reproduction and inter-species competition. Our urban centers are nothing more then than fancy refugee camps. We make them grand to disabuse ourselves of the nature of our predicament. Their violent collapse not much of a surprise because of their nature. And the rise of new urban centers a certainty as long as the numbers are there to prevent a return to smaller, more workable communities.<br><br><a href=#c582539481614697866 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 7:11 AM</a><br><br>

But you could take your analysis a logical step further. The people in our society who are by and large making the major decisions are not only operating in urban environments, where as you point out there is much less sensory input than in nature, but in offices. Working in an office myself, I realized some time ago how incredibly barren offices are in terms of sensory input. There's no smell, little noise, bland visual surroundings, and a constant temperature. I compared this to my grandfather's experience as a farmer, where, even doing something prosaic like moving his cattle, he was surrounded by a sea of input. It's possible, given the poverty of offices as sources of stimuli, that the brains of decision makers (and all of us who work in offices) have somewhat rewired themselves accordingly.

I've also experienced the profound change when I got rid of the tv, stopped going to movies and even buying shiny magazines, got an ad blocker for my computer (thank you Ghostery!) - the drop in over-stim and brainwashing, added to the move into Nature (albeit on a small cultivated homestead)changed how I see the world. And - of course - put me at odds with all my suburban/urban friends and family. Their response to Nature is both laughable and tragic. Anyway, I've probably told this before, but the two most shocking responses I'd heard were from children I'd taken on their first field trips - to county parks (not the wilds by any means). A five year old asked, about the trees we were passing, "is this real real or fake real?" (Thank you Disney - NOT!) and a 12 year old looked up at Bridal Veil Falls (huge) and asked, "Do they turn that on up there, or does it turn itself on?" She just couldn't grasp the idea of a waterfall! Sadly, living in Nature doesn't guarantee anything.

We spent the 1990s in Colorado, where large portions of the youth and young adults did spend much of their recreational time outdoors. But they viewed the wilderness as a playground, a massive outdoor gymnasium. They were increasingly into gear (the higher tech the better) to conquer the wild and prevent themselves from actually having to interact with it.

With equal certainty, they know that the statistical studies that show no such correlation must be wrong somehow. (Notably, though, an emergency room is far from a natural environment, nor is typically situated in one.

I wonder whether the real reason that method of divination gets dropped is not the negative feedback (which is less than 50%, considering the cases where the answer is correct by chance, the cases where the girl's own subsequent behavior self-fulfills the flower's prophecy, and the cases where one never finds out one way or the other) but the absence in our culture of a compelling and pervasive narrative insisting that it works and suggesting why. It's not as though the parity of randomly derived numbers can't be used to divine whether an influence is active or passive in a situation. (Starting about a month ago I've been learning and practicing geomancy, as you once suggested to me.)<br><br>With the utmost respect, I'll just gingerly mention that confirmation bias is a tricky topic in this setting. The implication that confirmation bias becomes more prevalent or more consequential when people interact with artificial surroundings is plausible, though, at the very least. A reasonable paraphrase: what nature expresses first-hand is more convincing than people or human artifacts can be.<br><br><a href=#c4424211713633151073 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 8:22 AM</a><br><br>

I hope the phrase is well understood in its engineering sense, but I've met enough people who say "negative feedback" when they mean "personal criticism" that I thought I'd add a few words to JMG's explanation. The sense of "negative feedback" as "criticism" has just enough truth in it to be confusing, but if you take criticism to be a pejorative term, the confusion is compounded. Something that I used to marvel at, as a child, was the way that I could be riding in a car on a two-lane country road and see a car approach from a mile or two away. It was always coming "straight for us", yet we always passed a few feet apart. Each driver was steering with "negative feedback": too far to the center, turn toward the shoulder; too far to the shoulder, turn toward the center. The action is the opposite of the observation (hence the feedback is negative).<br><br>On the other hand, positive feedback is something almost always to be avoided (in engineering)! House too warm; make it warmer? Too cold; make it colder? Driving close to the shoulder of the road, turn <b>toward</b> the shoulder? One use for positive feedback is in re-affirming a marginal choice: Having decided that the house is just a little too cold, turn on the heat for a guaranteed minimum period of time, because heating plants do not perform well with short cycles. Positive feedback works on a personal level, too.

This is one of those essays that keeps me so hooked on this site; A real face-palmer, (as in, why didn't I see that before!? It's so obviously there!). <br><br>So 2 things in reply:<br><br>I just recently read a novel about a boy growing up in Manhattan - that was not the meat of the story, but while reading,I was distracted, I couldn't stop thinking of the question of children growing up in, developing in and spending their whole lives in that uber-urban setting. WHY?, as when my kids were babies, My husband and I, and every other parent we knew instinctively, irrationally, thought, "NO. They HAVE to have some nature around them. We HAVE to be someplace where they can spend SOME time in a bit of wild". Irrational because as young adults we ADORED Manhattan, loved it to bits. We knew plenty of 'City Kids' who seemed perfectly fine, it's rationally a perfectly acceptable way to grow up; yet there was an overwhelming primal draw to provide them with some sort of natural access. We didn't even question it. Almost every parent I've ever discussed it with says they felt the same. They don't know why or question it either. <br><br>We settled on Hong Kong, partly because it provided us with both - uber-urban wherein we could actually make a living with our 'civilized' skill sets, yet on the south side - right on the beaches, some tame, some wild, inlets and coves to swim or row to and walking distance to the country parks, wherein there is shockingly more wildlife than one might imagine, (wild boar, wild dogs, civets, snakes, snakes, snakes). Then we chose this uber-rural US home, (I'm sitting in right now) in Wyoming - Nothing much to do, No strip malls, no traffic light, no fast food, Only one supermarket with scant, ugly, homegrown fruit and veg and the best tasting beef, buffalo and elk you've ever dreamt of. My teens seem to stay busy and happy outside all the time. The latest 'toy' is a scythe for the pasture). Although on hikes far from the roads, I'm just like May Hawk - know your jungle, don't overdo it, when you know you're in over your head. Learn to read the tracks and scat slowly, carefully. When we used to be able to afford to come also in the winter, it was even more so - covered in snow, far less "to do", yet we couldn't keep them inside for 5 minutes.<br><br>Interesting, given your (face palming) explanation of how our brains have developed for millennia to learn from nature. I, (and I would hazard to say so many like me) never thought of the cognitive dissonance, the disconnect for ourselves - but when having babies, when those parental hormones are surging - it was like a clarion call - "Get out of the city!".<br><br><a href=#c7845992703292589436 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 8:45 AM</a><br><br>

It is scallop season here in Florida, so on the weekends, my family and I are generally foraging around in the grass beds for those delicious little critters. It's both exciting and terrifying at the same time. Here we are, invaders of their world, yet we can look at it as though we belong there. There is so much life and so many different forms of life. The only sound you hear is the sound of your own breathing. It's practically the antithesis of artificial stimulation.<br><br>I've also gotten much more in tune with the seasons as a result of gardening and fishing. I now know when it's time to catch certain fish, where they can be found and what gets them to bite. That came from years of just doing it. Straight observation and trial and error. It feels good to gain that kind of skill. I see so many people with boats that cost half what my house cost and they can't catch anything. It's as though they figure they can buy being a good fisherman. Not until you put down the toys and start paying attention to the sea, the tides, the currents, the look of the bottom, etc.<br><br>Looking forward to next week's installment.<br><br><a href=#c4135306512550592137 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 8:47 AM</a><br><br>

The next time you have a chance, go out only as far as you feel comfortable. Then sit down, and in your heart, introduce yourself to all the beings you sense around you--the plants, rocks, clouds, mountains. Listen with your heart for their response. Perhaps you felt their hostility because you failed to introduce yourself. Never mind you're a city guy--you're human! The fact that you felt this is valuable and indicates you have not lost the ability to sense this.<br>The first time you go, don't try to stay the night. Just make friends. Then, perhaps next time you can go a little further. If you continue, later on you may feel ready to take the big step of staying all night all alone in a wilderness.

I'm not sure I understood JMG's contention to the effect that "[o]ne question I’ve never seen discussed, though, is whether the human intellect has needs that are only fulfilled by a natural environment." I don't think he would have meant that the issue itself hasn't been addressed--it would be of central interest to ecological psychology, ecological theories of mind, bioinformatics, eco- and biosemiotics. For the latter, see the work of Jesper Hoffmeier (e.g., 2008):<br><br>" That the species of this world are products of evolution is a fact we no longer have to defend, and thus we no longer need to agree on some unitary, simple mechanism to justify its belonging inside well-established scientific knowledge. Rather we should try to grasp the evolutionary process on Earth as a multifaceted play of creative life processes. That such a process has ultimately created intelligence is a striking fact.... Biosemiotics, by positing interpretation in the center of its focus, necessarily admits semiosis as an inescapable feature of life and claims that semiosis (i.e., sign action, 1 see below) was the root-form of intentionality and intelligence." (p. 253)<br><br>A particularly good early example of these lines of thinking is the work of ecological philosopher Paul Shepard in such works as _The Subversive Science_ and _Thinking Animals: Animals and the Development of Human Intelligence_ (1978). Shepard makes a powerful case that animals are a particularly vital resource in early child development, particularly in our capacity to model other minds and ways of being in the world. He makes the broader point that the exquisite plasticity and complexity of human minds is itself the product of ecological diversity, and the range of beings with which we have evolved by interacting with. Human-centric or human-only environments are, on this view, dangerously impoverished as resources for our mental health and cognitive flourishing.<br><br>If JMG means, instead, that he hasn't seen this line of thinking extended from ecological concern to the question of civilizational collapse, I think we could argue that it's at least implicit in the work of Catton, one of his heroes.<br><br>In Shepard's Thinking Animals he links the development of our brain capacity beyond that of other primates as an artefact of the expansion of our range and repertoire from forest omnivore to include grassland predator modelling. Others--Merlin Donald's _A Mind So Rare_, for example, make the argument that the special spur to our cognitive development was emergent human culture. Not civilization, but increasingly complex and materialized expressions of sign-making and interpretation.<br><br>I think we can still endorse JMG's overall argument about the detrimental isolation of civilization from its more-than-human matrix (Norretranders provides powerful arguments along these lines as does Bateson) without omitting from the overall portrait particular ecocidal and civilization-destroying forms of cultural organization--late-stage capitalist globalization being one. <br><br>JMG himself is an exemplar of the millions if not billions of people who are or could be persuaded that massive change is called for and would choose differently on a terrain of choices configured differently. The recent referendum in Greece might be read in any number of ways, but one is of a people pushed to the wall and prepared to defy the diktats of these elites only to find that option traduced and foreclosed upon by overwhelming financial power.<br><br><a href=#c8065781914728756675 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 9:14 AM</a><br><br>

For humans to do unnatural things, we would need to be somehow separate from the natural world. We would need to be "special". My belief is that there is nothing special about humans-we are just part of the universe. As I have state here previously, I carry this view even further to the extent that the distinction between myself and a rock is meaningless when these "distinct" entities are viewed at the subatomic level in space. So if humans are not special, if they are not ever really separate from the universe, how can they do anything unnatural? Viewed this way, our manipulations of matter and energy are merely the universe "playing with itself". That is not to say that this self play isn't destructive to some eddy's of organization within the universe. Yes, the effects of this game will be tragic for our little eddy. But I believe that when this eddy is completely disrupted and our organism has been destroyed, some new energy eddy will arise in the universe and a new game will ensue. Throughout the universe, creation is the product of destruction (or the reverse). Does any of this make "me" happy? Absolutely not. I love being as a human on this planet to which my body is so well adapted. I have two children that I love very much and I work every day to teach them things that I hope will help them survive in the "natural" world. But, deep down inside, I know that we are part of a infinite organism that cannot be concerned about our consciousness. I love this planet and all that it contains and I would like it to be here forever. But I know that that is not possible. <br><br>As an aside, it has not escaped my notice that Stephen Hawking and a number of other members of our "intelligentsia" seem to have given up on our Earth and have turned their attention toward the techno-utopian promise of inhabiting some other planet. These "geniuses" think they are special. I suspect that that a lot of people will put money into these escape schemes and enrich a few swindlers. I doubt that any will escape the aftermath of "the games" that we are currently playing with our planet.<br><br><a href=#c8548806353015433478 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 9:25 AM</a><br><br>

Order is a measure of the opposite. Consciousness does not consist of very much information and regards itself as order. It is proud that by discarding information it can reduce all the disorder and confusion around it to simple, predicatable laws for the origin of phenomena. Civilization consists of social and technological organization that rids our lives of information. As civilization has progressed, it has enabled the withdrawal of consciousness of the world. (p. 410)<br><br>The Age of Composure of Consciousness...<br><br>"But consciousness has also reached the age of composure. Through conscious studies of man and his consciousness, it has become clear that man is much more than his consciousness. It has become clear that people perceive far more than consciousness knows; that people do far more than their consciousness knows.

About 15 years ago one of our august "national" publications noted that the students in my hometown (a small, out-of-the-way place) consistently scored highest in the province on certain academic tests.<br><br>My-oh-my the astonishment this incited. I mean, how could these hicks outscore city kids? Once, ok, flukey things happen. But this? <br><br>Never mind that people in such towns need skill sets in occupations that involve making and growing things that city-dwellers find magically appearing on store shelves, that involve more than spreadsheets and meeting rooms. How can it happen that there's also competence in stuff that only city people are supposed to know? <br><br>And so reporters went on an expedition to the place. I'll bet they expected some TV-land "Hooterville" with tabacky chawin' morons in coveralls. You know, Mr Druckers and Jethro Bodines and Ellie May Clampetts all around. <br><br>And they asked about the nature of the town and schools. A real head scratcher so let's hear from the cretins themselves: "Everybody knows everybody". And somebody opined that there's a "woven-ness" to the place. "Woven-ness", I'll bet that wowed the reporters. <br><br>The answer? Realistically there's no one answer. <br><br>In any case, a long article was the result, wonderment at such a sociological phenomenon, the interviewees and objects of this implicit scorn guys I grew up with and, by extension, "expats" like yours truly. <br><br>Imagine, if the place with such high academic results had been a neighbourhood in Ottawa or Toronto, NOBODY on the newspaper would blink. But THAT place????? Where people get dirty, where people bathe after work as opposed to before? <br><br>This is just ONE example. This is one of the last allowable bigotries. I've seen hot-shot pundits on national TV talk about urban areas where people are "educated" as opposed to our version of fly-over country where people supposedly aren't. <br><br>I've seen another of our eastern-based, self-described, "national" publications write about an arts centre in a western city. In this case in-your-face bigotry: the writer asked the person he was interviewing but isn't this "red-neck" country? And they didn't mean "red-neck" as a compliment. Can you imagine if the arts centre was in a small town?<br><br><a href=#c5196686498892025546 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 10:02 AM</a><br><br>

But, at this current point, that positive impulse is very often <i>distorted</i> and expresses itself in forms that can be, at best, less beneficial than it might be, and at worst, actively damaging.<br><br>I have spotted a number of examples of this - here one that's been exercising (pun!) me recently. <br><br>Part of the "natural world" is one's own body (of course!) and so walking, running, climbing, swimming, cycling, done out-of-doors, are all lovely, healthy, intrinsically <i>good</i> and a plenty of people want to do them. Using one's muscles is a very intimate way of experiencing the truth of one's connection to the rest of nature - that's why it's satisfying even if it hurts a bit. These activities are not, in principle, damaging and the world could, in prnciple, sustain a huge amount of them. Except that in our current cultural setup pretty much everything comes with a huge side order fossils fuels and many find it impossible to imagine things any other way. <br><br>So, for example, someone takes up running and they <i>drive</i> to the local fun runs, or maybe they join a club (social - another positive natural impulse) and copy what the keener people in their club do by <i>flying</i> to 'collect' marathons all over the world. Or - another positive impulse - they decide to raise money for a charity so take part in organised 'challenges', which inevitably start with flying to some exotic part of the world to climb or kayak or cycle something or other. Who could say it's 'bad'? And yet ... and then there's the ton of fancy kit that beckons. So if 'outdoor activity' becomes a serious 'hobby' the default involves burning oil. Nobody is being a 'bad' person. All originates from good impulses. Yet the focus of the activity slides from <i>connection</i> to <i>consuming</i>, and it shades into just <i>stomping</i> all over things.<br><br><a href=#c1495610755024871274 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 12:11 PM</a><br><br>

Adding to the anecdotes is the chapter in The Omnivores Dilemma where the author goes wild pig hunting. He describes the change in perceptions and values and then the return to civilized values and a certain amount of shame at having been caught up in the killing and enjoying the victory of success. <br><br>Tracking and mapping locations in space are major activities that are ignored when discussing a lot of what our brains are primed to do. Children playing hide and go seek are a simulation of what our wilder kin do when roaming the landscape with a purpose. I might argue that the basis of some meditation techniques is to simulate these mental tools to make a shift to a more intense awareness of sensory input. In other words, a lot of spiritual yearning is for these primal states of being.<br><br>Urban life turns the map into the linear street scape rather than the space and landmark method of the less civilized or even rural population. Getting instructions from the rural locals invariably includes landmarks rather than street numbers or exact instructions regarding distance. When I lived in the Barrio I also noticed that the locals [who tended to be more out and about than us cubicle jockeys] were extremely aware of what was going on just by the sounds of cars they recognized or a glimpse of person walking. Even when indoors they still stayed tuned to local activities. So even in an urban setting the use of perceptual methods akin to hunting or gathering is seen in sub-cultures where keenness of sight and hearing are highly valued. Yes, this is gang territory. Our thugs are sometimes more attuned than your average educated person.<br><br><a href=#c2942674459996421868 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 1:01 PM</a><br><br>

As a teacher, I heard from others and more or less confirmed for myself that only about 2% of students are really creative problem solvers, perhaps 15 or 20% are what I call "infrastructure", i.e., people who can take the ideas of others and implement them by following instructions and making minor adaptations. The rest are of varying degrees of usefulness. The British Empire managed to get by for a while on the younger sons of its nobility--there were enough of them to have a pool of creative problem solvers which enabled them to get by, and they had a culture that encouraged the younger sons to establish themselves in the military or colonial activities. Also, their military and colonial administration were meritocracies to some extent--I recall reading that their military, for instance, figured that 1 in 22 was a natural leader who would emerge if a unit got badly bloodied in combat. But at home they were not a meritocracy and eventually this doomed their empire.<br><br>So the idea is that after a while you wind up with an oligarchy in which there are insufficient persons of creative ability, not enough new blood of ability coming into the elite ruling class which becomes increasingly reserved for the children of existing privilege. <br><br>Sort of like the Kennedy, Bush and Clinton clans dominate our political landscape--people who will follow the old traditions. Even though our business may to some extent be a meritocracy (some would say of sociopaths), the innovators of that fraction of society will not allow any creative "trouble makers" to emerge in the candidates for high office.

Like many in this culture, I played them as a young person. I now find them so, so incredibly boring, even stifling when compared to being in the outdoors, gardening, or being engaged in a woodworking or telescope project in my shop. It seems a fairly recent phenomenon that there are these legions of adult gamers and I have pondered many times what this intuits about our culture that adults would want to spend so much of their time in a totally artificial and predefined fantasy environment. I can only posit that there is a comfort to be found in the rule-based and finite nature of videogames for these people. I have to wonder whether these people have missed out on experiencing nature to such a degree that they now seek to control their existence even further than that allowed by just living in a completely human-built environ, they now live in a built environment for the mind. This pheonomenon will surely have ramifications, previously, I feel like adults put down these kind of fantasy environments when they came of age and engaged with something resembling reality. What I see so often now is that many, many "adults" just continue to live ensconced in these fantasy worlds. While I feel like I am much more nature oriented than most of the people who surround me, I thank you for spurring me to think more deeply about the ways in which this city, this built environ, shapes and influences my thinking and values.<br><br><a href=#c5292599237259072463 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 2:16 PM</a><br><br>

I’ve been ruminating on this myself lately -- how we in the modern world have become surrounded by the artificial, in many subtle ways that we don’t usually think about. Electric lights became increasingly ubiquitous over generations, until we lost our intuitive sense of time and seasons. Chemicals in food slowly came to dominate flavour, until we forgot what things really taste like. Many of us learned politics from a yelling voice on the radio, sing songs we heard over loudspeakers and know only the jokes we saw on social media. We describe physical space in terms of driving a car through it. <br><br>I’m still having trouble, though, with your idea: that civilisations decline when their inhabitants rely on human abstractions rather than the natural reality. I agree that’s a major factor in our society, due to our vehicles, electronics, chemicals, media, and other things, but the Sumerians or Olmec didn’t have those things. Most people in those civilisations remained farmers, and even kings back then lived closer to the natural world than most cubicle workers today; for example, they had to experience the same weather as everyone else, with no air conditioning or glass panes. They had cities and palaces, but they were much smaller than people imagine -- the average new US home is the size of the Biblical Temple of Solomon, and their cities would be villages to us. <br><br>I grant you the parallels in, say, military overreach or resource exploitation, but I’m having a harder time seeing the parallels in purging the natural world from everyday life. I hope you don’t take this as another “It’s different this time” argument – you know I agree with you on most things – but this is one way in which our culture seems quite unique. <br><br>Also – if you don’t mind my being argumentative – how do we know that foraging societies have lasted longer than civilisations without collapsing? In other words, how do we know that most tribes didn’t decline and fall just as badly and often, but left no cities behind to make their collapse apparent to subsequent generations? <br><br>Thanks again, <br><br>Brian Kaller<br>County Kildare, Ireland<br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c3025451317807378119 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 2:53 PM</a><br><br>

Attempting to compare the cost of renewables versus fossil fuels is difficult because of all the hidden subsidies of fossil fuels. (Having said that, this does not mean PV is a silver bullet! Also, as has been discussed many times already, peak oil and energy constraints are but one facet of our society's overreach.

Your experience suggests that some aspects of it may be. <br><br>Aron, but it's certainly not the kind of feedback your nervous system was evolved to process, and it's much cruder, louder, and less information-rich. <br><br>Sunbindsblackstone, to my knowledge, sequences of ages that decline are found solely in societies that have emerged out of the collapse of a previous civilization. You get all kinds of shapes of time in uncivilized societies, but I don't know of an example of the ages-that-get-worse model. <br><br>Beetleswamp, I skipped it, too, and will continue to do so! I think the model you've suggested, though, makes a lot of sense. <br><br>Karuna, no, I wasn't familiar with it. Thanks for the heads up. <br><br>Nathan, exactly. Every civilization starts with ideas borrowed from nature. What in nature does walking down the streets of a modern inner city remind you of? <br><br>Bill, yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Your first question -- yes, and we'll be discussing that next week. Your second? Maybe; it could be argued that every intelligent species evolves in a natural environment and is thus poorly fitted to the urban or urban-analogue environment necessary to build the infrastructure and technology for space travel.<br><br>Brian, "good" and "bad" are value judgments, and always presuppose "good for what?" and "bad for what?" That is to say, no, we're not going there. <br><br>RPC, okay, let's take a look at the data. Ancient Egypt went through three dark ages -- the First and Second Intermediate Period, and whatever they're now calling the time of troubles that followed the collapse of the New Kingdom. When things got pulled back together afterwards, the result was still recognizably Egyptian, though there were radical changes at each transition. (China has a very similar history.) The Edo period in Japan lasted just over 250 years and followed a dark age; we have no idea what it would have done given another 750 years of uninterrupted development. Byzantium is a more interesting case; I've argued (in my essay about catabolic collapse) that it was saved by the rise of Islam, which forced Byzantium to downsize fast enough to survive. Any questions?<br><br><a href=#c7606748557871765173 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 5:16 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, that can be worked into the overall model. <br><br>Zaphod, a case can certainly be made for a natural human community size, though it's also true that people seem to be able to reinvent that in a great many different patterns of settlement -- the old-fashioned urban neighborhood might have around that many people, for example. <br><br>Erik, I don't have an institutional affiliation so they'd chuck it in the trash. I've tried that game before! Thanks anyway. <br><br>Daergi, that's one way of looking at it, but human population numbers aren't an independent variable -- they depend on a galaxy of factors, with access to food and water among the more important. Not every human society has population increase hardwired into it, and in fact you get situations like the classical Mediterranean, where the population declined steadily for centuries on end. I'll offer my proposed explanation shortly. <br><br>Scott, yes, and that's also a part of the whole picture, since decision-makers in every civilization routinely insulate themselves from unwanted stimuli to the greatest possible extent. <br><br>Cathy, that five year old deserves a treat -- to have grasped the difference between "real real" and "fake real" at that age is a feat, and promises well for the child's future. As for the waterfall, I know a lot of urban parents in places surrounded by mountains who have to explain to their children that nobody made the mountains -- they're just there. <br><br>Jonathan, you've fallen into the same logical trap as Ben did last night. I'm saying (a) all civilizations implode after lifespans averaging a thousand years; (b) uncivilized societies can last much longer than this, and some have; and (c) there are features of civilized societies that may explain this. I didn't say, please note, that all civilizations crash and burn and no uncivilized societies do!<br><br>Bill, that's sad. Oddly enough, you do see kids here in Cumberland heading down to the river with fishing poles, so I wonder how regional a thing we're discussing. <br><br>LatheChuck, exactly. It's as though their office building was on fire and they sat around as the flames neared them, discussing how to get someone else to call the fire department. <br><br>K-dog, yes, but it's not just policy makers.

What makes a city dangerous to the intellect is that it visually, and sometimes through other senses as well, reiterates the tacit presuppositions of the culture back to its residents.

Here's a falsifiable prediction relevant to that blog: whenever anybody says "renewable energy is going to take off and become economically viable by X date," they're wrong, no matter what the date is. I've been saying that in specific cases for some years now, and it may as well become a general rule.<br><br>Indus, the fact that I've never seen a question addressed doesn't mean that it hasn't been addressed; it simply means that if it has been, I haven't seen it. One of the reasons I phrased it that way is precisely that I knew that any of my readers who had seen the question addressed would let me know, for which thank you. <br><br>Jason, "natural" is a label with a galaxy of potential meanings. I specified repeatedly in last week's post what I was talking about: for the purposes of the present discussion, an environment is natural if most of the things in it were put there by nonhuman actions and processes, and it's unnatural if most of the things in it were put there by human beings.

It is rare for me not to see what some would consider wild creatures on my city journeys (deer, eagles, mink, muskrat, fish, herons, coyotes). <br>In grade school, I used to trap mink and muskrat in the city lakes with my friends, we had lots of fun and could make a few bucks to boot (in full compliance with hunting/trapping regulations). <br>I can only imagine what kind of an uproar that would cause if kids trapped in the city now.<br>Human children are creatures I rarely see around these urban wild areas, they used to be all over not long ago. <br>In fifth grade (1968), the school I went to offered a firearms safety courses (then a requirement for those under 16 to go hunting). After the last classroom training course we had to qualify at a shooting range to get our safety certificate. Everyone brought their guns to school that day and we all packed up into a school bus and went off to the range. This was at an intercity school in Minneapolis where any kid with a piece of plastic that is gun shaped today may cause a SWAT team to be called, an international news story to sprout and herds of legislators promising to outlaw plastic. The point of this has to do with hallucinations, where things that were once quite ordinary have been converted into ideas of horror (kids getting gun training) and highly risky items to all of humanity hardly rate a nod (climate change, etc).<br><br><a href=#c1509583375355750021 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 6:19 PM</a><br><br>

The farmers didn't make the decisions that doomed the Mayans to collapse, btw; it was the people who lived in the big stone palaces and spent their days in a round of ritualized activities far removed from raw nature.

(Among other things, I taught Rise of Civilization. We--grad students and professors--often lamented that we were not also allowed to teach Fall of Civilization. For some reason, the university administration wasn't interested in that.) Over the years, each new crop of students seemed to be less and less able to perform certain basic cognitive processes such as logical inference and pattern recognition. I was continually amazed that more of those kids didn't get dead, and I felt like it should be recognized as some sort of disability. Of course, our educational system--like the civilization of which it is part--is a sinking ship, which is part of why I bailed. As you said in last week's post with your language-learning analogy, there are specific windows in childhood for learning specific things. Miss the window and you've missed your shot in this incarnation. In this sense, it's not at all surprising that so many of us are unable to see, let alone fix, the mess we've made. <br><br>Suddenly I am all the more grateful to my parents for raising me in the country and taking me hiking and camping, and all my dad's attempts at making his own beer and goat cheese and the resulting explosions. But though I am a huge fan of "primitive" technologies (and in particular "Neolithic" ones, given our social context), I don't think learning them or getting "out in nature" can fully bridge the cognitive gap. Learning these skills is an improvement on what's currently in our mental toolkit, and increases the likelihood of surviving collapse, but without the full cultural and, as you rightly point out, natural context, it can't teach us the kind of cognition that non-civilized societies have. (And to be clear, I don't think that you, JMG, are saying that, but I have heard others suggest it.) I am afraid that only natural selection can teach us to think outside our box now.<br><br><a href=#c2419768607663348551 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 7:18 PM</a><br><br>

The mind is a creation engine, creating mental models pervasively, Dreaming? Model creation disconnected from the senses, Consciousness? A self referential model of oneself.

I'm going to read the book, mostly because I am wondering if our willful lack of response to the problems facing us is due to the lack of negative feed back in our environment, and thus enhancing our ability to ignore those negative consequences. As we are more adept at warding off famines and plagues we forget that we don't actually control death or the lack of it's prevalence in our immediate experience.  The idea that we can put off death for a long time or even "over come" it in the literal rather than spiritual sense, seems to get positive feedback from video games and from other cultural expressions.  You can just start the game over and optimize your character so that it has the attributes necessary to succeed in the manufactured environment.  Our popular characters never get killed even in the face of all of the common causes of death.<br><br>Anyway thanks for the thought provoking essays!<br><br><a href=#c8715436285106763344 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 8:01 PM</a><br><br>

A great many cultures and spiritual traditions consider coming to terms with our own mortality an essential part of maturation -- and the lack of that is among the major reasons we've got so many overgrown toddlers in contemporary society. <br><br>Jonathan, duly noted. For what it's worth, I think we're dealing with a both/and rather than an either/or situation -- that is, both biological and cultural factors play a role. <br><br>Crow Hill, it depends very much on local ecological realities. East of the Mississippi, for example, due to the lack of large predators, deer are abundant enough to damage local ecosystems, and hunting is a way to bring their population back into balance. Similarly, over much of the country, feral pigs have become a massive and ecologically damaging presence, and keeping their numbers down contributes to the resilience of the rest of the environment. Does that mean that all hunting everywhere is appropriate? Of course not -- but it does mean that some hunting in some places actually contributes to the health of ecosystems.<br><br><a href=#c319767288394555041 title="comment permalink">7/23/15, 10:53 PM</a><br><br>

I wasn't joking when I said to you a week or two back that I'm only just keeping ahead of the seasons here.<br><br>Fortunately, for construction purposes, this week has been drier than usual (as well as last month), but in keeping with the theme of this week's essay I will try and describe the world here as I saw it late last evening and perhaps commenters can get a sense of the differences between being immersed in nature or being immersed in an artificial environment and overly concerning themselves with abstractions.<br><br>Most nights, either Sir Scruffy or Scritchy the dogs’ want to do a boundary check on the farm, so off we trundle out into the cold night. Winters here are not like winters in many parts of the world. It is cold and chilly for sure, but it is rarely frozen. <br><br>Last night, the clouds scudded past the small crescent of a moon that was low on the horizon. When the moon is low to the horizon here, it has a sickly yellowish glow to it. Needless to say it didn't produce much light so Scruffy and I ambled through the orchard in the dark - hoping not to crash into any fruit trees. Scruffy alerts me to any nearby animals. Dogs as well as all of the other animals of the forest can sense for example a wedge tail eagle from a long distance away so it always pays to listen to what the dogs have to say to you about the forest and its denizens.<br><br>Last night was a warm night, which during winter can mean that a change in weather is on its way. A light wind rustled the leaves at the very top of the tall trees, whilst also failing to make its presence felt at lower heights. The forest was alive with sounds. Owls can be heard in the distance stalking their prey calling: Boo - Book over and over again off in the distance and from various hunting grounds too. The screech of the Powerful Owl, lets you know that the real boss of the night time is around. Tree frogs and toads call out in pleasure at the future rain and they too are worthy of listening to.<br><br>During winter the night time insects are quiet, but the wallabies bouncing off and away from Sir Scruffy and I and into the safety of the surrounding forest makes a sort of thump, thump, thump sound. I hope not to accidentally one day approach a grey forest kangaroo bull as they are much bigger problem than I am, and I'm uncertain as to whether they'd stand their ground or not. Sir Scruffy is usually wary of their kind and he will steer me to safety in the night.<br><br>cont...<br><br><a href=#c8751691421885594399 title="comment permalink">7/24/15, 3:33 AM</a><br><br>

Wombats actually literally do crash the vegetation and it is to their kind that the job of keeping the forest open falls to. The next day in the sunlight, all you will find in your vegetable beds is foot and claw impressions, although that is preferable to the impressions in the soil left by the very large wallabies and their tails as they bounce into the garden beds and sup on the choicest organic vegetables!<br><br>The air smells itself smells warm and moist for this time of the year with the background of smells of vegetation and moulds and also with the immanent change in weather conditions there is almost an electric charge to the air. Cold nights are clear nights, but the warmer nights produce a hazy film of moisture putting the milky-way slightly out of focus.<br><br>Later that night as I slept warm and toasty inside this human constructed cave, a thunder storm rolled in and the night sky lit up with flashes of lightning, crashes of thunder and half an inch of rain. And I knew in my heart that these weather conditions were almost a full month earlier this year than expected and wondered what it all meant for the coming summer?<br><br>And that is the sort of thing that goes on day to day in nature and is missed by people that allow themselves to be overtaken by concern for abstractions.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: I've got a new blog entry up discussing the construction of the new chicken enclosure and all weather run: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Sunday Promises</a>. Next to the house, this chicken construction is one of the most complex structures that I have ever built. The complexities arise because of the need to foil the dastardly rats and field mice which currently enjoy the free and easy feed in the original chicken enclosure. Enough, is enough I say! Oh yeah, there was a light frost at the farm this week, peak wine bottles has been averted and I observe one of the locals performing slash and burn agricultural techniques. It is all good stuff and there are lots of cool photos. Enjoy!<br><br><a href=#c2193771687895794104 title="comment permalink">7/24/15, 3:33 AM</a><br><br>

It is a town with a Cathedral. (Although originally founded as Roman Catholic in the Middle Ages, these are Anglican Cathedrals. Modern RC Dioceses were only re-established after 1850). The original towns of course were rather small because they pre-dated urbanisation; the latter arises from industrialisation and/or trading rather than from small manufacture. There have been others elsewhere going back to Antiquity, but London is the exception that proves the more general rule in pre-urban agrarian civilisation. It was a successful trading hub and grew enormous in what was still a relatively small country even at the end of the Middle Ages. (London grew from a minimum of 50,000 in 1300 rising to circa 350,000 by 1642, rising even more rapidly to 650,000 by 1750 when England still had fewer than 6 million people. Incidentally, infant mortality was so high in 17th &amp; 18thC London that the city’s population would have declined, not increased, if it had not been for inward migration. That could have done something for the growth of our modern mentality perhaps.)<br><br>Except on the Scottish Border our old Cathedrals survived into modern times relatively unscathed, even through the Civil War and religious disturbance. (Monasteries and their Churches were something else.) The cities they overlooked were of course not always happy places. I can remember in the still pre-commuter rural south, slums next to and in some cases belonging to the Ecclesiastical Authority, despite the exquisite mediaeval architecture and the solemn and joyful bells sounding out the day. However, I also remember a poem I wrote after being in a mid-morning workaday old Cathedral City and seeing a cat asleep on a doorstep. The doorsteps stuck out on to the pavement in the old streets. I inverted the logic and called the poem “The Cat Preserves the City” rather than the Cathedral. I guess I also had in mind an exquisite chalk stream flowing into the City boundary where small children dammed ponds and fished for tiddlers with jam jars.<br><br>best<br>Phil H<br><br><br><a href=#c867389385487500150 title="comment permalink">7/24/15, 3:51 AM</a><br><br>

Either the majority of the population is urbanized, or, those who aren't are all powerless peasants with no voice in the top-level decisions. I'm thinking now of early modern England and France; pardon the History 101 oversimplification here.<br><br>When a king of France was able to command the nobility to come to and live at court, and made his court the center of all power, that trapped them in the hall of mirrors and helped pave the way for the French Revolution somewhere down the road. The English nobility, gentry, and squirearchy had a strong presence and a serious hand in decision-making well into the 19th - even the 20th - century. They'd go to London for The Season and sit in Parliament while their wives introduced their daughters to society, at best. They had the English Civil War indeed, and it had its share of bloodshed, but it was nothing like the French Revolution<br><br>Incidentally, while the link vanished when my former computer crashed, there is an essay by a bright young man and self-identified geek explaining why high school is such a pit of pettiness and uselessness by comparing it to the French court, and pointing out that both are holding pens for a segment of the population the decision-makers want neutralized. For what that's worth; it makes as much sense as any. <br><br>And the Icelandic Republic, which by your definition (and I agree) was a very successful barbarian state for a while, fell apart when chieftainships could be bought and sold, and individual landowners held multiple chieftainships, according to Norse expert John Lindow (in a classroom lecture at UNM,where he was a visiting scholar). Snorri Sturleson did so himself, while deploring the decay that followed the practice. I don't think Sturleson saw that the centralization this entailed was just as bad; he was thinking in moralistic terms (people have become greedy... wolf age, axe age...)<br><br><a href=#c3249438998650289088 title="comment permalink">7/24/15, 6:32 AM</a><br><br>

In my experience a very humble simpleton emerges! A realisation that desires and pleasures can change over time has been an odd buttress to incorporate into the new building. And here I am enjoying chard stems and relishing pulling buttercup from a mint patch. <br><br>Each time you reference your love of the pulpy books of childhood I am reminded of my own pulpy childhood. But it wasn't science fiction fantasy it was the thirty or so books written by L.M. Montgomery of Anne of Green Gables fame. Her Emily of New Moon books likely still form a great part of my mental models. There is still much of value there to keep moving forward - an orphan girl living in a small community who counts many individual trees as friends and wants to write something from her whole self. The natural world is not a literary trope in her work. There is also always the sense that inside of a small community you have to do the work of getting on with things with the people who show up. <br><br>I don't know if you are familiar with Kenneth Burke's work but his essay "Literature As Equipment for Living" is a kind of pulling buttercup from the mint patch for me. It gestures towards a discussion that happened here a month or so ago about what books or stories can do in descent. And he says quite calmly " what I want is categories that suggest their active nature. Here there is no "realism for its own sake." There is realism for promise, admonition, solace, vengeance, foretelling, instruction, charting, all for the direct bearing that such acts have upon matters of welfare." So my girl in the meadow has two (or more) other daisies and the first one plays a little like yours. The second goes " I love him, I love him not" and the third one goes " I love me, I love me not." <br>Best to all.

I was pointing out that when population did increase, at a certain size, groups typically did split to keep from getting too large. I've read different explanations as to why. Including control, where above a certain size small group control mechanisms breakdown. To continue to function, control structures have to become institutionalized - the church for example. How the brain is hardwired provides several theories. For example, people have a limit to the number of individuals they can recognize as familiar. Past that point, when a new person is added as familiar someone else falls off the list; a very limiting factor to the size of an intimately connected group. Linguistics are different for small groups and even math - how small groups understand quantity and numbers. Carrying capacity of the group's territory is a factor.<br><br>The individuals in a raising population that cannot separate and maintain smaller group numbers must change, quite literally, everything about how they interact, feed themselves, govern themselves, conceive of themselves, count, they no longer intimately recognize all the members of the group living around them and so on. Dense population is anathema to the way humans evolved. While admittedly melodramatic to say "refugee camp", civilization is the patchwork of constructed, sometimes somewhat arbitrary (very little overbearing, lumbering bureaucracy in a small tribe), fixes meant to keep a larger group cohesive when the brain wiring we evolved with in small groups doesn't translate to the dynamics of the larger group.<br><br>"Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations" might offer some explanation of declining population in classical Mediterranean. Spoiler Alert: they despoiled the fertility of the land. <br><br>Always eagerly awaiting your next installment.

The most impressive thing for me , is how well I can now see the differences between city and country life. I can see that (not in all cases of course) the city caters to human wants and desires to an extent that the need for knowledge of how to create things for ones self becomes superfluous. It numbs (out of lack of necessity I suppose) the part of a human that reads and adjust and evolves with its felt experience, giving precedence to the mental constructions.<br>The idea of the city dweller as the pinnacle of human intelligence, and the rural human being a drooling fool I find erroneous to say the least.<br>Most of my neighbors and people of this area, are highly skilled and integrated into the immediate environment to a degree that many "sophisticated" city dwellers may never even come close to knowing.<br><br><a href=#c3398240915454853117 title="comment permalink">7/24/15, 9:19 AM</a><br><br>

She was not a “scientist,” and did not go for any kind of study or academic purpose. Through a series of occurrences, she just wound up in the Amazon. At any rate, she particularly observed the way that the Yequana cared for and raised their children. Based on her observations, she felt that we in the West have deprived ourselves and our children of very evolutionarily important inputs right from birth and on through childhood.

The basics are that no one tells the boss the truth. The more layers of bureaucracy the worse the problem as each person takes the semi-palatable version of the situation that their underlings have given them, polishes it up a bit and passes it up to their boss. So the king basks in the notion that "my people love me" even as the tumbrils are being dragged up to the palace wall.<br><br>Folk wisdom backs this up with tales of wise kings who disguise themselves and go among the people to learn what they really think. Or of foolish kings or princes who get the same lessons by accident when they are temporarily stripped of their identity in a Prince and the Pauper scenario. <br><br>But the suspicion that bosses don't really want "honest feedback" is reflected in an apocryphal tale I originally heard told of Vlad the Impaler. I realized that one could substitute any ruthless, powerful ruler for the same lesson (Mafia Godfather, Lenin, Attila, Caesar).

The other proudly speaks truth to power: they call you a tyrant and a monster, a thief and a murderer, no man feels safe in his home or secure in his property. you are ruining a once proud land.

Questioning what kinds of environmental changes seem most problematic, and what is mostly harmless. A specific question became a critical one in this process. When does a city stop driving people mad? <br><br>I suspect very strongly that ruins are not so prone to driving people into the madness of the civilized, and that only the active living city has that power. If this is the case it would shift the operative distinction from natural versus artificial environments to wild versus tame environments. A tame environment is almost precisely an environment stripped of its power to enforce feedback upon its tamers. <br><br>This fits with my sense of homeless people I know who live in cities, though many live with serious mental issues, this is adequately explained by a mix of selection bias and the societal disconnect of living in a place which is tame for many people but very different for you, and in many cases the homeless (and the disenfranchised more generally) seem to be less seriously afflicted by the particular madness of the person who lives in a controlled environment. Also, I have observed that intelligent species like oyster mushrooms suffer senescence after being expanded too many times in highly controlled conditions, but even in extremely artificial and unorthodox conditions that are not highly controlled the strain seems to maintain health. Both of these observations make me suspect that it is possible to maintain sanity in a human created environment, simply not in an environment that one controls. I would argue an organism cannot thrive in an environment it has too much control over, problems in the mental plane would always grow septic.<br><br>Of course many of today's cities are already in a strange cusp of this condition, they are becoming not wild but feral. Shaped by humanity, but our intentions can not be heard over the accelerating blight. The damage of living in a echo chamber of your own ideas is lessened when the mental patterns in the buildings offer far less to be inspired by than any living this making its way through this shattered landscape. Yet, as the resources are still connected to artificially manipulated flows much of the issue remains, and what's more other species are today early in establishing the customs of what ecosystems may one day cover over the bed rock of civilization, thus the lessons of mature ecosystems are especially fragmented.<br><br><a href=#c3638252695599830544 title="comment permalink">7/24/15, 6:25 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not surprised you notice the echoes. <br><br>Cherokee, one of the things I find most striking about your narrative is the role of the dog. That's something primates are surprisingly good at -- baboons in the wild like to hang out with gazelles and impalas, who hear and smell better than baboons do and will often alert the baboons to a predator long before they spot it themselves. The baboons return the favor by driving away the smaller predators. Humans and dogs seem to have worked out the same sort of mutual-assistance pact a long time ago. <br><br>Phil, did the cathedrals get there first, or did towns get cathedrals because they were large enough to support a bishop and his diocese? <br><br>Denys, I know. It's interesting to me that most other nations don't seem to need the constant patriotic incantations -- possibly because their inhabitants live in actual countries rather than imaginary ones. <br><br>Don, thank you. <br><br>Patricia, when I was in high school I wrote an essay comparing the student government to the puppet governments the Soviet Union installed in the Eastern Bloc nations of Europe. I'm sure you can imagine how well that went over! That said, a Versailles analysis makes at least as much sense, if not more. <br><br>Donalfagan, haven't read the book (or seen the movie), but that sort of mismatch between verbiage and action is all too familiar. <br><br>Eric, glad to hear it!<br><br>Stacey, I'm not familiar with Burke, and clearly will have to change that. <br><br>Daergi, populations can do plenty of things when they get too large for their environment: they can split and expand into new territories, but they can also take other steps ranging from changing marriage customs to adopting human sacrifice; they can also collapse and undergo the necessary dieoff to get back in sync with the carrying capacity of the environment. The latter's the thing, I think, that too often gets left out of these analyses. <br><br>Spanish Fly, yeah, we had exactly the same experience when Obama took office promising to reverse all the policies of his predecessor, and proceeded to do a first-rate imitation of the third and fourth terms of George W. Bush. This time around, we've got a whole clown car full of monkeys eager to wear silk! <br><br>Onething, that's a very good point.

With encouragement and experiences like those you are offering your young neighbor, along with his normal maturation and growing ability to handle abstractions, these skills will likely develop just fine over the next couple of years.

That's an inner process; what you're talking about now sounds like the corresponding outer process. The inner process is a process in the minds of the civilization's inhabitants (and creative minorities), who progressively focus their attention less and less on direct experience and more and more on their own thinking and it's products. Correspondingly, these products get turned into external objects, leading to increasingly urban environments. <br><br>What you called a lack of negative feedback can then be seen as the neglect of figuration in the later stages of civilization. The figurations are there, they are settled, and the mind starts from them in the process of abstraction and reflection. That the figurations only ever represented a part of the world, and that the world itself may change (as in ecological change) isn't picked up since the process of figuration has been abandoned.<br><br>Of course, I'd say it's a mistake to say that either of these process is the main one. They reinforce and delimit each other. The urban environment provides the figurations and abstractions that the process continues to work in. In Spenglerian terms, perhaps we might say that the central image of the culture provides an axis around which the inner and outer processes intertwine, like the twin strands of DNA.<br><br>Well, that's my -- rather abstract! -- take on this.<br><br><a href=#c8034010020603044906 title="comment permalink">7/25/15, 2:47 AM</a><br><br>

Such service!<br><br>This week I have been reading EF Schumacher's 'Small is Beautiful' for the first time. It is an extraordinarily prescient book to have been written in the 1960s, and I imagine it informed your own thinking? I can see many of the seeds of the discussions I read here in Schumacher's thought. <br><br>What interested me particularly in the light of this week's essay were his thoughts about convergent and divergent thinking, and how they pertain to the civilisation/barbarian dichotomy. Convergent thinking being of the sort that narrows down a problem to a logarithm with only one answer, and divergent thinking fanning out the possibilities and creating a complex and intricate model of various potential outcomes, including the possibility of holding opposites in elegant tension.<br><br>As I have mentioned before over the last few weeks, I am fascinated by the process in which 'improved' technology actually makes life both more complicated and less rich and nuanced. Living in nature requires constant re-evaluation and flexibility - divergent thinking, while urbanisation allows us to 'control' nature, reorganise it into straight lines, and simplify it, so that our brains don't have to constantly work so hard - convergent thinking.<br><br>Schumacher says, "All divergent problems can be turned into convergent problems by a process of 'reduction'. The result, however, is the loss of all higher forces to ennoble human life, and the degradation, not only of the emotional part of our nature, but also... of our intellect and moral character. The signs are everywhere visible today."<br><br><a href=#c3800787465752888222 title="comment permalink">7/25/15, 5:43 AM</a><br><br>

I would like to add a bit to the discussion.<br><br>The first is to expand on the nature of our hard-wired cognitive abilities. We take so much of this amazing gift for granted but really we need to admit that it is actually like the part of the iceberg below the surface – it is really the majority of what we are. The unconscious is remarkable and here we are so proud when we get a little bit of conscious sphincter control.<br><br>One fascinating aspect of the unconscious is the amount of communication that it is responsible for. The body language, in particular, with universality of gestures is very interesting. In fact, the full range of communication extends to energetic as well. One has to wonder at how much is going on given that languaging is probably 6-8 bits when our full processing capability is orders of magnitude greater.<br><br>What happens in civilization? Well, we’ve decided that all sorts of aspects of body language are either socially awkward and need to be suppressed. One just needs to sit at a business meeting and observe to see this in practice. Or better watch a hipster get ready to go out; I’ve never seen anyone pay so much attention to communicating “I couldn’t care less about what I am wearing” through choice of pants, shirts and shoes…<br><br>So civilization is taking millions of years of evolved processing and then adds layers of OCD-like bad code over top. Is it any wonder that civilization starts to seriously wander after a few generations of this practice?<br><br><br><a href=#c7737604345272218205 title="comment permalink">7/25/15, 6:21 AM</a><br><br>

It is dear to me, the benefits to mind, body, heart and soul of really engaging with nature. Richard Louv's Last Child in the Woods and The Nature Principle brought this topic to the mainstream years ago now. It has helped those of us who have always been involved in nature to understand why so many others act the way they do, and to know that it is now a multi-generational part of our culture, unfortunately. The question is where can we find our way back into nature, when so many of us are actually afraid of it. <br><br>I've worked for many years in the public park sector, planning and "designing" parks for public use and education. My colleague and I have tried to change how access to parks and the nature to be found there can be offered and allowed. You can find hints of what is needed in Louv's books, but there are other useful sources such as Lepage's Parks for Life, Jon Young's Coyote's Guide to Connecting with Nature, Paul Shepherd, Norberg Schultz and Alexander's A Pattern Language, among others. Hints can also come from tribal and other rural life ways, and our own yearnings when out and about. <br><br>It is abundantly apparent that we need much more than a walk in a manicured park where we must stay on the trails and touch nothing, or where we just drive through and "camp" in our RVs. We had worked to bring into our parks, or some of them, a number of new approaches, such as leaving your car at the gate, lots of trails in loops and to destinations and features, primitive tent camping at near, middle and far distances, places to hunt and fish, places where kids can build forts and nests , bringing in storytellers and artists instead of Interpreters and much more. This is a huge topic, a huge need and a huge challenge in the face of the status quo management of most park agencies of any scale. Perhaps, as budgets continue to shrink these things will creep in under the fence, but it would be so much better to consciously make it happen and to join with park users and the communities in doing that. Thanks so much for your amazing insights.<br><br><a href=#c1664307907582018720 title="comment permalink">7/25/15, 7:41 AM</a><br><br>

I will point out that JMG's theory accords nicely with Robert Howard's own view - the state of "barbarism" cannot be fullt re-learned as an adult. It is something one must be born into (preferably over many generations). From "Beyond the Blackwater":<br><br>Balthus had had a good look at his companions in the fort before they slipped out of the stockade and down the bank into the waiting canoe. They were of a new breed growing up in the world on the raw edge of the frontier—men whom grim necessity had taught woodcraft. Aquilonians of the western provinces to a man, they had many points in common. They dressed alike—in buckskin boots, leathern breeks and deerskin shirts, with broad girdles that held axes and short swords; and they were all gaunt and scarred and hard-eyed; sinewy and taciturn.<br><br>They were wild men, of a sort, yet there was still a wide gulf between them and the Cimmerian. They were sons of civilization, reverted to a semi- barbarism. He was a barbarian of a thousand generations of barbarians. They had acquired stealth and craft, but he had been born to these things. He excelled them even in lithe economy of motion. They were wolves, but he was a tiger.<br><br>AV<br><br><a href=#c136188484010166620 title="comment permalink">7/25/15, 9:52 AM</a><br><br>

I wasn't going to comment, but I had an idea that might be of interest to some, and I think complements the Archdruid's ideas here. JMG's idea that separation from nature----with its endless play of structure and non-structure, randomness and order, living and non-living----keeps us cognitively and emotionally grounded has indeed strikes me as quite powerful. In fact this has been studied at least a bit: there are longitudinal studies on children who've been raised with free play in nature (who have some woods to run though, etc), and as adults they show different palette of personality traits, such as higher openness, empathy, and IQ.<br><br>Anyway, my thought is this. There is an argument to be made that the world of stuff is only about half the world we inhabit; the other half is our relations with the human being around us. I'm not saying this is 100% correct, only that it has a strong argument behind it. After all your survival and reproduction (particularly for males!) depends on your group every bit as much as it does on non-human factors, and on your various positions and functionings within your group's dominance hierarchies (in humans, groups have multiple, overlapping dominance hierarchies).<br><br>In modern society we've not only removed ourselves from nature, but also, even in crowded cities, from natural interactions with the humans around us. My suggestion, in complement to JMG's ideas this week, is that the thinness and artificiality of our human relations is similar to the thinness and artificiality of our material surroundings. And that this is also a common feature of civilizations, and has been a problem of like proportions.<br><br><br><a href=#c1550284942893867858 title="comment permalink">7/25/15, 11:23 AM</a><br><br>

I would say we build cities largely *because* city-scapes are artificial, therefore predictable, therefore easier to survive in. But we must survive our fellow humans, too, and we want our relations with them also to be predictable (for instance we'd like for dealing with shop-owners and government functionaries to be predictable). So civilizations -must- develop fundamentally arbitrary rules of conduct and modes of relation. Without these, we just wouldn't be able to function with lots of people around that we don't personally know.<br><br>Evidence? Just think of your own reaction when you see someone acting unpredictably, say on the subway, or in front of you on the sidewalk, or driving. You think (understandably!) that there could be trouble, and you try to avoid the situation. Or think of how you react if the store doesn't open at the usual hour. Or think of when a "customer service" person doesn't follow the usual script but instead seems rude....or on the other hand is *too* personal and asks how church went this week or something. You get frustrated or just plain weirded out.<br><br>So without *some* system of restrictive, artificial norms, civilization couldn't exist (to some extent they're necessary in non-civilized cultures, too, I know). But civilizations appear typically to exaggerate this necessity, maybe because without an external check (as appears almost totally absent now) such systems become self-sustaining and self-evolving, and separated from their foundational raison d'etre.<br><br>And such norms are indeed arbitrary and confining. Just now, as our culture seems increasingly fractured and stale, they seem ever-more deeply confining, don't they? And we bristle with rebellion.<br><br>I'd also suggest that in today's advanced societies, the situation is even more exaggerated than usual, what with cubicles, social media, and our various *extremely* abstract ways of dealing with each other.<br><br>For instance posting to an Archdruid's stream on Blogger. Try explaining THAT to a Mongol.<br><br><br><a href=#c4002353437616195499 title="comment permalink">7/25/15, 11:54 AM</a><br><br>

The following is a disjointed series of observations: When my mother died six months ago I had the strange experience of running into friends in the next few weeks when I was out running errands who were not aware of my mother's passing. To a person they felt embarrassed that they had not known. They did not know it, but I was embarrassed for myself because I was aware of so many in the community who had died in the past year that I had only acknowledged on the funeral home condolence pages. (I live in a rural community with two small towns of combined population less than 400 and at least 18 people have died within the past ten months!) <br>This is the South and just a couple decades ago it was all so different. When my dad died in 1987, the house immediately filled up with people and food, food, food! When mom died I depended on my best friend in the community to quash the food. She did not understand completely, but she did it because it was what I wanted. The food to the homes of the dead is one Celtic tradition that I am glad to see come to an end.<br>I have more to say and will tie this all together, but now the shingles demand a break.<br><br><a href=#c3487968361179071882 title="comment permalink">7/25/15, 2:16 PM</a><br><br>

I wondered if you were familiar with the Dark Mountain Project and their concept of "Uncivilisation" over in England.

They are wondering if perhaps they do not understand it as well as they imagined. They are wondering whether they are controlling it at all or whether, perhaps, it is controlling them.<br>- From Uncivilisation: the Dark Mountain Manifesto<br><br>The Dark Mountain Project is a network of writers, artists and thinkers who have stopped believing the stories our civilisation tells itself. We see that the world is entering an age of ecological collapse, material contraction and social and political unravelling, and we want our cultural responses to reflect this reality rather than denying it.<br><br>"The Project grew out of a feeling that contemporary literature and art were failing to respond honestly or adequately to the scale of our entwined ecological, economic and social crises. We believe that writing and art have a crucial role to play in coming to terms with this reality, and in questioning the foundations of the world in which we find ourselves.<br><br>What is 'Uncivilisation'?<br><br>As well as being the name of our manifesto and the festivals we organised between 2010-13, Uncivilisation – a word we think we coined – is a concept indelibly associated with Dark Mountain, and it has been interpreted in different ways. Some people, for example, have interpreted it as a political term – a call to destroy civilisation. This is not quite what we had in mind when we began to use the word, though we can see why it might sound that way.<br><br>For us, Uncivilisation is a process: the stripping away of forms of thinking and ways of seeing which might be termed ‘civilised’ – those associated, for example, with the illusion of control, the restriction of reality to that which can be measured and managed, disconnection from nature, the enthronement of a particular kind of rationality over other ways of knowing and feeling, and the like. The art, writing and culture we see around us is, we believe, over-civilised. As an alternative, we propose a form of cultural engagement which is rooted in place and time, takes an ecocentric view of the world and is not taken in by ephemeral promises of growth, progress and human glory.<br><br>http://dark-mountain.net/about/the-dark-mountain-project/<br><br>--<br><br><a href=#c5095356721633688230 title="comment permalink">7/25/15, 2:31 PM</a><br><br>

The area wasn't "natural" in the strict sense, but was nowhere near being a city. Berry writes of the "Port William membership", including people, of course, but also the entire web of life, as well as the landscape. (To Berry, "community" necessarily includes all these things, and the way they shape each other.)<br><br>Here's some description of the community of Sycamore, described in a story of a young minister and his wife coming there. For me, it illuminates something of the structure and dynamics of such communities.<br><br>"There was little enough of money at large in Sycamore at that time, but it was rich in produce of its fields and woods and the river."<br><br>"Small as it was, the town seemed to them to be inundated with self-knowledge. This knowledge moved over it in an unrelenting current, some of it in stories told openly that eddied with variations from teller to teller and place to place, some of it more darkly and quietly in an undertow of caution, sometimes fraught with the unacknowledged pleasure of malice, sometimes bearing a burden merely of anxiety or concern. It was to this subsurface current of gossip that Williams Milby [the minister] learned to listen with greatest care, for it told him where needs were."<br><br>"Sycamore had suffered the depressed agricultural economy of the 1920s. It had been hit hard by the Depression of the 1930s, by the severe drouths of 1930 and 1936, and the great flood of January 1937. But it was a community of farm people and of people related to farmers and dependent on farming. They had never expected to live independently of the weather or to be free of hardship and struggle. They suffered as they had to suffer and did as they had to do. They also knew of one another's struggles, and as they could they helped."<br><br>"Also, by their own modest standards and by their skills and thrift, they throve. Because none of them had ever been overly prosperous, their losses were never great. It says much for the hardiness of the place that its population increased during the Depression, as young Sycamoreans who had gone to the cities to prosper returned home to survive."<br><br>And writing of a main character in many of the stories, Burley Coulter:<br><br>"Always when he was outdoors, where he had been in most of his waking hours all his life, and especially when he was in the woods, he was aware that he was more seen than seeing. In the woods he kept company with the original life of the place, a life intricately knowing of itself, even of him, but never to be fully known by him. ... He was a man of two worlds: the world that produced crops and animals by his work, and the world that by his knowledge merely, and his pleasure, gave him pelts, wild meat, fish, wild fruits and nuts, and good places to be."<br><br>I get the impression that, if industrial civilization hadn't impinged on these communities, they could have continued largely unchanged over centuries (impacted mostly by ecological changes). Some of the stories, though, describe the effects of what Berry calls The Economy and The War, two huge intertwined, impersonal forces that inexorably changed the nature of the membership, and mostly not for the better.<br><br><a href=#c5293606364294227979 title="comment permalink">7/25/15, 10:43 PM</a><br><br>

His dad grew up on a farm and his major recreation was hunting and fishing which he passed on to his sons. My cousin would bring in almost any game you can imagine that ended up on their family table. One of my most vivid early memories was of visiting their house on a cold Thanksgiving before my cousin and I started school. His job that morning was to catch the old red rooster on the yard so that my aunt could serve him up in an awesome pot of chicken and dumplings. I accompanied my cousin on the chase of this rooster who was having none of it. The rooster went under the house which was built high off the ground as so many of the older houses were. We followed him and I was awestruck by my cousin's bravery at tackling the creature who was chest high to the both of us. In the melee my cousin got a puncture wound on his head from an exposed flooring nail and there was much blood. My aunt bandaged his wound and laughed at "our" accomplishment. My only contribution had been moral support! I still remember that pot of dumplings after almost sixty years!<br>The point of all this is that both our families lived off the land, the only difference being that there was no tradition of hunting in my family. We had huge gardens, pigs and chickens, milk cows, and not much from the store.<br>Fast forward to now. Within the past couple of weeks I had a conversation with my aunt who is now 82 years old and as good a cook as she ever was. She told me that all of her grown children<br>will not now eat her homemade banana pudding! They want instant pudding, with no bananas added to it! My cousin is now retired from a vigorous outdoor occupation as an electric utility lineman and lives in splendid air conditioned isolation, with all of his food coming from the store. I, OTOH, am trying to move in the other direction completely. Big bed of turnips and collards this fall! New chickens in the Spring if all goes well!<br><br><a href=#c3004371035051604101 title="comment permalink">7/26/15, 6:57 AM</a><br><br>

Feedback can be applied promptly, or after some delay. By "promptly", I mean "before the phenomenon has had much time to change". <br><br>Delayed negative feedback can lead to oscillation. Imagine the drunk driver who drifts to the right, turns to the left, drifts all the way across the lane before realizing that he needs to turn back to the right, drifts back across the lane before realizing that he needs to turn back to the left, and so on. You can see the same thing in economics: a surge in demand for housing cannot be accommodated immediately, so by the time new apartments are build for the surge, there may be too many apartments built. Then developers lose money, lenders become cautious, no new projects are started, and new construction isn't even planned until there's another surge in demand. Expensive oil, after a few years, results in more producing wells, which forces the price down; cheap oil, after a few years, results in fewer producing wells, etc.<br><br>Positive feedback creates <b>exponential growth</b> in whatever the modeled variable is. Whenever the rate of change in "x" is proportional to the quantity of "x", "x" will grow at an increasing rate. A little yeast in a big vat becomes a lot of yeast. One popular restaurant becomes a world-wide franchise. People in a world of plenty produce more children. In a time when cheap energy facilitated low costs for oil drilling and transport, energy production could grow exponentially. Exponential growth is very popular just now. A pension fund promising 8% growth of assets under management is taking exponential growth as granted. (The "exponent" does not need to be large to qualify. "1.08 per year" is still exponential.)<br><br>But eventually, a system driven by positive feedback evolves to the point where the original model is simply no longer valid. All of the sugar in the vat is consumed by the yeast. The limits to growth appear.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c605174688297614163 title="comment permalink">7/26/15, 10:16 AM</a><br><br>

I would read stories to them from the time they were new born, we played lots of games (cribbage, poker, checkers, chess, monopoly) games with string, sticks and tape measures in the back yard like make a circle, determine the area of a triangle. Consequently they were developmentally disabled by the time their mandatory state education started as they could already read, do higher level geometry and math but had to spend years of early life regressing to the level of peers.

It's car commercial that extolls the benefits of, believe it or not, shortsightedness.

As an article in Bay Nature pointed out about a year ago, the population density of deer is much higher in Marin County suburbia than in the wilder woods of the federal, state and county parks. The reason is a concentrated food supply. The deer don't have a lot of young green foliage to browse in the less populated areas on account of fire suppression. The town deer graze people's lawns, vegetable gardens and rose bushes. Maybe not so much deer food when people have to cut back on the watering.<br><br>I used to live on the very border of the wild part of Twin Peaks, which is located in the geographical center of San Francisco, surrounded by street lights, houses and apartment buildings. Raccoon, skunk and possum sightings were common at dawn and dusk, and my cat brought home juvenile rabbits twice. Other than the skunks, those are game animals. Coyote and deer are known to cross the Golden Gate Bridge from time to time (probably in the pedestrian/bicycle path late at night). <br><br>On the other side of the bay, Lake Merritt in Oakland is a major migratory bird sanctuary. Some years ago, the Canada geese quit migrating back to Canada, settled down by the lake and have become a major nuisance. Plenty of bugs in the grass or whatever the heck they eat, mild weather and no major predators. People aren't allowed to hunt them in town; for some reason the authorities think poisoning them, paying employees to addle their eggs or give them contraceptives (I'm not making this up) are better ways of controlling the goose population.<br><br>The remnant tule elk herd on Point Reyes is crowded into a tule elk concentration camp, fenced in from their dwindling water supplies, because they compete with the neighboring herds of dairy cows. For sure there are too many of us humans around here to all get our animal protein from wild birds and mammals; crickets and grubs are more plentiful. But since the local grizzlies and wolves have been extirpated, and the cougars get chased off when they come into town, human beings have become the apex predator. Some predation is fine with me as long as we don't waste the meat.<br><br><a href=#c3304073912459727232 title="comment permalink">7/27/15, 2:47 AM</a><br><br>

I too experienced this, and when my 2 children were small moved from Sydney, Australia back to Tasmania, where I grew up. I wondered if Caryn also grew up in a non-urban place? Because for me, it was the feeling that I should not give my children a lesser life than I had enjoyed. It would be interesting if Caryn and the other parents she describes as also hearing the "clarion call" to leave the city had not actually had that non-urban experience as children themselves - because if so, that gives us hope that these connections with nature do not just disappear through lack of use after one generation.

And the thing is a weighty tome at about 1.5kg (3 pounds) - you could kill someone with it. Do you think Conan would be pleased by that use of the book? ;-)!<br><br>My original copy was not nearly so extensive and all encompassing, so it is a true pleasure to read - and also very hard to put down.<br><br>I enjoyed reading about Grom the canny Pictish king. Incidentally, I hoped that you noticed the heavy use of mercenaries by the Aquilonian’s as a serious weakness. Just sayin, that Howard had a good grasp of military strategy from a generals (and a historians) perspective. I'm inclined to add some battle darkness to my Spacebats story as it is a bit too much sweetness and light, and a bit of darkness may round off the main character a little.<br><br>Incidentally, I was pondering our earlier discussion about rituals as they are performed in the present society as a reinforcing agent, and it occurs to me that people who can't partake of that ritual are excluded and blamed for their lack. Does that not strike you as being an insecure culture? Also I feel the scrabbling around of ideas in my mind relating to the lack of social cohesion and that is somehow related to the dominance of that culture, but I'm having trouble putting the ideas into words. It is almost as if, the breakdown in social cohesion is an outcome of the dominance of the mainstream culture for we are all more easily managed that way. Dunno, but I am thinking about it, but it is really hard to get an exact fix on that issue in my mind and it feels as if the insight is hiding just around the corner.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c458935734591837517 title="comment permalink">7/28/15, 4:24 AM</a><br><br>

Current assessments place emphasis on practical effects such as increasing extremes of heat waves, droughts, heavy rainfall, floods, and encroaching seas (IPCC, 2014; USNCA, 2014). These assessments and our recent study (Hansen et al., 2013a) conclude that there is an urgency to slow carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, because the longevity of the carbon in the climate system (Archer, 2005) and persistence of the induced warming (Solomon et al., 2010) may lock in unavoidable highly undesirable consequences. Despite these warnings, global CO2 emissions continue to increase as fossil fuels remain the primary energy source. The argument is made that it is economically and morally responsible to continue fossil fuel use for the sake of raising living standards, with expectation that humanity can adapt to climate change and find ways to minimize effects via advanced technologies."<br><br>"We suggest that this viewpoint fails to appreciate the nature of the threat posed by ice sheet instability and sea level rise. If the ocean continues to accumulate heat and increase melting of marine-terminating ice shelves of Antarctica and Greenland, a point will be reached at which it is impossible to avoid large scale ice sheet disintegration with sea level rise of at least several meters. The economic and social cost of losing functionality of all coastal cities is practically incalculable.

The Windows 10 ad, with its cute babies, alludes to this I think, and the same time makes it seem as if Windows 10 will take the place of the Nature we must leave behind to "grow up."<br><br><a href=#c2163756837043158031 title="comment permalink">7/28/15, 4:55 PM</a><br><br>

Whether you're new to independent living, a recent college graduate, or just downshifting to a simpler lifestyle, Poorcraft can help you with everything from finding a home to finding a hobby, dinner to debt relief, education to entertainment. So get ready! It's time to cut your expenses! (Or just make sure they never pile up.)<br><br>@ mgalimba :<br>I personnally find that spending an evening with paper books is more pacifying than staring at electronic screens. But, aside from individual instances, you are probably onto something, as the permanent stimulation is not only a distraction, but leads to a shorter attention span and therefore a more fragmented mode of reasonning. This must be an unintended consequence of technology, but it might have been playing so far to ease the tensions that are also building up in the modern world as an unintended consequence of technology (like, the aversion to constraints of any sort... though suburbanites who have to commute daily in traffic jams have to go through their own shares of constraints too).<br><br><a href=#c54948980654241628 title="comment permalink">7/29/15, 2:23 AM</a><br><br>

I was raised by my grandparents (who themselves, grew up in the Great Depression). I know a lot of my natural inclination towards Green Wizardry and salvage stems from that early teaching. We moved around a lot, mostly in small towns, rural or semi-rural suburbs. Spent most of my childhood in a SoCal cookie-cutter suburb with only our big front and back yards for connection with nature - but Most of my memories come from a little cottage we rented when I was 8, for only 1 year. It was 50 feet from a small lake and my sister and I spent every waking moment, not in school; outside, covered in dirt and mosquito bites, building a raft, pulling and weaving tules, exploring every inch of embankment, running through wild fields pretending to be witches with super-powers. I honestly don't remember nearly as much of the suburban track house we spent over 10 years in after that.<br><br>If you remember those early Steven Spielberg movies: ET &amp; Poltergeist: THAT was like most places we lived in - a cookie-cutter suburb growing and expanding on the edge of the desert scrubland or wilderness. Very boring, but right behind the back fence was utter wilderness. Coyotes howling, canyons that seemed to stretch on forever. My husband grew up in one house on the Jersey Shore. In those days, ('60's &amp; 70's), he also had a mix of 'civilized' suburbia and little stretches of wilderness - the Pine Barrens, beaches, thousands of small inlets to sail and raft on, where no one could know where he was for the whole day.<br><br>As a teen and young adult, I haaaaated yard work, (weeding mostly) and couldn't wait to live in an apt. (no weeding!!!) LOVED city living in young adulthood, in spite of the claustrophobia it sometimes generates. Then as I said: when my first was born - My husband and I both just 'knew'. Maybe that's a natural progression? I don't know. We've definitely found, (although a different type of ecosystem), a similar mix: the edge of civilization and the wilds, for our kids. They have a lagoon, coves and beaches, the country parks, etc…. within walking or swimming/paddling distance on Tai Tam Bay. Surprising, but only about 25% of Hong Kong land is developed. Most is protected country parkland or still wild. My 16 year old and his friends just found another 'secret' waterfall and swimming hole in the parks. <br><br>And then there's our US home base in Wyoming - which I could blather on about for days, but I'll spare you!, Haha.<br><br>So, you're probably spot on. We feel a need to pass on things we knew and thrived on as kids ourselves .<br><br><a href=#c9148021067810301386 title="comment permalink">7/29/15, 8:50 AM</a><br><br>

Such information is absolutely riveting to me as a cattle producer myself. The drought in the US West has such apocalyptic potential and we in the US don't even take that as seriously as we ought to, much less think about climate conditions in Europe. <br><br>As for the ways in which social media/smartphone technology is so popular as means of mitigating the pain of living in a machine civilization, I agree that it was probably not foreseen or planned by the developers of these mechanisms and gadgets. And the psychic and even physical toll that the technology will inflict upon us is not something that we thinking through either. Anything to ease the pain, short-term, of those terrible, planet-warming commutes.<br><br><a href=#c7401680306035440137 title="comment permalink">7/29/15, 12:57 PM</a><br><br>
