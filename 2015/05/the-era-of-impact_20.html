Of all the wistful superstitions that cluster around the concept of the future in contemporary popular culture, the most enduring has to be the notion that somehow, sooner or later, something will happen to shake the majority out of its complacency and get it to take seriously the crisis of our age. Week after week, I field comments and emails that presuppose that belief. People want to know how soon I think the shock of awakening will finally hit, or wonder whether this or that event will do the trick, or simply insist that the moment has to come sooner or later. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To all such inquiries and expostulations I have no scrap of comfort to offer. Quite the contrary, what history shows is that a sudden awakening to the realities of a difficult situation is far and away the least likely result of what I’ve called the era of impact, the second of the five stages of collapse. (The first, for those who missed last week’s post, is the era of pretense; the remaining three, which will be covered in the coming weeks, are the eras of response, breakdown, and dissolution.)</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The era of impact is the point at which it becomes clear to most people that something has gone wrong with the most basic narratives of a society—not just a little bit wrong, in the sort of way that requires a little tinkering here and there, but really, massively, spectacularly wrong. It arrives when an asset class that was supposed to keep rising in price forever stops rising, does its Wile E. Coyote moment of hang time, and then drops like a stone. It shows up when an apparently entrenched political system, bristling with soldiers and secret police, implodes in a matter of days or weeks and is replaced by a provisional government whose leaders look just as stunned as everyone else. It comes whenever a state of affairs that was assumed to be permanent runs into serious trouble—but somehow it never seems to succeed in getting people to notice just how temporary that state of affairs always was.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Since history is the best guide we’ve got to how such events work out in the real world, I want to take a couple of examples of the kind just outlined and explore them in a little more detail. The stock market bubble of the 1920s makes a good case study on a relatively small scale. In the years leading up to the crash of 1929, stock values in the US stock market quietly disconnected themselves from the economic fundamentals and began what was, for the time, an epic climb into la-la land. There were important if unmentionable reasons for that airy detachment from reality; the most significant was the increasingly distorted distribution of income in 1920s America, which put more and more of the national wealth in the hands of fewer and fewer people and thus gutted the national economy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s one of the repeated lessons of economic history that money in the hands of the rich does much less good for the economy as a whole than money in the hands of the working classes and the poor. The reasoning here is as simple as it is inescapable. Industrial economies survive and thrive on consumer expenditures, but consumer expenditures are limited by the ability of consumers to buy the things they want and need. As money is diverted away from the lower end of the economic pyramid, you get demand destruction—the process by which those who can’t afford to buy things stop buying them—and consumer expenditures fall off. The rich, by contrast, divert a large share of their income out of the consumer economy into investments; the richer they get, the more of the national wealth ends up in investments rather than consumer expenditures; and as consumer expenditures falter, and investments linked to the consumer economy falter in turn, more and more money ends up in illiquid speculative vehicles that are disconnected from the productive economy and do nothing to stimulate demand. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s what happened in the 1920s. All through the decade in the US, the rich got richer and the poor got screwed, speculation took the place of productive investment throughout the US economy, and the well-to-do wallowed in the wretched excess chronicled in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s <i>The Great Gatsby</i> while most other people struggled to get by. The whole decade was a classic era of pretense, crowned by the delusional insistence—splashed all over the media of the time—that everyone in the US could invest in the stock market and, since the market was of course going to keep on rising forever, everyone in the US would thus inevitably become rich. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s interesting to note that there were people who saw straight through the nonsense and tried to warn their fellow Americans about the inevitable consequences. They were denounced six ways from Sunday by all right-thinking people, in language identical to that used more recently on those of us who’ve had the effrontery to point out that an infinite supply of oil can’t be extracted from a finite planet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The people who insisted that the soaring stock values of the late 1920s were the product of one of history’s great speculative bubbles were dead right; they had all the facts and figures on their side, not to mention plain common sense; but nobody wanted to hear it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When the stock market peaked just before the Labor Day weekend in 1929 and started trending down, therefore, the immediate response of all right-thinking people was to insist at the top of their lungs that nothing of the sort was happening, that the market was simply catching its breath before its next great upward leap, and so on. Each new downward lurch was met by a new round of claims along these lines, louder, more dogmatic, and more strident than the one that preceded it, and nasty personal attacks on anyone who didn’t support the delusional consensus filled the media of the time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
People were still saying those things when the bottom dropped out of the market. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Tuesday, October 29, 1929 can reasonably be taken as the point at which the era of pretense gave way once and for all to the era of impact. That’s not because it was the first day of the crash—there had been ghastly slumps on the previous Thursday and Monday, on the heels of two months of less drastic but still seriously ugly declines—but because, after that day, the pundits and the media pretty much stopped pretending that nothing was wrong. Mind you, next to nobody was willing to talk about what exactly had gone wrong, or why it had gone wrong, but the pretense that the good fairy of capitalism had promised Americans happy days forever was out the window once and for all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s crucial to note, though, that what followed this realization was the immediate and all but universal insistence that happy days would soon be back if only everyone did the right thing. It’s even more crucial to note that what nearly everyone identified as “the right thing”—running right out and buying lots of stocks—was a really bad idea that bankrupted many of those who did it, and didn’t help the imploding US economy at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably necessary to talk about this in a little more detail, since it’s been an article of blind faith in the United States for many decades now that it’s always a good idea to buy and hold stocks. (I suspect that stockbrokers have had a good deal to do with the promulgation of this notion.) It’s been claimed that someone who bought stocks in 1929 at the peak of the bubble, and then held onto them, would have ended up in the black eventually, and for certain values of “eventually,” this is quite true—but it took the Dow Jones industrial average until the mid-1950s to return to its 1929 high, and so for a quarter of a century our investor would have been underwater on his stock purchases. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s more, the Dow isn’t necessarily a good measure of stocks generally; many of the darlings of the market in the 1920s either went bankrupt in the Depression or never again returned to their 1929 valuations. Nor did the surge of money into stocks in the wake of the 1929 crash stave off the Great Depression, or do much of anything else other than provide a great example of the folly of throwing good money after bad. The moral to this story? In an era of impact, the advice you hear from everyone around you may not be in your best interest. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That same moral can be shown just as clearly in the second example I have in mind, the French Revolution. We talked briefly in last week’s post about the way that the French monarchy and aristocracy blinded themselves to the convulsive social and economic changes that were pushing France closer and closer to a collective explosion on the grand scale, and pursued business as usual long past the point at which business as usual was anything but a recipe for disaster. Even when the struggle between the Crown and the aristocracy forced Louis XVI to convene the <span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>États-Généraux</span>—the rarely-held national parliament of France, which had powers more or less equivalent to a constitutional convention in the US—next to nobody expected anything but long rounds of political horse-trading from which some modest shifts in the balance of power might result. </div>
<br>
That was before the summer of 1789. On June 17, the deputies of the Third Estate—the representatives of the commoners—declared themselves a National Assembly and staged what amounted to a coup d’etat; on July 14, faced with the threat of a military response from the monarchy, the Parisian mob seized the Bastille, kickstarting a wave of revolt across the country that put government and military facilities in the hands of the revolutionary National Guard and broke the back of the feudal system; on August 4, the National Assembly abolished all feudal rights and legal distinctions between the classes. Over less than two months, a political and social system that had been welded firmly in place for a thousand years all came crashing to the ground. <br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those two months marked the end of the era of pretense and the arrival of the era of impact. The immediate response, with a modest number of exceptions among the aristocracy and the inner circles of the monarchy’s supporters, was frantic cheering and an insistence that everything would soon settle into a wonderful new age of peace, prosperity, and liberty. All the overblown dreams of the philosophes about a future age governed by reason were trotted out and treated as self-evident fact. Of course that’s not what happened; once it was firmly in power, the National Assembly used its unchecked authority as abusively as the monarchy had once done; factional struggles spun out of control, and before long mob rule and the guillotine were among the basic facts of life in Revolutionary France.<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Among the most common symptoms of an era of impact, in other words, is the rise of what we may as well call “crackpot optimism”—the enthusiastic and all but universal insistence, in the teeth of the evidence, that the end of business as usual will turn out to be the door to a wonderful new future. In the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, people were urged to pile back into the market in the belief that this would cause the economy to boom again even more spectacularly than before, and most of the people who followed this advice proceeded to lose their shirts. In the wake of the revolution of 1789, likewise, people across France were encouraged to join with their fellow citizens in building the shining new utopia of reason, and a great many of those who followed that advice ended up decapitated or, a little later, dying of gunshot or disease in the brutal era of pan-European warfare that extended almost without a break from the cannonade of Valmy in 1792 to the battle of Waterloo in 1815.<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And the present example? That’s a question worth exploring, if only for the utterly pragmatic reason that most of my readers are going to get to see it up close and personal.<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That the United States and the industrial world generally are deep in an era of pretense is, I think, pretty much beyond question at this point. We’ve got political authorities, global bankers, and a galaxy of pundits insisting at the top of their lungs that nothing is wrong, everything is fine, and we’ll be on our way to the next great era of prosperity if we just keep pursuing a set of boneheaded policies that have never—not once in the entire span of human history—brought prosperity to the countries that pursued them. We’ve got shelves full of books for sale in upscale bookstores insisting, in the strident language usual to such times, that life is wonderful in this best of all possible worlds, and it’s going to get better forever because, like, we have technology, dude! Across the landscape of the cultural mainstream, you’ll find no shortage of cheerleaders insisting at the top of their lungs that everything’s going to be fine, that even though they said ten years ago that we only have ten years to do something before disaster hits, why, we still have ten years before disaster hits, and when ten more years pass by, why, you can be sure that the same people will be insisting that we have ten more.<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the classic rhetoric of an era of pretense. Over the last few years, though, it’s seemed to me that the voices of crackpot optimism have gotten more shrill, the diatribes more fact-free, and the logic even shoddier than it was in Bjorn Lomborg’s day, which is saying something. We’ve reached the point that state governments are making it a crime to report on water quality and forbidding officials from using such unwelcome phrases as “climate change.” That’s not the action of people who are confident in their beliefs; it’s the action of a bunch of overgrown children frantically clenching their eyes shut, stuffing their fingers in their ears, and shouting “La, la, la, I can’t hear you.”<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That, in turn, suggests that the transition to the era of impact may be fairly close. Exactly when it’s likely to arrive is a complex question, and exactly what’s going to land the blow that will crack the crackpot optimism and make it impossible to ignore the arrival of real trouble is an even more complex one. In 1929, those who hadn’t bought into the bubble could be perfectly sure—and in fact, a good many of them were perfectly sure—that the usual mechanism that brings bubbles to a catastrophic end was about to terminate the boom of the 1920s with extreme prejudice, as indeed it did. In the last decades of the French monarchy, it was by no means clear exactly what sequence of events would bring the Ancien Régime crashing down, but such thoughtful observers as Talleyrand knew that something of the sort was likely to follow the crisis of legitimacy then under way.<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'> </span></div>
<br>
The problem with trying to predict the trigger that will bring our current situation to a sudden stop is that we’re in such a target-rich environment. Looking over the potential candidates for the sudden shock that will stick a fork in the well-roasted corpse of business as usual, I’m reminded of the old board game Clue. Will Mr. Boddy’s killer turn out to be Colonel Mustard in the library with a lead pipe, Professor Plum in the conservatory with a candlestick, or Miss Scarlet in the dining room with a rope? <br>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In much the same sense, we’ve got a global economy burdened to the breaking point with more than a quadrillion dollars of unpayable debt; we’ve got a global political system coming apart at the seams as the United States slips toward the usual fate of empires and its rivals circle warily, waiting for the kill; we’ve got a domestic political system here in the US entering a classic prerevolutionary condition under the impact of a textbook crisis of legitimacy; we’ve got a global climate that’s hammered by our rank stupidity in treating the atmosphere as a gaseous sewer for our wastes; we’ve got a global fossil fuel industry that’s frantically trying to pretend that scraping the bottom of the barrel means that the barrel is full, and the list goes on. It’s as though Colonel Mustard, Professor Plum, Miss Scarlet, and the rest of them all ganged up on Mr. Boddy at once, and only the most careful autopsy will be able to determine which of them actually dealt the fatal blow.<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the midst of all this uncertainty, there are three things that can, I think, be said for certain about the end of the current era of pretense and the coming of the era of impact. The first is that it’s going to happen. When something is unsustainable, it’s a pretty safe bet that it won’t be sustained indefinitely, and a society that keeps on embracing policies that swap short-term gains for long-term problems will sooner or later end up awash in the consequences of those policies. Timing such transitions is difficult at best; it’s an old adage among stock traders that the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. Still, points made above—especially the increasingly shrill tone of the defenders of the existing order—suggest to me that the era of impact may be here within a decade or so at the outside.<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'> </span></div>
<br>
The second thing that can be said for certain about the coming era of impact is that it’s not the end of the world. Apocalyptic fantasies are common and popular in eras of pretense, and for good reason; fixating on the supposed imminence of the Second Coming, human extinction, or what have you, is a great way to distract yourself from the real crisis that’s breathing down your neck. If the real crisis in question is partly or wholly a result of your own actions, while the apocalyptic fantasy can be blamed on someone or something else, that adds a further attraction to the fantasy. <br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The end of industrial civilization will be a long, bitter, painful cascade of conflicts, disasters, and accelerating decline in which a vast number of people are going to die before they otherwise would, and a great many things of value will be lost forever. That’s true of any falling civilization, and the misguided decisions of the last forty years have pretty much guaranteed that the current example is going to have an extra helping of all these unwelcome things. I’ve discussed at length, in earlier posts in the Dark Age America sequence here and in other sequences as well, why the sort of apocalyptic sudden stop beloved of Hollywood scriptwriters is the least likely outcome of the predicament of our time; still, insisting on the imminence and inevitability of some such game-ending event will no doubt be as popular as usual in the years immediately ahead.<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
The third thing that I think can be said for certain about the coming era of impact, though, is the one that counts. If it follows the usual pattern, as I expect it to do, once the crisis hits there will be serious, authoritative, respectable figures telling everyone exactly what they need to do to bring an end to the troubles and get the United States and the world back on track to renewed peace and prosperity. Taking these pronouncements seriously and following their directions will be extremely popular, and it will almost certainly also be a recipe for unmitigated disaster. If forewarned is forearmed, as the saying has it, this is a piece of firepower to keep handy as the era of pretense winds down. In next week’s post, we’ll talk about comparable weaponry relating to the third stage of collapse—the era of response.</div>

I said recently, that the superannuation system here which takes 9.5% gross employee earnings and funnels that into the "investment" economy is a fundamental error and has led to the sort of unreal rise in investment vehicles that preceded the 1929 crash. It may be fair to describe it as a ponzi scheme which a person is forced into.

And they may have been able to field the first few margin calls too but eventually they got done in a process of slow attrition.<br><br>Of course we are trying very hard to purchase real wealth with paper IOU's which may or may not even been payable - and other countries know this.

The chimps will always formulate new hierarchies when it comes to peeling the bananas i suppose .<br><br>I get the feeling that once the masses are unceremoniously excommunicated from the industrial morass , the countryside will become awash with the detritus of this upheaval , and it will be interesting to see how the middle class resilience mindset copes with the arrival of tens of thousands of depressed , angry and impoverished plebes looking for their share of the vanishing pie . Locally grown organic food could well be at the top of their list ! . I suspect an altogether different mindset will become handy . Reminds me of a book mentioned by Orlov by an Argentinian guy ( during one of their collapses ) who used to get his wife to film their running gun battles with the interlopers for him to present to the law when they finally arrived days later , so he didnt get locked up .. He became quite expert in such affairs ..<br><br><a href=#c8618027393207001184 title="comment permalink">5/20/15, 4:00 PM</a><br><br>

In fact, I suspect it has a lot to do with how long people can hold onto pretense. Collapse has already happened in everyone's town as certain people slide out of the normal economy. But it's happened to another extreme in McDowell county West Virginia or the Pine Ridge reservation, and yet another extreme on the hellscapes of western Syria, Yemen and northern Nigeria - or the brothels of Siberia and Brazil. <br><br>In comparison to others somewhere else you haven't collapsed - not really, not yet.

The idea that someone, anyone, could be "serious, authoritative, respectable figures" is the most difficult idea for me to communicate. Your post on the possible rise of fascism is obviously brought to mind; my experience from discussing some of the ideas in that post is that my peers are so frustrated with authority after a life time of never once seeing an authority figure they found respectable, that they cannot imagine what such a figure would look like, and thus do not include any such figures in their imaginings of the coming era. Of course they, each in accordance to their sub-culture, have many celebrity leaders. You are such a leader to one tiny subculture; I take your ideas seriously, your advice to be authoritative, and your work respectable. It seems that so long as you don't go looking through the wrong seeing-stone or wearing the wrong rings, if you catch my meaning, you will likely stay to the sidelines of the age of impact, leaving the limelight to the "serious, authoritative, respectable figures" more interested in the magnitude of their message than the meaning of it.<br><br>I can imagine such an authority figure. Using the symbols of my subculture I would paint a picture of a young enthusiastic person who waxes on about farming or ecology or freedom or the oppressed or tradition or some fine thing, and casts the obvious mistakes of the old regime in the most sinister of light. For people living in the dark even that sinister light may have more warmth than most today would guess. Depending on which "Clue Character" is seen holding a weapon, all the once friends and allies of that character should be wary (choose your friends wisely during the era of pretense). Symptoms of the problem once unspeakable will be spoken about, and then yelled about, and finally screamed about. Sadly the time of speaking will be short, and the time of yelling long. The Authority Figure may recommend many sound ideas to some problems, but there will be no way to stop these ideas for copying themselves mindlessly to be applied to issues they have nothing to do with. Buying stocks is an obvious fix to people selling them, had that been the real problem all the better, but it treated a symptom and with a toxic dosage. Checking the power of the first and second estates was sensible, going to the extremes of the revolution was tragic. Will the solution be environmental restoration "work crews"; an iconoclastic rejection of certain 'bad guy' technologies; a ruthless winnowing of certain governmental or economic powers? Maybe none, maybe some mix, maybe things not polite to discuss even in these fringes of subculture. Regardless, though what little survives of our culture's checks and balances will be stressed greatly by the impact and will be unlikely to check the rampant over applying of the new Figures 'programs', then there will be the time for screaming.<br><br>Might look like Boris Yeltsin if he got his start in an local food coalition, anti free trade group, as an environmental activist, a homeless advocate, or in veteran affairs.<br><br>Not to dwell on the gloomy, stay out of histories way, and plant lots of squash!<br><br><a href=#c4183762597948654496 title="comment permalink">5/20/15, 4:59 PM</a><br><br>

A period of economic depression and scarce food leads to Europe-wide revolution (starting in France, Italy, and England).

Most of the opinions I hear discussed are based on disgust and distrust. That crisis of legitimacy you mention may be considerably further along than those in power realize. The militarization of police departments is, I think, an indicator that events are going to play out much the same as they did in the examples you gave. I've no doubt that very serious people will be dispensing advice on how to proceed to the masses. I do wonder though, just how many in those masses will have enough disposable resources left to follow that advice. My hope is that not many will since the real intent of such advice is to prop up the tottering wealth and power bases of the privileged few. Those people would be far better served, and in turn be of better service, using their remaining resources learning a sustainable living skill-set. Who knows, we might even pick up a few good Druid candidates.<br><br><a href=#c7481299260008642916 title="comment permalink">5/20/15, 7:51 PM</a><br><br>

I think those guys must read your blog, because it hits all your points about pretense, impact, and the cyclical nature of history.<br><br>The rest of what I've been listening to is my collection of superhero themes.<br><br>Despite as much as JHK and others spit on the current superhero craze as power fantasy wish fulfillment, I think some of it does have a useful place as the era of impact closes in. The Marvel movies have been repeatedly surprising me with their explorations of real world and somewhat current philosophical issues (especially the nasty potential of "big data" carried to its ultimate conclusion in The Winter Soldier). The really useful piece I take away, though, is the ability to identify with a character that never gives up.<br><br>The fractal process of decline means that the era of impact can start hitting small niches well before it is felt by the society at large, I believe. Lately I've been feeling it's close in the architecture profession, and maybe the building industry at large. Clients have pushed fees as low as they can go, government clients are cutting costs everywhere they can on Tea Party principles, and firms are competing for an ever-shrinking pie slice as the goal for everyone is to get the big projects that don't come very often anymore. Project managers are quietly going out of their minds, and my young peers increasingly don't look at advancing to that level of responsibility as desirable. I think 2008 hit the Boomer principal class like an iceberg, but instead of getting everyone into the lifeboats, they want their final legacy to be saving the ship, and so are putting everyone aboard to the impossible tasks of patching the hull and pumping water while building a bigger ship.<br><br>It would be easier to walk away, but the traditional methods of building construction I work with in historic preservation are one of the pieces of knowledge I want to ensure gets delivered to the future. Hence my personal Steampunk Sustainability project, and the need for some inspirational figures that don't give up or shirk giving 110%.

It's possible that the end of the United States may be much more sudden than anyone expects. <br><br>Steve, it's good advice. ;-)<br><br>Patricia, I know -- I think I have it fixed now.

There's certainly plenty of options. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, the best move if you were in France in the wake of 1789 was the same as the best move if you were in central Europe in the 1930s: go somewhere else, fast.

They are deeply worried.<br><br>Paul Krugman might be the chippiest serious economist recently confessing a fear that he had for years that he might be a fraud, and yet in his mind the financial solutions to restore liquidity was wildly successful in keeping the system going, avoiding the second great depression, and NOT (so far) creating massive inflation that all the pessimists were claiming would happen. Still, he also admits he has no clarity how we move out of this zero-interest "era" and that this is the new normal, and savings accounts will have negative-effective interest rates compared to inflation.<br><br>A decade ago I'd have gone with peak oil as the driver of crisis (impact), but now it seems clear its the econonic/financial system that's the key to how things fail.<br><br>At a personal level the predicament seems to be that in a growing economy, borrowing money to invest (in stocks, home, education, etc) pays off more than not, but in a contracting economy (or an inflating one that is an effective contracting one by median wealth) most investments built on debt fails to pay off the debt.<br><br>Since the government (or central banks) are the only institutions that can afford to lose (as long as its sovereign fiat debt) we have to expect these institutions will grow ever more powerful.<br><br>So to me this is where the Tea Partiers and Libertarians hold some sway for me. Liberals like Bernie Sanders would love to promise free colledge education for all young people, while doing nothing to control costs, imagining raising taxes on the top will pay for it. But however its funded really the effect would be ever greater top-down mandates against over-indebted universities until they all start popping into bankrupcty.<br><br>So in summary the nature of fiat money means we can predict (1) ever greater central control (2) ever greater local bankruptcies of cities, counties, states, colleges, as well as private companies, all looking for bailouts that each encourage the next domino.<br><br>So there's a debtor's dilemma here - if you're underwater in effective net debt, you keep borrowing more, since it'll never be repaid anyway, and sock aside some sort of wealth that won't be seized by a bankrupcy, while others if you have a positive net worth now, you could see all your useless assets, pay off all debt, and then redirect that wealth closer to home?<br><br>And such questions exist for individuals and corporations and every government institution.<br><br>But maybe the "era of impact" isn't caused by financial excesses, but a military conflict, like your story of a great military loss? <br><br>Anyway, betting on large market losses, and ever greater federal control and ownership is an easy one, and maybe the next step is while a negligent central ownership is overwhelmed, local forces start redividing resources and assets on their own, legal or not? <br><br>Occupy might still have a mission to complete, a decentralized Robin hood crew that meet local needs and dares anyone to stop them?

She remembers one uncle who sold off the chickens one by one to buy gasoline for his car; when the last chicken was gone, the car went up on blocks in his yard. But her family was never hungry, and they offered food and shelter for work to the unemployed who came through their small community. That collapse differed according to employment, location, and economic status, much as any looming on our horizon will.

My approach has been to look at population numbers before European immigrants arrived in various parts of the Americas. <br>California, where I now live, in pre-colonization times is thought to have had roughly 300,000 people living in it. Currently it has over 30,000,000 people. If a return to truly sustainable living is in our future, then it seems like a hundred fold reduction in population would also seem to be in our future.<br>The reduction in population would probably happen in a ragged sort of way. Most immediate might be population flight in response to a prolonged drought. Downstream might be further emigration in response to the decline of electricity, irrigation pumps being the largest user of this commodity in the state. <br>No irrigation pumps equals no agriculture in a large part of the state. <br>Given California's climate, the dream of permaculture farming might well be impractical. Adjusting to living off seasonably available food might be more reasonable. I suspect that farming was sustainable only in a world with a stable climate.

I once mentioned a classic book by Philip Slater ("The Pursuit of Loneliness"), and Slater quotes some other author as saying one of the defining qualities of the era he wrote the book (1970s, re-released in the 90s) was "crackpot realism". He defined the term as "the insistence that you invest another half-million dollars into a failed project, because 'one doesn't just junk a project one has already spent fifty thousand dollars on'". We know this today as "The Sunk-Cost Fallacy" but he was talking about broader attitudes more than just money: failure to give up on an idea that has worked in the past, when it is manifestly no longer working. Crackpot realism is, I'd say, the somber and serious pursuit of the ultimate logical consequences of a bad assumption about the world, in the face of reality and evidence (e.g. "The Market Will Always Go Up")<br><br>I suspect we can name a crackpot delusion that is distinctive to each of your five phases of collapse. To me it would sound a little schlocky to re-use the word "crackpot" five times, (or perhaps you don't object to it). Instead of "crackpot" we might perhaps say the Age of Pretense is defined by Delusional Realism; the Age of Impact is defined by Delusional Optimism; and so forth. Maybe something to keep in mind as you finish the columns in this series.<br><br><a href=#c1752694078284135402 title="comment permalink">5/21/15, 9:43 AM</a><br><br>

I'm a Civil Engineer, a field different but closely related to architecture, and I've been seeing some of the same things Architrans describes. I try to explain this to my co-workers and friends, but nobody seems to believe me. Nice to have a vote of confidence from another observer. The United States is <b><i>already</i></b> a very developed country in terms of infrastructure (which Architects and Civil Engineers are both designing). The easy stuff, the clearly needed stuff, the projects with a high benefit-to-cost ratio, have <b><i>already been done</i></b> in the US. The "low-hanging fruit" projects are already gone in our professions. We already built our shining new highway systems and our massive dams, mostly back in the 50s. Yes, our civil infrastructure is now crumbling, but infrastructure repair and maintenance projects are far less "sexy", in part because they are inevitably more complicated, more of a pain-in-the-neck to design and to implement, and have a far, far lower benefit-to-cost ratio. They're less profitable and less "sexy" ergo they are far under-funded and work on such things is less available... compared to grandiose studies of proposed projects that go nowhere, vacuous masturbatory regional planning documents, and so forth. Our profession is slowly moving in that direction -- each day we are less and less the bold developers improving the quality of life for our fellow citizens through clever shining new infrastructure; each day we are more and more like bureaucrats writing self-indulgent and speculative reports and fantastical designs that will never be built. Only large entities like governments can still afford to finance such frivolous and vacuous work -- and at that, it's less and less the local governments, and more and more the regional or national ones -- so my view from the inside, as a worker, is that Architects and Engineers seem to me more and more like our projects are pointless and crazy. We are becoming just another set of hogs feeding off the trough of old wealth, rather than creative minds pursuing clever new improvements to real peoples' individual lives.<br><br><a href=#c1757544201648484074 title="comment permalink">5/21/15, 10:03 AM</a><br><br>

Not in the way the Silicon Valley Tech optomists or the the Wall Street stock pumpers think it will be. The one thing that is different than in the other historical examples of collapse is our civilizations ( western industrial civilization) absolute reliance on several very fragile and energy dependent technologies ( discussed at length on this blog). I agree that we will not run out of food, or water or undergo political upheval any faster than out examples from the past, but when the age of impact is upon us ( my bet with the doom bookie is by the end of the election of 2016) then the first thing to go is personal automobile transportation for the masses. This may seem like just a small step down the stairs of collapse for those of us who bike, or walk in small towns but for the bulk of americans it is the central activity in their lives. I return every day to my condo in an unusual node on the light rail tracks of suburban Portland. Surrounding this tiny haven of public transportation are car lots, car washes, car repair, muffler shops, body shops etc. for as far as the eye can see. People think their lives are over if they can't park right next to their destination at the strip mall. We will certainly not collapse in to the dark ages when the age of impact arrives, but when they can no longer drive most people will think they have. I think this will happen abrubtly and will not be viewed as a small setback by anyone in mainstream america. The only bright spot is that the angry mobs in suburbia won't make it very far on foot.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c4358138307658239836 title="comment permalink">5/21/15, 11:51 AM</a><br><br>

Bonaparte wannabees are among the occupational hazards of the era of impact. <br><br>Raven, true enough. <br><br>Greg, nah, the current handwaving is all about "don't worry, we've got it fixed." The rhetoric of an era of impact is all about "we all" (meaning everyone but the political class, of course) "need to roll up our sleeves, tighten our belts, and get to work" -- doing something counterproductive, of course. <br><br>Denys, your hypothetical profession used to have names such as "witch," "hoodoo doctor," "diviner," and "priest/ess." It's a perennial growth industry in hard times, for good reason.<br><br>Shawn, glad to hear it. If you have the chance to plant some trees or perennial plants now and then, that's also a response they appreciate. <br><br>Yupped, yes, 1939 is another very good example. I should probably do a post on that one of these days, because there are ways in which the international situation has much more in common with that than with, say, 1914 or 1789. <br><br>Laney, very true. I hope you've learned as much as possible from your mother about how to get by in hard times; that sort of knowledge is well worth having. <br><br>Tomatina, hmm! I somehow managed to miss the pole reversal prophecy. Do remind your friend, once the date passes without incident, that he was wrong. <br><br>Matthew, ten years is a guess. I expect the first really big economic shock to come a good deal sooner than that -- I'll be startled if we get through this year without a major crisis -- but how long it takes for the crisis to break through the last fingernail grip of complacency is a good question. Thanks for the tip about Rosenstock-Huessy; I'll check him out as time permits. <br><br>Fudoshin, ka-ching! Exactly. <br><br>Avery, but the entire global system isn't suddenly going to realize that its entire project has failed. That's exactly my point. Decades after any sane person will have come to that realization, vast numbers of people around the world will still insist at the top of their lungs that there was nothing wrong with the industrial project, and they can <i>too</i> have all the goodies they think they deserve. Many of those people will be in positions of power, in those societies that haven't yet replaced their senile elites with competent thugs.

That's why we're facing the end of a civilization, not just a common or garden variety economic collapse.<br><br>Mister R., good! I wouldn't quibble with your timeline at all, as it happens. <br><br>Lawfish, well, we'll see. <br><br>K-dog, oh, it's going to be a mess, no question. Again, a good look at the collapse of any dead civilization will show the same kind of ragged trifecta of doom -- Mr. Boddy gets clonked over the head with the candlestick by Colonel Mustard in the library, staggers into the conservatory to be stabbed by Professor Plum, and crawls into the kitchen, where Miss Scarlet is waiting with the rope...<br><br>Denys, hmm. I don't want to fall afoul of the laws concerning internet gambling, but it might be worth starting an informal betting pool -- perhaps on the Green Wizards forum -- where people make their guesses. The one thing I'd require is that everyone agree that if they're wrong, they admit it publicly. <br><br>Wolfgang, I haven't forgotten about the post on Peak California. Mass migration out of the formerly Golden State? Already baked into the cake. <br><br>Thomas, "crackpot realism" was C. Wright Mills' phrase originally, and yes, I modeled "crackpot optimism" on it. I don't know that every phase has its own form of crackpottery, though it's at least possible; I simply wanted to point out one of the most widespread delusions of our time, the bizarre conviction that everything somehow has to turn out the way we want it. <br><br>Cacaogecko, got it in one. The lower down the pyramid you are, the less of a distance you have to fall, and the more of the skills you'll need at the bottom you already have. That's why I'm encouraging people to collapse now and avoid the rush -- that is, to embrace simplicity and poverty now, while they still have time to get good at it. <br><br>Caged, yes, I read it and appreciated it. It's good to see someone admitting that those who insist that everything's going to be fine if only (fill in the blank) are shoveling smoke. Everything is not going to be fine. Industrial civilization is crashing into ruin, billions of people are going to die before they otherwise would, and an immense wealth of natural and cultural treasures will be lost forever.

Main Street knows where it's at, and my kids, affluent youngsters (though they wouldn't see it that way) who travel extensively, do not argue with my perception that we're an a period analogous to the 1930s. In fact, they seem to be doing what they can to prepare for it. <br><br>I date the Age of Pretense from dear Ronnie's Morning In America speech - we all, truly, wanted to believe him! It has been a rather long period as such things so, though prolonged *crises* are nothing new in history. I give you the 30 Years War in Germany, or for a megaCrisis, Rome's Dying Republic era, which like our own 1914-1954 period, actually produced a highly visible Lost Generation! (Clodius Prettyboy, his sister, Catullus, et. al.) <br><br>(I finally realized their Latin Wars, c. 90 BCE, was not a WWII analog, but a Vietnam analog. Both sides fought like tigers, and then the winners gave the losers everything they asked for. That's an Awakening-Era war if ever I saw one.) And 9/11/2001 was a flash in the pan, whose impact on our society ratified what was already being done by the War on Drugs. <br> <br>The Crisis of today is the Great Recession, which is clearly still on. Peak Oil is the MegaCrisis, and those specialize in prolonged Ages of Pretense. Note the efforts of Augustus to keep up the pretense that he was merely a very rich and popular private citizen, and the Republic was functioning as always, only a lot better! It took Tiberius to ratify the change that had happened decades before. <br><br>Or look at the 14th and 15th centuries in England and the North of Europe (and for different reasons, Spain) - the medieval order's death warrant had been served by the Great Plague, but it took the corpse a long time to die. <br><br>I hope this helps make sense out of what's happening today; we're superimposing a regularly recurring cycle on top of what I feel quite confident in calling a megaCycle because they deal in *massive* changes.<br><br><a href=#c1539458815712710815 title="comment permalink">5/21/15, 3:35 PM</a><br><br>

They will continue to do this as they won’t want to give up any market share. It will effectively become a game of attrition as the big players squeeze out the marginal operators.<br>This contrasts markedly with BHP Petroleum’s chief Tim Cutt, who this week spoke to the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA) conference in Melbourne.<br>His concern is the opposite. He’s worried the industry is not uncovering enough new discoveries to cover the future demand for oil. He believes that the shale industry in the United States will peak in the next decade, which ultimately will lead to a spike in oil prices once known oil reserves start to decline.<br>Part of his argument is that the world consumes over 30 billion barrels of oil a year. Although by his estimates there is currently an oversupply of about one or two million barrels a day, in the long term, the industry is not even covering half of this consumption from new sources.<br>This is what he had to say:<br>‘In the past four years discoveries were less than 10 billion barrels per year and in 2014 they amounted to less than six…That's only a fifth of current consumption!’<br>The recent reduction in oil prices has led to oil companies dramatically cutting their exploration budgets, thus further reducing the chances for more new sources of oil.<br>You don’t need me to tell you how important oil is to the world economy. And as the two divergent views from the market experts highlighted above indicate, the longer term outlook is anyone’s guess.<br>What we can agree on is that there is currently an oversupply. So in the short term, don’t expect to see oil revisit anywhere close to 2014s highs.<br>Regards,<br>Matt Hibbard,<br>For The Daily Reckoning<br><br><a href=#c5806166856483999198 title="comment permalink">5/22/15, 3:47 AM</a><br><br>

I think for most of us there is always the thought that there will be a rescue before the end, even as our noses are pressed into that last little air pocket in the corner and we claw our way past all the other trapped people to get one more breath.<br>Having been raised by depression era parents and taught skills to "get by" because we were "poor" (even though I didn't know it),I still fell into the bliss of the last few decades, the glamour of the American Dream, and didn't see what was inevitable. Now I scramble to teach my children the skills my parents taught me about survival by living it and asking them to help me do things.

But after some thought I now agree that this is a simplistic and not very usefull analysis of the situation. <br> If we start from the premise, that we both agree is possible, that the U.S. loses its ability to import petroleum from the rest of the world early in the age of impact. Then if we also assume that by then the tight oil boom will have run it's course and the wells drilled during this time will be well down their rapid depletion curves. This leaves us with about 6 million barrells per day of petroleum in the U.S. We currently use about 18 million barrells per day. The interesting, and scary, issue becomes how do we deal with this politicaly. Does our disfunctional government and senile elite impliment rationing with necessary allocations to agriculture, transportation, infrustructure repair and chemical feedstocks ? Are we too far down the rabbit hole of market economics and let the rationing occur on a purely price/affordability basis. Does everyone from the middle class on up continue driving while they slowly starve to death and the electrical grid falls apart due to lack of repair? Does this lead to a major and potentialy violent political rift. <br> My idea that we would make the right choice and allocate our scarce fuel rationaly, leaving out happy motoring, is the engineer in me talking. The historian or political realist would agree that things will be much more complicated than that, and far less rational.<br><br><a href=#c3638605129750894127 title="comment permalink">5/22/15, 9:10 AM</a><br><br>

There's a bit of cynicism therein: the implication that the real killer might be among the usual suspects (which is they they are the usual suspects in the first place) but probably isn't (which is why the phrase suggests mere going through the motions). It underscores the importance of being prepared for the predictable consequences of disruptive events, because the events themselves are unpredictable.<br><br>The breaking point of the era of pretense, I imagine, will have to be a literal breaking point. Not necessarily the breaking of a thing, but at least of some major ongoing taken-for-granted continuity. After all, the reason collapse is fractal is the ability to contain and limit shocks by shutting off (as you described two weeks ago), cutting off, sloughing off, breaking off, the most troublesome parts. That process can be, and currently is, surreptitious: a lot of little pieces breaking off can go unnoticed by the remaining collective. Big important pieces, not so much.<br><br>Fractals and all-or-nothing (nonlinear) thresholds are concepts that go hand in hand. For instance, fractal clouds form when the threshold between a lot of condensation and no condensation at a given point in the sky is sharp. When that condition doesn't apply, you get hazy blobs of overcast instead. The power grid is like that too: at any given receptacle, the power is either on or off (with rare exceptions), but the future pattern of where it's on and where it's off over time is likely to be fractal indeed.<br><br>John Barth, in the obscure masterpiece <i>Lost in the Funhouse</i>, discusses forces creeping against hidden thresholds:<br><br>"For ages the fault creeps secret through the rock; in a second, ledge and railings, tourists and turbines all thunder over Niagara. Which snowflake triggers the avalanche? A house explodes; a star. In your spouse, so apparently resigned, murder twitches like a fetus. At some trifling new assessment, all the colonies rebel."<br><br>So: the end of the era of pretense comes when something breaks at the larger end of the fractal's scale. Actually, not quite. It actually comes when the collective decision is made (by choice or necessity) to let that fracture stand. To not make the commitment or effort to reclaim the region/segment hit by flood/insurrection/whatever. To "cut off the infected limb." The headline of import isn't something like "drought drives millions out of California;" it's more like "Congress votes down relocation assistance for California refugees."<br><br>(Because of that, my best-guess timeline for this era extends somewhat farther than yours, though we seem to agree about requiring more than one more major crisis yet to end it. I could be wrong. Yay dissensus.)<br><br>I think this formulation tells us a little bit more about the post-crisis crackpot optimism phenomenon. It's the backlash, the attempted revoking, of that inevitable sacrificial decision. In your historical examples and every other one I've looked at, the common motif is to join/rejoin the collective. Jump back into the market/movement/commons. It's an obvious and even commendable impulse to undo the fracture. It's doomed to fail (and make things worse) because the fracture was only a symptom. "Stay on the sinking ship, and we can all climb up to higher decks together, hand in hand." Or less metaphorically: "Welcome back to the new improved Soviet Union."<br><br>You probably already know that Mandelbrot coined the word "fractal" from the latin <i>fractus</i>, "broken" or "fractured." An irrelevant but interesting bit of irony. Fractal decline is fractured fracturing. Oh frack!<br><br><a href=#c4562869649334637195 title="comment permalink">5/22/15, 9:38 AM</a><br><br>

(I'm not authorized to give out gold stars, but have a tin parallelogram instead.)<br><br>It does depend somewhat on the place. Where I am now, neighbors certainly notice things like my and my wife's walking, DIY yard care instead of their army of itinerant Guatamalan landscapers, and our single bag of trash per week in the huge 80-gallon bin the town provides, while theirs are often overflowing. They seem to instinctively (and in our case accurately) associate that pattern with "knowing how to do things," so that's an additional potential benefit for the future. But they have few such needs now (the Guatamalans and the home improvement megastores and Angie's List being omnibenevolent in their lives) so occasional favors and some level of mutual understanding is as far as it goes. In other words, they don't appear to be competing any less, but they're also not sneering in our faces, for what that's worth.<br><br>At our previous place, where there were many more households around with similar habits, things were a bit different. They and we found one another quickly, and all our various knowledge of how to do things had immediate mutual benefits. The taste of real community I got there makes being the thin leading edge of future community here a bit more promising.<br><br>In many places you do have to be careful about consequences of signs of poverty that become <i>too</i> conspicuous, such as the dreaded clotheslines.<br><br><a href=#c6867122500144415920 title="comment permalink">5/22/15, 10:30 AM</a><br><br>

I understand what you're saying, and appreciate your comments about the confusions and contradictions of feminism -- being a human phenomenon, how could it have avoided those? -- but I find that when people put me in a father-role, the personal baggage and the projections usually come out in short order, and my work is difficult enough without those. Relations between parents and children are so fraught these days, a case could be made that it's probably healthier not even to address deities as "Father" or "Mother" until family relationships calm down a little!<br><br>Patricia, so noted; I'll be interested to read about it. <br><br>Ursachi, my poor fellow citizens are increasingly aware of that fact, and that's one of the things driving the crisis of legitimacy over here. <br><br>Eduardo, abolishing debts isn't the same thing as paying them off, you know. That said, you're right, of course -- that which can't be paid back, won't be paid back, and a lot of debt is going to end up worth rather less than the electrons it's printed on. <br><br>Clay, my working guess is that the loss of the ability to import oil won't happen all at once; Canada is basically treaty-bound (at gunpoint) to supply us with oil, for example. So it's a matter of losing one chunk of imports, then another, and so on.

Look at the pictures from 1930 where men in suits and ties are waiting for a bowl of soup, even if their suits are coated in dirt. It was rare in the 1930's for a woman to appear in public in pants. Men wore suits and women wore dresses, even in poverty. That changed with the war time assembly lines in WWII. In the 1920's to the 1950's most people went about life, outside the home, in what today are considered “dress up clothes.”<br><br>For the coming economic collapse we will all be less dressed up and more slovenly than the 1930's. There will be lots of casual clothes, recently sewn overseas in sweatshops, but little new clothing made here. After collapse there will be no way to make lots of new clothing out of new fabric here in the USA or to import the same, cheaply, from far away, as we do now.<br><br>The fashions of today are crude and are crudely made if judged by the standards of the 1920's. Today, only around 3% of our clothing is made in the USA and commercial sewing skills have been lost, that could bring back large scale clothing manufacturing in a collapsed future economy. There are limited numbers of commercial sewing machines available to reinvest in making clothes in the USA with a hastily rebuilt factory.<br><br>Most clothing made in the USA today is for the high end, for the fashion runway and the red carpet. The possibility of us literally covering our asses, in a difficult future, in the event of a major economic collapse is doubtful. We will be wearing cheap, causal, hand-me-downs for a long time.<br><br>This predicament is typical for many industries. We have lost the old industries that produced our necessities. In the last five decades, manufacturing activities have drifted to other continents where wages were lower. Factories closed and millions of employees were cast off. Whole sectors of the economy, which are those things a country must to do for itself, in order to survive, have been gutted and destroyed by those entrusted with managing them. The vaulted global economy is not going to supply us, post collapse, as it has for the past few years.<br><br>If our country's collapsed economy needs to replace its wardrobe in the future, it must do so with local cloth and with local manufacturing. Whatever is made will not be done from a corporate marketing plan, coupled with cheap over seas labor. We will need durable, well made work clothes, that will last and be practical for the hard work of raising our food and making our own tools. Petroleum based polyester will no longer be the fabric of choice. We will have to rely on home grown natural fibers. Our future clothing will be made by local talent, sewing local materials by hand and not made in a distant foreign factory out of oil by products.<br><br>Reinventing an abandoned industry and bringing it back to these shores, within a collapsing economy, will not be easy because any actions will have to survive the new economy's lurches downward. The revival of what were once the thriving home grown industries of the 1950's and 60's will be chaotic and difficult. Local efforts will try to fill the void left by what we are now shipping in from far away places.<br><br>Clothing is but one example. In the future we will be using inadequate equipment and local materials to recreate what has been lost over the last fifty years. At best we will patch together what we can and make do. That way the fashions this time will be different. When people say it is different this time, it will be, but only in the way we are costumed for the ball. Same old descent, but new costumes. Wear your best, because at midnight the bells toll and we all return to being mice.<br><br><a href=#c6337666404512935021 title="comment permalink">5/22/15, 11:18 PM</a><br><br>

However, prior to 1914, and unlike the 1930's and our time, the general climate was of optimism, and the global economy was doing well. Many knew a war was coming in 1914, but not a complete catastrophe as the Great War; during the 1930's, a sense of impending doom was very common, just like in our time.

Seriously though, whether you are building a pyramid, a coliseum, bridge or just a shack, knowing how big to make the structural members, and where to put them is key. Without this knowledge, things tend to fall down on people rather quickly.<br><br>While we have progressed quite far from the "if you want a coliseum that big you need pilars this big at the base" stage of engineering, the results are the same. There will still be a need for that information, even if we go back to log and hand laid stone constructed structures (or even mud huts). What will likely change during the decline is the availability of exotic/modern materials and fastening systems, and the spare resources to do as much building as we have in the past.<br><br>So are we at peak engineering? If you mean peak employment of engineers, maybe; we will need to see how the economy bounces along in the future. If the economy stays weak, the building of things may decline (it has declined substantially already due to the export of manufacturing). <br><br>If you mean the peak need for engineering knowledge, I'd say no sign of that in sight. Although the way this engineering gets done and by whom will be changing, probably significantly so during the decline.<br><br><a href=#c2187435087218937544 title="comment permalink">5/24/15, 12:59 PM</a><br><br>

The idea of moving into a $3 million home in a gated farm community then hiring some poor schlubs (an actual farmer and barely paid interns) to do the dirty work for you, (but NOT be able to live/own a place there themselves!) like some medieval serf or tenant farmer is an insulting farce.

Similarly, the 1929 crash affected the financialized world at the time, but largely was unknown in South America, Polynesia, already rural poor areas, etc. <br><br>While I appreciate the study of history as much as anyone, this is BIGGER - and there are conflating variables from so many different directions that 'rational' models are simply nonsense... One thing that Western 'science' really SUCKS at is synergy and accounting for minute interactions that are critical to outcomes. <br><br>While I understand that you are not impressed with apocalyptic 'fanatasies' that blame some mythical 'other', it defies logic that 'western civilization' has managed to evade scrutiny even here, and that we are ALL culpable - even those of us who have largely 'collapsed before the rush'... :)<br><br><a href=#c4060276639679991910 title="comment permalink">5/24/15, 5:43 PM</a><br><br>

The reason for the premium paid for aluminum cans is that smelting pure aluminum out of ore uses a lot of energy, and melting down cans uses very little. Providing there is some demand for things made of aluminum, the higher the price of oil, the more recycled aluminum is worth.<br><br> IIRC, recyclers started paying good money for aluminum cans years before they paid much for newspaper, steel cans or any other post-consumer waste, and ordinary Americans started recycling aluminum cans long before they paid attention to recycling in general.<br><br> The prices of other industrial commodities are subject to a lot of variables, but I think most observers would agree that they are affected by demand from China. The growth rate of the Chinese economy is slowing as the economy matures, which is pretty normal. The Chinese government has figured out that its investment policies have resulted in some building and construction that was useless, and they are revising those policies. These are benign reasons for a slackening world demand for industrial commodities.<br><br> Meanwhile the world's population continues to grow, and many countries cannot feed themselves. Perhaps agricultural commodity prices are a more reliable indicator of demand destruction caused by economic contraction.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c1774513275543866448 title="comment permalink">5/25/15, 11:53 AM</a><br><br>

His songs "The Last Day of June 1934" and "Laughing Into 1939" are the most directly apropos to the current discussion, but many others of his songs about history also contain powerful messages. Often the connection with present-day issues is implied rather than stated. But for example in his song "Somewhere in England 1915," where after many decades of seeming to avoid the topic he finally (in 2005) addressed WWI directly, he closes (after exhibiting the war in a series of scenes "in a dream") with a shift to the present day and a familiar-sounding warning:<br><br><i>Now the girl and the beach and the train and the ship [from the dream of 1915] are all gone<br>And the calendar up on the wall says it's ninety years on<br>I go out into the yard where the newspaper waits<br>There's a man on the cover we all know, defying the fates<br>And he seems very sure as he offers up his opinion<br>Well everyone feels like this in the beginning</i><br><br>I don't think it matters whether a song (or poem or story...) is literally about collapse or not. A song about something else can be a fine metaphor for collapse, and a song ostensibly about collapse can also be a metaphor for something else. I think it's likely as not, for instance, that Bastille's "Pompeii" was written as a metaphor for a failed romance.

A small one. Not long ago the brick façade on an apartment building for low income citizens came crashing to the ground. Luckily there was nobody underneath. <br><br>The bureaucratic response was, well, the inspections had been done, the requisite procedures fulfilled. <br><br>Yeah but the bricks still came down. This was failure. You can't just shrug. Over and over, for years now, we've had reports about the dreadful condition of our social housing. No matter. <br><br>I'll give you another. For the past couple of decades we've been talking about what to do with an elevated expressway that runs through the downtown. And talking and talking and talking. The thing is falling apart. Boom, crash, big, honking chunks of concrete. One of these days there will be a calamity. So what, there's no urgency. <br><br>I know, these are small coin, and they ARE small in the grand scheme and not hardly as glamorous as the invasion and sack of the city. No ISIS hordes on the outskirts. At least, not yet. "Impact", as you say, in the form of building materials raining down.<br><br>But, to me, this is what decline is primarily made of, a year-by-year dishevelment such that we forget what the place used to look like and how it used to work. Gradually, slowly, it comes un-done. <br><br>The glitterati deride law and order types as Neanderthal mouth-breathers because crime rates have come down since the 1990s. Or so they say. But we still have regular bullet fests where food courts and street parties get turned into kill zones. <br><br>Even if crime rates declined, rates are still three times what they were in the early 1960s, that is, if you believe the official stats (a dubious proposition). But in this, as in so many other things, the evidence of my eyes defies the official story-line. Apparently people are willing to bear levels of criminality that would have been intolerable a couple generations ago.<br><br>Like so many other places in history we'll get to the point where the life sustaining systems become so unreliable that the city becomes uninhabitable.

Some may call this measurement scheme a lie but in a sense it is more truthful to the popularly desired narrative, more energy efficient than a history rewrite to current measures of success.

I am just wondering if there might be another option besides 1) "crackpot optimism" (the various illusory schemes that will be promoted from within these big institutions), and 2) the sort of hunkering down in your locality and living right right now (the voluntary collapse strategy) advocated in the Archdruid Report. Option #1 deserves all the scorn that JMG has heaped on it for years now. No solutions, and certainly no relief, will be coming from those quarters. Option #2 seems to me vulnerable to criticisms like the one addressed in the Collapse Now book - making an individual commitment never to rape anyone will not end rape. <br> We might recall how wildly popular the Occupy Wall Street actions were when they first occurred. Something about them tapped a deep resentment at the way the planet and the economy are being ruined, but tapped as well an enthusiastic appreciation of the way the occupiers held on to a piece of territory for a bit and lived on it humanely and democratically. Nearly every credible style of social activism and most projects for intelligent food and energy production are now, on principle, "localist" in their thinking and strategies. As pretense gives way to impact, these strategies and this kind of thinking might sustain some more interconnected, trans-local kind of movement - something a little less solitary than the "collapse now" option. Yes, we will likely all be localists in the long run just out of sheer necessity (everything big will have collapsed). But as I see it, a strategy of local self-determination - if it included some plan for actually creating local economies and local assemblies as permanent alternatives to the corporate economy and centralized political authority - could give us some power to determine just what this collapse is going to look like, perhaps moderate its impacts somewhat. A controlled demolition, you might say, rather than an indiscriminate collapse. <br> Anyway, that's what I am working on ... btw, I grew up in central Appalachia - you made a wise choice.

I wanted to share an experience we had attending church and another I observed, and probably others have too. I'll share the observation here if that is ok - many churches around us build larger and larger buildings, especially the spin-off congregations which take a group from an existing church or two and recruit some more followers. Many of the building are the size of several barns with off shoot wings of classrooms. Lots of costs for something used 20 hours over the course of a week (20 is probably generous). It looks like they are measuring their success as a church by the size of their congregation and if they can fit them all In a building at once while serving them lots of programs (Sunday school, teen/ women/men groups, Bible study).<br><br>This confuses me. Did not Jesus say our work is to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, free the prisoner, educate the ignorant, heal the sick, comfort the lonely - as well as preach the gospel? All this work doesn't need building and programs but the work of one person in relation to another person. A church that runs a food pantry that distributes food on the third Thursday each month, may be feeding the hungry according the letter of the law, but it certainly is missing the spirit of it.<br><br><a href=#c8151236301325744587 title="comment permalink">5/27/15, 7:23 AM</a><br><br>

I got the job as a favor to my employer and was astounded at what I learned. The job was straightforward enough. All I had to do was to take the manual bookkeeping system and input it into a spreadsheet and generate a set of statements for the pastor to take to the annual Bishop's Meeting.<br><br>What I learned was how wealthy a small protestant congregation can actually be! The church had at best a few dozen, mostly elderly, members. The eyeopener, however, was just how much the church had given to individuals in need in the community in the prior year--a grand total of $250! Which to put it in perspective was less than 1/2000th of the church's net worth. My thought at the time was that on Resurrection Morning Jesus is bound to be pleased by all those CD's that will be laid at his feet.

As a resident of Alberta, where a large amount of the said oil is, I can see the current tactic is to tie up any option that proposes to change how and where the oil is shipped in red tape. The number of out of country organizations funding protests to every pipeline is very disturbing. There is some innuendo that the current owners of the railroads, which ship a rather large amount of oil, are bankrolling these efforts, but there seems to be more to it then that. If the Canadian Government actually wanted to enable running a major pipeline from Alberta to ports on the pacific coast, they have the ability to mostly disregard the street protesters, but not the pressure from the US.<br><br><a href=#c9004753122556711515 title="comment permalink">5/27/15, 5:57 PM</a><br><br>

I'll be interested in reading how you use it - your description almost seems like the heroine is rationalizing her own evil... which is not what the sentence says (I definitely believe I have a responsibility to change my own evil - or faults, since I don't think I'm quite that bad).

The Heroine is in conversation with another top leader in the society. They have prepared for the possible need to reduce the rival population for 200 years so the rationalization is well set (to maintain their own sovereignty as their rivals are doubling in population every 25 years) and they don’t want to go into the proverbial dustbin of history because of neighbors procreation. <br>The Heroines’ culture has strong values and manages to contain their own population to fit the environment. They know that once they take the action they will have to up their own replication to fill in the void.<br>The Heroine has to “implement” the plan which is quite different than rationally talking things over in a theoretical way. Here the sentence fits well in the dialog as an endcap to the conversation and start of the implementation. <br>Thanks for your input, it is most helpful.<br>Michael<br><br><br><a href=#c2064641095724586282 title="comment permalink">5/30/15, 9:34 AM</a><br><br>
