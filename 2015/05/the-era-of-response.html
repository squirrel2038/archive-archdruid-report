<div class=MsoNormal>
The third stage of the process of collapse, following what I’ve called the eras of pretense and impact, is the era of response. It’s easy to misunderstand what this involves, because both of the previous eras have their own kinds of response to whatever is driving the collapse; it’s just that those kinds of response are more precisely nonresponses, attempts to make the crisis go away without addressing any of the things that are making it happen. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If you want a first-rate example of the standard nonresponse of the era of pretense, you’ll find one in the sunny streets of Miami, Florida right now. As a result of global climate change, sea level has gone up and the Gulf Stream has slowed down. One consequence is that these days, whenever Miami gets a high tide combined with a stiff onshore wind, salt water comes boiling up through the storm sewers of the city all over the low-lying parts of town. The response of the Florida state government has been to ssue an order to all state employees that they’re not allowed to utter the phrase “climate change.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That sort of thing is standard practice in an astonishing range of subjects in America these days. Consider the roles that the essentially nonexistent recovery from the housing-bubble crash of 2008-9 has played in political rhetoric since that time. The current inmate of the White House has been insisting through most of two turns that happy days are here again, and the usual reams of doctored statistics have been churned out in an effort to convince people who know better that they’re just imagining that something is wrong with the economy. We can expect to hear that same claim made in increasingly loud and confident tones right up until the day the bottom finally drops out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With the end of the era of pretense and the arrival of the era of impact comes a distinct shift in the standard mode of nonresponse, which can be used quite neatly to time the transition from one era to another. Where the nonresponses of the era of pretense insist that there’s nothing wrong and nobody has to do anything outside the realm of business as usual, the nonresponses of the era of impact claim just as forcefully that whatever’s gone wrong is a temporary difficulty and everything will be fine if we all unite to do even more of whatever activity defines business as usual. That this normally amounts to doing more of whatever made the crisis happen in the first place, and thus reliably makes things worse is just one of the little ironies history has to offer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What unites the era of pretense with the era of impact is the unshaken belief that in the final analysis, there’s nothing essentially wrong with the existing order of things. Whatever little difficulties may show up from time to time may be ignored as irrelevant or talked out of existence, or they may have to be shoved aside by some concerted effort, but it’s inconceivable to most people in these two eras that the existing order of things is itself the source of society’s problems, and has to be changed in some way that goes beyond the cosmetic dimension. When the inconceivable becomes inescapable, in turn, the second phase gives way to the third, and the era of response has arrived. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This doesn’t mean that everyone comes to grips with the real issues, and buckles down to the hard work that will be needed to rebuild society on a sounder footing. Winston Churchill once noted with his customary wry humor that the American people can be counted on to do the right thing, once they have exhausted every other possibility. He was of course quite correct, but the same rule can be applied with equal validity to every other nation this side of Utopia, too. The era of response, in practice, generally consists of a desperate attempt to find something that will solve the crisis du jour, other than the one thing that everyone knows will solve the crisis du jour but nobody wants to do. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s return to the two examples we’ve been following so far, the outbreak of the Great Depression and the coming of the French Revolution. In the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash, once the initial impact was over and the “sucker’s rally” of early 1930 had come and gone, the federal government and the various power centers and pressure groups that struggled for influence within its capacious frame were united in pursuit of a single goal: finding a way to restore prosperity without doing either of the things that had to be done in order to restore prosperity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That task occupied the best minds in the US elite from the summer of 1930 straight through until April of 1933, and the mere fact that their attempts to accomplish this impossibility proved to be a wretched failure shouldn’t blind anyone to the Herculean efforts that were involved in the attempt. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first of the two things that had to be tackled in order to restore prosperity was to do something about the drastic imbalance in the distribution of income in the United States. As noted in previous posts, an economy dependent on consumer expenditures can’t thrive unless consumers have plenty of money to spend, and in the United States in the late 1920s, they didn’t—well, except for the very modest number of those who belonged to the narrow circles of the well-to-do. It’s not often recalled these days just how ghastly the slums of urban America were in 1929, or how many rural Americans lived in squalid one-room shacks of the sort you pretty much have to travel to the Third World to see these days. Labor unions and strikes were illegal in 1920s America; concepts such as a minimum wage, sick pay, and health benefits didn’t exist, and the legal system was slanted savagely against the poor. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You can’t build prosperity in a consumer society when a good half of your citizenry can’t afford more than the basic necessities of life. That’s the predicament that America found clamped to the tender parts of its economic anatomy at the end of the 1920s. In that decade, as in our time, the temporary solution was to inflate a vast speculative bubble, under the endearing delusion that this would flood the economy with enough unearned cash to make the lack of earned income moot. That worked over the short term and then blew up spectacularly, since a speculative bubble is simply a Ponzi scheme that the legal authorities refuse to prosecute as such, and inevitably ends the same way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There were, of course, effective solutions to the problem of inadequate consumer income. They were exactly those measures that were taken once the era of response gave way to the era of breakdown; everyone knew what they were, and nobody with access to political or economic power was willing to see them put into effect, because those measures would require a modest decline in the relative wealth and political dominance of the rich as compared to everyone else. Thus, as usually happens, they were postponed until the arrival of the era of breakdown made it impossible to avoid them any longer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second thing that had to be changed in order to restore prosperity was even more explosive, and I’m quite certain that some of my readers will screech like banshees the moment I mention it. The United States in 1929 had a precious metal-backed currency in the most literal sense of the term. Paper bills in those days were quite literally receipts for a certain quantity of gold—1.5 grams, for much of the time the US spent on the gold standard. That sort of arrangement was standard in most of the world’s industrial nations; it was backed by a dogmatic orthodoxy all but universal among respectable economists; and it was strangling the US economy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s fashionable among certain sects on the economic fringes these days to look back on the era of the gold standard as a kind of economic Utopia in which there were no booms and busts, just a warm sunny landscape of stability and prosperity until the wicked witches of the Federal Reserve came along and spoiled it all. That claim flies in the face of economic history. During the entire period that the United States was on the gold standard, from 1873 to 1933, the US economy was a moonscape cratered by more than a dozen significant depressions. There’s a reason for that, and it’s relevant to our current situation—in a backhanded manner, admittedly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Money, let us please remember, is not wealth. It’s a system of arbitrary tokens that represent real wealth—that is, actual, nonfinancial goods and services. Every society produces a certain amount of real wealth each year, and those societies that use money thus need to have enough money in circulation to more or less correspond to the annual supply of real wealth. That sounds simple; in practice, though, it’s anything but. Nowadays, for example, the amount of real wealth being produced in the United States each year is contracting steadily as more and more of the nation’s economic output has to be diverted into the task of keeping it supplied with fossil fuels. That’s happening, in turn, because of the limits to growth—the awkward but inescapable reality that you can’t extract infinite resources, or dump limitless wastes, on a finite planet. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The gimmick currently being used to keep fossil fuel extraction funded and cover the costs of the rising impact of environmental disruptions, without cutting into a culture of extravagance that only cheap abundant fossil fuel and a mostly intact biosphere can support, is to increase the money supply ad infinitum. That’s become the bedrock of US economic policy since the 2008-9 crash. It’s not a gimmick with a long shelf life; as the mismatch between real wealth and the money supply balloons, distortions and discontinuities are surging out through the crawlspaces of our economic life, and crisis is the most likely outcome. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the United States in the first half or so of the twentieth century, by contrast, the amount of real wealth being produced each year soared, largely because of the steady increases in fossil fuel energy being applied to every sphere of life. While the nation was on the gold standard, though, the total supply of money could only grow as fast as gold could be mined out of the ground, which wasn’t even close to fast enough. So you had more goods and services being produced than there was money to pay for them; people who wanted goods and services couldn’t buy them because there wasn’t enough money to go around; business that wanted to expand and hire workers were unable to do so for the same reason. The result was that moonscape of economic disasters I mentioned a moment ago. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The necessary response at that time was to go off the gold standard. Nobody in power wanted to do this, partly because of the dogmatic economic orthodoxy noted earlier, and partly because a money shortage paid substantial benefits to those who had guaranteed access to money. The rentier class—those people who lived off income from their investments—could count on stable or falling prices as long as the gold standard stayed in place, and the mere fact that the same stable or falling prices meant low wages, massive unemployment, and widespread destitution troubled them not at all. Since the rentier class included the vast majority of the US economic and political elite, in turn, going off the gold standard was unthinkable until it became unavoidable. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The period of the French revolution from the fall of the Bastille in 1789 to the election of the National Convention in 1792 was a period of the same kind, though driven by different forces. Here the great problem was how to replace the Old Regime—not just the French monarchy, but the entire lumbering mass of political, economic, and social laws, customs, forms, and institutions that France had inherited from the Middle Ages and never quite gotten around to adapting to drastically changed conditions—with something that would actually work. It’s among the more interesting features of the resulting era of response that nearly every detail differed from the American example just outlined, and yet the results were remarkably similar. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus the leaders of the National Assembly who suddenly became the new rulers of France in the summer of 1789 had no desire whatsoever to retain the traditional economic arrangements that gave France’s former elites their stranglehold on an oversized share of the nation’s wealth. The abolition of manorial rights that summer, together with the explosive rural uprisingsagainst feudal landlords and their chateaux in the wake of the Bastille’s fall, gutted the feudal system and left most of its former beneficiaries the choice between fleeing into exile and trying to find some way to make ends meet in a society that had no particular market for used aristocrats. The problem faced by the National Assembly wasn’t that of prying the dead fingers of a failed system off the nation’s throat; it was that of trying to find some other basis for national unity and effective government. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a surprisingly difficult challenge. Those of my readers who know their way around current events will already have guessed that an attempt was made to establish a copy of whatever system was most fashionable among liberals at the time, and that this attempt turned out to be an abject failure. What’s more, they’ll have been quite correct. The National Assembly moved to establish a constitutional monarchy along British lines, bring in British economic institutions, and the like; it was all very popular among liberal circles in France and, naturally, in Britain as well, and it flopped. Those who recall the outcome of the attempt to turn Iraq into a nice pseudo-American democracy in the wake of the US invasion will have a tolerably good sense of how the project unraveled. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the unwelcome but reliable facts of history is that democracy doesn’t transplant well. It thrives only where it grows up naturally, out of the civil institutions and social habits of a people; when liberal intellectuals try to impose it on a nation that hasn’t evolved the necessary foundations for it, the results are pretty much always a disaster. That latter was the situation in France at the time of the Revolution. What happened thereafter<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>is what almost always happens to a failed democratic experiment: a period of chaos, followed by the rise of a talented despot who’s smart and ruthless enough to impose order on a chaotic situation and allow new, pragmatic institutions to emerge to replace those destroyed by clueless democratic idealists. In many cases, though by no means all, those pragmatic institutions have ended up providing a bridge to a future democracy, but that’s another matter.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here again, those of my readers who have been paying attention to current events already know this; the collapse of the Soviet Union was followed in classic form by a failed democracy, a period of chaos, and the rise of a talented despot. It’s a curious detail of history that the despots in question are often rather short. Russia has had the great good fortune to find, as its despot du jour, a canny realist who has successfully brought it back from the brink of collapse and reestablished it as a major power with a body count considerably smaller than usual.. France was rather less fortunate; the despot it found, Napoleon Bonaparte, turned out to be a megalomaniac with an Alexander the Great complex who proceeded to plunge Europe into a quarter century of cataclysmic war. Mind you, things could have been even worse; when Germany ended up in a similar situation, what it got was Adolf Hitler. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Charismatic strongmen are a standard endpoint for the era of response, but they properly belong to the era that follows, the era of breakdown, which will be discussed next week. What I want to explore here is how an era of response might work out in the future immediately before us, as the United States topples from its increasingly unsteady imperial perch and industrial civilization as a whole slams facefirst into the limits to growth. The examples just cited outline the two most common patterns by which the era of response works itself out. In the first pattern, the old elite retains its grip on power, and fumbles around with increasing desperation for a response to the crisis. In the second, the old elite is shoved aside, and the new holders of power are left floundering in a political vacuum. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We could see either pattern in the United States. For what it’s worth, I suspect the latter is the more likely option; the spreading crisis of legitimacy that grips the country these days is exactly the sort of thing you saw in France before the Revolution, and in any number of other countries in the few decades just prior to revolutionary political and social change. Every time a government tries to cope with a crisis by claiming that it doesn’t exist, every time some member of the well-to-do tries to dismiss the collective burdens its culture of executive kleptocracy imposes on the country by flinging abuse at critics, every time institutions that claim to uphold the rule of law defend the rule of entrenched privilege instead, the United States takes another step closer to the revolutionary abyss. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I use that last word advisedly. It’s a common superstition in every troubled age that any change must be for the better—that the overthrow of a bad system must by definition lead to the establishment of a better one. This simply isn’t true. The vast majority of revolutions have established governments that were far more abusive than the ones they replaced. The exceptions have generally been those that brought about a social upheaval without wrecking the political system: where, for example, an election rather than a coup d’etat or a mass rising put the revolutionaries in power, and the political institutions of an earlier time remained in place with only such reshaping as new necessities required. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
We could still see that sort of transformation as the United States sees the end of its age of empire and has to find its way back to a less arrogant and extravagant way of functioning in the world. I don’t think it’s likely, but I think it’s possible, and it would probably be a good deal less destructive than the other alternative. It’s worth remembering, though, that history is under no obligation to give us the future we think we want.</div>

Intelligence expert Robert Steele had the following to say in <a href=http://www.phibetaiota.net/2015/05/robert-steele-homeland-security-the-much-bigger-picture/ rel=nofollow>a post yesterday on The Public Intelligence Blog</a>: "From the perspective of a long-time intelligence professional – a former spy who helped create the Marine Corps Intelligence Center and spent 20 years as a CEO pioneering commercial intelligence – not only do most of the preconditions for revolution exist in America right now, but the federal government seems determined to ignore realities across the board."<br><br>He then referred to a graph listing the preconditions for revolution; the ones that currently prevail in the U.S. were printed in red. Of the 45 cells in the table, 33 were completely red and five were half red, leaving only seven that did not completely or partly signal impending revolution.<br><br>On another topic you raised, the nature of money in relation to the U.S. going off the gold standard, I have two links to share with you, both of them about money as a legal institution, which includes the idea that money doesn't really exist without taxation or its equivalent.

One thing I've found interesting recently in the interviewing that I've been doing - is that the crisis of legitimacy - which is, as you say, in full swing - is in important ways directed at the elites rather than to the institution of representational democracy. There is a persistent and well-defined belief among Americans that they ought to have a government of the people, by the people and for the people. (This is always brought up as an ideal being atrociously violated in practice, of course.) An underlying accompaniment to this article of faith is still rare but has been coming up more often - namely that this form of governance was created through revolution and defended through civil war. There's a script that could play out in any number of interesting ways.<br><br>In a related vein, JMG, I picked up a copy of <a href=http://subscribe.adbusters.org/collections/back-issues/products/ab119 rel=nofollow>Adbusters</a> for my ride home from a research trip to Kansas City, and was pleased to find your work taking up some of the pages inside. Kudos for that. I think you reach an interesting readership there. <br><br>That magazine has always been pretty vehemently anti-consumer-capitalism, but I don't recall it being quite so doomerish in the past.<br><br><br><a href=#c4334754840042873663 title="comment permalink">5/27/15, 6:32 PM</a><br><br>

It is possible that the lies will simply get too convoluted and grandiose (approaching that now, perhaps...) until they burst, just like financial bubbles. A media bubble bursting? I don't know, but this seems to be part of what is required for the breakdown.<br><br>Another point is that our country was begun as a loosely grouped bunch of confederated zones/states. Outside of a short-lived common heritage, we are a nation of immigrants and have been taught to celebrate diversity of late. There is no one tribe or group that is the center of this country any longer; no one religion, no one deity, no 'one thing' to unite us as a people. In point of fact, the only thing that seems to serve as a focal point is the attainment of the "American Dream", which is based solely on money and is receding towards 'elsewhere' rapidly.<br><br>I also see the various groupings of people (urban vs rural, white collar vs blue collar, etc.) only united by reason of common geography. In cities, that is the only unifying factor - common utilities and roads and such. Rural areas have similar points of unity, but seem to be based more on commerce and products - many rural folks have only electricity as a utility.<br><br>If we examine the country as a whole, we wind up with the south, the northeast (corridor of power), the Great Lakes area, the central plains, the desert southwest and the west coast - Texas might even be enough to stand on its own, considering they still retain a large group with state pride and identification.<br><br>I think that the country as a whole has taxation without representation solely based on population vs congressional headcount. The "corridor of power" stretching from VA to NYC also encompasses the military and financial seats of power. This is so very obvious when one watches the morning news shows, where everything is about the corridor and its goings on, with anecdotal stories about the rest of the planet. It is rare to see anything make the national news, outside of a crises, that is not in their immediate geography.<br><br>I think it possible that we might devolve over time into a more manageable grouping of states or even countries, similar to Europe. Fuel costs will limit globalism and thus similarly limit nationalism, in a country currently based on highways in lieu of anything resembling a rail system. <br><br>Further, there are ideological divides between north and south and east and west that seem to be exacerbated by the MSM. I know my Texas accent isn't visible on the screen, but when I travel to the northeast or the west coast, I hear the derogatory mutterings in the background quite often. And it is often assumed I am very ignorant and unsophisticated just by virtue of the lilts in my speech. <br><br>I think a breakup along lines of mutual comfort and advantage is very possible due to the size of this country, once it is obvious that there is no longer any business as usual. I think this type of evolution might stave off or roll back any "national figure" here in the US - it is hard to maintain unity as it exists today without the meme of Rep/Dem or other artificial means. And more people are awakening to the truth of our existence each year - many of us are simply ignoring things and moving on.<br><br><a href=#c3625724038691373596 title="comment permalink">5/27/15, 6:46 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, a classic nonresponse would be: the meeting to discuss no business at all but merely to be a display of power. What a time waster... I'm pretty certain John Kenneth Galbraith wrote about those wretched things, where much and nothing at all was discussed.<br><br>The gold standard was as much an illusion as the current token based system in place. The expansion of the money supply right now at a time of decline in real world wealth is strangling the economic system and producing some very unusual results... Down Under, the government regulator for the banking industry during the past fortnight has told the banks to up the interest rates for housing investor loans by shock, horror 0.1%pa. When I was a wee lad, investor loans regularly fielded a 1% premium over owner occupied mortgages. The property market has gone feral here.<br><br>The whole economic thing of today reminds me of nothing more than the equivalent problems faced by a large scale money laundering operation. I've never been involved in such an enterprise and would run a mile from that particular beast because once you are in the jaws of that beast there is no escape.

In other words, as a clash between competing ideologies.

One of the great temptations of studying history is to get caught up in the big dates, and the major political or military events that happen on big dates, by dividing eras up into neat units of time, based one either side of these dates. But applying the fractal model, it seems that major change happens as a series of cycles of pretense/impact/response/breakdown - working at all levels of society - rather than just one big cycle that neatly divides the timeline up around the important dates?<br><br>For example in pre-revolutionary Russia there were clear pressures mounting on the Romanov's, each with their own response, from well before 1905 through the early years of WWI. And then of course there were two revolutions in 1917, including several reorganizations of the provisional government. And then the ongoing evolution of the Bolshevik's responses and internal changes for years afterwards, culminating ultimately in Soviet dissolution. It's tempting to see 1917 as the impact date, with the Bolsheviks as the response and Stalin as the strongman. But really weren't there several cycles of pretense/impact/response, etc, that ran from 1905 through to, say, 1922?<br><br><a href=#c259632380660939510 title="comment permalink">5/27/15, 7:55 PM</a><br><br>

Steele's analysis is very close to mine; I hope someone in the corridors of power is listening. <br><br>Andy, one of the few things that I think could help the US get through its current mess in better shape than it's otherwise likely to do is a major push by those of us on the fringes to haul the skills of representative democracy out of the dumpster and put them into as many hands as possible. I've put some effort into that from time to time, but a bigger push is probably needed. <br><br>Wizzard, no argument at all. In most of my guesses as to the future of North America, btw, an independent Texas (possibly including a few other neighboring states) is a pretty consistent feature. <br><br>Cherokee, he did indeed -- the discussion of no-business meetings is in the latter part of <i>The Great Crash 1929</i>. As for the next bubble, if I knew I'd invest in it now, then sell out right about the time that it's proclaimed as the salvation of the global economy. <br><br>Allan, good! There's a lot in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> -- L. Frank Baum was in the thick of the cultural controversies of his time, and you'll find large chunks of Theosophy and turn-of-the-century feminism in Oz, too -- but yes, bimetallism was part of the mix. The idea was that the rate of silver mining was high enough to permit a much faster expansion of the currency, and thus counteract the gold standard's tendency to force deflation. <br><br>Fudoshin, dead on the money. <br><br>HalFiore, ideology is overrated as a basis for revolution. What's needed is a conviction, on the part of a majority of the population, that the existing order is not only bad but vulnerable, and that overthrowing it is a live option. Once you have that, an ideology can usually be cobbled together to justify the seizure of power pretty easily. <br><br>Steve, as previously noted, I didn't have the Kubler-Ross stages in mind while coming up with this, but you have a point!<br><br>Yupped, exactly! Revolution has a fractal structure, and the more complex the collapse of the old order, the more self-similarity you'll get on different scales.<br><br>Zoroaster, you're not quite the first person to point it out -- see Steve Morgan's comment two notches above yours. As for your question, the more of the old institutional framework remains in place, the less the likelihood of ending up with really drastic abusive behavior on the part of the post-revolutionary government. Every post-revolutionary situation sees abuses, as the new government has to establish its power vis-a-vis competing power centers, but when the old elite hangs on long enough to transfer the institutional forms of power to its successors, old limits to abuse tend to restrict the body count somewhat.<br><br><a href=#c7891321369849330409 title="comment permalink">5/27/15, 8:19 PM</a><br><br>

The Russians have just released a whole bunch of new info about the T-50, claiming it can outfight not only the F-35 Lardbucket (love that nickname, BTW) but the F-22 Raptor as well. They say it not only has better aerodynamic performance than the F-22 and F-35 but is stealthier and has a more advanced sensor and electronic warfare suite. What’s even more stunning, American generals and military analysts have essentially admitted in recent days these claims are probably true. Moreover, the F-35 won’t be ready for combat until at least 2020, while the T-50 is scheduled to begin entering service next year. The end of the American Empire could be a lot sooner than anyone expected…<br><br>Also, did you notice that the US Army pushed back the start of its next upgrade program for the M-1 Abrams from 2017 to 2020? The announcement came not long after the Russian Army unveiled its new T-14 Armata tank, which even the US Army has admitted outguns and outclasses every other tank in the world. My guess is that since the new M-1 variant, the M-1A3 has comparatively modest upgrades over the existing models, the Army decided it probably doesn’t make much sense to put it into production when the Russians have a much better tank that will be going into full scale production next year.<br><br><a href=#c4900942648769926561 title="comment permalink">5/27/15, 8:28 PM</a><br><br>

I do have one question, which is saying that the gold standard had to go as a response. No, I'm not promoting the gold standard; it's just that the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, nearly 16 years before the Crash, and was freely applying monetary policy right into the Crash, including what Benjamin Strong referred to as a "little coup de whiskey" for the stock market in 1927. And the dollar didn't stop being pegged to gold after the Crash; Roosevelt changed the peg to inflate the dollar, but the peg itself persisted until Nixon closed the gold window in 1971. So I'm curious why you consider going off the gold standard to have been a response in this case.<br><br><a href=#c8578344166417701994 title="comment permalink">5/27/15, 8:45 PM</a><br><br>

I'll want to see an objective assessment of the PAK-FA's performance before jumping to conclusions; it can hardly help being better than the Lardbucket, granted, but we'll see about how it compares to other fighters. Ditto with the Armata -- clearly a state-of-the-art design, but Russia's had its share of brilliant designs that flopped in practicr, like every other producer of armaments. <br><br>Jose, you're welcome and thank you. I wish more people in the business world took the time to think about the world their actions are making for their children and grandchildren. <br><br>Unknown, Roosevelt unilaterally changed the terms on Federal debt from "payable in gold" to "payable in Federal Reserve notes, which we can choose whether or not to let you exchange for gold." He also made private ownership of gold, in any quantity beyond jewelry, illegal for US citizens, thus making it impossible for the latter to cash their dollars in for gold in what had been the usual manner. A gold standard where the gold sits in a vault at Fort Knox and is valued at an arbitrary price defined by government fiat, rather than being freely exchanged for currency by all participants, is a gold standard in name only. <br><br>Andrew, thanks for the link!<br><br><a href=#c4284856451901725141 title="comment permalink">5/27/15, 9:38 PM</a><br><br>

Not because I am blindly in love with the gold standard (which I am not), but because I think it misses some significant financial "forces" which were in play back then (as well as today).<br><br>What FDR did was not to take the US off the gold standard (that waited for Nixon's in the 1970's), rather he did a simple (for that era) devaluation of the currency. He called in all the gold currency (made it illegal for private citizens to keep gold coins), then when he had it all out of the hands of the citizenry, he devalued the currency, from about $20 to $35 per oz of gold. He had to get the gold coins out of circulation otherwise they would be hoarded as the currency went down in value [Ignoring of course that the well to do somehow found out about this plan in time to move their gold overseas where it they could keep it.] At that point he could have issued new gold coins at the new rate, as was typically done in these devaluations, but didn't. Likely I suspect because he wanted to keep the option of further devaluations open; things were pretty bad and it wasn't clear this devaluation was enough to fix things.<br><br>What he did may seem draconian today, but it was just the way gov'ts had to do a currency devaluation back then, with fixed, gold-based exchange rates and gold coins in circulation. When countries did not follow that plan, there was usually a run on their gold (as the French were doing to the US when Nixon closed the gold window in the 70's, and as Britain saw in the 30's). If you just print more currency without adjusting your official rate of that currency to gold, then your gold goes on sale in your currency, and lots of folks will want to trade whatever of your currency they have for your gold.<br><br>The underlying approach which FDR took, increasing the money supply, is ironically the same basic strategy which the FED (Federal Reserve) has taken since the ongoing crisis of 2000. The main difference is that FDR also put in place various work and other programs designed to funnel that "new money" into the hands of the poor and unemployed. That did not restart prosperity, but it did keep many families alive and build some useful infrastructure. Historians/economists will argue whether FDR's program really would have pulled the US out of the depression, without WW2. If it was doing so, it was at a glacially slow pace up until the war started. If WW2 has not happened, FDR would likely have needed another round of currency devaluation.<br><br>The main difference with today is that the "new money" which is being created is not funneled into the hands of the average citizen, with a very few exceptions. Rather it is channeled into the banking system, where surprise, surprise it finds it way into financial assets. Probably the ideal solution from the POV of the elite, all this new money is going to them not some poor person. What could be wrong with that, other than it does not fix the problem at hand either...<br><br><a href=#c2411067528146858422 title="comment permalink">5/27/15, 10:24 PM</a><br><br>

An underlying assumption of the Keynesian approach, is that the slow down is a temporary anomaly, caused by a hiccup in the financial sector. Greasing the financial skids by tossing in new money allows the economy to regain its momentum and get through the temporary financial hiccup. But what if what ails the economy is not a temporary financial thing, but a serious "illness" at the heart of the economy itself. Then throwing more money at the economy, whether as FDR did or as is being done now, can't fix it. [and BTW, neither can a return to a gold standard] All that you get from it, is more debt, devalued currencies, and a stagnating economy. Hmmm, now where have we seen this before ;)<br><br>I wonder if your stages of a societal collapse can be equally applied to an economy (as a subset of a society). If so, I would venture a guess that the economy is still firmly in the stage of Pretense. No recognition that there is something wrong, that the steps which are being taken to fix it are not working. And that those steps have not worked anytime in the last 80 years when they were tried...<br><br><a href=#c5070704033065135705 title="comment permalink">5/27/15, 10:26 PM</a><br><br>

I especially appreciate the incorporation of multiple similar historical circumstances to help define the general thrust of such events. As you've noted before, in the US at least, talks about troubled history and collapse inevitably focus on the last one for us, Depression/WW2-era events. It's useful, but a sample size of one isn't sufficient for analysis.<br><br>As for the gold standard, I'd suspect I'm one of those who you expected to screech. :) I will not, though, and feel you have a point, though I'd disagree on some details. For instance, I'd argue that while fiat money may have been a possible solution, the system we adapted (money as debt, thus requiring growth for interest payments) is one of the major sources of our present difficulties, such that it was just another example of dumping one's problems upon a future generation. A gold standard, moreover, could be more adaptable than the system that was in place at the time, to accommodate growth. But yes, the system as it was obviously created numerous difficulties.<br><br>The response against fiat in conservative or libertarian circles is primarily a moral and ideological one, which then claims (for reasons never quite clear to me beyond rhetoric) that a gold standard must improve life in all ways, always, in all circumstances. Which is silly, of course. The moral-ideological argument is, to my mind, a sound one, and we are now seeing the consequences of not heeding it. <br><br>Simply put, an institution given unlimited power to print and control money will eventually be stupid enough to use it, which then self-destructs. It also leads to economic inequality through inflation and other means. Even if the gold standard is sub-optimal economically, it at least can (in the right circumstances) provide a hard limit against such abuses.<br><br>As for the lack of a unifying idea to prompt revolution mentioned by another comment, I'd heartily disagree. We have two, in fact, at least. Both are prominent among the young, who will after all be the vanguard of any revolution and need not be anywhere near a majority to be big enough (see the Bolsheviks, for instance). The first is the original American model of limited government and states' rights (Ron Paul-style libertarianism), which millions of Americans believe is the sole true interpretation of the Constitution. <br><br>The second is what might be called "Communism 2.0" or new socialism; a huge swath of the country believes Communism/Socialism is a good idea that's merely impractical, and that it has never honestly been tried. The "Stalin argument" doesn't work on them, because they take the Trotskyist view that he betrayed the revolution, as did many others. The USSR doesn't disillusion them like it did the old left, much like how the KKK doesn't shake my faith in Christianity, because I view it as a perversion of the system. Their hatred of capitalism, moreover, is palpable. Give them the right leader, the right manifesto, the right political environment, and they'll instantly mobilize by the millions as well.<br><br>And that right there is grounds enough for a revolution/civil war ala 1917 Russia. The old system collapses under pressure from all sides via a crisis of legitimacy. Some defend the old order, but most fall into a variety of ideological camps who think the right way to run the nation is something either very new or very old. Californian Reds (or maybe Pinks) demand revolutionary change in DC, while Iowan Whites (or Red/White/Blues, sure) demand it be abolished altogether and left a smoldering ruin. Either swathes of the country break away into independent nations, or there is war. I think it's virtually inevitable.<br><br>Sorry for the long post; it's an interesting thought exercise! Also, I got my copy of After Oil 3!<br><br><a href=#c770167735777094352 title="comment permalink">5/27/15, 11:05 PM</a><br><br>

It involves active civil disobedience of nonsensical mandates. As an example, recently those 'in control' decided that rainwater and well water should be within their jurisdiction.<br><br>You are faced with a choice - comply (admit complicity to what has recently been made illegal), pay a fee, permit, registration, inspection, etc or just ignore those howling for your money and for you to do things as they wish. When private groups do this, it is termed criminal activity. When the majority of a governing group does this, it is termed a law or ordnance or other such non-descriptive nebulous term. In counties and cities, the vote on these things is rarely even announced or is often done in 'private session' of the authority.<br><br>My grandfather told me the only votes that count are those made by your silver or your feet. Truth is, he was very right in the scheme of things. These are the votes that count, because all those in control rely on us accepting their authority. At the same time, there are myriad more of us than there are of them - in short, they rely on compliance by edict. If people do not simply comply or if they loudly illustrate their non-compliance, then the 'authority' will pick and make an example. This increases their compliance to acceptable levels by using fear of similar hassles for others not in compliance.<br><br>But, when faced with massive non-compliance, the authority will reconsider its overreach - as has been seen in many times (littering is a great example). And this non-compliance should consist of leaving for an area free of these silly mandates - voting with your feet. We were all hunter-gatherers and embracing this is a sort of freedom. Alternatively, simply not abiding by the rules and doing as you wish and keeping your mouth shut negates their authority as well. <br><br>It is just that most people want to brag and love to talk, and authorities rely on this too, especially with respect to today's internet generation. Many cannot help but brag and crow in their search for anonymous validation - the exact behavior the authority relies on for policing.<br><br>One reaches a point where so much of what goes on is just silly or feels like junior high politics - because it actually is - that it needs to simply be ignored as background noise as you live your life. My meaning in using "ignoring things and moving on" is to move past being overly concerned with what those in authority decree, as most of it simply cannot be enforced on an unwilling populace. And we all know where things are headed at this point, so abetting a broken system feels like a supreme waste of time.<br><br><a href=#c3551232569101306157 title="comment permalink">5/28/15, 7:56 AM</a><br><br>

California has talked quite seriously about splitting up into more than one state. Why would that even be happening if things were going well? In the Era of Response I would think it highly likely for more autonomous regions to take the place of one single unified country leading to a whole host of other possible outcomes.

As compared to any other time in our history we have a very large percentage of the the population dependent on this distribution, from the snap cards on the bottom of the wealth pyramid to the social security and pension crowd in the center and the financial and government contracting elite at the top. No matter how ridiculous or illigitimate the existing elites are, they will not be seriously challanged until the wealth pump stops. The denial and of the elites may of course play in to this as the wealth pump could be kept running a tad longer if they were more realistic. But I think the spectre of the masses without thier tribute is truly scary to those in power, and motivates nearly every decision no matter how clueless the outcome. They will keep the money spigot on as long as they can, even when it passes the point of no return and makes the inevitable crash down the next stair rung of collapse much further and harder than it would have otherwise been. <br><br>So though even though politics are important, the pathway to the age of impact and beyond will be paved by financial and currency collapse.<br><br><a href=#c1156164515026244 title="comment permalink">5/28/15, 8:59 AM</a><br><br>

But they were less severe and the resulting recessions only lasted for a period of a year or two at most, while the Great Depression went on and on and on and on because the effort the government expended to try to cure it were continually making it worse. Treating the patient with leeches, as it were. <br><br>And you go on to make one of the silliest errors in all economic reasoning - THE ACTUAL QUANTITY OF MONEY IN THE MONEY SUPPLY IS IRRELEVANT. If the entire US economy had $1 as its total supply, everything would still be fine! There would be the issuance of $.0000000000000000001 coins; $.000000000000000001 coins, and so on. Obviously these numbers are awkward for human reasoning, which is why 1 ounce of gold being worth $20 was a reasonable supply of currency when people were still using 1/2 and 1/4 cent pieces.<br><br>If capital increases while the money supply stays the same - or increases at a slower pace - then prices go down! This is a GOOD thing! Prices are SUPPOSED to go down! When prices go down, wages purchase more goods and services! When prices go down, investments and savings rise in purchasing power. This is SUPPOSED to happen in a healthy economy. Find me a Keynesian terrified of deflation and I'll find you somebody still using a $500 modem to transfer data 2600 baud... right? <br><br>The reason that gold needs to be money is because it's good at BEING money. Steel is good at being railroad track; bamboo is bad at being railroad track. The actual physical properties of the metal itself are what makes it good substrate for being money. It's fungible; divisible down to the atom; and remains chemically stable even at the bottom of the ocean. It's rare but not so rare that we have to deal with the uncomfortably large numbers mentioned above in order to make daily transactions. How much can be extracted from Earth's crust and refined is statistically predictable and we won't see wild shifts in the overall supply. And, first and foremost of importance - the government and banks can't print it and hand it to themselves.<br><br>Money is a technology, and like all technologies it must have a material basis. As a technology, it supports a very specific purpose in human ecology - it allows for a more efficient division of labor than any other technology invented to date. And the quantity needed to effectively be money has already been raised out of the ground, refined, and carefully stored for future generations. Precious metals are money, and that's a technology that no economic shenanigans (gold price rigging is worse than LIBOR according to Germany's retired finance minister) or government has been able to entirely suppress.<br><br><a href=#c3070093163749241764 title="comment permalink">5/28/15, 9:14 AM</a><br><br>

Setting the scene: prices for standard goods under the gold standard were roughly the same in 1798 as in 1929, showing vacillations but also stability of value. Stability of value leads to tension between the creditors (hard money) and debtors (easy money). At that time-- as per Wizard of Oz--easy money people believed in silver. No one believed in paper, as the rules were believed to change with political winds or the courts bought off by the rich. What silly imaginations, I know!<br><br>Here's the thing: the gold standard doesn't really contain anything. Fantastic, nation-ending credit booms happen with great regularity on the gold standard, France being one example, but the land boom of the US frontier in 1830s being another. Didn't stop the Tulip Mania or the 1920's Florida land boom. Why? Because speculation runs on CREDIT. Credit runs on BELIEF. Sure, there's a little salt in the vault to fall back on, but credit, in 1770, in 1920, in 1999, and now, runs the whole thing. Almost all “money” is credit and always has been. So lack of gold cannot be the problem if they had booms and cured booms for 500 years until then. <br><br>So what gives? In 1922 there was a similar reckless credit boom in the stock market which similarly popped. Coolidge did nothing despite his Treasury Commerce--none other than Herbert Hoover--had billionaires up and down his office looking for favors and bailouts from the taxpayers. Coolidge told them they got themselves into the mess, they could get themselves out. (And for you foreigners, note there is no legal foundation for the US to ever interfere in the economy, prohibited by Amendment 10, and/or in free contracts per Article 1,Sec 10). Now that was a different season in the economy and market from 1929, but Coolidge was right and Hoover was wrong. The Billionaires liquidated, the bad debts were eaten and written off, and the economy restabilized—in a YEAR. On a gold standard. So...discuss?<br><br>Back to 1930, the billionaires did not want to see the debts--that is, what they were owed, that is, their paper wealth-- go down. Sure the people would take a hit in Depressions as happens, but guess what? While the poor get a little poorer, the rich get a LOT poorer. Income disparity levels out, the debt level drops, and the economy restarts. Rogoff and Rinehart have a whole book on how economies never recover with high debt loads. But how to write off the debts of the rich without getting poorer? One way, tried to disaster in many nations, was to water down the currency. This is what FDR did by devaluing gold from $20.67 to $35/oz --illegally since the dollar is tied to silver (not gold) in the Constitution by weight not value, and illegally because he cancelled all the "gold-deliver" clauses private individuals had made between themselves. <br><br>Upshot? The debts that would have never been paid to the wealthy but defaulted and written off--making the rich FAR poorer, were instead pooled and paid by EVERY CITIZEN via a devaluation of the currency. So the people, of course, got to pay the losses of the wealthy in what you might call a creditor bailout. Sound familiar? <br><br>But even 10 years later the economy did NOT recover, ever. Sound familiar? In 1939, Morganthau admitted nothing they tried--no project, no printing, nothing, had worked. The rich did not write off their debts, the debt load still crippled the economy, and the income disparity did not decline so the poor still had no money to buy with. Even in 1949 and the 1950's they expected and feared the US would fall back and continue the Depression. They didn't--but only because they had blown up every other factory on planet earth, leaving the US as the only viable workshop.<br><br><a href=#c2787793154348719501 title="comment permalink">5/28/15, 9:38 AM</a><br><br>

It seems to me that what will decide the outcome are simply the choices we each make in our daily lives. As Americans there is an added weight to the choices we make. Choosing to walk and talk alternatives to greedy consumerism and shoddy lowest common denominator entertainments remains the path. If in fact we are closing in on a time of consequences, as many of us sense, it is all the more important that we do not throw in the towel and give up on working for the lesser of the two evils. It is not much but it is real and it is worth pursuing.<br><br>I took up a small part of what this might look like in<a href=http://mindfulecology.com/2015/05/tomorrow-in-our-land/ rel=nofollow> Tomorrow in our Land</a>.

And, oh my, how the world hasn't changed. <br><br>One of the central characters is Augustus Melmotte. And does Melmotte ever remind me of Bernie Madoff, that is, a financier of great wealth and experience and acumen, who lives in the world financial capital of the time (London). <br><br>Though there are rumours that Melmotte is a low-down swindler that left people on the mainland high and dry, and though some in England see his true nature clearly enough, in Victorian London there seems no end of credulous people willing to give Melmotte money. <br><br>Just don't ask Melmotte any questions. NO questions. Don't ask about documentation because you see, nowadays, in these modern 19th century times, transactions aren't done with cheques and receipts and pen-strokes but rather merely with the exchange of a few words and a nod. Don't ask about your duties as the director of a rail company start-up, don't ask about company operations and transactions, what's the problem, what's your concern, Melmotte is the great man of affairs, Melmotte will handle it. <br><br>And DON'T ask him about your money. Melmotte flies at too high an altitude, he has no time. <br><br>Don't ask because, like Madoff, Melmotte demands unquestioning trust and if you dare, he would say to you, who knows more about these matters, you or him? And, if you persist in questioning, you would be invited to get gone. Sound familiar? <br><br>Our modern day CEOs, these great men of affairs, these men of action, have no patience for history, history being the province of absent minded professors that don't deal in down to earth reality. <br><br>But our great men are wrong, surely, that's exactly what the professors of history deal in. And if academics do the work honestly and provide fair-minded depictions, even if not a complete picture, we get pictures complete enough to be useful and instructive in the real world. <br><br>And so, history being ignored by our great men, history being considered by most of us ordinary folk to be boring and irrelevant, history inevitably repeats, if not exactly, at least close enough. <br><br>If Trollope hadn't seen men like Madoff walking around the London of his time then he must have gotten into steam-punk time machine and visited our own era. Given the realism of Trollope's depiction and the unlikelihood of time machines...<br><br>JMG, the point of the foregoing of course, is that your discussion of what happened in the past would be met with give-me-strength sighs especially in the offices of the high and mighty. You see, they'll say they don't have time to waste on nonsense. <br><br>So, especially because the high and mighty don't listen, because those who have the most ability to change the course of events are oblivious to what history tells us is the likely shape of the future, what went before will come again.<br><br><a href=#c941654702962379854 title="comment permalink">5/28/15, 10:29 AM</a><br><br>

They assumed 1 breadwinner per family, usually the adult male. They also assumed that kids over the age of about 10 could be trusted to more-or-less manage themselves during the day. Of course, those weren't universally true--but they were common enough that the program could be built with those assumptions, and allow for tweaking for rare exceptions.<br><br>Today, the issue of childcare clashes hard with any attempt to provide jobs to the poorest Americans. Single parents, mostly women, don't have the network of family and neighbors that commonly existed in the 30's, who would tend children while someone worked. Also, as the wealthy have fewer children and communities have fractured, acceptable standards for childcare have changed--leaving a 12-year-old in charge of two toddlers is no longer acceptable, and parents can be arrested for simply letting their preteen children walk to a local park alone.<br><br>These are not insurmountable problems, but addressing it would require giving up the notion that single parents, especially mothers, are shameful leeches on society's valuable resources, which stymies any attempt to fix widespread unemployment and poverty problems.<br><br><a href=#c2414613072715343144 title="comment permalink">5/28/15, 11:36 AM</a><br><br>

Perhaps this is because the Revolution of 1776 was so unusual, as far as revolutions go. It was led by an extraordinary group of people who eventually coalesced around clear goals for the revolution. Even more important, in my opinion, it wasn't a complete revolution in the sense that the colonial legislatures had already existed for almost 150 years and continued as functional authority. It wasn't overthrowing an ancient way of life like the French Revolution. <br>I think this is an important conversation to have with hot headed people who want a revolution first and ask questions later. When I read or hear some of the reckless things they say on talk radio, for instance, I want to make this distinction. I want to say to them, "If you really want this, be aware of how lucky we were the first time."<br><br><br>"The vast majority of revolutions have established governments that were far more abusive than the ones they replaced. The exceptions have generally been those that brought about a social upheaval without wrecking the political system.."<br><br>I'm pulling for Plan B, keeping the political system intact.<br><br>In the book "American Nations," by Colin Woodard, he describes North America as eleven regional "nations" based on history, culture, and geography. The most interesting point, I think, is the persistence of these regional cultures even in a time when so much of the population is itinerant. He explains that once the imprint of a culture is in place, the incoming people tend to absorb it, either consciously or unconsciously, because they want to fit in. I can see this process even on a town by town basis, the way towns and cities can retain certain attitudes long after the original citizens are replaced.<br>As energy becomes more expensive and the idea of a "small world" becomes obsolete, this regional view of North America gets more interesting. Perhaps there is hope for a new map 100 years from now, a sort of velvet revolution and then a confederation of regions?<br><br><a href=#c6627880804401876644 title="comment permalink">5/28/15, 12:04 PM</a><br><br>

I've been enjoying this series so far. It is a mordantly humorous thing to observe that at the time I'm writing this, President Obama is taking and responding on Twitter to questions about climate change. Let's hope he still has some semblance of respect for the truth. Keeping Florida in mind, I wonder how long people can keep their fingers in their ears and pretend to not hear the truth when climate change has ceased to knock politely on America's collective door, and is in the process of huffing and puffing. Historically unprecedented flooding in Texas? Check. Devastating drought in California? Check. Timid stirrings of recognition of global weirding in the mainstream media? Sometimes check. I believe that the nonresponses that have gotten people through so far are now being strained to the utmost limits of credulity. Strap in, ladies and gentlemen.

Direct employment programs and meaningful banking reforms."<br><br>Kris, (and JMG)<br><br>I used to also feel that way but no longer do. I think that by the time politicians get into a position of being able to make positive changes, they are either already corrupted and/or controlled by their 'supporters'. Most likely they were sorted out long before and never made that final leap. When Obama refers to people as 'folks', I wince, because I think he is all about helping the Warren Buffets and Jamie Dimon's of the world. Is he evil? Probably not, but by now he simply does not know any better. Deliberate change is either not possible due to the influence of the powerful, or else by this stage he no longer 'groks' much of anything. We have watched him turn grey and irrelevent. He appears incompetent. His apparent succesors are even worse.<br><br>I grew up on stories of The Great Depression. My Dad, long since gone, grew up in rural Minnesota. As he would often say, "we always had lots to eat, we just didn't have any money". They lived on a 1/2 acre in a town of 700, and did just fine by growing a huge garden, raising a couple of pigs, chickens, and always had fish to eat. They bred racoons for their pelts and made cash that way. He and my Grampa got work in the Twin Cities in a slaughter house. They got by and then WW2 broke out and the kids were up and away.<br><br>Those stories had a profound effect on me. I always paid my modest homes off as soon as I could, kept years of fire wood on hand, and when my own periods of recession caused unemployment hit we too had chickens, a huge garden, and for a few years I even raised rabbits for food. This summer I turn 60, firmly entrenched in a very rural byway on Vancouver Island. I spent the morning doing a few chores, and hand watered my 146 hills of different potato varieties. This year we will choose the stock we like best....probably fingerlings and russets. We are processing our years supply of broilers next week, and will start filling the freezer with salmon in July, deer or elk in the fall, and veggies until October. The eggs pay for feed and the chores keep us fit and outside. My kids are working and doing well, so this is the autumn of my life. The fall has always been my favourite season.<br><br>What I have learned is that the rich and powerful do not live better than my family. It would be impossible to do so. When they start losing their fortunes I will be pleased enough. Now, back outside to finish roofing a shed.<br><br><a href=#c7942406921074164329 title="comment permalink">5/28/15, 12:19 PM</a><br><br>

That this normally amounts to doing more of whatever made the crisis happen in the first place, and thus reliably makes things worse is just one of the little ironies history has to offer."<br><br>@Cherokee Organics asks, "I wonder what the next bubble will be?"<br><br>A particular area of interest of mine is the large-scale "renewable" energy projects being lavishly promoted as a "solution" to the problem of fossil fuels. Proposals are regularly published in which we ”replace” fossil fuels with mega renewables (particularly solar and wind), and this transition to "clean" energy will make moot our dual problems of carbon pollution and fossil fuel depletion. (I use quotes liberally here to announce the questionable veracity of the terms being used.)<br><br>Large scale solar and wind power plants look really, really good on paper: zero cost of fuel, zero carbon pollution, and oh yes they are pretty, especially if you show them in fields full of daisies and/or cows. Various hypothetical, complex, yet vague-on-the-details schemes claim to show that we can power industrial civilization 100% with these guilt-free sources of energy.<br><br>Problem is, building an entirely new energy infrastructure based on intermittent, distributed energy sources is an enormously complex, expensive, and energy-intensive prospect. These proposals amount to "doing more of whatever made the crisis happen in the first place" as you say. The pursuit of a "clean energy revolution" that will enable millions in North America, Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, etc. to maintain a highly energy-intensive standard of living is an unrealistic task that will likely result in using up lots and lots of increasingly scarce high-quality fossil fuels, and producing copious amounts of carbon and other pollution in the process.<br><br>No matter, this "renewable" energy fantasy is extremely attractive to liberal elites and environmentalists, and it also promises to keep the rabble silent about the real issue—which is that the imperative for growth in a capitalist system makes that system utterly unsustainable.<br><br>But this "clean energy revolution" must be funded somehow, and preferably not via the public purse. Investors big and small must be convinced that "clean energy" is the Next Big Thing and so is the best place for the Smart Money to be. The fossil fuel divestment campaign is a visible strategy to redirect investors from fossil fuels to "renewable" development. There are other examples just a googling away.<br><br>So here's my prediction for the next bubble: investing in schemes for large-scale renewable energy, from solar and wind farms to battery and liquid fuels vaporware. Massive amounts of non-money will be channeled towards building increasingly ambitious and complex systems that we hope and pray will keep the party going for a few more years. <br><br>But most of this "money" will be wasted in pursuit of the equivalent of perpetual motion machines, and we will have squandered a decade or two and trillions which could have been spent transitioning humanity to low-energy lifeways.<br><br><a href=#c4753975431647094287 title="comment permalink">5/28/15, 12:57 PM</a><br><br>

It’s a shame my life hasn’t given me as much opportunity to participate in these conversations recently, but I definitely wanted to contribute before this brief series had concluded. You’ve pointed out a few times the attempts by states like Florida, North Carolina, and Kansas to silence the discussion on climate change and actually pass through legislation that prevents constructive action. However, there are elements to the climate change discussion and its interplay with American politics that still confuse me. Yes, on a local level there are a few governments that are doing exactly what you’re describing, but overall large scale political, corporate, and academic institutions have at least in theory embraced climate change and are claiming to be responding to it. Most of that includes things like the president spending 2 minutes discussing the gravity of climate change and the necessity of constructive responses to it and 20 minutes cheerleading the economy and singing the praises of the petroleum industry (as happened in the most recent State of the Union address). The attitude and behavior of the elites regarding climate change is mostly a classic “age of response” style scramble, with the federal government and international think tanks pouring resources and effort into mitigating the effects of climate change in every conceivable manner except for the ones that would actually put a dent in the problem. Climate change denial exists, and in some regions they still have political sway, but for the most part they’ve been relegated to the fringes of society.<br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, I’m seeing a completely opposite response to the equally dire issues posed by the industrial agriculture system. Discussing soil ecology and organic agriculture, opposing industrial pesticides, pointing out collapses in insect and wild plant biodiversity, questioning the ethics of engineering plants that can withstand more potent weedkillers, or talking about the pitfalls of large scale industrial monoculture and agriculture ill-suited to local ecosystems is something politicians and academics have taken the exact opposite stance on. Professors of Ecology and sustainable development I discussed these issues what to do about them in college as recently as five years ago have in less than five years taken a full swing in the opposite direction, prominent environmental activists and journals and media sources that focused dominantly on these problems and even the Quaker meeting I used to attend (and they were among the most environmentally proactive groups I ever participated in) have begun to shame and ridicule anyone who takes issue with industrial agriculture or who supports alternatives to it, and big name scientists and popular science newsletters have begun to shove critics of the industrial food system and supporters of organic growing, local food, permaculture and the like into the same fringe as climate change deniers and creationists. And with many friends who have been avid environmentalists as long as I’ve known them, climate change has become the only problem acceptable to discuss. The claim is usually that the science has changed, but reading the articles I find in peer reviewed journals, it looks like those these issues still have at least as much scientific backing as climate change (unless an issue at stake has gone completely unstudied due to lack of funding). <br><br>What shoved these issues into such different ends of the cycle of response you’ve been discussing here? Keeping up on the news, I don’t see one impact hitting faster or harder than the other. In fact they seem to be hitting at about the same pace and often working in tandem with each other. So why would governments and institutions be doing their best to “look busy” when it comes to one issue, while participating in the large scale shaming of anyone concerned about the other issue?<br><br><a href=#c3070599059224098007 title="comment permalink">5/28/15, 1:24 PM</a><br><br>

If I had the spare time and a book contract, it would be entertaining, and possibly useful, to take two dozen or so examples -- including the two you mentioned -- and show how those fit the same pattern. <br><br>Fudoshin, that sounds like a good start. Are you making connections with neighbors, friends, community groups, etc. that will make it easier for you to market your skills once that needs to happen locally? <br><br>Repent, how long have you been working on your gardening skills? As I've mentioned in previous posts, it takes a good five years of hard work to get good at it. If you have friends who are further along the curve, btw, their advice can help. <br><br>Kutamun, good. As long as the privileged classes continue using green this and eco-that as status symbols, nothing but one-upsmanship will come of their antics -- certainly nothing that will keep Ragnar at bay. <br><br>Steve, no, as I noted in response to an earlier comment, Roosevelt took the US off an actual gold standard -- one in which currency could be exchanged for gold at any time by anyone -- and put it on a notional gold standard, in which US citizens weren't allowed to own gold at all, gold coins and gold certificates were removed from circulation, and the ability of foreign nationals to cash in their US holdings for gold was subject to government whim. That wasn't just a devaluation, it was a complete redefinition of the meaning of money, and freed up the US government to run up huge debts in the war years, in perfect confidence that the sort of balance-of-payments run on gold that had kept government debt in check up to that time would not happen to the US. <br><br>Derv, oddly enough, I'm not arguing either -- I agree that the current system of unlimited fiat money expansion is a cause of massive problems now. I'd suggest that it was the right move at a time when problems with the money supply were a major hindrance to what would otherwise have been a rapid expansion in the real economy of goods and services; it's just that we no longer live in a time when that's a possibility, because the fossil fuel and other resources that made that possible in the early 20th century aren't there any more. Thus finding a way to let the money supply contract at roughly the same pace as the real economy is one of the major needs of our time. More on this as we proceed!<br><br>Trog, hmm! It's been too long since I've read Bradbury, clearly; I don't remember that at all. It's a good metaphor, though. <br><br>Kristofv, they weren't tried in 2008 for the same reason that the establishment fought so hard against trying them in 1929: limits on the banking industry require limiting the earnings of bank CEOs and financial swindlers generally, and direct employment programs push up wages by decreasing what used to be called the reserve army of the unemployed. We'll probably see them again, but it'll be a few years yet. <br><br>Ben, I hope you're right.

It's on the level of citizen groups, starting on a local level, who are willing to discard the failed "consensus" gimmicks that have crippled political activism since the 1980s and go back to the old, robust, and effective methods of democratic organization. You won't get your local government to listen until and unless you can show them organized citizens who back your viewpoint and can make trouble in the next election, and you can't do that until and unless you help citizens empower themselves with the tools of the trade of representative democracy.

I'd be very interested to hear your take on that matter as it has been on my mind of late.<br><br>It is a good question because there certainly has to be another bubble once the fracking bubble pops. My guess for what it is worth is that despite the recent memories of the very unpleasant pop of the housing bubble, housing will be the next big thing. One of the interesting side effects if that is the case, is that the level of dissonance will rise in the population.<br><br>There really is no winning strategy in the policies that are being pursued - it's a mess. Now that I believe that I've finally grasped the final pieces of the economic picture and can form a coherent viewpoint that covers the entire system whilst fitting the facts on the ground, I must say that I'm quite staggered at the implications and from hindsight I now wonder why I couldn't see it before. It is quite a majestic system really, but it has such a short shelf life.<br><br>For what it is worth, I don't believe that the economic arrangements in place were engineered to function in the way that they currently do. I reckon that many chunks of the puzzle were put in place with good intentions and then subverted to provide band aids for other parts of the system that were failing. And also band aids were deliberately placed on systems that were both subversive and subverted.<br><br>The real problem is that the US is applying the same sorts of arrangements to your military which is the real source of US power because the same type of people are pulling on the levers, using the tools that they are familiar with.<br><br>I'll tell you a little story and for obvious reasons I can't mention names, but when I was at the big end of town I had to regularly report to the Board. One memorable Board was comprised of directors from entirely sales backgrounds. So every month they'd raise spurious invoices to customers because bonuses were paid to the sales guys and directors based on sales targets (not on collections as per my ignored advice). Credits were raised the following month to cover those invoices. So every month the fiction would get slightly larger, as of course it had to. To their credit, every now and then they'd suffer a correction for a month. At the Board meeting I'd raise this engaging practice as an issue and was told firmly that, no the sales were real - and the belief in the directors eyes was complete. It was pretty awesome to witness. And whilst I don't believe that such a situation is entirely true of your governance over in the US a strong case could be made... On a positive note, the structures in place are quite good, in fact they are very good, it is just unfortunate that the hard choices are being put off in favour of games and those games are slowly consuming your social, political, military and physical capital.<br><br>cont...<br><br><a href=#c513508177844389302 title="comment permalink">5/28/15, 5:05 PM</a><br><br>

Renewables are great, but they're definitely not a replacement for either coal or gas. Nuclear to my mind should not be on the table because the waste issue has not ever been resolved in the real world.<br><br>For what it is worth, the additional funds more or less have to be poured into financial assets - or increase the value of existing infrastructure assets.

This shouldn't surprise anyone too much. Obama began as a Chicago machine politician with a gift of inspiring speech, he married a awesomely brilliant wife, and the two of them figured out how to crowd-source their political campaign and what rhetoric would best enhance all that. The rsst, as they say, follows naturally ...<br><br>Also, I have wondered (as a writer of fiction wonders) through quite a few terms of inept presidents now, whether every new president, early on in his first term, gets a visitor escorted into the Oval Office by his Secret Service detail. I imagine the Secret Service saying something like this: "Mr. President, let us introduce you to Mr. Smith, the Messenger. Remember his face and voice, so you can always recognize him. You are the most powerful person on the planet, but now and then we will escort Mr. Smith into your office and leave you alone with him. He works for the same people for whom we, your entire Secret Service, actually work. When he shows up, heed his words. If you do not, there will be trouble for you. The first time you do not heed his words, your wife and children will become seriously ill, but will recover in precisely seventeen days. The second time, they will not ever recover fully. The third time it will be you who will not ever recover fully. -- Also, do not try to discover who sends the Messenger to you. He does not come from one person, or even from one group of persons who share the same agenda. That would be too simple. -- If you ever do come close to discovering this, it is we, your own Secret Service, who will kill you, and your wife and children with you." <br><br>This is the stuff of fiction, I have no doubt. It makes fictional characters out of nodes in a system, and it simplifies that system enormously. But if The Messenger is a fiction and the people he works for are a fiction, the system is real. (Much the same system constrained the actions of the later Roman Emperors.) And a system like that would be enough to give any president gray hair, and to render him oddly inept at times. <br><br>It is even imaginable that a highly effective system of this sort would eventually give a sitting president, so severely constrained in office, a sop for his own sense of limited manhood by providing him with effective means and sufficient reasons to kill as many far-away people as he needed in order to feel better about himself.

The counterculture, those trying to "collapse early and avoid the rush," are earnestly trying to initiate an era of response already... but rational questioning of the aspects of society that obviously aren't working is often accompanied by dogmatic belief in all sorts of dubious propositions, many of which have been covered here before. I've found myself fielding quite a bit of this lately, out here in California. For instance, a wall-mounted Tesla battery pack is no panacea, but if one believes that somebody's ginned-up perpetual motion machine is a superior alternative, then one is sailing in quite shallow waters! Just last night, I also received a somewhat unwelcome invitation to a UFO conference in the desert. The assumption was, I suppose, that since I was a rather ardent Star Trek fan as a youth, then I must naturally believe that our space brothers are going to descend from on high with all the answers!<br><br>An exodus from California would surely put a psychological dent in these movements, but I can't help but think that the state has a few tricks left to keep the dream alive for another business cycle or two. For instance, if marijuana is legalized here next year, I expect even more flim-flammers and funny money to be sloshing around that industry. The pot bubble will likely succeed the Web 2.0 bubble. There's also the matter of the influx of wealthy Asian expatriates here, and it's too soon to tell what role they will play. California is already essentially a one-party state, so I do worry about the Democrats becoming too cozy with the Chinese Communist party. On the other hand, much of this state was built on the backs of exploited Chinese labor, so it is thoroughly unwise to be xenophobic.<br><br>All in all, I feel that being able to communicate earnestly with all kinds of people will be an important survival skill, and this leads me to avoid committing to any of the strange, strident dogmas that seem to be arising in the early stages of attempted response to crisis. I know that you, JMG, have advised me to leave California before, but my immmediate ancestors helped turn this place into what it is, so I feel somewhat duty-bound to see it through. At the very least, it'll give me something interesting to write about.<br><br><a href=#c227204354724754616 title="comment permalink">5/28/15, 6:29 PM</a><br><br>

Still, it won't wash. You've got your economic history wrong -- if you think depressions under the gold standard were short and mild, I'd encourage you just for starters to look up the Long Depression of 1873-1879 -- a good book on the social history of Gilded Age America will give you some sense of just how brutal that was. If you're going to accuse me of making a simplistic mistake, it would help if you bothered to take the time to notice what I was actually saying -- not the mere size of the money supply, but the rate of change of the money supply relative to changes in the production of nonfinancial goods and services, is the thing that drives inflation, recession, or relative stability, as I pointed out. Finally, shouting "Gold is good for money!" is simply handwaving; a gold-based currency, like every other kind of currency, benefits some people at the expense of others, and under some circumstances can cause serious economic disruptions. <br><br>Sven, I certainly don't agree with Steele's proposed solution, but I thought it was interesting that his diagnosis was so familiar. <br><br>Professor D., you're conflating several different factors here. Again, what Roosevelt did wasn't simply a devaluation -- he changed US currency from an actual gold standard, in which currency could be converted to gold on demand, to a purely notional gold currency, where US citizens couldn't own gold at all and foreign investors could be prevented by government order from taking their holdings home in gold. That stopped the credit crisis that had very nearly driven the US to collapse in 1932 and 1933. That his actions didn't put an end to structural unemployment is another matter; structural unemployment is inherent in industrial economies, due to the effects of automation, and the only situations in which it hasn't been a massive problem have been when a permanent war economy could be used to employ vast numbers of people in economically unproductive roles. It's a source of wry amusement to me that opponents of Roosevelt always want to talk about 1938 and never, but never, want to talk about 1933...<br><br>Ecologist, nicely phrased. <br><br>Roger, excellent!

It's one of the ways that democratic eras come to an end. <br><br>Other Tom, I've been discussing for some time the likelihood that the US could come apart more or less peacefully, probably by way of a constitutional convention that passed an amendment either dissolving the constitution entirely or giving states the right to opt out. I'm not cheerleading the idea, mind you, but I think it's going to appeal to a lot of people. <br><br>Alexander, true enough -- it's going to be a heck of wild ride. <br><br>Erik, yes, it's a standard Keynsian fix. Ultimately, the problems with money will be solved <a href=../../2014/11/dark-age-america-hoard-of-nibelungs.html rel=nofollow>by the abandonment of money</a> that's standard in dark age societies. <br><br>Eric, interesting that you're seeing that. I suspect that a lot of it is that there are a great many people whose love for the environment stops short of changing their own lifestyles, and the thought of actually having to let go of strawberries in December and coffee from halfway around the planet is too much for them to bear. Climate change is a great way to cling to the mantle of Green-ness while still remaining a faithful believer in the Church of Consumerism, after all. <br><br>Ed-M, don't assume that the Bernays of the world are the only people practicing malefic magic in the current situation -- or that the others are practicing it for the benefit of the existing order. That is to say, I think you're quite wrong, and that events may surprise the stuffing out of you. <br><br>Cherokee, I've been to a few no-business meetings, and I'd rather have dental surgery with a brace and bit and no anesthetic.

As for your example, quite the contrary, such a situation is entirely true of governance here in the US. <br><br>Matthew, we don't have a monarchy yet, so how on earth would we get from there to a republic? First we have to get the charismatic demagogues and warband leaders, then the collapse into dissolution from which a feudal order emerges, then the transition to monarchy, then the republic, which turns into a kleptocracy and the wheel spins again...<br><br>Robert, colorful, but utterly unnecessary. Imagine instead that as people rise through the political sphere, from local to state to national, different power centers within the broad US elite class choose to support them, or not. Those who further one or another power center's agenda get tapped for funding and organized support, those who don't remain on the outside looking in. By the time you get within reach of the presidency, everyone who might conceivably be a threat to the system has long since been filtered out, and we get a succession of smiling sock puppets whose policies differ from one another so little that a microscope can barely find the gaps. <br><br>Cathy, oh, I think that if there was a 5% electoral turnout, they'd still make sweeping claims about democracy -- not least because vote fraud is as American as apple pie, and a good many of the absent 95% would have ballots cast in their names anyway.<br><br><a href=#c2656862839698123407 title="comment permalink">5/28/15, 9:01 PM</a><br><br>

The thing I don't think my more gold-buggish readers get is that saying that going off the gold standard was necessary in 1933 does not mean that going onto it again would be a bad idea in 2020.

As for recessions being good, there again, they're good for some people and very bad for others.

Problem with gold is it is in the same category as discussing religion or politics. People have strong opinions, both pro and con, and once you bump into them they usurp the discussion... <br><br>To answer your questions to me, if the "new" money was channeled into the general populations, you'd see significant inflation; since the general pop spends most of their money rather than hoarding it. And the reason to move individual's money into the financial sector is several fold: the financial sector can be manipulated and made to appear to be expanding, and it is easier to confiscate/control too (if you believe our leaders would contemplate such a move). Although I am not clear where you are leading. Perhaps you could spell it out for those of us (myself included) who can't see where your path is heading.<br><br>My point in my first post to JMG wasn't about gold really (I only mention gold because it was a factor in foreign exchange settlements of that day and had to be taken into account). But gold really is a "four letter word" it seems, once you mention it, that is all some people hear.<br><br>The more important point is that FDR's solution was not all that different than the solutions used in the dot com bubble and the RE bubble which followed. Slight differences as to who and how the new money was distributed, but none of them produced the desired results. If anything they are becoming less and less effective at producing any results which can be dressed up and sold as a successful outcome.<br><br>Perhaps not earth-shaking news, but if correct it means the underlying problem has been with us for quite a bit longer than many people believe. And that what passes for "the good old days" when we did not have this problem (the 20's, 50's, 60's, or later) really were not examples of an economy which worked. In fact, there is probably no one alive today who has experienced an economy which did not have the current problem, in some form or another.<br><br>Just something to ponder when thinking about how one would like the economy to work.

Last week I was too busy to jump in, but when you said Russia was likely to be giving a subtle shove to America toward its date with reality, I agreed that it would not be surprising. And others noted that the shove was quite public, which surprised me, but the authorities might have some reason for letting that happen, such as discrediting Russia.<br><br>I love Russia, but it would be foolish to underestimate them. I suspect the tactics they will employ to the best effect are those our authorities cannot bring to light without uncovering damning evidence of their own crimes. One case of this we have already seen was the microwaving of the Moscow Embassy, which the authorities could not protest without jeopardizing the uses they were already making, with plans for more, of those same frequencies and field strengths.

We need a society - we are communal, mostly. What I did was to view money purely as a requirement, a necessary evil. What you DO with the money is what differentiates (IMHO). For me and mine, it goes to said farm where much of what we use is cast-off (old tin, old lumber, pallet lumber, tires, etc.) from cities. It doesn't have to be pretty - it has to work with gravity or minimal energy inputs. You have to think lots smaller for the future(s). <br><br>We got 22 telephone poles and several thousand feet of netting for free - by hauling it off for free when they replaced a driving range. This was several thousand dollars of 'junk' that turns into a hawk-proof 2-acre chicken pen...<br><br>Yes - it takes money, but by choosing carefully, we have 40 very rural acres for $x0,000 and it got paid for fast since many cars sell for that much and we quit buying new cars... The goal is now to lower energy inputs by choosing systems of doing things that require less. Some fail and others work - the fun is in the doing.<br><br>The end result is that the need for cash drops, allowing you to collapse somewhat. Once farm income rises enough, you are there... or you collapse more, requiring less inputs... What's my downside? Well, I spend years with my kids doing stuff and I have a farm in the country... still looking for that downside.<br><br>If you continue to put your money into suburbia or other things that cannot 'give back', then it just vanishes. Like buying a new car - it is just a waste of money and resources. This eternal suburban 'money pit' is the root cause of a lot of poverty and misery. This is all voting with my feet and my wallet. <br><br>It is not for everyone, but my kids are in their 20's and they are all-in and support us, even the 2 that live in the city (they want to build micro-house on our creek). The fact is we cannot take all this 'stuff' with us on our final journey, so if you accumulate 'stuff', it shouldn't be for you anyway. Not against a little hedonism on occasion though!<br><br>If it was easy to do, then everyone would be doing it. You have to BELIEVE that your vision of the far future (or one of them) is probably right. Then you have to choose to believe in yourself in order to let go of where you are. That you and I are even conversing is most indicative...and sorry if I come off preachy, but I do feel passionately and believe in my visions.

It's easy to drop prices to undercut competitors but it's a lot harder to cut the established wages of an employee, most especially in a healthy labor market. You deride gold as an inert lump of metal, which, ironically, is exactly the reason why it's good for being money.<br><br>As a thought experiment let's say we go back to a gold standard tomorrow, let's be conservative and call it 20,000 / oz. Doing this isn't going to create more oil or get pulverized plastic out of the oceanic food chain. But it will blow up every bank, hedge fund, and the deficit spending embiggened government - the real rentier class. I find it odd that you accuse the gold standard of enriching rentiers, when they're currently in the business of printing money and handing it to themselves directly. <br><br>This discussion is more than academic and it's directly relevant to the topic at hand. In the era of response, it's going to be taken for granted that the old economic order has failed and can't be forced back onto the rails with any amount of state violence. When fiat currencies blow up people are going to turn to precious metals as stores of value, and I very much expect a money economy to be able to survive any convulsion in human affairs. The capital base may grow or shrink depending on external circumstances but money - gold - will remain valuable in all situations.<br><br><a href=#c5637311321327373284 title="comment permalink">5/29/15, 8:46 AM</a><br><br>

For instance, the fact that most of the monies of the QE programmes of the past and present (Europe and Japan and China currently) have been used by corporate entities to inflate their asset prices by stock buy-backs, dividends to stock holders, and rather large remuneration to corporate executives, rather than any investment in plant and infrastructure pursuant to new production; the fact that there is now a net decline in small business survival, never mind creation, in the U.S.A. for the first time in the history of the nation; the fact that corporate earnings of entities listed on the S&amp;P 500 have fallen by something like 13% year over year in April, but that stock prices continue to climb higher; the fact that "fracking" has a very short shelf-life for production, especially amid the reality of the majority of those involved never having positive cash flow.

I have been to a right wing mega church whose pastor ordered his thousands of worshippers to buy guns, that the time to go to declare war against liberals, who he said were agents of Satan, is coming soon. The thousands in attendance were growling and cackling like evil scientists, I kid you not, with some people there saying "the only good liberal is a dead liberal". The pastor, who stood on a stage bathed in blood red light with scarred shields and painted blood-tipped spears encircling the stage, said he is in contact with other churches across the country to coordinate the final war to rid America of liberalism. There were cops, even the county sheriff go to this church and they weren't there undercover, they were there shaking their fists red-faced with rage.<br><br>It's not about religion as much as making a violent and infinitely morally relative ideology holy by misuse of religion. This church said that liberal Christians are just as much as infidels as atheist liberals, and apparently just as deserving of being murdered en masse. <br><br>When the US collapses, the ISIS -like religious fanatics will make an attempt at armed insurrection. As surely as ISIS talks about its caliphate, the Christian Right is talking of their God given entitlement to hold Dominion over all the people's on Earth by any means necessary. They may fail or get swept up in some other revolution, but if this church and its thousands of members had their way today, hundreds of millions of Americans would be in death camps and all the victims' assets would be divided up as spoils of the holy war, giving another temporary reprieve from the full collapse of the US.<br><br> Remember that (R) Inhoffe demanded that Hurricane Sandy victims receive no federal help at all, but then demanded a short time later that OK constituents hit by tornadoes receive full help, that there is a difference, he wouldn't elaborate, but the difference is, Inhoffe hates blue states to the point of trying to deny help in a life or death situation for hundreds of thousands just because their state voted blue, but his good religious Right folk deserve everyone's help whether they want to or not, so Help Him God.<br><br><a href=#c6585969348227607794 title="comment permalink">5/29/15, 11:45 AM</a><br><br>

You and I are on the same wavelength. I only woke up to the situation we're in in the past couple years. Since then, my life has changed considerably. My mid-life crisis, I guess. I started with a garden. Four boxes terraced nicely, surrounded by railroad ties. Had great success with potatoes and tomatoes the first year, but everything else was hit or miss. I started composting. I added 2 small raised beds beside my entrance trellis to grow climbing beans, then 2 apple trees and a blood orange. We got a Vietnamese potbellied pig, who makes the best fertilizer you've ever seen.<br><br>Beginning of this year, we got 4 chickens. I have since built a very nice coop (I had a lot of experience in construction before going to law school). It sits in the pen I fenced off for the pig, which contains the little house I built for him. Then I converted another small portion of our yard outside the kitchen window into another planting bed. It's loaded with potatoes and getting ready for harvest. Then we added 4 more chickens and off-loaded one of the original 4 who turned out to be a rooster.<br><br>The past 2 weekends, I've been fencing off my main garden to keep the pig out. It's all good. We live in an 84 year old house in mid-town in a smallish college town. In the absence of a commute, I could live without a car. We have a great local produce shop within walking distance and I get grass-fed beef from a local producer, as well as venison which I get in trade for fish. <br><br>One other thing I did was buy 30 acres of hardwoods north of a river near here. That was to be my "doomstead" property and ultimately a place to hunt deer. I haven't done much with it due to my desire to get my main home fully "collapsed." Did I mention that last weekend, I put up an old-fashioned clothesline? Took maybe 90 minutes. The clothes dry in less time than it takes in the dryer! <br><br>The final cog in my plan is a family cottage we have on a beach an hour south of here. Been in the family since 1966 and now jointly owned by me and my sister and our spouses. I have a large legal seine net and I know how to use it. When I tell you we catch fish, I mean we CATCH fish. The whole family gets involved. Shrimp, mullet, flounder, trout, sheepshead, we get it all. And what we don't eat right away, I pressure-can and use those jars for lunch here at the office for the next month. All of this will be here for my kids after I'm gone. <br><br>In short, I'm doing as you are. Setting up a sustainable homestead step by step by step and loving every minute of it.<br><br><a href=#c2142343314691842537 title="comment permalink">5/29/15, 1:21 PM</a><br><br>

If you have a bag of South African gold Kruggerands and they may be worth thousands of dollars each, good luck buying the few staples you may need to tide you over. The issue is purely one of human psychology. We seek to park long term value in anything that we deem secure in a particular situation. This can often work very well, but in the collapse that I envision for the US, there will be no accessible border that we can easily cross to convert the gold to practical, usable denominations.<br>At the time that Nixon "took us off the gold standard" I was an undergraduate. There were heated discussions among students and some profs about the prudence of what Nixon had done. I made what I still consider a mature decision: "Money" is whatever a particular society decides that it is at any given time. It is, in all instances, an abstraction and is proved to be so when a complete "monetary" collapse occurs. But when the collapse does come, we as individuals and as a society, have to immediately begin work on the remedy and are essentially all in the same boat.<br>I have a friend and neighbor across the river who is a beekeeper and produces some beautiful amber honey.

As for lead into gold, good -- but that's actually based on late medieval and early modern misunderstandings of the alchemical tradition. European alchemists generally claimed to be able to turn mercury, not lead, into gold. <br><br>(Name I can't read), to understand what I meant when I referenced US claims about installing democracy in Iraq, you have to remember that since the beginning of our age of empire in 1898, Americans have had this persistent delusion that we could invade other countries, set up pseudo-American institutions there, and have the people of the country we've just flattened suddenly start thinking and acting like Americans and, not coincidentally, support whatever the US agenda happens to be. That's the "democracy" the US thinks it can export: not actual democracy (we don't have much of that left in the US these days), but the delusional simulacrum that's stuck in the heads of our senile elite. <br><br>As for sages and prophets, well, I suspect the sages and prophets you have in mind are rather different from the ones I tend to read and study, so we should probably leave that question alone for now. <br><br>YCS, no argument there. Given the way the British stripped India to the bare walls before walking away, it's done remarkably well since independence. <br><br>Patricia, "never underestimate Russia" is one of those basic maxims that needs to be brutally burned with a branding iron into the backsides of every politician with the least interest in global affairs. As far as I can see, the Russians are playing a very skilled game, and the US response has been embarrassingly clumsy. Talleyrand's famous quote comes to mind: "It is worse than a crime, it is a stupidity." <br><br>Brian, check out the net energy on OTEC sometime; it's negligible -- powering a society by OTEC is like trying to get rich by extracting gold from sea water. Sorry!<br><br>Fudoshin, thank you.

As long as you approach the thing with that in mind, you may well squeak by. <br><br>Denys, no question, it's got to start at an incredibly basic level -- by teaching and enforcing basic standards of behavior for group discussions. Old-fashioned deliberative bodies used to have one or more sergeants-at-arms, whose job was to pick up anyone who got disruptive, by the scruff of their neck if need be, and toss them out of the assembly.

Again, you need to go get some good books on 19th century US social history and pay attention to the real world. In the second half of the 19th century, under the gold standard, wages were forced down brutally to starvation levels, erasing any benefit gained from falling prices -- but the major factor in the mass impoverishment driven by the gold standard was the thing you don't mention, which is debt. <br><br>When a currency deflates, the people who owe money still have to pay back the same face value as before. If their wages go down -- and again, in the late 19th century, wages for the lower 2/3 or so did -- they get hammered, while the people who lent money prosper at their expense because they get the same face value when it's worth more. Thus deflation is an effective way to transfer wealth from borrowers to creditors. Of course there are other ways -- the fact that it's being done by other means doesn't make gold any less effective as a tool for the same purpose. And of course, as I pointed out <a href=../../2014/11/dark-age-america-hoard-of-nibelungs.html rel=nofollow>in an earlier post</a>, the notion that having a stash of gold will keep you safe and prosperous in a time of economic crisis is also something that's been tested by history, and the results are not in your favor. <br><br>Ed-M, oh, granted. I'm still far from certain that the whole shebang couldn't blow sky high in a hurry over some apparently minor little event, but we'll see.<br><br>Varun, glad to hear it. Enjoy the ride... ;-)<br><br>Bruce, there are hundreds of blogs out there in the doomosphere carrying various mixtures of analysis and data. Two I read regularly these days are <a href=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/ rel=nofollow>Naked Capitalism</a> and <a href=http://www.ricefarmer.blogspot.com/ rel=nofollow>Rice Farmer</a> -- but your mileage may vary. <br><br>Bill, fortunately for the rest of us, the fundamentalists increasingly lack the one thing necessary for an effective jihad -- enough young men. Middle-aged guys are great at preaching holy wars and lousy at actually conducting one; for the latter, you need lots of 16 to 21-year-olds, the eternal cannon fodder of our species, who can be talked into throwing their lives away for whatever politico-religious agenda you have in mind. That's a problem for the Christian fundamentalists, because <a href=http://www.rawstory.com/2015/05/teens-are-fleeing-religion-like-never-before-massive-new-study-exposes-religions-decline/ rel=nofollow>American youth is bailing out on established religious groups</a> at an unprecedented pace, and the Christian mainstream is getting hit by this proportionally harder than other groups. <br><br>Shawn, good! A Livy quote is always welcome here. That's the classic attitude of the era of response, when everyone agrees that something has to be done but no one wants to do the things that would actually fix what's wrong. <br><br>Fudoshin, fair enough. <br><br>Tortoise, a classic example of the era of pretense in its last and most desperate phase. <br><br>Gabriela, remember that I have no idea where you or any of my other readers are unless you happen to mention that fact. Proxy wars are no easier to live through than any other kind -- it's just that they tend to be localized. The fighting currently under way in Ukraine and Syria, for example, is at the moment the extent of actual military conflict between the US and Russia; lacking nuclear weapons, in all probability we'd have something approximating the Second World War under way right now, with all of Europe, the Middle East, and various other parts of the planet being pounded by bombs and fought over by huge armies.<br><br><a href=#c6683108770136453596 title="comment permalink">5/29/15, 10:03 PM</a><br><br>

"I see five major overlapping threats on the immediate horizon," he continues. "They are all related: the collapse of complex societies, the acceleration of the Earth's demise with changes that used to take 10,000 years now taking three or less, predatory or shock capitalism and financial crime out of the City of London and Wall Street, and political corruption at scale, to include the west supporting 42 of 44 dictators. We are close to multiple mass catastrophes."<br><br>What about the claim that the US is on the brink of revolution? "Revolution is overthrow – the complete reversal of the status quo ante. We are at the end of centuries of what Lionel Tiger calls 'The Manufacture of Evil,' in which merchant banks led by the City of London have conspired with captive governments to concentrate wealth and commoditise everything including humans. What revolution means in practical terms is that balance has been lost and the status quo ante is unsustainable. There are two 'stops' on greed to the nth degree: the first is the carrying capacity of Earth, and the second is human sensibility.

The JMG quote you included in the first posted comment stopped me in my tracks when I first read it. I always read this column very slowly and consider it carefully. When I started reading the comments it was the very first thing I saw! Here it is again:<br><br>"Every time a government tries to cope with a crisis by claiming that it doesn’t exist, every time some member of the well-to-do tries to dismiss the collective burdens its culture of executive kleptocracy imposes on the country by flinging abuse at critics, every time institutions that claim to uphold the rule of law defend the rule of entrenched privilege instead, the United States takes another step closer to the revolutionary abyss.”<br><br>I actually had a brief fantasy of someone reading those words to a squirmy board meeting of bureaucrats (or “journalists”) with inspiring theatre music welling in the background. “At long last, have you left no sense of decency?” It has punch, it’s clear, it’s not esoteric. I love it.<br><br>As for the crisis of legitimacy, I have noticed an interesting shift in my professional life that may simply be a product of age and experience, rather than a broader shift. While I have always spoken truth to power and been completely ignored, management is beginning to listen to me. In the past, there was such complete rejection of the idea that the status quo had serious problems, and there was enough money, connections, and power sloshing around to safely ignore such problems, that there was no benefit to listening to the likes of me. As resources become tighter, as reality knocks the swagger from their stride, as bravado falters, I find myself suddenly having an audience. <br><br>It’s weird. It’s a micro-example of how I hope the small efforts of today will pay off later. The years I have spent speaking my mind may have been about as effective as practicing a speech in the mirror, but someday may come in handy. It won’t directly put food on the table or provide warmth, but perhaps indirectly it will be a useful skill, if only to influence the organization of cooperative effort. My imagined future role will be as some sort of project manager - anything from organizing a market to planning an inventory system. My husband and I also have specific practical skills, though I would love to have more.<br><br>With regards to gold, I have a dangerous plan myself. I expect it to skyrocket at some point, if only briefly, before it eventually settles into some other unpredictable role in an exchange system. I’m rolling the dice by acquiring a few of those coins and I plan to time the price explosion to a purchase of real material wealth in the form of a small homestead with some horses and loads of food-producing trees. Of course that may never materialize, and It’s certainly not my only plan, but perhaps the bet will pay off. Here is the southeast United States, you can still buy a 10-acre rural property with access to water and a great growing climate for a modest price. <br><br>Thanks as usual for your awesomefullly-awesomeletty-awesome column, and the best peanut gallery on the web. <br><br>p.s. I finally went shopping for your books intending to read about collapse, energy, etc… and found myself distracted by your occult collection. Monsters! UFOs! A gigantic guilty pleasure for me and I had to order those books first.

If their wages go down -- and again, in the late 19th century, wages for the lower 2/3 or so did -- they get hammered ...</i> <br> <br>We are currently renting a house in a city (in Sweden), but just looking to buy a property with a somewhat run down house and 2-3 acres of land in a small town of a few thousand people one hour drive from here. The monthly cost will become much lower, renovation costs included and even if the interest goes up from 2 % to, say, 7 %, than the cost for renting. The most important feature is the land which I intend to cultivate intensely and creatively, for family and small business needs first, but also to serve as an inspiration and help to others in the years ahead. That means though, that we have to take on some debt, even if it is half or less than people in the city are lending to buy houses, without any land, today. Do you think it is too risky to take on any debt at all, or is it a better idea to escape the city, start growing food and take on some comparatively modest debt to make it? The option to stay put seems ... rather depressing (and scary). <br><br>Another thing that was somewhat disturbing to read, was your response to Odin's Raven, about where we will be when the dust settles: <br><i>Raven, I'm by no means certain Europe will escape that fate. </i> (i.e. possibly we will all have been forced to convert to a Middle Eastern religion)<br><br>How do you see that play out? I know your focus is on North America, but I would really appreciate any thoughts you might have on the subject. By the way, I'm not much troubled by anyones religion or beliefs, since it should always be a personal choice, but the thought of brute force and limited freedom (especially for women) is not easily digestible, even if it is decades or centuries away.<br><br><a href=#c1051738282671164160 title="comment permalink">5/31/15, 4:02 PM</a><br><br>

Partly that's because I moderate comments and delete trolls without mercy, partly it's because I'm male -- female bloggers on controversial subjects get much worse treatment online, including a constant barrage of death and rape threats -- and otherwise on the privileged side of most of the standard binary divisions. That's just one of those things. <br><br>JML, there's an infinite supply of people who are eager to tell the revolutionaries of the future, or some other group of people who are expected to do something, what they ought to do. All such chatter is wasted breath. If you want to have an influence on the decisions that will be made as the US comes apart, get out there and start organizing people around your ideas. <br><br>Snotra, debt is a tool. If you know how to use it, it can work for you, but it you assume that it'll do the work without skillful management, it'll cut you. As for the possibility of Europe falling under radical Muslim rule, as water shortages and economic collapse cause the Middle East to come apart, I expect tens or hundreds of millions of armed refugees to spill north into Europe, and they won't be interested in settling down peaceably next to the current residents; a great many of them are already radicalized, and it's pretty much guaranteed that they'll define their migration in the language of jihad. If you want your daughters to have anything approaching basic human rights, I'm not at all sure Europe's current policy toward mass migration from the Muslim world is something you'll want to support -- but of course that's Europe's choice to make, not mine.<br><br><a href=#c4273533875532341708 title="comment permalink">5/31/15, 4:47 PM</a><br><br>

Perplexed, perhaps? People seem to invest more in the topic, emotionally, than it warrants. <br><br>I hope I steer more of a middle course, or as someone once said of me 'you don't just see both sides of the argument, you see both sides of both sides...' I'm not sure it was meant as a compliment, but I'm happy to claim it as such. Gold is neither panacea nor total anathema, as with so many things; it's a tool to be used with all due respect for which way the pointy end is pointing. And like any other tool, if it's the only one in your toolkit, then you're stuffed; equally, if it's missing from your toolkit you're just stuffed in a different situation.<br><br>Sure, its 'value' is an abstraction based solely on the beliefs of people. Yet that is a belief that has persisted for thousands of years in many cultures, through all kinds of upheavals. It does have wonderful physical properties that make it useful as a means of exchange - its divisibility, chemical inertness, physical scarcity etc. You can't eat it of course, but neither can you eat cowry shells, wampum, dollar bills or share certificates. The same caveats apply in the marketplace whatever mode of exchange is postulated - coin, fairy dust or barter: anything is only ever worth what someone else is willing to exchange for it. Sometimes the exchange rates may become extreme, but that is not the fault of the medium, but of circumstance. We can all find examples from real life to support either end of the spectrum of attitudes. On the one hand there are cases when a gold coin can't even buy you a rotten potato; on the other hand, there are some Jewish families alive today because one or more Nazis put aside their ideology and their orders and allowed a gold coin to purchase freedom. <br><br>The love of gold has rightly been hedged about with morality tales probably for as long as it has been used as a marker for wealth - Midas et al - but to think the morality applies only to gold is also to miss part of the warning. Surely the moral issue lies in putting trust in the impersonal, valuing 'wealth' above relationship. That gold is the literary metaphor for 'wealth' is not intrinsic to the gold itself.<br><br>Which brings me in a roundabout way back to the major point I've learnt here, about history. Despite all the particulars, all the 'it's different this time', all the 'but that was then, this is now' rhetoric, history keeps rhyming - because its always people that are involved, and people, individually and in the mass, tend to keep behaving in similar ways. That's why history is a good guide to the future when compared to absract theories of the future. That's why some way down the line, people will still be exchanging little pieces of shiny metal for things they need, or on occasion refusing to accept little pieces of shiny metal in exchange for what they have.<br><br>One parting historical rhyme: some commenters have been asking whether Europe could ever be overtaken by a militant Middle Eastern personality cult that is totally alien to the existing social order. Why not? It has been before ;-))<br><br><a href=#c4529223448960762236 title="comment permalink">6/1/15, 4:36 AM</a><br><br>

Besides, I can't drive anymore!"<br><br>While digging to repair a field line with pickax and shovels (otw home after reunion), the boys were talking about civil disobedience and how everybody does it unconsciously. They think this will simply broaden as things get less reliable and morph into sporadic 'movements' in the cities. Their feeling is that we are past the point where following rules and regulations makes any sense at all other than to avoid trouble with the 'idiocracy'&lt;--- their word choice, btw.<br><br>They realize that the government has insufficient folks to enforce anything without consent, and they like being in deep West Malofia where government cannot afford much and there is little concentrated wealth to loot. No county inspectors (too poor), thin LE (poor and low population), only post office and forest service as federal presence, minimal state presence, etc. They are recognizing that population centers are wealth centers and thus "harvesting centers" for those producing nothing - and said as much between usual BS verbal horseplay.<br><br>I think things will unravel in slow, fitful jerks and starts where much of the populace reels from one sinking assumption to another. I see people viewing the house of cards around us for the first time, and it frightens them. Here in West Malofia, where the oilfield is collapsing, we are being inundated by RV caravans of upwardly poor, foreigners without papers and recently, Californians and Arizonians even. I think this will cease when the banking system finally collapses under its own corruption or the dollar poops its pants - repos will stop then. But that is a few years off.<br><br>I see changes downward all around, and people returning to things that matter. I hear conversations along those lines too.<br><br>The thing everyone ought to keep in mind is that helping others helps you - but judge them by their actions and not their words. Some people are just bad - as everyone knows but PC diseaes makes uttering it anathema. Everyone does it instinctively, but does not vocalize - so nobody learns. Mine are beginning to vocalize to insure they deal with honest folks to protect their work. <br><br>I'm excited to see this normality reasserting itself. Here's hoping Aquarius ascendant is a little better...<br><br><a href=#c2988108348566130788 title="comment permalink">6/1/15, 6:55 AM</a><br><br>

Instead, they promote burning "biomass", which was originally envisioned as forest industry waste products: bark, branches, short &amp; twisted trees, etc. But it turns out that a popular form of biomass fuel (which can go right into the old coal-fired power plants) is mature North American trees which happen to have no greater economic value. So they clear-cut forests, grind the trees to sawdust, press the sawdust into pellets, dry the pellets, pack them on trains to ships to England. Just add diesel at the logging and shipping phases, probably natural gas at the processing plant. And then wait 50 years for the equivalent mass of trees to pull that CO2 back out of the air. (The story in today's Washington Post questions the habitat loss and regrowth issues, but ignores the process and transportation energy inputs.)

Sawdust from nearby saw mills is used by these guys rather than just harvesting pine trees. Clear-cutting is no longer practiced on the whole in most southern forests. There may be several acres (20-30) clear-cut, but rarely adjacent large parcels. The following spring, these clear-cuts are replanted or left fallow to allow hardwoods to grow in some cases - depends on the landowner. But the litter and detritus leftover from the clear cutting is usually graded into rows to hold topsoil until the trees are replanted - no topsoil and removing the harvest remnants removes nutrients. Timber farmers are only idiots when they work in large corporations, and even then, they are becoming more rare, as it does NOT pay to lose your farmland to erosion or stupid management.<br><br>Just what I know from down this way (timber exemption also btw).

One of these went to Hong Kong before being diagnosed, so the Chinese now have hundreds of contacts traced and quarantined.<br><br>An editorial in Yonhap News compares the failure of response to the MERS outbreak as similar to the Sewol ferry disaster. "Adding to mounting public concerns was a lack of information ― the exact area affected, the list of hospitals, the first patient and those infected by him ― leading to the spread of groundless rumors and swelling unfounded fears in a vicious circle. At the root of the popular fear and confusion is a distrust of the government, its incompetence and undue secrecy."<br><br>But it's not just a psychological crisis. "The epidemic crisis can also throw the already sluggish recovery into a deeper pit." I suggest that economic crisis leads to distracted and weakened government resources, which leads to fear, which leads to economic turmoil. An economy which depends on entertainment and tourism is hit hard when people hunker down.<br><br><br><a href=#c3971941877554857155 title="comment permalink">6/3/15, 4:22 PM</a><br><br>

But, apparently people like that American president, I think it’s Jefferson, were able and expected to combine doing their intellectual thing with practical hands-on work. Part of why it’s hard for us might be because in a more complex economy it’s expected now that we all specialize in what we’re best at. But an economy that’s de-complexifying must mean we need to de-specialize too.<br><br>I think the general principles of the strategy have to be the same for everyone because they’re based on the real material limits – so using LESS and collapse now and avoid the rush. But within that I think there’s lots of room for people to do it their way.<br>What has worked for me is treating is like a modelling project. Create an overarching concept and structure for how you’re going to do it. Like the whole systems examples at the end of Green Wizardry. So to do that you get to have lots of fun analysing your current situation and where you are and deciding which model would work best for you – or of course inventing new models.<br><br>Then you kind of have to accept that no one else is going to implement your brilliant model because there’s a shortage of willing minions ;-) so if you want to test it to get feedback so you can continue to tinker with it, you’re going to have to do it yourself. You can break it down into sub-projects then and conduct experiments to work out, say, whether you like gardening or sewing better or how long baking bread takes. Then you can adjust the model constantly according to your outcomes.<br><br>You do need to be kind of patient with yourself I think because if you’re like me you’ll burn half what you cook, spill water all over yourself in the garden and stick needles into yourself constantly while sewing etc. But just because we’re a bit, well, more rubbish, than others at physically doing things, doesn’t mean that we can’t learn to do them competently. It’ll just take longer and probably involve more injuries!. And that’s all your need to aim for. If you find something that you happen to love doing and get really good at I see that as a bonus.<br><br>Another thing I find really important is to recognize when you’re spending a disproportionate amount of time just accumulating information and pondering it, especially on the internet. I’ve managed to convince myself that I’m saving significant electricity by turning off the computer in the evenings so that I can’t go on it. Then you can spend the evening working on things.<br><br>Also, it might help to create a model in your head of you as the type of person who would be great at implementing the strategy you’ve chosen. So I treat it as a retro project and ask myself what a 1940’s housewife would do next. Then you get to create a whole model of someone else’s worldview and play in that. You might like different kinds of models so use them instead maybe – like a clever computer model of the project that tracks your progress and has databases of useful information or something?<br><br>I should add a caveat that my progress (regress?!) has coincided with starting magical practices. This might be a stretch too far for you but I have a feeling it might be related. Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c3075644498163383656 title="comment permalink">6/5/15, 10:14 AM</a><br><br>

Why? I don't know),and the resistance of various groups of power elites (the situation now. Oil, pesticides,banking, law, retailing have things almost just the way they want them (of course GM has not been able to pass the law banning working on your own car)). So real change is stymied until the power elites are convinced that change may benefit them. This frustrationj of being stymied, especially at the local level exacurated by the centralization of the economy), leads to the amusing example you protray.<br><br><a href=#c5678900691247469983 title="comment permalink">6/7/15, 11:03 AM</a><br><br>
