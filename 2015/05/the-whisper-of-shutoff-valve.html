Last week’s post on the impending decline and fall of the internet fielded a great many responses. That was no surprise, to be sure; nor was I startled in the least to find that many of them rejected the thesis of the post with some heat. Contemporary pop culture’s strident insistence that technological progress is a clock that never runs backwards made such counterclaims inevitable. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, it’s always educational to watch the arguments fielded to prop up the increasingly shaky edifice of the modern mythology of progress, and the last week was no exception. A response I found particularly interesting from that standpoint appeared on one of the many online venues where <i>Archdruid Report</i> posts appear. One of the commenters insisted that my post should be rejected out of hand as mere doom and gloom; after all, he pointed out, it was ridiculous for me to suggest that fifty years from now, a majority of the population of the United States might be without reliable electricity or running water. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve made the same prediction here and elsewhere a good many times. Each time, most of my readers or listeners seem to have taken it as a piece of sheer rhetorical hyperbole. The electrical grid and the assorted systems that send potable water flowing out of faucets are so basic to the rituals of everyday life in today’s America that their continued presence is taken for granted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At most, it’s conceivable that individuals might choose not to connect to them; there’s a certain amount of talk about off-grid living here and there in the alternative media, for example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That people who want these things might not have access to them, though, is pretty much unthinkable.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, <a href=http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2015/04/22/baltimore-detroit-threaten-thousands-with-water-shut-off.html>in Detroit and Baltimore</a>, tens of thousands of residents are in the process of losing their access to water and electricity.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The situation in both cities is much the same, and there’s every reason to think that identical headlines will shortly appear in reference to other cities around the nation. Not that many decades ago, Detroit and Baltimore were important industrial centers with thriving economies. Along with more than a hundred other cities in America’s Rust Belt, they were thrown under the bus with the first wave of industrial offshoring in the 1970s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The situation for both cities has only gotten worse since that time, as the United States completed its long transition from a manufacturing economy producing goods and services to a bubble economy that mostly produces unpayable IOUs.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
These days, the middle-class families whose tax payments propped up the expansive urban systems of an earlier day have long since moved out of town. Most of the remaining residents are poor, and the ongoing redistribution of wealth in America toward the very rich and away from everyone else has driven down the income of the urban poor to the point that many of them can no longer afford to pay their water and power bills. City utilities in Detroit and Baltimore have been sufficiently sensitive to political pressures that large-scale utility shutoffs have been delayed, but shifts in the political climate in both cities are bringing the delays to an end; water bills have increased steadily, more and more people have been unable to pay them, and the result is as predictable as it is brutal. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The debate over the Detroit and Baltimore shutoffs has followed the usual pattern, as one side wallows in bash-the-poor rhetoric while the other side insists plaintively that access to utilities is a human right. Neither side seems to be interested in talking about the broader context in which these disputes take shape. There are two aspects to that broader context, and it’s a tossup which is the more threatening. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first aspect is the failure of the US economy to recover in any meaningful sense from the financial crisis of 2008. Now of course politicians from Obama on down have gone overtime grandstanding about the alleged recovery we’re in. I invite any of my readers who bought into that rhetoric to try the following simple experiment. Go to your favorite internet search engine and look up how much the fracking industry has added to the US gross domestic product each year from 2009 to 2014. Now subtract that figure from the US gross domestic product for each of those years, and see how much growth there’s actually been in the rest of the economy since the real estate bubble imploded. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What you’ll find, if you take the time to do that, is that the rest of the US economy has been flat on its back gasping for air for the last five years. What makes this even more problematic, as I’ve noted <a href=../../2014/12/deja-vu-all-over-again.html>in several previous posts here</a>, is that the great fracking boom about which we’ve heard so much for the last five years was never actually the game-changing energy revolution its promoters claimed; it was simply another installment in the series of speculative bubbles that has largely replaced constructive economic activity in this country over the last two decades or so.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s more, it’s not the only bubble currently being blown, and it may not even be the largest. We’ve also got a second tech-stock bubble, with money-losing internet corporations racking up absurd valuations in the stock market while they burn through millions of dollars of venture capital; we’ve got a student loan bubble, in which billions of dollars of loans that will never be paid back have been bundled, packaged, and sold to investors just like all those no-doc mortgages were a decade ago; car loans are getting the same treatment; the real estate market is fizzing again in many urban areas as investors pile into another round of lavishly marketed property investments—well, I could go on for some time. It’s entirely possible that if all the bubble activity were to be subtracted from the last five years or so of GDP, the result would show an economy in freefall. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Certainly that’s the impression that emerges if you take the time to check out those economic statistics that aren’t being systematically jiggered by the US government for PR purposes. The number of long-term unemployed in America is at an all-time high; roads, bridges, and other basic infrastructure is falling to pieces; measurements of US public health—generally considered a good proxy for the real economic condition of the population—are well below those of other industrial countries, heading toward Third World levels; abandoned shopping malls litter the landscape while major retailers announce <a href=http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-05-02/major-us-retailers-are-closing-more-6000-stores>more than 6000 store closures</a>. These are not things you see in an era of economic expansion, or even one of relative stability; they’re markers of decline.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The utility shutoffs in Detroit and Baltimore are further symptoms of the same broad process of economic unraveling. It’s true, as pundits in the media have been insisting since the story broke, that utilities get shut off for nonpayment of bills all the time. It’s equally true that shutting off the water supply of 20,000 or 30,000 people all at once is pretty much unprecedented. Both cities, please note, have had very large populations of poor people for many decades now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Those who like to blame a “culture of poverty” for the tangled relationship between US governments and the American poor, and of course that trope has been rehashed by some of the pundits just mentioned, haven’t yet gotten around to explaining how the culture of poverty all at once inspired tens of thousands of people who had been paying their utility bills to stop doing so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are plenty of good reasons, after all, why poor people who used to pay their bills can’t do so any more. Standard business models in the United States used to take it for granted that the best way to run the staffing dimensions of any company, large or small, was to have as many full-time positions as possible and to use raises and other practical incentives to encourage employees who were good at their jobs to stay with the company. That approach has been increasingly unfashionable in today’s America, partly due to perverse regulatory incentives that penalize employers for offering full-time positions, partly to the emergence of attitudes in corner offices that treat employees as just another commodity. (I doubt it’s any kind of accident that most corporations nowadays refer to their employment offices as “human resource departments.” What do you do with a resource? You exploit it.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
These days, most of the jobs available to the poor are part-time, pay very little, and include nasty little clawbacks in the form of requirements that employees pay out of pocket for uniforms, equipment, and other things that employers used to provide as a matter of course. Meanwhile housing prices and rents are rising well above their post-2008 dip, and a great many other necessities are becoming more costly—inflation may be under control, or so the official statistics say, but anyone who’s been shopping at the same grocery store for the last eight years knows perfectly well that prices kept on rising anyway. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So you’ve got falling incomes running up against rising costs for food, rent, and utilities, among other things. In the resulting collision, something’s got to give, and for tens of thousands of poor Detroiters and Baltimoreans, what gave first was the ability to keep current on their water bills. Expect to see the same story playing out across the country as more people on the bottom of the income pyramid find themselves in the same situation. What you won’t hear in the media, though it’s visible enough if you know where to look and are willing to do so, is that people above the bottom of the income pyramid are also losing ground, being forced down toward economic nonpersonhood. From the middle classes down, everyone’s losing ground. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That process doesn’t continue any further than the middle class, to be sure. It’s been pointed out repeatedly that over the last four decades or so, the distribution of wealth in America has skewed further and further out of balance, with the top 20% of incomes taking a larger and larger share at the expense of everybody else. That’s an important factor in bringing about the collision just described. Some thinkers on the radical fringes of American society, which is the only place in the US you can talk about such things these days, have argued that the raw greed of the well-to-do is the sole reason why so many people lower down the ladder are being pushed further down still. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Scapegoating rhetoric of that sort is always comforting, because it holds out the promise—theoretically, if not practically—that something can be done about the situation. If only the thieving rich could be lined up against a convenient brick wall and removed from the equation in the time-honored fashion, the logic goes, people in Detroit and Baltimore could afford to pay their water bills!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I suspect we’ll hear such claims increasingly often as the years pass and more and more Americans find their access to familiar comforts and necessities slipping away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Simple answers are always popular in such times, not least when the people being scapegoated go as far out of their way to make themselves good targets for such exercises as the American rich have done in recent decades. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
John Kenneth Galbraith’s equation of the current US political and economic elite with the French aristocracy on the eve of revolution rings even more true than it did when he wrote it back in 1992, in the pages of <i>The Culture of Contentment</i>. The unthinking extravagances, the casual dismissal of the last shreds of <i>noblesse oblige</i>, the obsessive pursuit of personal advantages and private feuds without the least thought of the potential consequences, the bland inability to recognize that the power, privilege, wealth, and sheer survival of the aristocracy depended on the system the aristocrats themselves were destabilizing by their actions—it’s all there, complete with sprawling overpriced mansions that could just about double for Versailles. The urban mobs that played so large a role back in 1789 are warming up for their performances as I write these words; the only thing left to complete the picture is a few tumbrils and a guillotine, and those will doubtless arrive on cue. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The senility of the current US elite, <a href=../../2014/09/dark-age-america-senility-of-elites.html>as noted in a previous post here</a>, is a massive political fact in today’s America. Still, it’s not the only factor in play here. Previous generations of wealthy Americans recognized without too much difficulty that their power, prosperity, and survival depended on the willingness of the rest of the population to put up with their antics. Several times already in America’s history, elite groups have allied with populist forces to push through reforms that sharply weakened the power of the wealthy elite, because they recognized that the alternative was a social explosion even more destructive to the system on which elite power depends. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I suppose it’s possible that the people currently occupying the upper ranks of the political and economic pyramid in today’s America are just that much more stupid than their equivalents in the Jacksonian, Progressive, and New Deal eras. Still, there’s at least one other explanation to hand, and it’s the second of the two threatening contextual issues mentioned earlier. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Until the nineteenth century, fresh running water piped into homes for everyday use was purely an affectation of the very rich in a few very wealthy and technologically adept societies. Sewer pipes to take dirty water and human wastes out of the house belonged in the same category. This wasn’t because nobody knew how plumbing works—the Romans had competent plumbers, for example, and water faucets and flush toilets were to be found in Roman mansions of the imperial age. The reason those same things weren’t found in every Roman house was economic, not technical. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Behind that economic issue lay an ecological reality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>White’s Law, one of the foundational principles of human ecology, states that economic development is a function of energy per capita. For a society before the industrial age, the Roman Empire had an impressive amount of energy per capita to expend; control over the agricultural economy of the Mediterranean basin, modest inputs from sunlight, water and wind, and a thriving slave industry fed by the expansion of Roman military power all fed into the capacity of Roman society to develop itself economically and technically. That’s why rich Romans had running water and iced drinks in summer, while their equivalents in ancient Greece a few centuries earlier had to make do without either one. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Fossil fuels gave industrial civilization a supply of energy many orders of magnitude greater than any previous human civilization has had—a supply vast enough that the difference remains huge even after the vast expansion of population that followed the industrial revolution. There was, however, a catch—or, more precisely, two catches. To begin with, fossil fuels are finite, nonrenewable resources; no matter how much handwaving is employed in the attempt to obscure this point—and whatever else might be in short supply these days, that sort of handwaving is not—every barrel of oil, ton of coal, or cubic foot of natural gas that’s burnt takes the world one step closer to the point at which there will be no economically extractable reserves of oil, coal, or natural gas at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s catch #1. Catch #2 is subtler, and considerably more dangerous. Oil, coal, and natural gas don’t leap out of the ground on command. They have to be extracted and processed, and this takes energy. Companies in the fossil fuel industries have always targeted the deposits that cost less to extract and process, for obvious economic reasons. What this means, though, is that over time, a larger and larger fraction of the energy yield of oil, coal, and natural gas has to be put right back into extracting and processing oil, coal, and natural gas—and this leaves less and less for all other uses. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the vise that’s tightening around the American economy these days. The great fracking boom, to the extent that it wasn’t simply one more speculative gimmick aimed at the pocketbooks of chumps, was an attempt to make up for the ongoing decline of America’s conventional oilfields by going after oil that was far more expensive to extract. The fact that none of the companies at the heart of the fracking boom ever turned a profit, even when oil brought more than $100 a barrel, gives some sense of just how costly shale oil is to get out of the ground. The financial cost of extraction, though, is a proxy for the energy cost of extraction—the amount of energy, and of the products of energy, that had to be thrown into the task of getting a little extra oil out of marginal source rock. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Energy needed to extract energy, again, can’t be used for any other purpose. It doesn’t contribute to the energy surplus that makes economic development possible. As the energy industry itself takes a bigger bite out of each year’s energy production, every other economic activity loses part of the fuel that makes it run. That, in turn, is the core reason why the American economy is on the ropes, America’s infrastructure is falling to bits—and Americans in Detroit and Baltimore are facing a transition to Third World conditions, without electricity or running water. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I suspect, for what it’s worth, that the shutoff notices being mailed to tens of thousands of poor families in those two cities are a good working model for the way that industrial civilization itself will wind down. It won’t be sudden; for decades to come, there will still be people who have access to what Americans today consider the ordinary necessities and comforts of everyday life; there will just be fewer of them each year. Outside that narrowing circle, the number of economic nonpersons will grow steadily, one shutoff notice at a time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<a href=../../2014/10/dark-age-america-hour-of-knife.html>As I’ve pointed out in previous posts</a>, the line of fracture between the senile elite and what Arnold Toynbee called the internal proletariat—the people who live within a failing civilization’s borders but receive essentially none of its benefits—eventually opens into a chasm that swallows what’s left of the civilization. Sometimes the tectonic processes that pull the chasm open are hard to miss, but there are times when they’re a good deal more difficult to sense in action, and this is one of these latter times. Listen to the whisper of the shutoff valve, and you’ll hear tens of thousands of Americans being cut off from basic services the rest of us, for the time being, still take for granted. </div>

First, if your neighbors tell you that they haven't paid their bill in months, and the water keeps coming, do you feel like a chump for paying your bills? Some stories have reported that, when the threat of cut-off is serious, the bills DO get paid again.

I was living in a community in which the majority strongly believed in great faeries who would ensure that whatever negative signs we were seeing (which were all for the glory of God, by the way), would not get out of hand and doubters would be duly punished for their gloominess. Aside from that laughable culture, though, my overall impression at that time was an almost imperceptibly slow decline overall, with great advances being made in some ways, and people focusing on those and blinkering out the rest.<br>Immigrating to Japan 30 years ago gave me a new perspective. There was an overall boost during the bubble years, and though that has faded, I don't get quite the sense of cognitive dissonance that I did in the States. That is despite the fact that the majority of people I know here seem to inhabit a sort of children's book land, upon which they most decidedly do not want reality to intrude. They are not actually denying that decline. In Japan's case, though, I suspect the change will be sudden, and try as I may, I have no way of predicting how this society will break down.<br>My annual visits back to the States (now curtailed) gave me an interesting fast-forward overview. I'd visit several cities and rural towns and talk to people of various social strata.

In one case, I even got on stage or the playing field, as <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2014/07/water-protests-in-detroit.html rel=nofollow>I joined a protest against the water shutoffs</a>, the same one that the article in The Star that you linked to showed. That worked, after a fashion, as <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2014/07/bankruptcy-update-city-suspends-water.html rel=nofollow>a few days later Detroit suspended shutoffs</a>. Still, it was only temporary, as you described, for <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2014/09/update-on-detroit-water-shut-offs-and.html rel=nofollow>water shutoffs resumed two months later</a>. Those shutoffs are no longer in the local news, as they aren't new anymore and the bankruptcy they were part of is over. Just the same, they're happening, and it's up to the foreign press to report them as the domestic outlets have moved on.<br><br>As for closed malls, I have one literally next door to where I teach. It was only a few months ago that <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2015/02/closure-of-northland-mall-approved.html rel=nofollow>the closure of Northland Mall was approved</a>. Northland Mall was one of the oldest, if not the oldest suburban shopping malls in the U.S. That has been a long time coming, as the mall has been in decline since 2001. That makes it no less a sad sign of our times, as shopping malls are closing all over the country. Speaking of which, there is another mall north of me near Pontiac that's been closed for years. Its claim to fame is that it has a circus elephant buried in the parking lot. It would be too fitting if the deceased pachyderm had been white, but such was not the case.<br><br>As for the residents' reactions to all this, they had an opportunity to raise Michigan's sales tax to pay for road, bridge, and highway maintenance on Tuesday. <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2015/05/proposal-1-lost-examinercom-article.html rel=nofollow>They declined overwhelmingly</a>.

In contrast, <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2015/04/partisan-divisions-over-proposal-1-plus.html rel=nofollow>marijuana legalization is being favored by a majority of those polled</a>.

I have an older used car, which I drive maybe once a week at most. Most of the time, I walk or ride my bicycle and I live within walking or cycling distance of most places I need to go, so I rarely ever drive anymore. I would get rid of the car altogether, but public transit is such a wretched joke in most parts of the USA.<br><br>There is a huge shopping mall on the other side of town, which I haven’t been to in 2 or 3 years. The mall was built around 25 years ago. That was back before I moved to the city where I now live, but I had relatives in the area so I used to visit on a regular basis with my parents and siblings when I was a teenager and I remember seeing it being built during a visit to my great grandfather, who lived on a hill overlooking the site. When I moved to town, the mall was doing quite well and there were very few vacancies. The last time I went there a few years ago, the mall was clearly struggling but most of the storefronts still had tenants. <br><br>Boy was I in for a rude shock last weekend. I was driving through that part of town on another errand and decided to stop by the old mall out of curiosity. I was amazed by what I saw. Most of the storefronts are now empty. Hardly any of the tenants from a few years ago are still there and most of the remaining tenants are ones that weren’t there a couple of years ago, suggesting a huge amount of turnover in the last few years. The old Sears is now a movie theater and the only one left in a city of 35,000, because all the others except a boutique “theater-pub” have closed. At least we still have three traditional theaters, including the one at the local junior college, but they are struggling as well. The food court, which used to have more than a dozen eateries only a couple of years ago, now has one. The rest are all covered with sheetrock like most of the storefronts. The place looked like an Old West ghost town or a set from some cheesy B movie about the zombie apocalypse. I was absolutely floored. <br><br>The following day, I went down to the nearest major city with my girlfriend. I could not believe the number of dead strip malls with no tenants. I remember listening to one of Jim Kunstler’s podcasts where he talked about the tanking of the retail sector and how many urban areas in America are filled with dead strip malls, but its quite another thing to see block after block of them. Of course, as Kunstler pointed out, America is ridiculously overbuilt on retail floor space, which is no surprise since shopping has become a sort of ersatz religion for most Americans, including a great many of those who consider themselves to be “Christian conservatives”. Kunstler noted that the US has something like 20 square feet of retail floor space per capita, while most other industrialized countries have 4-5 square feet of retail floor space per capita. Moreover, many traditional retailers have been driven under by having to compete with the likes of Amazon, Mall-Wart and Costco, but still it’s an amazing thing to see just how quickly the retail trade has gone downhill in the part of the country where I live. <br><br>The funny thing is, this is a part of the Pacific Northwest which is far better off than Detroit or Baltimore. Catabolic collapse? To paraphrase Caribou Barbie, “You Betcha!”<br><br><a href=#c5919420801888085626 title="comment permalink">5/6/15, 8:00 PM</a><br><br>

I don't know if they can.”<br><br>Remember we were talking about how the US government has been laying the grounds for a possible counterinsurgency campaign here at home? To a great many Americans, this looks an awful lot like a training drill for just such a counterinsurgency campaign and there are a lot of people in Texas and the Southwestern US that are both concerned and mad as hell about it. The Governor of Texas was so concerned that Jade Helm might be used as a cover for something more nefarious that he actually put Texas military and law enforcement agencies on alert while the exercise was going on. Again, consider that this has historically been the most patriotic and pro-military part of the USA. All I can say is, wow!!!

You can never have too much water storage you know. This might sound like a bit of an advertisement, but the 4,000 Litre (about 1,060 gallons) water tank costs about $750. It refills from the sky for free too! Some of the bills that were mentioned in the article were many times that price.<br><br>Now before anyone bores me silly with legal arguments saying: oh no, you can't collect rain water - the state owns it! Well what do you reckon your gardens are doing when they receive rain water? Get a grip people – if the state can’t supply it, then they can hardly fine you for having your on storage! It wouldn’t be a good look…<br><br>That amount of water storage is not much at current usage levels, but I'll tell ya what, if you're thirsty and have no other access to drinking quality water then that stuff is priceless.<br><br>And I have to pay the annual water bill that turns up here despite having no assistance or supplies from that lot whatsoever. Talk about a wealth pump! Grrr!<br><br>The shutoff of basic supplies to a large percentage of an urban population is a move by the wealthy to retain their existing privileges in a system with declining wealth. It is a very dangerous game to play as it may actually galvanise opposition to that system in a large pool of people who may otherwise not having anything else in common. They would be far better to drive a wedge between the different groups and supply the basics and get them to fight amongst themselves. That major cut off is not a smart move at all from a long term strategic consideration.<br><br>Oh, did anyone happen to notice that the lady in the article living in the rental apartment building whose owner had not paid the water bills was working a 15 hour day regularly. The article sort of ignored that little matter and instead of focused outrage on the fact that she may indeed have no access to water in the near term after working such a long day. Is it just me or does anyone find that mildly surreal?<br><br>I agree with both of your points in that they reflect how the real world works.<br><br>Before running water and sewerage, diseases like typhoid and cholera were endemic because people simply disposed of their wastes as cheaply as possible.

I would suspect we would have an alarming very obvious trend on our hands. <br><br>I have also been thinking about the interesting way the collapse scene has drawn concerned investors. I have been thinking the most successful investment schemes to direct non-discretionary income will be to invest in your neighbors. Your neighbor is down on hard times with a few kids, buy them some groceries for a few months. That family and their kids will never forget it, and may return the favor in some in the years ahead. When it comes to socialization and a gift economy the one thing that is essential is the chance of reciprocity. In a world where people are moving to a new city to a new job every few years, it often doesn't make sense to invest the time and effort to make a good friend. As collapse hastens this relationship will change dramatically via limiting mobility, sunk cost of housing keeping people in place, gas/car/insurance price increases. I have often thought of schemes where these gold-bug typeinvestors should be sinking their savings into small villages in central and south america, paying for basics and upgrades, then moving there to retire. I am sure the village population would help support and accept such a generous patron into their community.<br><br>Also as far as populations an apocalyptic fantasy's it is interesting how exponential functions operate very well in the other direction. For instance with 400 million people approximately the population of the United States, it only takes a population growth rate of negative 4% per year to give us a population of 54 thousand in 50 years. This is around the US population in 1880. 4% per year is rather grim with 4 people dying out of 100 every year but it is hardly apocalyptic. The Limits to growth model that has proved highly accurate doesn't even predict something this grim. <br><br>Humans are really not naturally capable of perceiving changes on larger time scales. It is something that must be learned and trained. I know I am just repeating your points in a different context, however, every time I check your facts with logic, they seem to work out. It is almost like they were arrived at through logical conclusions themselves.<br><br>In summary how do you think one can fight with both rhetoric and religious appeal the very destructive memes below?<br><br>1. If the rich were forced to have their wealth redistributed we could return to progress as usual.<br><br>2. A vast conspiracy of banks and "elite" are holding us down for their own sick end.<br><br>3. Any reflection on the past is an image of barbarism.<br><br>(In some ways I am myself resurrecting a "noble savage") The original meme is actually much different from the contemporary version. The contemporary version is worth looking at in my opinion.)<br><br><a href=#c5454587084402386322 title="comment permalink">5/6/15, 10:52 PM</a><br><br>

Many towns in the San Juaquin Valley of California rely on individual wells for their domestic water supply.Most of these wells go down 100 or so feet. With the current drought, which may well be the new normal, agribusiness is is running wells down to 1,000 or more feet and pulling up water that has taken 100s of thousands of years to fill the aquifers.Not only is this draining the aquifers, but collapsing them so that the next 100,000 years may not have anywhere to fill. Most of these wells are costing into the 100s of thousands of dollars. There is no way that home owners or renters, many of them poor agriculutral workers, can afford these prices.One can buy bottled water for drinking, cooking &amp; tooth brushing, but not for bathing, dish washing,toilet flushing, etc.<br>In Australia, one can rent the trailer, buy the water to park a water trailer on ones land. I don't if this is possible in CA, or if most of these people could afford it or have room to put one.

There are quite a number of towns here which do not have potable water, either contaminated with e.coli due to the state being unable to manage small town water catchments, so that these towns are on permanent 'boil water' alerts, or from heavy metal contamination from mine tailings. This was once considered to be a temporary aberration, but it is now becoming clear that these 'third world conditions' are here to stay. Luckily, there are no restrictions on private water collection here, and many people have water tanks. Others rely on trucked-in water. The state is rapidly running out of money for education and healthcare, and can only seem to find funds for building sports stadiums (shades of Roman circuses?). Our Prime Minister has recently decided to close dozens of remote Aboriginal communities in northern Australia, declaring their preference for living on the land they have occupied for 40,000 years as a 'lifestyle choice'. So no more water, electricity or health care for remote communities.<br><br>This is clearly the thin end of the wedge, with rhetoric and euphemisms for 'we are running out of money' abounding.

I spent about a year, cumulatively, in places where safe, piped-in drinking water was not a thing (hot water? forget it!), electricity was unreliable, and the internet was just a thing you used just to check the news back home and send email, from the cafe on the next block. And there is hardly a day I do not want to go back for another visit. <br><br>My friends there spent a lot of time visiting neighbors and relatives and going to church. They taught me how to do laundry by hand, clean house without a vacuum cleaner or a mop, and do all my cooking at home without an oven or a refrigerator. None of them had cars. And I learned a little bit about how to live graciously and comfortably on a tiny fraction of the resources I use back home in the US. <br><br>The problem is, it's a huge fight to try to emulate those things here. I want so badly to have LESS crap in my life-- to have almost no furniture and *stuff*, like my friends, just so that I can make the housecleaning quicker and less resource-intensive. But there's a lot I can't do, because we are so *&amp;*%^ car-dependent. From my home, there is no church, relative, or place to buy food within bicycle range. One must have a car. And a big freezer. <br><br>Changing that distance is our next big project.<br><br><a href=#c6975671025352731603 title="comment permalink">5/7/15, 5:24 AM</a><br><br>

If the drought in the west continues for another year, the water will be gone, period. <br><br>Imagine the fury of people who have the means to pay for water at any price, but can't get it because it's simply not there. In a few short years, the lights in Vegas will go out due to the lack of power from Hoover Dam and the lack of potable water. But Lake Mead supplies at least 3 states that I know of with water, all of which are, in their native states, deserts. <br><br>It's one thing to have to catch rainwater or drill a well to get water; it's quite another to be forced with the choice to either abandon your home and move where the water is or die.

We're all familiar with the mantra of "it can't happen here", but nobody ever denied that one little thing can't go wrong, or another, or another... And then by the time "it" happens (food banks or water cut-offs or war), it seems so natural that people are halfway to forgetting they ever said "it can't happen" or that life was completely different ten or twenty years ago.<br><br>It happens in bits and pieces not only within a country (as between the well-off of, say, Manhattan and the people falling off the map in Detroit) but between them. It's always hard to gauge the mood in other parts of the world, but I get the impression that things are at once more broken-down (e.g. mass water shut-offs) and a lot more entrenched (bigger houses, bigger cars, steeper student loans, air-conditioning everywhere, miles of wasteland suburbs...) in the USA than in most of Europe. One of the differences, I think, is in the awareness of the real issues facing us: people *are* starting to speak up here about the impossibility of infinite growth, the way the media frames narrative to define what is "important", and the breakdown of infrastructure. It's glimmerings of clarity at best - most people doing the writing don't seem to have made connections between apparently disparate events or understand the underlying causes, and it's not affected the mainstream paradigm yet - but it's there, and it's showing up more often in more visible places. On the street, too: apparently unlike most of your readers, I find I'm more likely to get a thoughtful nod than a blank stare if I bring up the topic, and it's generally agreed that "Americanisation" is a thing to be avoided (and was that true fifty years ago?)<br><br>Today in particular is a case of "Don't mind me, just living through history". Ten years ago the Scottish National Party were a joke; today they look set to sweep Scotland in the UK general election. It's generally agreed that Scotland - which has been content in the Union for over three hundred years - is, if things continue on their current trajectory, likely to declare independence within a couple of decades. (This, like the continuing implosion of the EU, fits a general pattern of smaller communities and localisation with decreasing energy availability, and the deer-in-headlights response of the UK elite, who have completely failed to grasp this or practically anything else about the situation, has been entertaining to watch.) I can only say I'm glad to live somewhere still capable of effecting (some) change through the processes of democracy, and with a decent chance of seeing a peaceful rather than violent breakdown. The UK might be about to fall apart, but when the tipping point is reached the USA - for all your own elections next year look set to be another two-horse popularity contest, for all that things might hold and economists claim recovery for another five years or ten - is more likely to burn. And when it comes, people will be sure that this is where things have been heading for years (will have forgotten "it can't happen here"), even if most of them still won't understand why.<br><br><a href=#c7525724814130094993 title="comment permalink">5/7/15, 5:39 AM</a><br><br>

We finally made it out and when I got back home, I will never forget the miracles I encountered -- electric lights that flicked on with the touch of a button. Hot water that sprayed out of the shower head with the twist of a knob. The amazing bounty of food contained in the refrigerator -- all clean, cold and fresh. Clean sheets and a soft bed to lie in.

Not only that, but plumbing manages storm runoff and natural water resources as well. When municipalities are unable to keep abreast of maintenance needs, expect polluted water resources and flooded basements along with dry taps. <br><br>Also, although the electrical grid may be easier to fix in some cases as the infrastructure is above ground, it is also more vulnerable to damage from natural weather events. When public utilities start to struggle under normal conditions to maintain the mammoth amount of cable strung to power our lives, imagine what will happen after a tornado, fire, ice storm, etc. I imagine service restart times after such events will increase dramatically and for outlying areas may become permanent. <br><br>I don't think panicking and going off grid is the right solution, neither is gluing yourself to your screens and humming quietly in a corner. For myself, I try and learn about my current local infrastructure and how things were done prior to fossil fuels. I want to know what will fail and where so I can avoid polluted water sources (storm sewer overflow outlets) in the event that I have to source drinking water from somewhere other than the tap or store. When things do break down that we can't fix, infrastructure from the pre-fossil fuel era offers a guide for where to put our energy for any new projects. In my city, for instance, there was a large canal, since filled in, that provided hydraulic power for a substantial industrial sector. It would not be easy to dig out such a canal again, but withdrawal is a great motivator and it was done once already so it is possible! My civic forebears also dealt with massive contamination issues in the same river and conjoined lake, something that will undoubtedly become an increasing reality as chlorination and long distance pumping become more burdensome on society. It's probably a good idea to know that this is a reality and to have some idea of how to address it instead of letting half the population die from loosened bowels.<br><br><a href=#c3880740523124777051 title="comment permalink">5/7/15, 6:51 AM</a><br><br>

Evidence which contradicts it is ignored which is what happens with any deeply held attitude fueled and maintained by emotion and without evidence. The attitude kills empathy for the meme both forces and allows the affluent to ignore those who have their water cut off because they must in some way be responsible for their predicament. This could be entirely untrue but the attitude cares not. <br><br>In America we are raised not to see ourselves as a thread in a greater social fabric but as independent bolts of cloth each responsible for all our successes and all our failures.

It was an exciting technology vision, but I didn't think it made a lot of economic sense. And then I changed jobs and moved on.<br><br>Last year I sold my home, in a still affluent area of the northeast US, and was entertained by the water shut-off procedures. A real-life service person came to do the shut-off, working with the same old water meter that we'd had turned on 15 years ago, connected to the same 160 year old iron pipe that serviced the house from the street main. So, no flying cars yet and no robo-plumbers either, it seems.

For nearly all water systems( except for desalination based ones) most of the cost is in the water delivery infrastructure ands its upkeep. Cutting off inner city customers who can't or don't pay doesn't really reduce any costs but if they stay shutoff it reduces the revenue of the system. Also the costs per person of water delivery systems in urban neighborhoods is much lower than the cost per person of water delivery systems in the suburbs or exurbs because of the greater distance between dwellings.<br> The logical ( but unlikely) way to handle the utility systems in a declining economy is triage them from the outside in. Cut off the water/sewer/roads/fire/police in the most dispursed areas in the outer rings of metropolitan areas and get the shrinking population to move in toward the center. But these outer areas are where the money and power reside so such an approach is unlikely. Yet another reason why the road to decline will be steeper than it has to be. The elite and the population living on fantasy island are too senile and short sighted to make the right choices.<br><br>This also derectly relates to the end of the internet. Many of last weeks' posters proclaimed the ways that it was technically possible to make the internet work in the age of scarcity. But just as with water/sewer systems the hard choices to acheive the technicaly possible will run-aground on the back of decisions to retain the status-quo as long as possible.<br><br><a href=#c5998256127015235055 title="comment permalink">5/7/15, 8:47 AM</a><br><br>

Reading about the poor people of Detroit and Baltimore reminded me of a documentary about the US I've watched with my neighbour. It was about the american southwest; I remember they've been to Lousiana but can't remember the other states they visited. I do remember my neighbour's reaction to the views and general state of infrastructure and buildings though: 'This doesn't look like the richest nation on earth' he said, 'this looks more like a third world country!' He knows what he's talking about, too: he has been travelling to several countries in Asia and South America including Venezuela,India, Laos and Vietnam.<br> I have informed myself about peak oil,resource depletion and possible collapse for several years now and as a consequence I'm trying to implement some of the measures you've described in your 'green wizardry' blogs on a small farm here. My neighbour is no 'doomer', although he is aware of some of these issues since I don't leave him a choice and keep telling him about it from time to time, and he was quite shocked to see the state of affairs 'with his own eyes'; I think many people in industrialized countries outside the US think everything's still fine there, and finding out otherwise may be very unwelcome indeed.<br><br><a href=#c3957297507458292717 title="comment permalink">5/7/15, 11:23 AM</a><br><br>

I became familiar with your work a few months ago, and I have enjoyed it immensely. Thank you for doing what you do.<br><br>Last year, I wrote a comment on a discussion thread that amounted to something resembling "crash now and avoid the rush." I deemed it as a reclaiming of personal capital, taking it away from those who wield it to the world's undoing.<br><br>Since then, I have "unplugged" in a number of ways (and plugged in alternatively to simplified and, as you often point out, more interesting and rewarding ways). One thing that I jettisoned, was on-line commenting, so my very appearance here is a little like an alcoholic on Step 4 and a half wandering into a bar.<br><br>Several times recently (via recorded interviews), I have heard you quip: "What do you call an economist who makes a prediction? ... Wrong." I was thinking about that in the context of your work, and several parts of your most recent writing (May 6) motivated me to write. I do so with respect and friendship, but to ask you to consider somewhat of a critique.<br><br>I offer you this: You are an economist, and you make predictions. (I tend to agree with your assessments and your predictions, but I am taking issue with your comment about economists.) Like any economist, you analyze, evaluate, assess, and advise on matters of the movement of capital through the system that distributes resources and energy through our society (i.e., the economy). That you make predictions is abundantly clear.<br><br>Identifying an economist is a little like identifying pornography – I know one when I see one. I strongly suspect when you poke at economists the way you do, you are actually targeting the talking heads – the corporate and institutional cheerleaders who are really just street walkers for the cabal of multi-national corporations, crisis bankers, and their legitimizing store-front men in Washington. That’s all well and good, and I agree wholeheartedly with that targeting.<br><br>I do not pursue a quixotic mission to defend all economists nor some kind of sanctity for the marble halls of academia, rather what I think is important is that we allow space for true economists to evaluate and advise from a position of respect (as you would respect a blacksmith or farmer or bakery owner – as they, also, are all inevitably economists themselves).<br><br>The bigger picture is that economy and ecology are twin systems of the same meta-system of sustaining life (or, when gone awry, destroying it). I have written before that economy and ecology are an elegant marriage and a devastating divorce. Ecology concerns the movement of energy and matter through life systems. Economy concerns the allocation of energy and matter (resources) in the face of demand (sustaining life). Both concern the "house" (eco) and both concern life energy and matter. When ecology and economy are divorced, they destroy each other.<br><br>Like sexuality, we have a spectrum from street walkers and their pimps (mass-media economists and the cabal that they serve) to sacred intimacy between a married or otherwise committed couple (the natural economist and the common weal). Casting aspersions on economists broadly is like placing exploitative sex in the same category as true intimacy – the same physical act is performed, but with vastly different motives and results: one is transactional and exchanges money for exploitation, the other is life giving and life enhancing … the analogy to exploitative economics vs. natural, sustainable economics is strongly self-evident.<br><br>JMG, while I suspect there is a bit of “just having fun” with your quip (and targeting those economist street walkers who deserve every bit of it), I believe that respect for true economics (that which recognizes and otherwise promulgates that economics should be life sustaining) is essential in the world that we pursue. <br><br>Gregory Baird<br>Atlanta, GA<br><br><a href=#c9158706579248572121 title="comment permalink">5/7/15, 11:28 AM</a><br><br>

How very odd. Living in an area of poverty I see this frequently. Not just the shut off of utilities but the slow train wreck of failing City services. Just a few weeks ago a family member observed raw sewage bubbling up out of a manhole cover in the back alley. Now one see the City employees, daily pumping from the failed lift stations in the area the waste water which used to flow to the treatment plant in pipes. Similarly the City finances to make any meaningful repairs to such a system are gone. The only assets for the municipality are vacant unpaid tax properties and delinquent utility accounts. To disconnect a home is possibly a slow form of suicide as it just blights more areas of the small city. The original installations were made a generation ago using Federal Grant programs long gone.

And this proposal had a lot more things than just road improvements folded into it. I don’t think much of our current governor, but at least he laid out a proposal two years ago that would have (as I understand it) put the burden on those who use the roads and not entangled the funding with the school aid fund, the sales tax, and a bunch of other things. Perhaps if the proposal had been simply to raise the sales tax with all the proceeds going to road improvements, it would have had a better chance.<br><br>I just wonder if Michigan voters will ever figure out that they are the ones who elected these ultra-conservative, anti-government, anti-tax, term-limited idiots, and that they (the voters) are getting what they voted for.<br><br>And did you notice the proposal by the pro-marijuana people? “Legalize marijuana, tax it, and use the proceeds to improve the roads.” <br><br>@Cherokee Organics - re laws against collecting rainwater: water law developed much differently in the American west than it did in the east or in other former British colonies, so you can’t assume that the common law principles (or common sense principles) you are familiar with have any application in the western US.

When the City tried to require her to hook up to public utilities, the court said she was not required to be connected to the electric system but would need to be connected to the public water system (and presumably sewer system), although she is not barred from collecting and using rainwater for all or most of her needs. Sorry, but to me this makes sense as a matter of public health and safety in these particular circumstances (Florida - currently in drought, populated area, no viable alternative means of waste disposal).<br><br>However I do agree that wide scale attempts to enforce a city code like this where water has been cut off for non-payment is a potential detonator in a place like Detroit.<br><br><a href=#c2302929045455192050 title="comment permalink">5/7/15, 12:30 PM</a><br><br>

They utterly miss the point: the economy is tanking &amp; people know it despite rosy official declarations; Alberta effectively dropped every other viable economic subsystem before the altar of oil &amp; gas and until the price fell last year they could still pretend they had a viable economy.<br>The only opposition was the Wild Rose Party an ultra-conservative TEA party version of Conservative Party that is not a realistic vision of a viable future, but rather a collection of irate attitudes prompted by the vague anxiety caused by the cognitive dissonance between official claims and experienced economic reality. That cannot hold together for long and it didn't present a viable, realistic option.

We met with some people from the Boggs Center and got a tour of the east side of Detroit. To my surprise, one of the things we learned was that the water issues in Detroit go much deeper than simply poor people not being able to afford their water bills (although that is, without a doubt, no small part of it). Here are some of the things we learned:<br><br>* Detroit has the highest water rates of any major city in the Great Lakes region. <br>* Suburbs buy water from the City of Detroit at state-mandated discount rates. <br>* Because Detroit has de-populated and there is so much infrastructure necessary just to get the water to the suburban borders, and because water has to be sold to the suburbs at discounted rates, it is Detroiters who have to bear the brunt of all of that infrastructure cost.<br>* Water is being shut off to entire neighborhoods, not just house by house, even though there are people in those neighborhoods who are not behind on their water bills and never have been. <br>* Land in poor neighborhoods like those on the east side is being snapped up by real-estate speculators. Even the famed GM Packard plant in Hamtramck that closed in 1955 has been purchased by a South American billionaire.<br>* If you look at Detroit’s Master Plan, there is an obvious correlation between the neighborhoods where water shut-offs are occurring and the development ambitions of the City. <br>* The City has taken to attaching water bills to people’s property tax bills, so when the water bills can’t be paid, they can foreclose on the homes. <br>* Long story short, what’s going is an attempt by the City and the wealthy people in the shadows of the City government to deliberately push poor people out of the neighborhoods they want to re-develop. They don’t care where they go or even if they have the means to go, they just want them gone.<br><br><a href=#c8029434655647423910 title="comment permalink">5/7/15, 2:11 PM</a><br><br>

You don't have to impose a dictatorship to shut off the water of people who can't pay their bills; the system we've got now can do it perfectly well.

Toward the end, very large regions of the US are likely to become ungoverned zones, outside the last fraying bastions of the industrial age, and the people in those zones will have to worry about a lot of things but federal and state governments won't be among them.

My reasons for finally posting is in regards to the comments about the "Jade Helm" military exercise in the Southwest this summer. I've noticed quite a few comments of the conspiracy sort about this being a veiled attempt by the government to impose martial law or take over state governments. Doubtlessly, it may come to that but I think the simplest explanation is that the government is pre-positioning it's military assets to avert chaos in the Southwest. And chaos is likely to happen this summer due entirely to the drought situation. Most people are not aware that Lake Mead is dropping dangerously down to where the first of many contingency plans will be activated. When it hits 1075 ft, water to Arizona and Nevada will be cut or rationed per water agreements long established. This on top of a worsting drought, bad winter snowpack through much of the southwest and the prospects of another extremely hot summer, the likelihood of people losing it for lack of water is almost guaranteed. Then you have to factor in the definite possibility of brownouts if not major blackouts as hydroelectric power is a major part of power generation in the southwest. The power output of the dams have been continuously declining for years due to drought conditions and will probably get worst this summer. Finally, as a major portion of the food in the US is produced in this region, expect food prices to surge this year and spot shortages of certain items. This, I think, is why the operation is taking place now and in that particular part of the country. For if not, it sure is an amazing coincidence.<br><br><a href=#c7625492617833665851 title="comment permalink">5/7/15, 4:58 PM</a><br><br>

That's good. <br><br>Hello/Erika, I'll certainly consider another post on that -- won't be the first. I don't envy those of my readers who live in SF; it used to be a very pleasant town before the tech boom moved in on it. <br><br>Mark, good. Thank you. <br><br>Bernhard, even in the US, a lot of people have no clue just how much of this country has already entered the Third World. It's increasingly a matter of islands of faux-prosperity in a sea of increasing poverty and immiseration. <br><br>Gregory, I'm not an economist. An economist is someone who has a degree in economics and works in the field. The reason that I say what I do about them is that nearly always, when a person with an economics degree who's employed as an economist makes a prediction about the future, he or she turns out to be dead wrong. Do you recall how many economists during the housing bubble insisted that it wasn't a bubble and wouldn't pop? I certainly do, and so do a great many others; Nouriel Roubini, one of the very few who didn't, talks in an essay somewhere about trying to talk about the issue at an economics conference and getting the sound of crickets as a response. <br><br>I hear from time to time that this or that faction of economists has thrown off the shackles of conventional economic thought and is grapping with the realities of our environmental situation. Maybe I haven't been looking in the right places, but I haven't seen much beyond those claims -- not since the days of E.F. Schumacher, at least. I'll happily change my tune on the subject of economists, just as soon as I start seeing economic predictions from economists (as defined above) that are right at least as often as a tossed coin. I don't even require that from the whole field: a modestly sized group of economists who issue predictions that don't inevitably flop would be enough. <br><br>Michael, glad to hear about the story. I'll look forward to it!<br><br>Unknown, welcome to the deindustrial future. <br><br>Shastatodd, the thought of what Elon Musk would do to batteries to make them "sexy" is frankly stomach-turning...<br><br>Heather, my guess instead is that the cities will simply be the places where people have to go if they want the jobs and lifestyles that count as normal these days, and rural zones -- outside of those that are particularly well suited to agribusiness, until that goes messily bust -- will be left to those who can handle no services or police protection. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Justin, fascinating. Thanks for the link; I'll check it out. <br><br>Renaissance, yes, I noted that.

If one only counts conventional oil production, the USA hit peak in 2005, but has been able to prop up its oil production via fracking and deep water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Since nearly all of the recent gains in oil production have come from those two countries and oil production in the rest of the world has either been stagnant or declining, this would mean the global “total liquids” peak is likely to hit this year, with global oil production sliding downhill after that.<br><br><a href=#c5131830471981165858 title="comment permalink">5/7/15, 6:38 PM</a><br><br>

Mentally tearing down the house of dreams that had been built, and building a new one is a lot of hard work. <br><br>Your suggestion to read about people who had lived in similar times of economic contraction reminded me of an experience I had a few years ago while visiting my wife's hometown of Vladivostok, Russia. There, many people who choose to live in houses, not apartments as most well-to-do do, they live without running water, or heat, and electric is basically only available for lights. I remember it really wasn't a terrible experience, and I was fascinated with how they refrigerated their food in the summer, and were so self-sufficient. There were even bottles, upon bottles of homemade wine, which we managed to make a huge dent in while eating amazingly delicious, hearty Russian foods. <br><br>Reading this makes me realize how comfortable and enjoyable it was...

There will be plenty of conflict with out me or mine fueling it, better to get working on being a support system for those who are least involved in the struggles that threaten to disrupt the lives of all. I see proto soup kitchens forming here: looks like a good customer to me! <br><br>Interestingly this season demand for CSA shares has dropped, not good, I wish I knew what was going on there... maybe lots of folks don't have money up front to pay for it or humility to talk openly about the payment options. <br><br>Found a long abandoned scythe, I have it most of the way to properly sharp, already it cuts good, even though it is poorly fitted to me, thinking of getting a nice Austrian blade, but I might just stick with this salvaged beast.<br><br>Growing lots of oyster mushrooms, surprised how eager people are for them, I gotta improve capacity once the weather lets up after the weekend.

Southern Chester County where I live is still a very affluent area. But the cracks are forming. They just aren’t obvious.<br>The main street is now saturated with little restaurants; nine or ten of them. And the balance or retail activity is gift shops. It all looks pretty and nice and well off. I believe the local chamber of commerce actually hit their goal of creating a “quaint” retail environment to attract shoppers from the surrounding area. But forty years ago, there were “practical” retail establishments; a 5&amp;10, a hardware store, a department store and several men’s and women’s clothiers, not to mention a couple of banks.<br><br>So….from where have all these new restaurants come? The restaurant business is one of the riskiest business propositions out there; probably a 90% failure rate. And a credit line to open and run a business doesn’t materialize out of nowhere. From where have these new, hopeful restauranteurs raised the collateral for their new ventures?...mortgaged their homes, staked their life savings? Inquiring minds want to know.<br><br>Of course, the new WalMart Super Center has made practical retail activity obsolete. And the off shoring of well paid middle class jobs has forced the former middle class to take the plunge into business ventures of the riskiest and least secure kind…..and all entirely dependent on discretionary spending.<br><br>But the American middle class has not yet been completely bled of all of its financial resources.

Going by today's results, though (short version: Conservative majority + Labour gain have actually pushed England *closer* to a two-party system, while the SNP sweep Scotland) the only thing that's changed across much of the UK is that Labour is no longer smiling... (Apologies if the words "preaching" and "choir" come to mind in this next bit.) What you see is shifts at the periphery of the system first - regions that are at the edge of the system, that have a smaller population (so there's less inertia to overcome, it's easier for individuals to make an impact) and never had all the benefits of being part of the system compared to the core regions - hence Scotland, with a population of five million, moves faster than wealthier England, at fifty million, and both may well move faster than the up-to-now dominant USA, six times as big again. In this case it feels like a continuation of the breakdown of the British Empire with the loss of the colonies over the last century, and you can see the same pattern again in Europe (eg the rise of Syriza and Podemos).<br><br>I can't comment so much on the USA, so I don't know where to look for the pattern repeating in the same way I do for Europe, but you'd expect to see local shifts long before wholesale ones: there may well be breakaways (in spirit if not in law) long before whatever's left of the USA votes en masse for something other than the same old false promises. I get the impression the USA is rather further from becoming unglued, geographically speaking, than large parts of Europe (or "Europe" as an entity), but I might have a different take on the matter if I was actually living there. All the same - the divisions seem to be more internal than regional, and that along with the sheer number of people involved and the continuing relative comfort of large parts of the population (assuming the government/military machine continues to succeed in claiming enough resources to keep them in comfort), make me think that it's going to take a bit longer for a large-scale mindset shift to occur.<br><br><a href=#c3372262179291306061 title="comment permalink">5/8/15, 9:03 AM</a><br><br>

Even if systemic financial fraud and the offshoring of tens of thousands of factories wrecked the life prospects of millions of people and created gigantic and unsustainable imbalances, the problem is how you un-do all this.<br><br>Hate to say it but in my estimation it's not going to happen. What's done is done. And so the golden era of American middle class prosperity is over. <br><br>The Chinese elite know full well that they sit on a time-bomb of expectations of a Chinese multitude that have had their fill of poverty. They know that even their notoriously un-squeamish military won't be a match for more than a billion enraged people. Besides, in the event of mass insurrection, the man in uniform will get rapidly sick of shooting his own country-men. <br><br>So those offshored factories are not coming back from China. They mean jobs for many millions of Chinese. Given that the viability of the Chinese regime depends on those factory jobs, Beijing, which has never shown any inclination to play fair, certainly isn't about to play fair over this. Shareholder rights? Rule of law? Sez who? <br><br>Besides, our elites are so blinded by immediate self-interest as to preclude any possibility. <br><br>How about a re-build of America's industrial infrastructure? IMO, no chance. It's more fun and glamorous and maybe more profitable (for now) to gamble on Wall Street. <br><br>So, is this sucker going down? You bet, and the oligarchs will ride this sucker right down to zero.

Walking past marinas in the Oakland estuary with my wife and seeing acres of gleaming white plastic boats I would mutter, 30 more years, 30 more years. Whenever I heard complaints about traffic, I would mutter, 30 more years. My wife eventually became tired of my mantra and I stopped chanting it out loud. <br>A few weeks ago I realized that ten years had passed and my mantra should now be twenty more years. <br>Actually, more recent analysis of peak oil has shown that industrial economies don't wind down smoothly as the Hubbard bell curve shows but rather more raggedly and toward the end, more precipitously as collapsing sectors here and there fall on and tear down other parts of the economy in their freefall descent. <br>Meanwhile, forecasts in the press always assume growth as usual with no recognition that quite possibly we might be on the downslope of a bell curve.<br>Just yesterday some friends stopped by and we were talking about traffic congestion getting on and off our small island in SF bay and that by 2035 it was supposed to be completely unmanagable unless we built more bridges. So I said, in twenty years we won't have gas to drive cars so no traffic problem. Apparently I must have been mumbling because nobody in the room heard what I said and just kept on talking as if I hadn't said anything.

I really liked the way you highlighted the disconnect between the blanket faith that it won't happen here and faith in the future with the "isolated incidents" that are just happening here and there. This all too human psychology would be a major lolz fest if it weren't so disheartening. <br><br>Leif Christensen, <br>Your predicament is probably the norm and it's painful trying to find a way to some sort of resilience in our debt-servitude, property ownership world. "Collapse now and avoid the rush" is dark humor and contains an important truth, but it is too glib by half if intended as actual advice. One can't just go off and do sustenance farming in "rurl" America and expect to make it work among the meth-heads, massively unemployed, TV-addled, and obese-populated crashing local economies. You still have to have some way to make $$ to pay the taxes and buy some necessities, and that isn't going to happen while learning to farm. <br><br>If you are in the U.S., over at the Doomstead Diner, they have created a tax-exempt organization, Sustaining Universal Needs (SUN) that is trying to pioneer a model for building small intentional communities. They are trying to obtain sufficient funding to launch the first project in N.C. If you read the prospectus, SUN offers life-time access to a sizable acreage of land and a "long house" for community use (but not residence) along with a relatively small number of like-minded people. I think the minimum investment for you and up to three other family members is $10,000. You still have to provide your own residence, but that can be a temporary structure (e.g., an R.V), and you can come and go as you please. As buy in prices go, that is pretty low. We need more efforts like this and maybe people trying different ways to bring in people with skills who don't have the cash capital to set up their own homestead. Not a lot of pre-packaged solutions out there, I know, but then, even having a homestead in the boonies may not be the "optimal" solution for the next 30 years anyway.

I would reccomend JMG's The Long Descent, for a more detailed primer. Green Wizardry is another useful one. Also some of Sharon Astyk's work, such as Depletion and Abundance. <br>Here's the summary, though: Get your house well insulated, to the extent doing so is affordable. Learn to garden. Learn to preserve food. Start thinking about how you would manage various daily tasks without an abundance of electricity; how you might manage heating or cooling, cooking, etc. Where your water might come from. Where food is available, other than the grocery store.<br>The goal isn't to become some entirely self-sufficient survivalist. Personally, I garden, cook, preserve, start my own seeds, etc., and would have quite a struggle if the power were to go off tomorrow. Many of us would, probably most. But there are a lot of things you can do that would make such a scenario easier and more comfortable. Probably you can't provide all your food yourself -- even our much touted pioneer ancestors were buying salt, baking soda, flour, etc. But you Could substantially supplement your diet, and reduce your dependence on the store. (Plus, it's fun and the food tastes better). <br>If the house is well insulated, it requires less heating and cooling, which saves money now, as well as being much more comfortable, if the power goes out -- which it does all time, due to storms, or idiots running into power poles. <br>Etc.<br>nmontesano<br><br><a href=#c7525958676933542658 title="comment permalink">5/8/15, 12:30 PM</a><br><br>

I'll take a look at those books. <br><br>I've just been living in apartments with friends on the cheap, and I've been planning on moving onto a boat long before I ran across this site. Even though boat maintenance can be expensive, you're still saving a lot of time and money over an apartment if I do most of the maintenance myself.

Hard hitting stuff. I guess it's one of those 'can't see the first for the trees in the way' kind of things. The forest being simply - the times we are living in. Even for some of us who know this is happening - it's a hard slap to hear, then wake up and see how far along we are down that slippery slope.<br><br>One thing I want to question /interject that I think is related, but would like to hear what you and my fellow commenters think is this: <br><br>What about the prison-industrial-complex? What role is the for-profit prison system, the school-to-prison pipeline and the now ubiquitous private companies handling court fines and fees playing in all this?<br><br>From far-away Hong Kong, (so please correct me if I'm off-base for you on the ground there in the USA), I read &amp; watch the US news and am constantly reminded of Jean Valjean in 'Les Miserables'. Could there be a burgeoning serfdom/slavery labeled 'inmate-labour' using much the same system as was used in France in Hugo's day? I've read that in some states the laws against prison labour to outside entities have been abolished. <br><br>If so, this would directly answer Cherokee's bafflement as to why folks in CA don't just ignore a silly law of putting up a rain barrel. Because 1) as people have already said - The American Southwest has a history of taking their water-rights very seriously, but 2) scoffing at any laws could get you entangled in the net of never-ending fines and fees to a private collector or even land you in jail in the even tighter net of prisons. It's not like jay-walking in NYC in the 70's. From what I see, It's a well-laid trap.<br><br>It would also answer Buddhabythelake's comment (paraphrasing) - "with 'nonpersonhood', will we revert to some for of slavery/serfdom?" IMHO absolutely. Yes. IMHO, If history has taught us nothing it should have taught us that humans will do this to each other at every opportunity.<br><br><a href=#c5454524784098254873 title="comment permalink">5/8/15, 5:19 PM</a><br><br>

Human beings are so resourceful.<br><br>What I think helps is to look at the next ten years like this - imagine you keep living like you are today and in ten years you lose your corporate job and there is essentially no welfare system to fall back on any more. Basically, it's like the Depression all over again.<br><br>Imagine the same panic and helplessness you are feeling right now, but tomorrow you have no income.. that is the fate waiting for many, many people over the next x number of years.<br><br>However, think of the parallel universe in which in those ten years you spend nothing on consumer doodads so you can pay off your mortgage. Imagine you have adapted your house and garden to hand powered and solar technologies, have ten year old fruit trees, have chickens and home grown veg. Imagine you have learnt to cook and preserve food from your own land and local wasteland. Imagine that you have developed a really efficient rocket stove that locals are beginning to ask you to build for them. Maybe your home grown, home made condiments are also locally legendary. Imagine you have developed a network of similarly talented and capable friends. Now imagine you lose your corporate job tomorrow. Will your level of panic be the same? Of course not, because you have a year's worth of preserves in the cellar, a garden full of food, little need to use utilities, and the beginning of an alternative career building rocket stoves and selling condiments, and a community of supportive buddies.<br><br>This is the gift that TADR is handing to us.

It was on a PBS network noncommercial radio station, an interview with a journalist about his recent book on the politics of California's water shortage. I tuned in late and didn't catch his name or the book title. <br><br> There are three major differences between water demand in the current California drought and the last multi-year drought in the 1970s. One is of course massive water consumption for fracking. Another is that the population of the state has nearly doubled. The third is that orchard and vine crops like wine grapes and tree nuts have become more lucrative than row crops. Row crops are replanted every year and in dry years when fields are fallowed, the farmer loses the return on the crop but saves on seeds, labor, fuel, water etc. Trees need some water every year whether it rains or not, otherwise they die. Many orchards and vines are not productive for the first couple of years after they are planted, so you can't just fallow an orchard or a vineyard when it doesn't rain.<br><br> The big federal and state water projects are not delivering much water to farmers because some of what's left is set aside for wildlife and city dwellers. The big farmers who planted almonds and pistachios for export a few years ago are drilling very deep wells. Rights to underground water are not regulated in California. These deep wells deplete the aquifers and cause the land to sink, but the immediate result is that all the shallower wells in the vicinity go dry. <br><br>There are a lot of hamlets in the southern half of the Central Valley that were settled by small farmers a couple of generations ago. Their water comes from shallow wells, and the wells are dry now because their rich neighbors drilled much deeper wells. They have no water for crops. They have no water for bathing, cooking or drinking. They have no water, period. They are buying bottled water and trucked in water. These water delivery systems were set up to get the people through a temporary emergency, but the powers that be are starting to realize that a longer term solution is needed.<br><br>What solution would that be? Requiring the owners of deep wells to share a small amount of their water with their neighbors? It is to laugh. No details were given on the show, but the solution being imposed is to red-tag the houses of the people whose wells have gone dry. You don't have any water to flush your toilet; therefore your house is unfit to live in; move. Never mind that these people's houses and land is the only wealth they have and that the resale value is nothing if there is no access to water. <br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c7925281092803281930 title="comment permalink">5/9/15, 2:14 AM</a><br><br>

It is most certainly not fixed in stone; otherwise the legal profession would be out of a job!<br><br>It is also worth noting that a legal system can sometimes actually respond to crisis and occasionally even provide protections for the individuals that live within its jurisdiction. Is that not what happened in the aftermath of the social and economic disaster that was 1929 based on the lessons learned during that period? Often it takes a crisis for such an outcome though and it is usually after the dust has settled rather than a proactive policy.<br><br>I apologise for using quite provocative language to elicit a response about the rainwater harvesting issue, but those continuing responses have boggled my mind on many occasions now. I strongly suspect that people hang onto the: oh no, it is illegal to harvest rainwater because the state owns it – meme / response because it abdicates responsibility from that of the individual to the state that is imposing the laws for their own purposes.<br><br>Now I don't understand the historical considerations behind that - from my perspective - very unusual restriction and accept that there are cultural differences.<br><br>However, it seems very unusual that despite an ongoing serious drought, changes to rainwater harvesting laws in urban areas at least are not even on the table.<br><br>The reason that I point out that is because rainwater harvesting systems are completely paid for by the end user. The water authorities are missing out on a chance to charge a permit fee for such systems. Most urban runoff is completely wasted and ends up in the ocean. Heck, they can even be a fashion statement to some extent for the outwardly environmentally conspicuous, but at least they’ll do some good.<br><br>I point those facts out because to me as an outsider, your laws make absolutely no sense in the face of an ongoing and serious drought in the western states.

This almost happened here during the last serious drought and parts of this continent are still – even today - suffering a very serious and prolonged drought. It is no joke.<br><br>It is also worth mentioning that there is not even a consistent application of the rules across your country and this may reflect many historical and vested interests - but it still does not change my basic arguments.<br><br>One of the great benefits of maintaining your own rainwater harvesting systems is that you cannot hide from the environment that you live in. I survive entirely on rainfall here, which can be very variable and often fail during extremely hot summers for months on end. And despite that the garden is thriving, the orchard is thriving, and the wildlife is also thriving and they use this place as a haven during those conditions.<br><br>To my mind, if you cannot survive on stored rainfall alone and your centralised supply is of a concern, then you obtain more water storage tanks, use less water, have access to a permanently running stream or get the heck out of there. In accepting that limitation of relying only on stored rainfall though, you can begin to truly live within the area that you find yourself.<br><br>For if you don't accept limits to your consumption and you abdicate responsibility for that supply to someone else then you will never mature.<br><br>It is also worth noting that over here we have a great deal of trouble with wells (we call them water bores) during droughts because you are only ever as good as your neighbours who may decide - unbeknownst to you - to pump the ground water dry for their own purposes. Such systems only work when there is a great surplus of groundwater to draw from in the first place or there is a common understanding about its use.<br><br>I now feel that I have adequately stated my case and I will sit down quietly and consider your responses – if there even are any.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c2322570504471821838 title="comment permalink">5/9/15, 3:19 AM</a><br><br>

Except for a few times when I was near a road, the loudest sounds were the woodpeckers, the owls, and the wind in the trees. <br>I was thinking that an obvious way to get a jump on collapse is to cultivate only those interests and passions that require little or no money. Living outside, reading, writing, good conversation, will still be there even when we are poor. Even people who expect business as usual don't argue with me on this, so in this way I can stealthily help them collapse. <br>I've also been noticing a high correlation between TV watching and a false sense of security, or the belief that "it couldn't happen to me." Most of the people I have real conversations with don't have TV, because 1) it's better to spend limited income on what you really need, and 2) it's a lot more fun to watch TV at the tavern where we can collectively ridicule it. If I talk about pileated woodpeckers to a TV addict, they will invariably divert the discussion to a nature program they saw. TV seems like a reality prophylaxis, as if it makes people uncomfortable with direct experience. <br>I tested the idea that the internet may not be around forever last night on a few TV watchers and got the usual response. Then I raised this issue some off-TV people and we discussed resources, power grids, toxic waste, etc., without the automatic denial. Interesting.<br>@Caryn. I also have thought about the prison-industrial complex, as a trap for everyone who becomes poor. (At least poor in the traditional sense, as opposed to living with a light footprint.) I am hoping the expansion of prisons will eventually be limited by lack of tax revenue, as all the ponds dry up. There is a breaking point where they cannot extract more revenue in fines, court fees, etc. , when you can't get blood from a stone. In the meantime though, collapsing in place inevitably will involve violation of ordinances, and the art of avoiding attention or confrontation. I had a very chilling conversation with an acquaintance who is retired from the state police about this. He says that being poor will be just as dangerous as being black. (He is a black guy who knows rascism) He would say that being invisible is the best security.<br>I am not expecting outright, widespread slavery in the future only because it is cheaper to have wage slaves. Since everybody thinks they are "free" in a free market system, security is much easier for the elites. And when there are fewer jobs to go around it is easier to expel excess people than to enslave them.<br>I think keeping a low profile is important for a safe collapse.<br><br><a href=#c2452435237625401667 title="comment permalink">5/9/15, 11:11 AM</a><br><br>

For<br>approximately 150 years, water issues have been at the core of economic, cultural, and<br>political life in the region. Yet, despite the regional importance of water allocation and<br>management, and the tremendous investments in infrastructure and technology, water resource management in the American West is generally based on poorly conceived laws and policies. To the outsider looking in, the region offers a wealth of lessons—perhaps more negative than positive." http://www.colorado.edu/geography/geomorph/envs_5810/kenney_04.pdf<br> The laws are being challenged, and changed, all the time. We (well, some of us)here well understand the importance of water; this is a region where the water wars began in the 1800s, and they never really stopped, although they quieted down for awhile, before beginning to heat back up again about a decade or so ago. The climates of the various states are remarkably different, ranging from maritime temperate to desert, but it is climate normal to have no rainfall for months every summer. Historically, summer water comes from snowmelt, which fills the rivers and the reservoirs. The disaster hitting now is that there's virtually no snow. Rainwater catchment is going to have to become standard for people to survive, and it should have done so long ago. (Although lately, we've been having relatively dry winters, too.) So are graywater systems. Laws are lagging as far behind in this area as they usually do, but some useful changes have been made. My state now has an alternative building code, with (expensive) permit fees for things like graywater systems, and it allows rainwater catchment, although subject to some of the earlier-mentioned caveats. Water law here dates to the 1800s, and the water is overallocated. Some rivers are actually pumped dry. There's one in the town where I work that is largely dependent on effluent from the sewage treatment plant, for volume in the summer -- while farmers absolutely dependent on it, pump steadily out of it for irrigation. A bit mind-bending, a awhile back, to hear the city explaining to an activist that using graywater to irrigate city parks, instead of potable treated water, would be detrimental to the river. Just to pile on the irony, we've cleverly put a landfill above (literally; the trash is in a massive pile) the river, upstream from all those farm fields. On a bend in the river. In a region subject to subduction zone earthquakes.<br> It was just approved for expansion, over the vehement, years-long protests of local opponents. Now headed for a few more years of legal appeals.<br> California, a dry region, has been forced, via draining rivers, into a lush, verdant landscape that produces much of the nation's produce. Now they're in crisis. Not helped by the contamination of aquifers used for drinking water, by fracking effluent.<br>So, yeah, rainbarrels are needed, although I'm not sure how much they'll help the farmers referenced by Deborah Bender. Or the farmers dependent on riverwater for irrigation here, for that matter. This is a heavily agricultural area. The problem is just ... massive, and very, very hard to address. The infighting among competing users does not help the effort to come up with a more sensible system.<br><br><a href=#c8774295753900302055 title="comment permalink">5/9/15, 11:12 AM</a><br><br>

One of those is rainfall, which falls abundantly in NZ, yet hardly at all over most of Australia. Even where we are, that is a tropical coastal region with heavy rainfalls over 4-5 months in summer, this year we've received less than half the average rainfall - and now that it is May, the next 6 months are the "dry winter" months so very little, if any rain, is expected. Out in the dry west, farmers and graziers are facing dire futures.<br><br>With good preparation though, one can certainly have enough water to make it through the dry winter and beyond, since we get 1600mm easily over 3 months in the summer: we have a large water tank and a bore supply. We are surrounded by bush land (not agricultural use) so the bore water is fairly safe (though the taste is still unfavourable). More importantly though, we are learning to conserve as much as possible, even with our dual water sources. Another water tank is planned next year, and I'm researching a compostable outdoor toilet, where the worms transform waste into compost for the garden. <br><br>One step at a time...

I don't mind your humorous takin'-the-mickey style at all. You are very much appreciated here. I've also visited your blog and found it above my head, but trying to grasp- hopefully for my future understanding. Looking forward to the 2nd 1/2 of your story!!!<br><br>Personally, I don't live in the land of the free and the home of the brave (most of the time) anymore. That phrase actually makes me want to cry these days. As an expat - a foot in two worlds= confusion. <br>IMHO, Americans are no different than other cultures at their core. They've just had different experiences and expectations. Sure, when things get bad enough, not just abstractly, "I saw it on the news" bad, but "Hey! The tap's not coming on!" bad, they will break laws regardless of the consequences or risks. In China, we call that "breaking someone's rice bowl". They have no alternative but to fight to the death, because that's what they're facing anyway. It's a very foolish thing to do.<br><br>I think the stupor and inaction now, on taking things into their own hands may be because most Americans have no personal experience in living with real want and an indifferent or ineffectual (government) authority. It's just never been THAT bad in the living memory of almost any born-&amp;-bred American.<br><br>I mean, we saw on the news the mess of New Orleans post Katrina, people on their roofs, people fainting from thirst in the Huston Astrodome, Fema trailers that stayed for years with little to no rebuilding….. 2 DAYS after the waters receded post- tsunami in Sri Lanka, peasant fishing villagers old and young, were on the beach gathering driftwood and scrap and rebuilding their homes. They were told to stop. They didn't. It would never have occurred to them to wait for help or meekly obey their indifferent authorities. (** in fact, they were told to stop because an investor wanted their 'abandoned' beach-front land to build a resort hotel and displace them, they were quite right to act quickly) They've always known a world in which there is no help. Today's Americans have never known a world without help, emergency services, some semblance of infrastructure a somewhat responsive governmental authority…. I remember a 60-minutes show about a NO resident who had seen the Sri Lankans on the news and decided "Hey! Why didn't WE do that?" "I'm going to DO that!" So she got busy organizing a grass-roots rebuild in her neighborhood. <br><br>I think that's the whole or at least the biggest point here in our gracious host's virtual living room: Wake Up! It IS happening! We can blame them for their own stupor, but up to a point, IMHO, as those powers that be and media circus is pulling every trick out of their hats to keep the populace in that stupor and inactive. I can't feel superior to them as it could easily be me there if circumstances had been different, and there will still be ways my family will probably be caught out when it all hits the fan.<br><br>On another note: I would bet a lot of the people buying up all that overpriced real estate in OZ are wealthy mainland Chinese trying to just park their money before it all blows up here too. Ni Hao! ;)<br><br><a href=#c3606861675167479807 title="comment permalink">5/9/15, 4:40 PM</a><br><br>

Scott Fitzgerald story "Bablylon Revisited," who observes, "I did [lose a lot in the crash]... but I lost everything I wanted in the boom." It's painful to contemplate some of the things we've already lost, and are in danger of losing, "in the boom," which will make the consequences of those shutoff valves more acute.<br><br>A real-world case in point: a mile and a half from my house, there is a complex of three enormous commercial greenhouses, each one enclosing well over an acre. They have been unused for nearly a decade, and they're perpetually slated for demolition as soon as the owner of the parcel they're part of can finalize the funding. The plan is to cede some of the land to the town to use to straighten an adjacent road, and turn the rest into a development of McMansions. Whatever well-deserved fate eventually befalls the McMansions won't bring back the greenhouses.<br><br>The funding, though, keeps getting delayed by successive recessions and budget crunches. That that will continue to happen seems a pretty safe bet.<br><br>The greenhouses were last used commercially to grow roses. They're now filled with feral plant life including trees, sustained by rainwater through panes broken from petty vandalism. But there's enough intact glass to fully repair two of the buildings by cannibalizing the third.<br><br>I've walked or rode past them practically every day for years, but recently they've been on my mind (in ways that might bear discussion on your other blog). An already-lost treasure... or perhaps not. In most scenarios either I or the greenhouses or both will be long gone before any opportunity to have any say in their fate arises. Even if they came up for auction under real-estate market collapse conditions, taxes on the nominal land value, code compliance costs to put any of the structures to any use at all, and other costs would be well out of the reach of even a group of dedicated preservationists.<br><br>But if things go just right... or just wrong... maybe the greenhouses can be saved by the crash.<br><br>I can imagine squatting there, preferably with others, using my making-do technical skills to reclaim useful greenhouse space a little at a time, and hoping that whoever might be in a position to stop us chooses to help us in the endeavor instead.<br><br>I can spend some time in advance developing more specific applicable skills, but not much, because it's such a long-shot possibility. Next step: learning more via creative trespassing, under the cover of (genuine) photographic interest.<br><br><a href=#c8071316780409154783 title="comment permalink">5/9/15, 5:07 PM</a><br><br>

His job was to drive along the canal and turn the head gates, making water go where it was legally called; watching this I have some appreciation of the complexity.<br><br>You see the water infrastructure in the West, especially the mountains, is very sophisticated and was built over a long time, many Empires claimed and left the land and the water law was passed down with to the next guy. Today I have a good buddy living on the edge of the posh upper class bubble city of Fort Collins who farms with water rights granted by the King of Spain! The ditches were physically designed to fullfil the rights as written, so each new comer had to inherit the old laws simply because not doing so would involve very disruptive retrofits to the entire infrastructure. The laws and their complexity have built up over time still generally governed by a principle of seniority rules.<br><br>That's some old history, some new history is that my Dad was so good at his job because he is about the hardest person to stay mad at who has ever lived; just something about the way he is. Guns and well sharpened shovels were brought to bare over slight disagreements on how the ditch should be set on a given occasion. This is one of the reasons the laws are so complex, puts matters in the hands of a priesthoo,d if you catch my meaning.<br><br>You're not wrong that things can change, and its worth mentioning that many in the west do harvest and store water; but if they did they will still be wise to deny that anyone could lest an unfriendly neighbor google their internet posts.<br><br>My compromise? Practice the skills to do proper tank storage, have the equipment to do so brought in in the service of non water storage projects, land scape in a way that doesn't store water (technically) but might slow its leaving down to an negligible (but existent) rate.<br><br>Things could change, and I wonder how much of the infrastructure that makes this region livable will survive that turmoil. Alot hinges on that question.<br><br>Of course the last two weeks it been raining cats and dogs, never seen nor heard of anything like it. Everything is drenched and flooded with still water.<br><br><a href=#c6256928798761120040 title="comment permalink">5/9/15, 5:35 PM</a><br><br>

I don't think anybody here was trying to use the existence of laws against rainwater harvesting as an excuse for not doing something. Several of us were just trying to tell you that, despite your personal incredulity, such laws do exist in the U.S.<br><br>Likewise, I don't think anybody here is going to argue with you about the importance of rainwater harvesting. I think that applying your ultimate test - if you can't survive on the available rainwater, then you should move - would result in an awful lot of people recognizing that they should move.<br><br>But what about changing laws that prohibit rainwater collection? I can't speak to that, not living in such a jurisdiction. As Tip O'Neill said, "all politics are local," so whether you can get a law changed is going to depend on a lot of factors that outsiders may not be able to judge. But there's an interesting post from the National Conference of State Legislatures (link below) describing recent changes in the laws of several states encouraging rainwater harvesting. (So maybe we're not as backward as you think)<br><br>There's also this interesting bit of information: we're not talking abut rainwater belonging to the State. "In some states, such as Colorado, previous water law stated that all precipitation belonged to existing water-rights owners, and that rain needed to flow to join its rightful water drainage. However, a 2007 study conducted by the Colorado Water Conservation Board and Douglas County determined that only 3 percent of rain actually reached a stream or the ground. Colorado followed-up by enacting two pieces of legislation, one allowing certain types of well owners to use rainwater and one authorizing pilot development projects."<br><br>http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/rainwater-harvesting.aspx<br><br>So one of the claims against changing the law could be that the state is depriving existing water rights owners of valuable property rights - a taking that requires just compensation by the state. That kind of claim can throw a real wrench into proposed revisions if the law.<br><br><a href=#c3948417030701291947 title="comment permalink">5/9/15, 6:27 PM</a><br><br>

Having said that, the +50 per cent vote for Scottish Nationalist Party is a mind boggling change. It seems the de-industrialisation of old Britain has finally caught up with our Labour Party. (If we had something more like SNP rather than UKIP south of the Border, there would perhaps have been a similar shift in the old industrial and urban areas.) <br><br>One commentator has said that democracy has failed the poor. My view is that the old view of life changes when irreversible decline sets in. Arguably we already have the obvious first instalment. By no means have we had a catastrophe yet, but our social democrat institutions - essentially post-war European model - no longer distribute / share power in useful ways.<br><br>We transferred our need for a replacement Empire, resources, finance and etc. to the USA hegemon and latterly significantly to EU. The more Britain now 'Americanises' attempting to find a new model, the tighter the screws will turn. <br><br>We could, perhaps stand a loosening or break-up of the UK within a reasonable EU-frame, but are not likely to cope at all with a break-up of both UK and EU - and the latter might well follow the former if we leave the EU.<br><br>We don't know who we are anymore.

If my memory serves me correctly the energy per capita on a world wide basis peaked in 1985 or 87. This was driven by rising population more than oil supply issues. Since then we have had increasing population with only a small increase in oil supply. Therefore the the current situation is worse. If you factor in the increased consumption of energy by the oil industry to produce oil the situation would clearly be worse. Bottom line is that energy per capita has been going down steadily for about 30 years. <br><br>Tomxyza<br><br><a href=#c755347244263223386 title="comment permalink">5/10/15, 7:50 AM</a><br><br>

And I don't mean to imply that there won't be an elite. Jefferson and Adams' letters debated who constituted the natural aristoi; in the world that is coming, the "elite" will have to demonstrate that ability in some other way than "consuming" planet earth and reducing those economically deleveraged beneath them to something other than "human resources" (serfs) or "human commodities" (slaves). Slavery will no doubt be tried again. Part of the glory of the Middle Ages was that it tried to wend a way out of the slavery-dilemma, where rich and corrupted and degenerate oligarchies sat around and had others do the jobs they depended on for their opulence, but wouldn't do themselves. The last straw was the army - when no more Romans were virtuous enough to at least serve as centurions and inspire respect in their barbarian recruits, the final death knell sounded. The Church recreated society by abolishing slavery and accepting degrees/hierarchy that were adjusted or local conditions. In the future, it will probably be those who carry this project even further (people who serve voluntarily and demonstrate the knowledge of how to embody that in teaching others) who reform a legitimate elite. Seed-savers, druids, protectors (paladins), healers...it will probably have a deeply geocentric tinge, but it will need to draw on the inherited wisdom of Tradition and adjust it for peculiar conditions, without losing purity.<br><br><a href=#c9173687338360993317 title="comment permalink">5/10/15, 11:53 AM</a><br><br>

There are thousands of retired adults relocating to AZ and FL each year. Who would have ever thought the "over 55" community would be thing 30 years ago? Those retired adults who remain where I live in PA do weekly bus trips to casinos and other sites, play games together, go out to eat daily and have an incredibly busy social life. I rarely see grandparents with grandchildren when I am out running errands.<br><br>In our family both sets of grandparents removed themselves from the grandparenting role immediately when our first child was born. My parents moved to Florida and my husband's parents have an 7 day a week social schedule that requires us to book time with them 5 weeks in advance. I can get in my hairdresser easier.<br><br>Our family life now is nothing like we expected. Growing up both of us spent every Sunday night at our grandparents having dinner and sharing the same family stories over and over again. We even went on vacations with our grandparents along. Our children basically have no relationship with their grandparents and many tears have been shed about this and many arguments had, but I keep in perspective that so many children have it much worse in terms of family life. I've also learned that I am not alone in this dilemma as many children have no relationship with grandparents not just to the moving and social schedule, but also because of the divorce rate and relocation of families too. Its a crazy time to raise kids.<br><br><a href=#c2947356535496117594 title="comment permalink">5/11/15, 10:45 AM</a><br><br>

Oswald Spengler predicted that the next great civilization would emerge out of Russia and the world’s next great religious movement would grow out of Russian Christianity. More and more, I think that is yet another prediction by Spengler that turned out to be right on the money. A lot of other leading philosophers, historians and spiritual teachers from the 19th and early 20th centuries thought the same thing. David Goldman, who writes for the Asia Times under the pen name Spengler, wrote a column several months ago where he argued that predictions of Russia’s demise that were so common even a year or two ago were very much premature, much like the famous quote from Mark Twain concerning premature reports of his death.<br><br>Speaking of Russia’s newly found self-confidence and religious faith, have any of you seen this? The Saker is right; this is likely a harbinger of things to come:<br><br>http://thesaker.is/something-truly-amazing-happened-today/<br><br>You may also wish to pay close attention to General Shoigu in the future; he is one of three or four people who have been consistently mentioned as likely candidates to succeed Vladimir Putin when he steps down as President of the Russian Federation. When I was watching coverage of the Victory Day parade, I noticed that Shoigu, right after formally reporting to Putin and shaking his hand, walked over to greet Chinese president Xi Jinping. President Xi stood up and shook Shoigu’s hand as if they were friends and equals. I believe that General Shoigu is the odd on favorite be Russia’s next president and Xi is probably thinking the same thing as well.<br><br>I have a lot of friends who are ex-military or are military history/technology buffs who are really impressed with the new Russian armored vehicles that were unveiled, such as the T-14 Armata tank and the Kurganets-25 infantry fighting vehicle. The T-14 in particular is a radical new design that is a clean break with both the post-Soviet designs the Russians have been building so far and current Western designs. A growing number of military experts are saying that Russia has grabbed a major lead in armored vehicle design and technology:<br><br>http://defense-update.com/20150509_t14-t15_analysis.html<br><br>Meanwhile, as Russia and China introduce impressive and innovative new weapons systems like the Armata, the Kurganets-25, the J-20 and T-50 stealth fighters, the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile and any number of ultra-advanced supersonic cruise missiles coming out of both Russia and China, we continue to piddle away our military resources on futile wars in the Middle East and wasteful corporate welfare schemes such as the F-35 and Littoral Combat Ship that probably never will perform anywhere close to spec. As one blogger and former Marine put it, “We're gonna get our a** whipped in the next war and the seeds of that failure are being planted today.” <br><br>Twilight’s Last Gleaming, anyone?<br><br><a href=#c8770206565459766808 title="comment permalink">5/11/15, 2:45 PM</a><br><br>

I've had a spate of experiences in the last week that make me feel like we've hit that point. <br><br>For anyone who wants to communicate the concept of "externalities" to the uninitiated, I highly recommend visiting <a href=http://jhenryfair.com/aerial/index.html rel=nofollow>Industrial Scars</a>, the web site of aerial photographer Henry Fair, who is featured in this month's Audubon magazine. He largely photographs landscapes from the air, documenting the immense damages wrought by industrial processes. It's not for the faint of heart and, definitely, a picture is worth 1,000 words. Fair, quoted in the Audubon magazine, stated, “The problem remains the same: People just don’t care, and I don’t know why.” He hopes to change some of that with his photography. I wish him luck.<br><br>I read last week that the U.S. auto market has come roaring back. Sales of SUVs and luxury trucks (average sales price of $42K) are leading the way, given that gas is so cheap. What's amazing is that the AVERAGE loan length is now well over 5 years - something like 69 months, with some loans approaching 80 months. Apparently extreme debt is now 'negative income'. I can't help but think what will happen when the price goes up to $4/gallon or higher again????<br><br>I listened to a speaker yesterday who serves as a chaplain to prisoners in our local county jail. He was detailing the financial difficulties inmates face in trying to turn their lives around - for example, to join the paying work crew while in jail, they have to pay $5 cash per day, but there are very specific rules (and punishments) about other people bringing them money (even from their own bank accounts), so some aren't able to pay and so can't work. If they have fines or other costs from their court cases (and many do), those fines accrue interest at 12% a year, with the end result being prisoners discharged with thousands of dollars owed due to loan fees. In some larger urban jails, over half the prisoners qualify as mentally ill. And so on. I've never been a softie for those in jail, but I came away with a much better understanding of how so many never escape the rabbit hole. It seemed so hopeless.<br><br>It seems the more places I look these days, the more I find Peak Insanity. You'd think more people would notice. I guess I'll end with a few song lyrics from my new favorite singer, Nahko in his song "Vultures of Culture"<br><br>"It's unbelievable, all the slow movin' people<br> And they could care less, just as long as they are comfortable<br> It's unforgivable, because the conditions now are critical<br> And whether or not you're ready we are now approachin' a pinnacle<br> It's difficult to say exactly what to do<br> But the change begins with me and I reflect it back to you"<br><br>***********************<br>Better go get some of that change going.....<br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c3568614403680306113 title="comment permalink">5/11/15, 2:53 PM</a><br><br>

She keeps us updated on Facebook, showing how she's using rocket stove technology and melting snow in the winter to survive and keep warm. This is someone who has two part-time jobs, but simply can't afford to get the pipes replaced or the central heating unit replaced again. <br><br>The second friend does have running water and electricity, but does not have the funds to run the heat in the winter, and so "bundles up" and eats lots of soup, even during bitterly cold winters. She also has a job. <br><br>Another group of friends are, essentially, squatters who are unemployed and can't find new work, so they have taken over a block of houses and are working on making an intentional community there. Because they aren't legal residents, they can't get power or water. They are using rainwater harvesting, solar panels, and rocket stoves. <br><br>Even outside of the city, where I live, power is often a challenge. We routinely lose power for anywhere from several days up to nine days (the last nine-day power outage was last November--thank goodness for a woodburning stove). Practically every time a major storm comes through, we lose power. Because of the poor condition of the power grid, the storms come and the power company (DTE) gets overwhelmed and can't get everyone's power back online quickly. Some use generators--I just learn to live without. Neighbors who have been here a long time (like my next door neighbors who have lived here almost 40 years) tell me the power never used to go out like it does now. <br><br>People, especially those outside of the Detroit Metro area, or outside of Michigan don't believe me when I tell them this stuff. They tell me that nobody goes without power for 9 days in America. They tell me that nobody in the US lives without heat in the bitter winters. But its real, and its here.<br><br><a href=#c6402339341532108954 title="comment permalink">5/11/15, 6:45 PM</a><br><br>

That's good to know; they have a reputation in the hoodoo scene that goes well beyond the Baltimore area. It's a useful reminder of the kinds of businesses that thrive even in really hard times...<br><br>David, that sort of loaded language may make you feel good but it does nothing to help you communicate with people who don't already agree with you. Are you familiar with the concept of "defector syndrome" -- i.e., the way that radicals routinely pitch their arguments so that only those who already agree with them will listen? It's not helpful -- not if you actually want to make change. <br><br>Buddha, I doubt it. The last years of the Roman world were plagued by massive population decline and labor shortages, thus the prevalence of slavery and its transition to serfdom. We've got the opposite problem -- as we proceed down the curve, anyone who has the resources to provide a basic diet to laborers will have all the help he or she can use, and since wage slaves are cheaper than the other kind, I expect slavery as such to be relatively rare until the population decline has gone very far. <br><br>Varun, that's what I'm hearing from all over. I hope you're braced for the impact! <br><br>Chloe, granted, I was misled by the polls before the UK election like everyone else!

More on this in an upcoming sequence of posts. <br><br>Wolfgang, I tend to think of the SF Bay area as one of the major epicenters of delusional thinking in the US, so it's not surprising that you're getting that kind of reaction. <br><br>Jeff, make time to laugh about it!

Please give the post on the GOP's "Christian" devil-worshippers as much additional circulation as you can. One of the core things that wrecked the GOP's crusade against gay marriage was the way that so many gay-bashing GOP politicians turned out to have boyfriends, or a long string of less durable gay liaisons; if those who preach LaVey's Satanism under the cloak of Christianity start being called on it repeatedly in public, certain kinds of nonsense might become much less common in the US. <br><br>LL Pete, by the same logic, I can't understand people who've had a frontal lobotomy without having one myself, and therefore I should run out and get one! No, I've got a better idea -- throw out your own TV, and ditch your other connections to pop culture. I don't care what Camille Paglia says; they're wasting your time and harming your ability to think. <br><br>Candace, thanks for the link. <br><br>Caryn, the prison-industrial complex is a government subsidy for corporations; I don't expect it to last long once governments start going broke. As I noted earlier, slavery flourishes where there's a labor shortage, either in general or for specific jobs; with seven billion starving people chasing any opportunity to stay fed, wage slavery is much cheaper. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, good. My working guess for Europe -- though admittedly it's just a guess -- is that it's going to go under once the mass migrations from the Middle East and Africa get under way. The current migrations are merely harbingers -- imagine twenty or thirty million starving people, many of them armed with the weapons of defunct armies or insurgent movements, streaming into Europe every year for decades to come. The mass migrations in the wake of the Roman collapse, again, are a good model.<br><br>Caryn, of course -- that's usually the rhetoric of a dominant elite, to borrow Toynbee's phrase. It's the rhetoric of those outside that narrowing circle, though, that defines the future. <br><br>Doctor W., I saw that! As for putting it off limits, not a chance. I hereby proclaim that as long as <i>The Archdruid Report</i> lasts, whether on the internet, print media, cave paintings, or whatever, the word "frack" and its derivatives, such as "motherfracker", shall always be welcome here. Dear readers, if you want to turn the air blue with profanity, here's an expletive you can use freely. I look forward, in fact, to the day when, in imitation of the famous Army sergeant on D-Day discussing the condition of a defunct jeep, the sentence "The fracking fracker's fracked!" rings out loud and bold. Take due notice thereof, and govern yourselves accordingly. ;-)<br><br>Grebulocities, wasn't it Sinclair Lewis who pointed out that you can't make a man understand something if his income depends on not understanding it? <br><br>Jonathan, exactly. Exactly. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, exactly. The farm families of California are about to become the Okies of the new Dust Bowl. More on this in an upcoming post!<br><br>Cherokee, funny. I seem to recall reading that some sheila ran up to Prince Harry on his recent departure from Australia and proposed marriage to him on the spot. Rather like your outburst here, really: brash, amusing, and utterly disconnected from the issues surrounding a complex legal reality with a long history behind it. I'll just repeat: it's not that simple, not for those who actually have to deal with the consequences. <br><br>Iuval, whether or not we're passed Peak Empire actually has very little to do with whether we've passed Peak Landlord -- one of the many things that using a catchall label such as "Empire" tends to obscure.<br><br><a href=#c5147820423368760427 title="comment permalink">5/11/15, 11:06 PM</a><br><br>

Whole systems are whole systems, after all...<br><br>Shane, yes, I noticed that.

She's right: it's old, about 40 years old, but every handful of years I pick it up and it's amazing how incisive he is about ...well, the COURAGE to create or envision things that have not ever existed before.<br><br>that makes you feel insane. terrified. un-moored.<br><br>i thought of this because you're writing fiction, and you write so much, you're such a love. you want to share. and that's what we need now:<br><br>artists are shamans, and we need those with the mental strength and courage to stumble in the terror of the unknowing darkness to envision different possibilities, directions, warnings.<br><br>part of my terror about being in san francisco during the end of it, is that these tech people (and all the ancillary businesses making bank because of 'em), have manifested the creepiest vision that makes absolutely no sense from ANY standpoint. they're not even in all this for any proverbial "girl."<br><br>this city WAS the "girl" for many of us! <br><br>now it's just greed and snarkiness and hunched over people never looking up but wanting more more more.<br><br>so we need new visions. visionaries. get that COURAGE TO CREATE book. it's a classic that i heard about as a baby art chick in philadelphia in the 80s.<br><br>good luck, and have at it! i wish you well because writing fiction had me babbling madly. don't fear the mystical things that'll start to happen as you listen to people and intuit more. then you realize the mystical isn't "mystical" at all, but regular life. and that's cool when you don't freak out at gifts all the time like i used to. i'm always underlining and trying to capture things, which is killing them for me right now that i need to just let them be.<br><br>now i'm in the part of not knowing squat. or admitting it. admitting i'm not SUPPOSED to know squat. so i'm dying to read good visions/ideas/possibilities.<br><br>so what you've never done fiction? this is what this age is gonna be all about now, isn't it? <br><br>x<br><br>erika<br><br><a href=#c580455832945404397 title="comment permalink">5/12/15, 5:54 PM</a><br><br>

Yeah, I know, some bond yields have gone back up a bit lately. Nonetheless, to me negative interest rates indicate an economy and financial system in extremis. The money-men go charging into loss-making financial instruments for fear that the alternatives will lose them more. If there is to be a crash I think we won't have long to wait.<br><br>And then what? <br><br>It's not hard to imagine difficult conditions igniting bloody purges. Or cobbled together "courts" serving up rough and ready "justice" without the obsessing over legalistic niceties taught at law school. But I think that actions taken in the midst of the crash will serve as the template for the post-crash society including the legal system. So I think that caution is in order. <br><br>Now, I understand that time and resources may be scarce things in a post-crash landscape and I doubt that there will be a lot of patience for lawyerly hair-splitting. No matter, there needs to be the basics of fairness and proportionality applied no matter the howls for retribution. This doesn't mean that the authors of a disaster get off easily. But guillotines? Need to be careful with those. Need to keep an eye to the future. You know, what was done in the past - ie our own actions from the perspective of coming generations - justifying what's done in the present. <br><br>I'm no religious scholar. But I wonder about the authorship of the Ten Commandments. Did they happen after centuries of distillation and pruning? After all it seems that they arose after people had been leading settled agricultural lives for millennia. Not hard to imagine people discussing such things around their home fires or big thinkers of the times talking in the court-yard of the local boss-man. <br><br>Or were they devised by desperate people on the run after a civilizational collapse? Like I said, I'm not qualified to judge as I know nothing about the cultural and historical context in which they arose. But just looking at the simplicity and brevity I like the people-on-the-run scenario. We could do worse post-crash than come up with such a useful code.<br><br><a href=#c1021721785036601025 title="comment permalink">5/13/15, 9:19 AM</a><br><br>

The well pumped the water into the cistern and then it moved to the house/field. I bought this book two years ago thinking about building one - Water Storage, by Art Ludwig. It is very detailed and has enough diagrams and directions for guidance on above ground water storage. <br><br>They also sell plastic cisterns with man hole size covers that would need to be buried. The plastic would degrade in the sun over time. The big hole is to be able to climb in and clean it out if necessary.<br><br>This is one of the projects that requires a back hoe, loss of a couple of great shade trees, and a permit and a plumber so we have put it off thinking we might move too. <br><br>I have 35 gallon water barrels in the basement on furniture moving dollies from Harbor Freight for when the power goes out.

Its municipal government is infested with kleptocrats worthy of the Brezhnev politburo, private-sector asset-strippers roughly in the post-Soviet oligarch mold have been circling the city's infrastructure like sharks, and the governments of Detroit's suburbs and the state of Michigan are heavily in the sway of tacitly racist bourgeois supremacists who want to obliterate the city out of a combination of bigotry, resentment, and fear. <br><br>It's impressive that Detroit has not undergone major civil unrest in decades. Given its circumstances, it's no less overdue for a hot summer than Ferguson and Baltimore were when their quiescence was shattered by police homicides. The specifics are different, but all three cities are genuinely under siege. <br><br>The other thing that continues to surprise me about Detroit is that it has not, to my knowledge, produced a wave of refugees claiming asylum in Canada. Detroit shares several ports of entry, a navigable river, a haphazardly secured railroad tunnel, and half-hourly city bus service with Windsor, Ontario. The only way for the border authorities (US or Canadian) to physically bar desperate asylum-seekers from Canadian territory would be to open live fire, but the Canadian authorities seem too restrained to do so, and if the US authorities tried they'd have a riot on their hands. <br><br>What gives? My guess is that Canada just doesn't occur to besieged Detroiters as an option. Windsor is another country, another world, beyond the scope of Detroit's powerful sense of civic pride. Also, many of those who would most benefit from asylum would be legally inadmissible to Canada under normal circumstances on account of their criminal records. <br><br>The thing is, at this point, they'd probably receive a fairer and more sympathetic hearing from Canadian authorities than from anyone in Michigan. If they reach Canadian soil and surrender to the authorities (in precisely the fashion of Central American refugees at the US border), they'll have a compelling legal case for non-refoulement until the final adjudication of their claims. <br><br>There are probably thousands of Detroit residents who could make legitimate, sincere asylum claims in Canada as the victims of a provably failed state (their own municipal government), the targets of routine and deliberate human rights violations, and even the targets of attempted ethnic cleansing. This same situation would be a huge scandal in the US press if it were happening in, say, Nigeria or Syria. As things stand, UN officials have formally expressed concern about the human rights situation in Detroit.<br><br><a href=#c6047217065188853983 title="comment permalink">5/13/15, 3:13 PM</a><br><br>
