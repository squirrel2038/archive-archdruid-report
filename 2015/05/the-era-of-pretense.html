<div class=MsoNormal>
I've mentioned in previous posts here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> the educational value of the comments I receive from readers in the wake of each week’s essay. My post two weeks ago on the death of the internet was unusually productive along those lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>One of the comments I got in response to that post gave me the theme for last week’s essay, but there was at least one other comment calling for the same treatment. Like the one that sparked last week’s post, it appeared on one of the many other internet forums on which <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, and it unintentionally pointed up a common and crucial failure of imagination that shapes, or rather misshapes, the conventional wisdom about our future. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Curiously enough, the point that set off the commenter in question was the same one that incensed the author of the denunciation mentioned in last week’s post: my suggestion in passing that fifty years from now, most Americans may not have access to electricity or running water. The commenter pointed out angrily that I’d claimed that the twilight of industrial civilization would be a ragged arc of decline over one to three centuries. Now, he claimed, I was saying that it was going to take place in the next fifty years, and this apparently convinced him that everything I said ought to be dismissed out of hand. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I run into this sort of confusion all the time. If I suggest that the decline and fall of a civilization usually takes several centuries, I get accused of inconsistency if I then note that one of the sharper downturns included in that process may be imminent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>If I point out that the United States is likely within a decade or two of serious economic and political turmoil, driven partly by the implosion of its faltering global hegemony and partly by a massive crisis of legitimacy that’s all but dissolved the tacit contract between the existing order of US society and the masses who passively support it, I get accused once again of inconsistency if I then say that whatever comes out the far side of that crisis—whether it’s a battered and bruised United States or a patchwork of successor states—will then face a couple of centuries of further decline and disintegration before the deindustrial dark age bottoms out. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course there’s nothing inconsistent about any of these statements. The decline and fall of a civilization isn’t a single event, or even a single linear process; it’s a complex fractal reality composed of many different events on many different scales in space and time. If it takes one to three centuries, as usual, those centuries are going to be taken up by an uneven drumbeat of wars, crises, natural disasters, and assorted breakdowns on a variety of time frames with an assortment of local, regional, national, or global effects. The collapse of US global hegemony is one of those events; the unraveling of the economic and technological framework that currently provides most Americans with electricity and running water is another, but neither of those is anything like the whole picture. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably also necessary to point out that any of my readers who think that being deprived of electricity and running water is the most drastic kind of collapse imaginable have, as the saying goes, another think coming. Right now, in our oh-so-modern world, there are billions of people who get by without regular access to electricity and running water, and most of them aren’t living under dark age conditions. A century and a half ago, when railroads, telegraphs, steamships, and mechanical printing presses were driving one of history’s great transformations of transport and information technology, next to nobody had electricity or running water in their homes. The technologies of 1865 are not dark age technologies; in fact, the gap between 1865 technologies and dark age technologies is considerably greater, by most metrics, than the gap between 1865 technologies and the ones we use today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Furthermore, whether or not Americans have access to running water and electricity may not have as much to say about the future of industrial society everywhere in the world as the conventional wisdom would suggest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I know that some of my American readers will be shocked out of their socks to hear this, but the United States is not the whole world. It’s not even the center of the world. If the United States implodes over the next two decades, leaving behind a series of bankrupt failed states to squabble over its territory and the little that remains of its once-lavish resource base, that process will be a great source of gaudy and gruesome stories for the news media of the world’s other continents, but it won’t affect the lives of the readers of those stories much more than equivalent events in Africa and the Middle East affect the lives of Americans today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As it happens, over the next one to three centuries, the benefits of industrial civilization are going to go away for everyone. (The costs will be around a good deal longer—in the case of the nuclear wastes we’re so casually heaping up for our descendants, a good quarter of a million years, but those and their effects are <a href=../../2014/08/dark-age-america-bitter-legacy.html>rather more localized</a> than some of today’s apocalyptic rhetoric likes to suggest.) The reasoning here is straightforward. White’s Law, one of the fundamental principles of human ecology, states that economic development is a function of energy per capita; the immense treasure trove of concentrated energy embodied in fossil fuels, and that alone, made possible the sky-high levels of energy per capita that gave the world’s industrial nations their brief era of exuberance; as fossil fuels deplete, and remaining reserves require higher and higher energy inputs to extract, the levels of energy per capita the industrial nations are used to having will go away forever. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s important to be clear about this. Fossil fuels aren’t simply one energy source among others; in terms of concentration, usefulness, and fungibility—that is, the ability to be turned into any other form of energy that might be required—they’re in a category all by themselves. Repeated claims that fossil fuels can be replaced with nuclear power, renewable energy resources, or what have you sound very good on paper, but every attempt to put those claims to the test so far has either gone belly up in short order, or become a classic <a href=../../2014/03/the-crocodiles-of-reality.html>subsidy dumpster</a> surviving purely on a diet of government funds and mandates.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Three centuries ago, the earth’s fossil fuel reserves were the largest single deposit of concentrated energy in this part of the universe; now we’ve burnt through nearly all the easily accessible reserves, and we’re scrambling to keep the tottering edifice of industrial society going by burning through the dregs that remain. As those run out, the remaining energy resources—almost all of them renewables—will certainly sustain a variety of human societies, and some of those will be able to achieve a fairly high level of complexity and maintain some kinds of advanced technologies. The kind of absurd extravagance that passes for a normal standard of living among the more privileged inmates of the industrial nations is another matter, and as the fossil fuel age sunsets out, it will end forever. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The fractal trajectory of decline and fall mentioned earlier in this post is simply the way this equation works out on the day-to-day scale of ordinary history. Still, those of us who happen to be living through a part of that trajectory might reasonably be curious about how it’s likely to unfold in our lifetimes. I’ve discussed in a previous series of posts, and in my book <i>Decline and Fall: The End of Empire and the Future of Democracy in 21st Century America</i>, how the end of US global hegemony is likely to unfold, but as already noted, that’s only a small portion of the broader picture. Is a broader view possible?
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Fortunately history, the core resource I’ve been using to try to make sense of our future, has plenty to say about the broad patterns that unfold when civilizations decline and fall. Now of course I know all I have to do is mention that history might be relevant to our present predicament, and a vast chorus of voices across the North American continent and around the world will bellow at rooftop volume, “But it’s different this time!” With apologies to my regular readers, who’ve heard this before, it’s probably necessary to confront that weary thoughtstopper again before we proceed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<a href=../../2014/03/american-delusionalism-or-why-history.html>As I’ve noted before</a>, claims that it’s different this time are right where it doesn’t matter and wrong where it counts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Predictions made on the basis of history—and not just by me—have consistently predicted events over the last decade or so far more accurately than predictions based on the assumption that history doesn’t matter. How many times, dear reader, have you heard someone insist that industrial civilization is going to crash to ruin in the next six months, and then watched those six months roll merrily by without any sign of the predicted crash? For that matter, how many times have you heard someone insist that this or that policy that’s never worked any other time that it’s been tried, or this or that piece of technological vaporware that’s been the subject of failed promises for decades, will inevitably put industrial society back on its alleged trajectory to the stars—and how many times has the policy or the vaporware been quietly shelved, and something else promoted using the identical rhetoric, when it turned out not to perform as advertised? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s been a source of wry amusement to me to watch the same weary, dreary, repeatedly failed claims of imminent apocalypse and inevitable progress being rehashed year after year, varying only in the fine details of the cataclysm du jour and the techno-savior du jour, while the future nobody wants to talk about is busily taking shape around us. Decline and fall isn’t something that will happen sometime in the conveniently distant future; it’s happening right now in the United States and around the world. The amusement, though, is tempered with a sense of familiarity, because the period in which decline is under way but nobody wants to admit that fact is one of the recurring features of the history of decline. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are, very generally speaking, five broad phases in the decline and fall of a civilization. I know it’s customary in historical literature to find nice dull labels for such things, but I’m in a contrary mood as I write this, so I’ll give them unfashionably colorful names: the eras of pretense, impact, response, breakdown, and dissolution. Each of these is complex enough that it’ll need a discussion of its own; this week, we’ll talk about the era of pretense, which is the one we’re in right now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Eras of pretense are by no means limited to the decline and fall of civilizations. They occur whenever political, economic, or social arrangements no longer work, but the immediate costs of admitting that those arrangements don’t work loom considerably larger in the collective imagination than the future costs of leaving those arrangements in place. It’s a curious but consistent wrinkle of human psychology that this happens even if those future costs soar right off the scale of frightfulness and lethality; if the people who would have to pay the immediate costs don’t want to do so, in fact, they will reliably and cheerfully pursue policies that lead straight to their own total bankruptcy or violent extermination, and never let themselves notice where they’re headed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Speculative bubbles are a great setting in which to watch eras of pretense in full flower. In the late phases of a bubble, when it’s clear to anyone who has two spare neurons to rub together that the boom du jour is cobbled together of equal parts delusion and chicanery, the people who are most likely to lose their shirts in the crash are the first to insist at the top of their lungs that the bubble isn’t a bubble and their investments are guaranteed to keep on increasing in value forever. Those of my readers who got the chance to watch some of their acquaintances go broke in the real estate bust of 2008-9, as I did, will have heard this sort of self-deception at full roar; those who missed the opportunity can make up for the omission by checking out the ongoing torrent of claims that the soon-to-be-late fracking bubble is really a massive energy revolution that will make America wealthy and strong again.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The history of revolutions offers another helpful glimpse at eras of pretense. France in the decades before 1789, to cite a conveniently well-documented example, was full of people who had every reason to realize that the current state of affairs was hopelessly unsustainable and would have to change. The things about French politics and economics that had to change, though, were precisely those things that the French monarchy and aristocracy were unwilling to change, because any such reforms would have cost them privileges they’d had since time out of mind and were unwilling to relinquish. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Louis XIV, who finished up his long and troubled reign a supreme realist, is said to have muttered “Apr<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>è</span>s moi, le d<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>é</span>luge”—“Once I’m gone, this sucker’s going down” may not be a literal translation, but it catches the flavor of the utterance—but that degree of clarity was rare in his generation, and all but absent in those of his increasingly feckless successors. Thus the courtiers and aristocrats of the Old Regime amused themselves at the nation’s expense, dabbled in avant-garde thought, and kept their eyes tightly closed to the consequences of their evasions of looming reality, while the last opportunities to excuse themselves from a one-way trip to visit the guillotine and spare France the cataclysms of the Terror and the Napoleonic wars slipped silently away. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the bitter irony of eras of pretense. Under most circumstances, they’re the last period when it would be possible to do anything constructive on the large scale about the crisis looming immediately ahead, but the mass evasion of reality that frames the collective thinking of the time stands squarely in the way of any such constructive action. In the era of pretense before a speculative bust, people who could have quietly cashed in their positions and pocketed their gains double down on their investments, and guarantee that they’ll be ruined once the market stops being liquid. In the era of pretense before a revolution, in the same way, those people and classes that have the most to lose reliably take exactly those actions that ensure that they will in fact lose everything. If history has a sense of humor, this is one of the places that it appears in its most savage form. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same points are true, in turn, of the eras of pretense that precede the downfall of a civilization. In a good many cases, where too few original sources survive, the age of pretense has to be inferred from archeological remains. We don’t know what motives inspired the ancient Mayans to build their biggest pyramids in the years immediately before the Terminal Classic period toppled over into a savage political and demographic collapse, but it’s hard to imagine any such project being set in motion without the usual evasions of an era of pretense being involved<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Where detailed records of dead civilizations survive, though, the sort of rhetorical handwaving common to bubbles before the bust and decaying regimes on the brink of revolution shows up with knobs on. Thus the panegyrics of the Roman imperial court waxed ever more lyrical and bombastic about Rome’s invincibility and her civilizing mission to the nations as the Empire stumbled deeper into its terminal crisis, echoing any number of other court poets in any number of civilizations in their final hours. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, a glance through classical Rome’s literary remains turns up the remarkable fact that those of her essayists and philosophers who expressed worries about her survival wrote, almost without exception, during the Republic and the early Empire; the closer the fall of Rome actually came, the more certainty Roman authors expressed that the Empire was eternal and the latest round of troubles was just one more temporary bump on the road to peace and prosperity. It took the outsider’s vision of Augustine of Hippo to proclaim that Rome really was falling—and even that could only be heard once the Visigoths sacked Rome and the era of pretense gave way to the age of impact. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The present case is simply one more example to add to an already lengthy list. In the last years of the nineteenth century, it was common for politicians, pundits, and mass media in the United States, the British empire, and other industrial nations to discuss the possibility that the advanced civilization of the time might be headed for the common fate of nations in due time. The intellectual history of the twentieth century is, among other things, a chronicle of how that discussion was shoved to the margins of our collective discourse, just as the ecological history of the same century is among other things a chronicle of how the worries of the previous era became the realities of the one we’re in today. The closer we’ve moved toward the era of impact, that is, the more unacceptable it has become for anyone in public life to point out that the problems of the age are not just superficial. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Listen to the pablum that passes for political discussion in Washington DC or the mainstream US media these days, or the even more vacuous noises being made by party flacks as the country stumbles wearily toward yet another presidential election. That the American dream of upward mobility has become an American nightmare of accelerating impoverishment outside the narrowing circle of the kleptocratic rich, that corruption and casual disregard for the rule of law are commonplace in political institutions from local to Federal levels, that our medical industry charges more than any other nation’s and still provides the worst health care in the industrial world, that our schools no longer teach anything but contempt for learning, that the national infrastructure and built environment are plunging toward Third World conditions at an ever-quickening pace, that a brutal and feckless foreign policy embraced by both major parties is alienating our allies while forcing our enemies to set aside their mutual rivalries and make common cause against us: these are among the issues that matter, but they’re not the issues you’ll hear discussed as the latest gaggle of carefully airbrushed candidates go through their carefully scripted elect-me routines on their way to the 2016 election. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
If history teaches anything, though, it’s that eras of pretense eventually give way to eras of impact. That doesn’t mean that the pretense will go away—long after Alaric the Visigoth sacked Rome, for example, there were still plenty of rhetors trotting out the same tired clichés about Roman invincibility—but it does mean that a significant number of people will stop finding the pretense relevant to their own lives. How that happens in other historical examples, and how it might happen in our own time, will be the theme of next week’s post. </div>

I can recall the initial days of the Tea Party movement in my closest city (Worcester, MA) being surrounded by a large swath of the general public completely fed up with the lies from our federal government promising things would change and then nothing did. This seems to me like what you have described. Year in and year out since then it's been the same empty words replayed by different empty suits. Like Obama promised in 2008 and again in 2012 that our country would rise out of the ashes stronger than before and things would turn around and we would get back to the golden age of manufacturing. For some of the readers thinking we are just now finding ourselves in the age of pretense, think again. We've been here for a good amount of time now and the era of impact is drawing near. I can't tell you how frequently I am hearing about friends and family these days giving up cable because they can't afford it. This is just one example, but did anyone ever think that would be happening in 21st century America? I certainly didn't and especially not college-educated people with their Master's degree and well-paying jobs. My parents are in their 50's and my mom just cancelled her cell phone and got rid of cable. The transmission in their "new to them" SUV just died. They're really struggling to keep up with the Joneses and only 10 years ago they were in much better shape. I can't wait to start hearing more about the latest campaign promises from a completely disconnected group of people claiming they can relate to these struggles and other who are in much worse shape. Once they get into office nothing will change and we will continue to sink further down the slope of decline.<br><br><a href=#c5654227219052499103 title="comment permalink">5/13/15, 6:26 PM</a><br><br>

Geez, if your house is plumbed, it should be easy enough to eventually switch over from "city" water to a cistern, and to use a composting toilet and use the greywater on your yard.<br><br><a href=#c3925123419142318564 title="comment permalink">5/13/15, 6:27 PM</a><br><br>

Delicious.<br><br>I'm reminded of James Burke, the technologist and explicator of the history of science, and his show <b>Connections</b>, here — the place where I learned that the history of technology is largely the history of small improvements in existing technologies being combined with small improvements in other existing technologies, and then being married with one another. Technological suites, or in the language of another system of thought, <i>solve et coagula!</i><br><br>At the start of one of those episodes, he remarks on how, at Arles in France, you can see the remnants of the one of the largest ancient mills in the world, where water power ground grain into flour for the bread ovens of Rome... an early example of offshoring labor costs, I imagine. And, when Rome could no longer afford such a massive factory for flour production, it was mothballed and quarried for the then-new city walls of Arles, because the Roman army kept getting paid with the high taxes even though they were losing all the battles... <br><br>I note that one of our great achievements of water power, the Hoover Dam, is approaching its last operating dregs — it used to be 1,050 feet, but at great expense they've installed some new turbines, and they think they can keep in operation until it hits 950 feet. I doubt they'll use the rubble for Las Vegas's new defenses, though... there won't be enough water in southern Nevada to bother defending the place; and LV will have enough rubble of its own to not bother hauling it across the desert by hand, in any case.<br><br>And I think this is probably what those readers who accuse you of hypocritical writing are grappling with, JMG. We're a nation that's simultaneously declaring itself on the ascendant while struggling to manage our borders, our infrastructure, a whole series of wars we can't afford, our internal discontents, our external allies and rivals, and the rogue leadership of our economic system — who are breaking down the compact between governed and governors because it's "cheaper"....<br><br>And so the downward slope is there, even if you have Five Good Presidents in a row or rack up a few heroic (but expensive) victories on the Dacian frontier or rein in a few financiers in Juvenal fashion or build a few effective walls from sea to sea or river to river. Project Successes are not Operations Successes — you can't fix structural failures with individual success in relatively small-scale programs, and even five good emperors in a row can't fix anything if they don't tackle the right problems.<br><br><a href=#c1623380204131306447 title="comment permalink">5/13/15, 6:36 PM</a><br><br>

I hope I'm not redundant. Perhaps I'm jumping ahead a few weeks, but one of the largest criticisms I had of JH Kunstler's "World" novels was the way in which he elided and outright ignored the impact of the loss of utilities in the US. I have few doubts about your prediction, but I think it is disingenuous to say people can do quite well without utilities.<br><br>I suspect electricity will go first. It is easier to supply water and far more necessary but that wont matter for long. I'm geussing two or three percent of American houses, probably less, don't require central heat. Even here in relatively temperate Atlanta, it gets cold enough to freeze pipes...and people. Once the pipes freeze, and subsequently flood the house, black mold makes it a permanent health hazard. So living in tents, burning the sparse urban wood stock for fuel (a month at most, a little more in the suburbs.)<br><br>If that social dislocation hasn't brought the economy to a standstill, the fact that no commercial or office buildings will be usable certainly will. Where will we get the industrial capital to manufacture a billion kerosene lamps, build wick factories, build manual typewriter factories (never mind nobody knowing how to use them)?<br>I could go on and on. <br><br>None of this means the power wont go off, but I don't see how it can just be a hard bump in centuries of decline and not an relatively abrupt end to civilization as we know it and an apocalyptic conflagration.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c7120291684423657931 title="comment permalink">5/13/15, 6:47 PM</a><br><br>

I built the house here so that it could be liveable without power or running water and still maintain a reasonable temperature in all seasons. Running water and electricity are nice and all, but some of the early mansions built by the sheep squatters didn't have running water. And when they did install showers, they came with a health warning. Seriously. <br><br>John Kenneth Galbraith stated that the rhetoric around speculative bubbles always claimed:<br>- New and innovative products; and<br>- The old rules no longer apply. blah blah blah. The Twilight of illusion he called it. I hear it used all of the time.<br><br>Your writing reflects your contrary mood. No worries, I get occasionally very annoyed by this stuff too. Mostly, I'm calm, but sometimes I just hear and read things that are so preposterous and they're taken seriously.<br><br>A good example of this is that the off grid solar community down here has been providing some honest and frank assessments of the newfangled Tesla battery in box arrangement which is being touted as a revolution in battery storage. Yes, everything goes around in circles in a proper revolution! hehe! Come on, that must have brought a smile to your face? hehe. Well, anyway, whatever, I thought that it was funny...<br><br>As an interesting side note, those batteries - which can be paralleled - but require an off grid (or hybrid grid) inverter to actually work - plus an AC transfer switch of some sort provide 3kW of storage. Now that sounds like a lot of energy, until you realise that lifting water (apologies, but that was the example that came to mind that I thought people would understand) at household pressure even 10m (30ft) in elevation takes about 0.5kW of energy. You can try that experiment at home with a hose. Just take the output of the hose higher and higher and you'll notice that the pressure drops. Double the height that you require to lift that water at pressure requires about double the energy (i.e. 1kW) to about a limit of around 30m (100ft approx.). Beyond that lift, the energy required just gets bigger.<br><br>Running water is toast - long term - because normal household pressure is equivalent to a 70m (210ft approx.) drop and unless that can be supplied by gravity...<br><br>It is absolutely no different to the problems surrounding oil wells and is actually a very similar energy equation.<br><br>Exactly, the future costs soar with each day that passes by and no action is being taken. I'm told many and varied reliable sources that an El Nino event is guaranteed on its way to visit my farm next summer, so the land of milk and honey is going to be seriously challenged and the time to take action was yesterday, today and tomorrow - of which I've been actively pursuing and will continue.<br><br>cont...<br><br><a href=#c2764086599015840178 title="comment permalink">5/13/15, 7:08 PM</a><br><br>

And people use it to confirm their own choices to join in. I bailed on that one years ago right before the US bubbled popped and the waves of that pop were felt even here at the bottom of the planet in a far distant country.<br><br>The Louis XIV quote is sheer genius! Too funny - even if it isn't an exact translation. I'm pretty certain someone will come along to correct it, not that it matters...<br><br>Yes, I find listening to the words of politicians particularly wearying because I see the magic that they are trying to weave. The current lot here are a fascinating example as they are introducing a superb narrative which could have come from the mouth of a two year old. It is a real credit to them and they are sticking to that narrative like glue and growing it over time. Pity it doesn't match reality and doesn't stand much close scrutiny. The media pundits however lack the ability to ask even the most basic of probing questions and when they do ask, they accept narratives, stories and outright evasiveness as an answer. It is almost as if no one wants to burst the bubble of illusion. I smell fear behind it all, the fear of being confronted by reality. And people lap it up and repeat it back to them... It is not going to end up well.<br><br>Reality isn't so bad, you know.

I'm trying to buy a piece of property with the intention of building hugelkulture beds for organic vegetables to sell in the nearest town. The first place I found on the web to buy was actually not available, the second place, a bit further from a town is, according to the realtor, not suitable because of flooding. As I've said before my mind jumps from a problem to a solution with benefits. Excess surface water means more graze and I don't have to buy as much hay and feed for my animals, using french drains I can transport excess water to dug ponds and perhaps raise organic fish for sale as well. This makes sense to me since I wouldn't want to flood a neighbor who may be down hill from me! Basically when told that tree I've been leaning on is a lemon tree I'll start shaking every tree in the forest for lemons or a reasonable facsimile thereof to make lemonade. In spite of all the cautions of the realtor I'm tempted to go for it. While further from town then I'd like, the possible advantages make it attractive. Besides, I can make the payments!

My most-hated unambiguous trope is that of the imminent collapse of the petrodollar (generally just a few months away), something I've been reading since I first learned of the petrodollar a decade or so ago. (I now generally avoid petrodollar articles, and not only because they're often attached to the promotion of a book promising how you can make a killing from the just-as-imminent economic collapse.)<br><br>Paralleling that a bit, you've often mentioned (which I think is something that needs to be mentioned by others more often) that energy is required to concentrate dispersed energy. Likewise (and certainly I can't be the first to think of this), it just came to me that (extra) energy is required to release potential energy if the idea is to release it in a slow manner (read: slow collapse) rather than in a fast manner (whoops!). Of course, this doesn't imply that collapse must be extremely fast or extremely slow, but that to inject those periods of slowness will require extra effort/energy to make it happen. Sometimes that energy/effort will be injected (when it's even available), sometimes it won't be. Those injections will come at different times and places. Hence the ambiguity, and likely a bunch of people upset with various prognostications (and perhaps confusion of when's the best time for them to make a killing).<br><br>Maybe I'm just stating the obvious.<br><br>Certainly none of that would qualify as being called a theory, but perhaps an understanding.

TV effectively abets bubbles and the EoP most effectively. I watch TV news every month or so, but can only tolerate it for a few minutes. But the 'eye of sauron' is everywhere you go, comforting the herd with the same melodies and remedies, as we all discussed previously.<br><br>There is no stopping the descent - there is no feasible replacement for fossil fuels that can match them in energy density and flexibility. But it may be that other things (specifically, globalized food production and transportation) that hit the shoals first. The currents of finance, currency and oil depletion are interwoven - and it takes all of these to get food to mouths across the globe. This system is starting to show signs of weakness, as food prices are spiking in different areas across the globe. Gloabalism and international food transport are what keep China livable - without food, China and many other countries (Egypt, KSA, etc.) cannot support their populations due to insufficient arable land. The same holds true for large cities outside of Europe - where growing food is displaced from the populations.<br><br>The true issue is hypercomplexity - all these systems are stretched to maximize profits, making them inelastic and susceptible to even minor perturbations and interruptions. Globalism is hypercomplex - and why there are only 48 hours worth of groceries in your local store. JIT inventory systems cannot function sans internet or sans rapid and reliable transportation systems. Grocers are not even set up to handle more than 48 hours of inventory, to maximize profits...<br><br>Just some thoughts about bumps in the long ramp to lower energy per capita and a more natural rhythm of life. Avoiding the rush certainly relieves the pressure on a family...<br><br><a href=#c208321890999055733 title="comment permalink">5/13/15, 9:03 PM</a><br><br>

For a little bit of irony, there's an old television(!) show that now helps me to imagine the scenario; was on maybe a decade or so ago; Dark Angel. It had a fairly silly pseudo-scientific premise about genetic engineering, but the setting was Seattle, after the U.S. had become a third-world country. So, people lived in high rise apartments, but without reliable access to electricity, and managed in a variety of ways; there were a lot of cell phones around, and familiar-looking bike messengers, but antibiotics had to be bought on the (thriving) black market; there were a lot of over-militarized police standing around ... come to think of it, it may have been a precursor of some larger cities right about now.<br>Which is a little surreal to me, because in my tiny corner, things still look pretty much as ever; the hard-to-fathom news reports are about distant places on the other side of a very large continent, and I don't travel much. I have to focus to notice what has become routine; the road department reports to city councils that there isn't enough money to maintain existing streets, for example, or the constant efforts by the state to cut back on previous commitments to its retirement funds. The simmering fights between farmers and cities for water. The recollection that the country has not truly been at peace in my lifetime. And then it suddenly looks very, very clear indeed, and yet no one around me is willing to see.<br><br><a href=#c6207882121856716238 title="comment permalink">5/13/15, 10:09 PM</a><br><br>

As someone who grew up in the 'First World' and then spent a number of years in Southeast Asia and India, it was a revelation to learn that most of the people living in these places weren't living in abject misery, and in fact were leading relatively happy, contented lives, without the massive consumption that I was used to growing up. This in turn led to the realization that, in a direct contradiction to the colonialist attitude that it is our duty to help these poor benighted creatures lift themselves out of darkness, WE have much to learn from cultures and countries that never fully adopted the industrialist-consumerist paradigm. And so I've spent the last three decades or so...<br><br><a href=#c9158704389053121444 title="comment permalink">5/13/15, 10:26 PM</a><br><br>

Thank you also for catching yourself using "slave" and "serf" as snarl words -- the ability to notice and stop the habit of reducing words to emotionally loaded noises is a crucial one already, and will become even more so as we proceed down the curve of decline. <br><br>Postpeak, I'll add it to the long list of podcasts people want me to take in. When there's more than 24 hours in a day, maybe. <br><br>Greg, congrats! May the project thrive. <br><br>Andy, glad to hear it. It does seem to be easier for the young to grasp what we're discussing. <br><br>Sven, I'm not sure we've quite reached the twilight of pretense yet, but it's surely close. <br><br>Mr. B., exactly. I'm pleased, though, to hear that you know a lot of people who are getting rid of cable service. If they'll take the next step and get rid of their televisions, they'll have the spare time and defogged minds to deal with other aspects of our predicament!<br><br>Shane, if society's run up against a brick wall, and the only way to go anywhere else is to back up, who's in the lead? Those who have been "backwards" about progressing toward the brick wall!<br><br>Andrew, exactly. One of the odd side effects of elective government is that you don't get five good presidents in a row; we probably won't get even one, because a good president would have to start by telling the people that they couldn't have everything they think they want, and that guarantees a losing election campaign...<br><br>Btidwell, that's because you're still thinking of some kind of situation that would cause all the power everywhere to go off at once. Not so; as I noted in last week's post, it's already going away a bit at a time, and while that will accelerate, it's not going to turn into the giant off switch of contemporary apocalyptic fantasy. You might also want to read some of the comments from last week's post -- we had discussions of the many people who already live in houses with no power or running water, and get by tolerably well. <br><br>Cherokee, no argument there -- reality is a lot more pleasant and functional than the crackpot delusions handed out by modern industrial cultures these days!<br><br>Pinku-sensei, the "consensus trance" is exactly the pretense I'm discussing. The main difference is that I'm not at all sure that it's a matter of trance -- there's a fair bit of deliberate refusal to look involved!<br><br>Fudoshin, that's certainly a major factor.

I know it was expected, but still. May the land purchase go well. <br><br>Repent, good. Finding the right question isn't a simple thing -- it took each of the Grail knights years of questing to manage the thing, you know. <br><br>Stravinsky, wasn't it one of the Roman moralists who wrote about how kids in his time spent all their time getting drunk, driving their chariots too fast, playing that atrocious music, etc.? <br><br>Nestorian, good heavens, no. You might look up the Decadent movement in 19th century literature, which focused on the idea that industrial civilization was on its way to decline and fall; Kipling's poem "Recessional" approached the same thing from another angle; and the waning of the British Empire before the First World War was accompanied by lively debates and discussions about British decline. <br><br>Yupped, exactly. The loss of faith by the masses in the American dream -- or, as it's become these days, the American Pretense -- is far more dangerous to the existing order of society than any number of terrorist bombs.<br><br>Dave, fascinating! I somehow missed hearing about the TSR-2 -- many thanks. <br><br>Ben, thanks for the tip -- I'll put it on the get-to list. <br><br>Allan, good, but you're missing one important detail. The process of collapse frees up energy, which then goes to work slowing the collapse process: that's the foundation of the theory of catabolic collapse. Once you allow an portion of capital to turn to waste, you no longer have to invest resources in maintaining it, and you can often salvage useful raw materials from it as well. That's the brake that slows the collapse process. <br><br>Peakfuture, yes, that would also follow -- and it's among the reasons why people high up on the food chain are terminated with extreme prejudice in the course of collapse, since their disproportionate use of energy makes their removal more valuable to others. <br><br>Tasha, makes sense to me. <br><br>Claire, exactly. It's going to take pink slips, or some other highly personal shock, to break through the pretense. <br><br>Wizzard, the whole point of the bubble economy of the last two decades is that it props up the illusion that we still have a productive economy of any kind here in the US.

The emotional reactions you can get by questioning those slogans are among the things that make me think that what's going on is pretense, not actual belief. <br><br>N Montesano, that act of focusing is crucial. It has to be done deliberately, because whole industries make their money by doing their best to keep it from happening by chance. <br><br>Brian, no argument. I don't see "Third World" as inherently insulting, though -- I think of it as "third time gets it right..." <br><br>K-dog, brace for the impact!<br><br>Dwig, I'll have a look as time permits, but it sounds as though Preston is using the word "evolution" to mean "progress,"<br>which is of course erroneous. Nihilism isn't limited to one of these five stages, btw -- as I noted here <a href=../../2013/11/toward-green-future-part-three.html rel=nofollow>before</a>, it's a feature of the process by which ages of reason end, and thus is present in some versions of the five-stage pattern and absent in others. <br><br>Tawal, of course they don't care about "the Homeland."

(But... but... iPhone!) What bothers me more than the psychological barriers is the general inability or unwillingness to deal with complexity (e.g. the belief that ebola will either kill everybody on the planet or isn't worth worrying about at all). There are few things more exasperating than illustrating a point with small words, big writing and clear diagrams and be greeted with understanding nods, sage "I get its" and a question that makes it apparent the listener hasn't the faintest clue what you're on about. Schools have a lot to answer for.<br><br>So does my university, because the mention of White's Law just reminded me of something: we've never been taught about it. I study archaeology; looking at the development (less so the fall, funnily enough) of societies and civilisations is what we *do*. However, it's - shall we say unfashionable - to suggest that the environment or the resource base or anything similar has a significant effect upon the pathway of a society - to say so is derided as "environmental determinism". This leads to the always-fun task of trying to explain the existence and form of a society without, in fact, explaining anything at all (towns just... develop, all right? Because human agency. Or something).<br><br>If anybody's still wondering, a direct translation of the Louis quote is, "After me, the flood", which is a bit more poetic if a bit less descriptive.<br><br><a href=#c8073044988585838634 title="comment permalink">5/14/15, 1:32 AM</a><br><br>

The amount of power is immaterial to the height you can lift water. The only difference it makes is to the amount of water lifted. I have a 30 W pump that can lift water up around 30 metres (but only 3 L per minute).<br><br>Normal town water pressures are a bit variable around the world. But in Western Australia the Water Corporation is obligated only to provide water at the rate of 20 litre (a bit over 5 US gallons) per minute at a pressure of 150 KPa which is equivalent to 15m of height. This level is certainly quite useable (does us OK). <br><br>Water flowing at 20 L/min at 150 KPa is equivalent to 50 W of power. Given losses due to inefficient pumps and pipe friction that would mean a 100-150 W motor could supply the standard rate OK. <br><br>One commercial pump I looked at used a 0.5 KW motor and it could easily supply around 3500 litres per hour at that pressure, equal to the full guaranteed rate for about 3 houses.<br><br>Many systems use higher pressures, but pressures around 70 M of water height as you suggested would have a good chance of burst water pipes. <br><br>Cheers<br>Andrew<br><br><a href=#c4627730728476036580 title="comment permalink">5/14/15, 4:19 AM</a><br><br>

I don’t think you will be surprised to find that many in my country (I live in Canada) and yours are facing this ecological and economic anxiety by putting their trust in demagogues, small and large. I’ve read some of your<br>fine posts on this…and I think it’s important to continue stressing the real fragmentation<br>of our civilization from a political view. Paul Goodman had wrote how technology and all its practical applications is truly a moral philosophy. We have the ability to choose how we use and distribute our technology. And yet, as John Ralston Saul,our illustrious Canadian thinker has noted, in times of crisis, societies tend to seek out “heroes,” instead of self-reflecting and adjusting to the times pragmatically. Saul goes on to remind us that out of the first four modern (post 1750) republics - Corsica established by Pascal Paoli, America (fated to be led by Washington and Jefferson), France, and Haiti – three of them were essentially conquered by Napoleon, who is at heart a beloved strongman with a liberal uniform. A few years ago I read an excellent book by Eric Hoffer entitled “The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements”. Like you, he humbly uses history as his guide for the future. What he saw was that civilizations in decline tend to latch on to political nd/or religious mass movements <br>– some good, many bad. Mass movements are often directed by charismatic leaders who may drive their society in unwanted directions (Hitler and Mussolini are good 20th C. examples). I had to make mention of these items in order to buttress<br>your case that societies do not have to take a gradual path – they are more than able to fall off cliffs. To make a finer point on your argument, who is to say that the next regime will even allow today’s version of the internet to remain? To paraphrase you Mr. Greer…it is insufficient, at best to believe that “it’s<br>different this time.”<br><br><a href=#c203690730472490835 title="comment permalink">5/14/15, 5:27 AM</a><br><br>

First, as I was watching the Dr. Phil show yesterday (not so much watching as it being on while I checked my social media), the famous Amish guy, Lebanon Levi was touting his new book. He mentioned that the Amish don't pay social security because they don't believe in insurance. I remarked to my son that I wished I could stop paying social security tax on religious grounds. He said, "But Dad, if you do that, you won't get social security when you retire." I had to remark back, "Son, I'm not going to get social security anyway."<br><br>Last week, I had a 2 hour excruciating appointment with the college "counselor" at my daughter's private school (not my idea - my wife insisted on private school, so she got a job to pay for it). What an eye-opener. The first thing he said was "Don't get sticker shock. The advertised tuition is like the sticker price on a car. Your daughter will get scholarship money, so the real cost is less." After a horrible two hours, I came away with the realization that what colleges have done since I attended was the old retailers' scheme of doubling the retail price and then having a 50% off "sale." When I attended a state institution in the 1980's, the tuition was roughly $1,200 per semester. Now that same school charges $9,500 per semester, but everyone gets a bright futures "scholarship" that discounts the tuition by $3,000 per year. So the real tuition is $8,000 per semester. Thank God she made a 32 on the ACT so she might get some actual meaningful scholarship money and get the tuition down to something close to what her education will actually be worth.<br><br>Meanwhile, in the 10 years I've been with my current law firm, I've watched the local office shrink from 11 lawyers down to 7. When I started here, our large office was fully occupied by lawyers, paralegals and secretaries. Since then, we've shrunk by about 30%. Yet one of my partners just spent $35,000 on a USED Tahoe! He told me that and I told him I just spent $36,000 to buy 30 acres of land in the woods. Does this guy not see the writing on the wall?

The tiller, overwhelmingly, is considered to be more valuable, based on the supposition that it is faster and easier than using a hoe. Considered from a wider paradigm this fallacy becomes obvious. The initial monetary cost, to regurgitate Thoreau, must take into account the increased number of hours worked to earn the difference in price. We must then add the cost, in hours worked, of maintenance; oil, gas, replacement parts, Time spent on trips to the store to obtain those items. Since maintenance is a recurring event the expenditure of time is continual. I posit that the tiller is, in fact, not faster but significantly more time consuming.<br>To address the notion that it is easier I would mention the disparity in labor required to earn the difference in price, the work involved in maintenance, and the additional work needed to sustain productivity in soil more deeply disturbed by the tiller. <br>Seen from here the tiller starts off with a negative value that sinks relentlessly over time. In comparison to the manual-powered, easily maintained hoe it is neither faster nor easier. Dragging the incorrect suppositions regarding the tiller out into the light it becomes fairly obvious that the hoe is not only more valuable, but needs only a tiny fraction of the externalities inherent in the manufacture and use of the tiller.<br><br><a href=#c3035775476862362592 title="comment permalink">5/14/15, 6:16 AM</a><br><br>

Without even getting into the fact that our entire economy depends heavily on the electric grid, a few randomly organized thoughts and questions follow:<br><br>1) One of the important contributions of electrification is the simple ability of the electric light bulb to provide lighting during dark, evening hours that can then be used for educational purposes and self-improvement; reading/study. Electrification has been shown to be a basic tool allowing a population to lift itself out of poverty.<br><br>2) Prior to universal electrification, the population was agriculturally based and rooted in a social system of extended families; largely self-reliant.<br>a) What are the social/civil repercussions of a “diaspora of individuals” that is reliant on electrification to connect them to their family and social networks upon which they depend? What are the repercussions for a population acclimated to the benefits of universal electrification? And what are their political, psychological and emotional reactions likely to be as these benefits are lost?<br><br>3) What happens as cable tv service disappears for many and: <br> a) The “circuses” portion of “Bread &amp; Circuses” ends for millions of bored, frustrated, unemployed and disenfranchised people?<br> b) The information control (propaganda), mind control (and behavior control) aspect of mass information disappears as a control tool for TPTB?<br><br>Granted, the loss of electrification may initially follow a process of triage, sort of like a New Deal, “Rural Electrification Project” in reverse, but I doubt that the unraveling process will be gradual, either. An electric system can be built up slowly, but a mature system requires economies of scale in order to function. <br>Our current electric system is approaching the end of its anticipated useful service life right now. The consequences of its dissolution will certainly be profound; not just a simple reset to nineteenth century conditions. I would expect that there would be compounding effects; in negative directions. And I also expect that TPTB will move heaven and earth to keep the system up and running as long as is possible (presenting its own set of negative feedback loops).<br><br><a href=#c29408665242207661 title="comment permalink">5/14/15, 8:27 AM</a><br><br>

There's one near my home, here in France. According to a friend of mine who used to work there, their power generators can provide electricity for only two days if the grid is down. <br><br>If the grid remains down after two days (as could happen if power stations are targeted during a civil war) millions of people will have to live without electricity and running water. All city life comes to a halt, and I'm afraid that food shortages will begin when the food stores are empty, a few days after the grid is down. <br><br>There will be no gas at the filling stations anymore, for it is pumped out of underground tanks by, you guessed it, electrical pumps. Supermarkets, either in France or in the USA, don't store food for more than a few days. If the trucks stop coming, the shelves are empty in three days.<br> <br>Large, modern cities without electricity (and therefore without running water) would be unlivable and would have to be evacuated.<br><br>Imagine living without electricity and water in an apartment. No running water means no flush toilets. If you have a garden, you can use a chamber pot and empty it in a corner of the garden, but what do you do in an apartment?<br><br>I guess, though, that the process will take some time, and the evacuation of the cities will take years, rather than days, and will be a result of resource depletion rather than violence. But whatever the cause will be, what will be left behind will look apocalyptic indeed. <br><br>Very few people realize that our daily lives depend on a relatively small number of power plants which could be easily destroyed, the power transformer being the easiest target.<br><br>Don't rely on wells in urban areas: where I live, east of Paris, some people still have wells (it used to be a village), but the underground water is either gone or polluted.<br><br>Incidentally, Louis XV, not Louis XIV, said "Après moi le déluge". They had very different personalities (Louis XIV, the Sun King, would never have made such a callous joke).<br><br><a href=#c6672172199506673783 title="comment permalink">5/14/15, 10:53 AM</a><br><br>

I agree that we are deeply embedded in this era and it seems that there is almost nothing that can't be ignored, spun, lied about or blamed on criminals, terrorists or crazy people. I believe that an upcoming series of three events coming together will portend the end of this era. <br> The next financial crash " temoporary setback" will occur in the near future kicked off by any number of not so black swans such as greece, shale crash, stock reversals or retail impolsion. But this by itself would not be enough to shake us from the era of pretense as it could be papered over with more printing etc.<br> The next factor will be the first significant loss of global military/economic power that may not be devastating such as in " Twilights last Gleaming" but enough so that other countries start ignoring us and pursuing their own best interests. This has happened in small doses with Syria and Yemen. But something such as having our proxies run out of the Ukraine, or having the Germans change sides would be enough. <br> Then thirdly, having the current trajectory of oil prices, drilling costs and demand destruction that is now battering the once stable oil market play out to its conlclusion of severely reduced oil avaiability. <br> I think the three of these will come together to quickly cause a significant situation for those living here on fantasy island. We here in the USA will be stuck with our domestic production of oil from traditional wells. This is probably somewhere from 5-6 million barrells per day. As we currently use 17-18 million barrells per day this will be a massive shock to america's auto centered lifestyle. It would bring us to an average oil per person of most of the world so in the big scheme of catabolic collapse it will only be a small step. But to the average motorist it will be a giant change. 5-6 million barrells of oil per day is about enough to keep trucking, agriculture, electricity generation and chemical feedstocks going with little left over for any consumer transportation. The effects of this can left for future disussion, but I doubt it can be covered up, bringing an end to the age of pretense.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c7591496623492196779 title="comment permalink">5/14/15, 11:14 AM</a><br><br>

On a personal level we might not "feel" such a change, but in 2035 we'll look back and see that the US has dropped from ~320M to ~260M people. While certainly downward in trajectory, it's not the apocalyptic vision others might come up with where we have a massive die-off of &gt;10% of our population in a few months' time, perhaps several such punctuated decimations over the course of a decade.<br><br>If somehow per-capita GDP rises slowly, say 0.5% per year, on a personal level (assuming all gains don't go to the top 0.01% of us and inequality doesn't get horribly-worse) we might feel like things are gradually improving over time or at least not getting worse, but that will be belied by a GDP that falls from $17T to $15T in that same 20 years, and chances are that even in such a rose-colored scenario that economists will never be able to imagine that a slowly-contracting economy is a good thing.<br><br>To play with this overly-optimistic "soft landing" scenario, what it White's Law relating per-capita power consumption and per-capita GDP growth has been broken? The energy industry has recently been publishing some hopeful graphs that seem to suggest that over time things like load-side efficiency has decoupled the relationship between energy growth rates and GDP growth rates. (This decoupling is most-likey the rise of the bubble-based financial sector, which has morphed to something like 40% of our economy without burning 40% of the energy, and since it is most or all of the GDP growth in the last decade or so, White's Law may not be as broken as I might wish it to be...) <br><br>Let's say the energy industry's hopes are not entirely unfounded, and that through some combination of personal load-side efficiency and conservation measures (on the aggregate), per-capita energy consumption also goes down slowly, say another 0.5% per year, in which case we go from 87 to 64 quadrillion BTU over that period 2015-2035. While energy production certainly cannot keep rising every year, could it perhaps keep up with this kind of contraction?<br><br>This is just to put some numbers out there, to put a shape to the curve for a "slow crash" intuition, and to challenge someone like you to point out what is fundamentally wrong and overly-optimistic about such a soft-landing scenario and why nobody who is paying attention should waste much time on such a hope for the future. I'm guessing that finance and credit are simply not prepared to deal with downward production rates, that there is something house-of-cards-ish about the Ponzi schemes that have sustained us to this point, that once it starts to go downward it's more like a freefall and less like a pleasant trip on a glider.<br><br>What do you think -- any hope whatsoever for a soft landing at this point?<br><br><a href=#c3492558174221326957 title="comment permalink">5/14/15, 12:17 PM</a><br><br>

I for one am working on my show. Right now, there are many neighbors who enjoy playing music with me and swapping stories in my neck of the poorer inner city scene (back yard or front steps). Why we even drink a beer or two while doing so and make plans to help each other out with various projects. I see storytelling revival and local music get to-gathers as a huge growth in our progression. <br><br>b) The information control (propaganda), mind control (and behavior control) aspect of mass information disappears as a control tool for TPTB?<br>MickG – Information control and TPTB will localize more and the structures for such revert to those of the past. The flow of info will slow greatly. TPTB will change/evolve to use less IT intensive means of control though it will likely be centralized through Corporate/Governmental/Religious,Trade structures. Good examples of this would be the Hudson Bay Company of 1700s, Labor Unions, Trade Guilds, Gangs, Political Parties, Churches, Clubs of various sorts. Those who are organized and connected will always have a superior ability to compete/survive and hopefully, have more fun. Fun? Yep! In my opinion this is a much better control mechanism than fear. TPTB have used Fun for years as a control mechanism, there is even new evidence coming out that those who constructed the pyramids did so not as the whipped slave dogs portrayed in some movies but rather as a worthwhile rewarding community effort where you could meet interesting people and do good things together.<br>BTW – My multi state electric provider spends hundreds of millions annually just to remove growing tree branches from wires. This is called ”Vegetation Management”. I would imagine as time pushes budget priorities, the trees may start to get more than a light clip every few years causing great squealing from the tree owners. As our collective ranges of options narrow: it is my desire that us humans become better and faster at prioritizing and making decisions based on both short and longer range impacts. I believe that is our next evolutionary hurdle, to get better making decisions. <br><br><br><a href=#c8022756698612789676 title="comment permalink">5/14/15, 1:30 PM</a><br><br>

To summarize some points from a well-cited (IMO) Wikipedia article: The building complexes, contructed using vast quantities of lumber and stone, were the largest in North America until the 19th century(!). The area became a major trade and cultural center of the Ancient Pueblo (Anazazi) people begining in the 800s and in full swing a century or two later. It was toward the end, during the 'building boom' of 1020 to 1050 when the largest and most elaborate of the complexes were built and thousands of trees were cut down in the immediate area and far beyond. The death knell was sounded around 1140, after a ten year drought, as people began leaving the Chaco Canyon complexes; more droughts followed and the area was abandoned by 1450. Resource depletion and mismanagement occurred on a massive scale in an area that was marginal to begin with and subject to intermittant droughts. <br> From what I understand, cutting down forests causes or increases the severity of drought. I've heard that the area in and around Chaco Canyon still suffers the effects of what happened over eight centuries ago (maybe the area would have recovered by now if only those pesky Europeans had stayed on their side of the pond). One can only imagine what would have occurred had they lived during these modern times. Oh - wait! Nevermind.... Another major new housing development is planned for the far side of sprawl-ville. Never mind that there's a chronic and intensifying water shortage, or plethora of existing abandoned relatively new houses (not to mention abandoned buildings throughout older parts of the city), or the lack of decent jobs and more major employers leaving than staying or moving in. The sheer waste of energy and materials that would go into building this project, plus future costs, as well as the destruction of precious natural habitat, is simply mind-boggling. I hope it doesn't go through. And while the many voices of reason may yet prevail and keep the project from going forward, it's not likely. But maybe, just maybe, the voices of reason can delay the project until it gets stomped to bits when the era of impact hits. <br> Again, thanks to you JMG, and to all those who share comments. 'Hearing' your 'voices' of reason - practical, realistic, affirmative, instructive, non-judgemental - has been helping me to deal with my personal demons and, step by step, doing more with less.<br><br><a href=#c6897552840645708495 title="comment permalink">5/14/15, 5:38 PM</a><br><br>

For what it's worth, I wasn't thinking of the Kubler-Ross stages at all when I put together the five stages in question! <br><br>Diana, he did indeed. That sort of thing was much discussed until fairly recently. <br><br>Barnyard, it's exactly the externalities that are at issue, of course.<br><br>Shane, Europe may be overcrowded but it's less so than the habitable parts of the Middle East and northern Africa, and it also has ample water supplies. Starving and desperate people aren't going to worry too much about other details. <br><br>Fred, good. These are the sorts of questions that people should be thinking about. Answering them would take a good-sized post, not a mere comment here, so I'll simply encourage you to follow up your idea about rural de-electrification; cutting rural areas and poor neighborhoods out of the grid isn't difficult, and would save electricity for the rich and privileged -- at least for a while.<br><br>Travis, you're welcome. <br><br>Dave, good. Yes, I did indeed say that, and I also noticed how many people immediately acted as though that useful qualifier wasn't there at all. <br><br>Varun, I don't know that it would be, because it's very hard to nail things down to that sort of strict timeline. Are you familiar with catastrophe theory? This is that sort of thing; that something's going to give is certain, but when and where -- that's another matter. <br><br>Bryant, good. I'd encourage you to get a composting toilet sooner rather than later, and learn how to operate it; that way you won't have to rely on the sewer system when it, shall we say, craps out. <br><br>Michael, the collective imagination is indeed so constrained -- that's why it's crucial to develop individual imagination, and learn how to think things that you're not supposed to think.<br><br><a href=#c8592206540851542725 title="comment permalink">5/14/15, 6:06 PM</a><br><br>

Many US cities and towns outside of the plains regions have gravity-fed water systems that will keep going for quite a while without electricity. Remember also that utilities can prioritize electrical supply to critical services -- such as water treatment -- while letting poor and peripheral neighborhoods go dark for prolonged periods. <br><br>Changeling, in the US, the good times ran from the end of the Second World War to 1972, and things have been contracting here since then. That doesn't seem to have made most Americans more willing to grapple with the reality of decline!<br><br>Clay, possibly, but if I had to guess, I'd predict that what pushes us over into the era of impact will be something nobody is expecting. <br><br>Jonathan, thank you -- a first-rate example of an era of pretense in action. No, you can't make this stuff up. Writing political and social satire during an era such as this has to be the world's most difficult job -- how do you top the absurdity in what people are saying every single day? <br><br>Avalterra, I know. That's why I keep on bringing it up, and trying to help people think in sufficiently large terms. <br><br>Bruce, I've done that many times here. There is no one pace of collapse; it's a fractal process that moves at different rates at different places and times. There are lots of little breakdowns you barely notice, a amsller number of larger discontinuities, and then every so often a real whopper that leaves plenty of carnage and ruin in its wake. Some people and places will land soft, some hard, and some will be splattered across the surface. As for quantification, we'd have to settle on a specific metric, and then explore just how relevant that one metric is to the broader issue of overall decline and fall. <br><br>Daddy, a nice summary. <br><br>Dwig, and yet complexity only increases when there's an increase in energy per capita, and decreases when this goes down. Here again, it seems to me that the temporary spike in energy per capita and its results caused by fossil fuels is being mapped onto all of history, with unhelpful results. <br><br>Patricia, you're welcome and thank you.

All the main characters struggle to discover , reduscover or maintain this connection within themselves while being pursued by a mad dictatorial former military officer who guards " the citadel" one of the few remaining places capable of sourcing water and growing vegetation . Max and the Valkyries flee and proceed far into a blasted desert before the epiphany of realising they must run the gauntlet back to the citadel , take it by force and establish a gentler , more feminine though still fierce rule. .

Surely someone who witnessed the Imperium's vivisection and died within 30 years of Romulus Augustulus' birth was seeing the breakdown phase!<br><br>With many here I like history, so let me lay out how I saw Rome potentially fitting into your model. Cliché as it may be, I'd say Rome's high water mark was the ~100 year period of the 'Good Emperors,' as dubbed by Gibbons. This extended period of internal peace and prosperity may correlate with the USA post WWII till present. In your 5-phase model, it would appear this is the Pretense phase. Then the onset of decline came with the Antonine plague, affecting the close-quartered army especially severely and initiating man-power and taxation crises that Rome was never really able to resolve. The famous Crisis of the Third Century would appear to be the "Impact" phase, and the Diocletian reforms and aftermath the "Response" phase. Then "Breakdown" would begin roughly with Theodosius, and accelerated under the (morbidly) comical Valentinian III... who overlapped with Augustus. Breakdown bled into Dissolution, and total oblivion came around 600 or so with the disappearance of the Roman senate (which, curiously, survived the fall of the Empire itself).<br><br>I would be interested to hear about how your view of the 5-phase model differs!<br><br><a href=#c8435205766506832847 title="comment permalink">5/14/15, 8:31 PM</a><br><br>

This allowance came in the form of coupons, or order, for which the recipients could obtain food and drink from his milkman, butcher, baker or grocer. The dole was officially termed - sustenance. Common parlance reduced the maintenance to susso. (Food stamps, anyone?)<br><br>In some cases the strugglers found that the money which had to be spent on food, rendered them unable to pay their rent. Evictions were frequent, and not always peaceful.<br><br>The homeless generally sought refuge with relatives, and many braver souls, to whom begging was degrading, and to whom sustenance was equally humiliating, searched far and wide for jobs. Many - jumped the rattlers (slang for the country trains) risking death and imprisonment to travel the country by a free ride on the goods train. A number travelled interstate, but for some it was the swag (an oiled canvas bag to sleep in) and the open road and a chance to work in the bush. They travelled the highways in thousands, and some of the fortunate ones found work, others existed by hand to mouth, cutting wood, and offering to do odd jobs for a billy of tea and a bite to eat.<br><br>Throughout the Depression many children went barefoot to school, and left it to assist their families, lucky enough to have land to eke out an existence by growing their own vegetables and cutting timber. Some were lucky enough to have cows and horses on their properties, and grimly held on through the bitter years. Others beaten by the hardships, simply shouldered their swags, and walked yet again.<br><br>As times became economically better, these wanderers drifted back to the cities and the families they had deserted. The stauncher ones stayed on their land, gradually improving their humble shacks."<br><br>The reason I mention this is because - sigh - there is another instalment of the Mad Max film franchise which was (or is about to be) recently released. I thought that it may be useful to provide an actual account of those times as an antidote to the more colourful fantasies that get thrown around these days.<br><br>As an interesting side note, this past week I have had to face three individual and completely unrelated attempts to rip me off. Seriously, what is going on? This almost never happens to me. Two of them have been resolved in my favour after a lot of hard work, but one still hangs in the balance. It is not a good sign, but who knows it may have been coincidence?<br><br>I’m trialling the dog food and biscuits tonight.

Thanks for tipping me off to that. The error related to the battery capacity which I wrote as 3kW, when in fact it should have read 3kWh (i.e. supply of 3kW for one hour). The discussions by people who are in the know about all things off grid electricity related appear to be not revealing good things about those batteries. I wonder at the claims being made about them...<br><br>JMG, you'll like this (or be amused by it anyway) - A revolution in energy storage I'm sure was said about them somewhere...<br><br>Back to the reply...<br><br>kW is the measurement of energy used or produced at a particular point in time. W (Watt) is equal to V (Volts) x I (Amps).<br><br>kWh is the measurement of energy used or produced over a period of one hour.<br><br>Seriously, 3 litres of water per minute for a lift of 30 metres for 30W of energy... Hmmm, I could actually fill a 10 litre bucket and simply walk it up hill in less time. Just sayin, but 3 minutes and 20 seconds is quite a long time you know…<br><br>The smallest of the 12V pumps here provides 17 litres per minute of water to a similar head at 60 psi and uses only 96W of energy.<br><br>The larger transfer pump which uses 1kW of energy provides 6,000 litres of water per hour and can lift as high as 28 metres. That isn't a bad effort. To lift much higher requires daisy chains of either pumps or water tanks or a very powerful and energy hungry pump indeed.<br><br>Of course, an individual house does not have to withstand such pressures, but on a system level where you have to supply multiple houses then you bet the pressures are big! That is why they're called mains... Imagine if your neighbour turned on their water taps and you lost your water pressure. Ahh, the things we take for granted as an everyday thing.<br><br>Incidentally, I recall someone telling me a story of a fire at a local pub many years ago when the mains was either turned on or off too quickly (people were a bit over excited, I guess) and the hammer from that action burst the mains water supply. Oh yeah, the systems are far from infallible.<br><br>PS: I’m enjoying discussing water and pumps etc. but have promised not to speak about such matters again.

I remember now that Californians get much of their running water from the snow which accumulates in the mountains during the winter.

In the Paris region (11 million people) we don’t, for we get our water from rivers, especially the Marne and Seine rivers. As you say, when we’ll hit the ‘impact’ phase, electricity will be progressively restricted to critical services, like water treatment plants. <br><br>In the Third World, they have petroleum-powered electricity generators, which they use during power cuts. Of course, it only makes the energy problem worse. I wonder if the poor will actually leave the cities before they become truly uninhabitable (no electricity, no water, no food in the stores). In Detroit, they stayed in spite of urban decay, because they have nowhere to go. The first ones to go will be those who have the means to resettle elsewhere, and who have prepared their exit. The truly poor will be the last ones to leave.<br><br>@ Patricia Mathews: "Their security guards shoot them."<br><br>Four solutions, here:<br><br>1. The Stalin method. Since everyone is a threat, even you servants, you seduce your chambermaid. Being your mistress, she has a lot to lose and nothing to gain if you die. She can spy on the other servants. Then you periodically ‘purge’ your closed collaborators, servants, etc. The problem is, the more people you eliminate, the more covert enemies you make. Expect to die alone.<br><br>2. The Hitler method. Be very chummy with your chauffeurs, bodyguards, secretaries, etc. Treat them well. Knowing that they’ll never have another boss as good as you are, they’ll be faithful to you. It worked, all the low ranking employees who worked for Hitler liked him and remained loyal to him until the end. But it couldn’t offset the fact that eventually the war was lost.<br><br>3. The Don Corleone method. Stop hiring people you don’t know as security guards. Do like mafia dons, hire relatives or co-ethnics. It works… Or not. I’m just thinking of Jean-Marie Le Pen who has just been ousted by his own daughter from the party he founded. <br><br>4. The Howard Hughes method. The aviation tycoon hired Mormons. They are very loyal people, and they don’t drink alcohol.<br><br>@ Clay Dennis: « We here in the USA will be stuck with our domestic production of oil from traditional wells. »<br>I read a study made by a fellow Frenchman several years ago. Interestingly, AFAIK it hasn’t been translated in English. The author wondered what would have happened if the USA had been unable to import oil after 1970. His study shows that the real income of the average American would be roughly equal to that of a Spaniard. Not impressive, but enough to live decently, First World style. <br><br>IMHO, if the USA had a Spanish economy, it would have had to amend its health system, which would seriously dent Spaniards’ incomes. And amending the US health system would be very difficult to do. Another consequence would be that a poorer USA could no longer maintain a huge military. Given the political and financial weight of the industrial-military complex, that would be quite difficult and painful to implement.<br><br><a href=#c1326590135085631243 title="comment permalink">5/15/15, 4:18 AM</a><br><br>

This arrangement is quite effective and equitable, but it comes at a price that few English (as the Amish call us) would ever be willing to pay, namely, total submission to an intrusive de facto government run by the community, in particular by its elders. This form of community governance verges on the early church communism described in the Book of Acts. Refusal to submit to the community government or attempting to chisel on one's obligations of mutual aid to other Amish in one's sect ultimately leads to excommunication, a decision that can be made on very short order if there's a strong community consensus in favor of it. <br><br>Most of the concerted agitation that I've heard against Social Security, by contrast, comes from "go Galt" moochers and self-dealers who are diametrically opposed to the Amish lifestyle in word and especially in deed. They're obviously just looking to evade their communal obligations to the welfare of other Americans. Many would argue that the American public is too large, diverse, and fractious a community to be sustainably insured in this fashion, but in any event, payroll contributions to Social Security and Medicare are, with a few limited exceptions, legal obligations binding upon employees and employers operating within the United States. Deliberate evasion of these obligations strikes me as fundamentally antisocial and lawless. <br><br>The virulence of the agitation against Social Security in the US and the willingness of American employers and employees to evade payroll deductions (an underreported cause of the system's looming (but exaggerated) insolvency) are among the reasons that I've been looking into immigrating to Canada. This sort of selfishness disguised as concern for the national budget seems less common north of the border. I'm 32, and I very much hope that these systems are still operating in my old age. My guess is that the Canadian Social Security and Medicare systems won't collapse unless they encounter insurmountable structural insolvency (i.e., the failure of the Canadian state), but that their US counterparts are much likelier to be fatally sabotaged by concern trolls. <br><br>The apparent willingness of people my age and younger to dissolve Social Security in order to take revenge on the Boomers worries me sometimes. More broadly, the vindictive selfishness at play here offers some idea of why the US has had such a vicious and incompetent response to the current economic troubles. Bitterness about having to support the national pension plan is just the tip of the iceberg. Going back to colonial times we've had mainstream political elements hatefully demanding to soak the poor, and going back at least to Bacon's Rebellion we've had civil unrest as a consequence. <br><br>It's no coincidence that Social Security was introduced in the US at a time when Europe was falling into the grip of communism and fascism. FDR was a savvy fellow who probably saved the hides of the wealthy peers who savaged him as a class traitor, and the American republic, too.<br><br><a href=#c2119822151879281040 title="comment permalink">5/15/15, 8:16 AM</a><br><br>

"Tax cuts" they quack, tax cuts are the remedy. Or de-regulation. Or another international, mega free-trade deal. Over and over and over. It's tiresome. You want to avert your eyes. <br><br>People like Paul Ryan, living in a story-book world of past greatness, look into the camera earnestly and, without flinching, tell your fellow citizens and the world the answer.

She is choosing instead to learn the lifeways of her culture, to become fluent in her language, to relearn traditional skills, to be intimate with the land. The dominant American culture does not encourage such a path.<br>… Please do not mistake Lyla’s choice for an exercise in ideological purity, as if she wished to avoid the taint of power. A better explanation is that she knows that Harvard is not where the action is. There are other paths to walk that are no less important, and it is crucial that someone walk them. I see more and more young people seeking them out today, from within the dominant culture and from its margins. They are walking out of our civilisation’s Story of the World; some are not even entering it.<br>The best and brightest are abandoning the ship, and even those who remain aboard are participating half-heartedly as they sense the inevitable shipwreck. Eventually even going through the motions of complicity becomes intolerable, as our hunger to live a meaningful life draws us towards a new and ancient story of interconnection, interbeing, and social, personal and ecological healing. Yet few of us are free of the programming of our youth, our indoctrination into the values of system; therefore our exit can be messy, subject to hesitation, relapses and diversions. As Lyla told me more recently, “While I know intellectually why I am doing this, I am still so brainwashed it is hard to really know it from my body.”...<br><br><a href=#c7843747212906039512 title="comment permalink">5/15/15, 11:21 AM</a><br><br>

From reading along in the blog and comments I have a number of observations.<br>Images: <br>For the most part Mexicans consider the USA as number one in the world. I have shown university classes videos of Detroit and I had them read a news article about the water shutoffs. They cannot believe what they see and read. The images they get from movies, TV, and popular opinions of the USA are completely contrary to this. Yet they still admired us in many ways. They want Mexico to be more like the USA.<br>Food: <br>Although much of Mexico is being undermined with convenient packaged junk food and drink, especially the lower classes, and thus, obesity and diabetes abound; there are still good large public food markets with fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, and fish. A traditional Mexican diet purchased from these markets is about as healthy as the diet of pre-1950’s.Food distribution is by trucks. Because Mexico is a mix of semi-arid desert, Central Highlands, and Coastal Lowlands, it has with an infinite array of microclimates, almost anything grows somewhere; and the transportation is not much more than 3-4 hours in most cases. Mexican society was quite localized in the past and could revert back to that in many cases. Even without improved hydrology Mexico could probably feed itself. Their definition of what constitutes food is much larger: including fried leather, insects, hooves, intestines, weeds, odd semi-wild fruits, cacti, and so forth. All large cities have wholesale food markets called Central de Abastos where the trucks come in and unload. Retailers, illegal street vendors, and any person who cares to can come here and buy in almost any quantity they want – no restricted access favoring large business. This system provides food that is usually much fresher than the USA’s long distribution systems.<br>Economy: <br>About 50% of the national economy is illegal (or the “informal economy” in professional speak) = street vendors, beggars, parking lot attendants, men renting public curb parking spaces in cities, people cooking in their homes for parties, professionals taking cash, selling anything on the streets, street performers, clowns, peanut salesmen at red light intersections, window cleaners, popsicles in the heat, umbrellas in the rain, pirated movies, computer programs, music, and on to the limits of imagination. This economy would also include whole industries like narcotics, illegal mining, timber, etc. The USA has heading this way in a more open way under the guise of the economic advancements of the tech revolution. I consider Amazon, Uber, and the like not much different than electronic street vendors. The illegal economy doesn’t do taxes, thus it impoverishes the public sector. The illegal economy responds to immediate needs faster than any economist can theorize; thus at the first few drops of rain, a plastic poncho saleswoman is on the street selling plastic garb for a standard price. Some consider this to be more resilient from a social perspective – they are probably right. But it is a race to the bottom. Many beggars and street vendors make more per day than a teacher. The world’s richest man at $78 billion is Mexican. From my perspective it seems clear that the USA is going through a program of Latin Americanization. We can expect more and more black market activity.<br>(continued below)<br><br><a href=#c8755007781176974574 title="comment permalink">5/15/15, 11:31 AM</a><br><br>

In contrast, the USA system of corruption is less obvious because it is systemitized behind a mask of legal maneuvers disguised as good business practices. <br>Low Expectations: This is probably one of Mexico’s great strengths. They expect very little of their leaders and society. They would like a better system, but accept what comes. They can endure much more than Americans can imagine, they have a culture of enduring. However, one big thing that Mexico does not have to endure is life-threatening winters. Temperature comfort is easily attainable. <br>If you break a leg, it is your problem. If a dog bites you, you should have known better. Most people don’t go to the police if they have been robbed or hurt.

Some may disagree about Lyndon Johnson, but he was a good president on domestic issues. Had his successor gotten the US out of Vietnam more quickly, I believe LBJ's war escalation would be remembered as a serious misstep but not as an absolute disaster.<br><br>I agree that the chances of the US getting even two good presidents in a row now are slim, for the reasons you give. Our last good President might have been the first Bush, precisely because he was modest in his aims and promises; that cost him re-election.<br><br><br><a href=#c8023329869312974956 title="comment permalink">5/15/15, 2:17 PM</a><br><br>

The over-achievement and burnout-factor of the top-end of university programs these days has been on my mind a lot since I started architecture school seven years ago, and still bothers me after 3 years out of it. There was a spate of student deaths at East and West coast architecture schools while I was studying, and the student arm of the AIA was abuzz with trying to find a solution - all the students had died in car accidents caused by sleep deprivation. Luckily I never lived more than two blocks from campus, but I did drive five hours from home to school after the Thanksgiving holiday with a raging fever from the flu, because I couldn't afford to not be on campus to finish my project (I viewed it as a greater injustice to repeat a year of school - and thence a year of tuition payments - due to not finishing the project on time). The only solution the schools had was locking studios after hours, not actual reduction of workload. Could it be the increasing sacrifice of "good" education is caused by society doubling-down on education to combat the issues of decline? Which only leads to the pretenses that: each generation is less tough than the last, more education is needed for everyone, and that there will be a job for you when you graduate. The impacts are already afoot, with graduates entering the workplace "used-up" and burned out, and droves of angry unemployed debtors behind them.<br><br><a href=#c8626382597946980626 title="comment permalink">5/15/15, 3:25 PM</a><br><br>

Drinking water from snowmelt runs into reservoirs, but then must be pumped through treatment systems before entering municipal drinking supplies. (Water wonks, please correct me if I am wrong.) It is these pumps which determine the water pressure for the great majority of CA citizens who are on municipal supplies ("city water").<br><br>In my rural area, we purchase gravity-fed irrigation water as runoff from the Sierra Nevada mountains through a system that was built by the gold miners in the 1850s. Not quite the Roman aqueducts, but still pretty impressive. You are not allowed to treat this water at a household level to purify it for drinking, though. Our drinking water comes from a pumped well, 250 feet deep, which produces 5 gallons per minute (for now). We pump this water into a 5000 gal. underground storage tank and then pump it again into the house. Lack of power for pumping would fairly quickly become a problem, but from what I've read a hand pump is not feasible for such a deep well. I am continuing to investigate other possibilities. (Unfortunately moving to a wetter area is not on the table for my family right now. Time and circumstances may change that- we will see.)<br><br>Apologies to everyone who is by now sick to death of hearing about water in California.

I'd found someone (and in fact, a whole community of folks) who not only 'got' it but articulated and reasoned so succinctly what I've been seeing for years, but could not make sense of myself. I've never had a problem understanding the concept of fractal collapse, (Could it also be called 'geometric collapse'?) or White's Law - it just makes perfect sense, right?<br><br>While I still appreciate it, these last 2 posts, I have to admit were not fun to read, but fill me with greater urgency to get down to the business of preparing/collapsing. Yikes! How to prepare my teenagers?! (CAN I prepare my teenagers?) <br><br>I think if we're in the Era of Pretense, we must be fairly far along in it, to the Emperor's New Clothes stage, no? It doesn't honestly feel like anyone truly believes anymore that any of these bubbles or fixes to keep us on that starry ever-upward trajectory of progress are actually going to work, Do they? Not in the long run and not for the populace, only maybe for themselves and their cronies. Even the politicians these days don't work very hard to hide the fact that their policies and proposals are their own personal &amp; crony corrupt money-grabs before it all goes belly up. (&amp; that is not just the USA, of course).<br><br> If people are getting angry at you, I think that's where the anger is from - it's not like you're peeling the scales from someone's eyes. Those protective scales have long ago fallen off on their own and have been replaced with makeshift band-aids. It's the crummy, flimsy band-aids you are knocking away. They already know the truth. They're just not emotionally ready to face it. Ditto for 'not understanding' the process of a fractal collapse. It's not only easy to imagine and visualize, it's happening now around us - it's just painful to accept. <br><br> I think the parallels to Elizabeth Kubler- Ross' 5 stages of death/bereavement is a brilliant observation - regardless of the sequencing disparity. <br><br>On a brighter note: I'm stubbornly not giving up the terrace garden and with the help of a green-thumbed friend have some lush, greens and spices thriving in little pots. Cherry tomatoes just pushing up from the soil. Aloe Vera has new baby shoots, pineapple tree is sulking, but holding steady, lye on order for soap-making and the kiln at work back in order, so I can get back to it.

Not because of lack of power to pump water though, but rather the disintegration of the pipe network and other infrastructure. <br><br>However it is relatively simple to supply running water at reasonable pressure for a household, even without electricity. <br><br>I am not sure why you say that you require a 0.5 or 1 KW motor to pump water. I suspect you might be thinking of an electric powered, on demand, water pump. These certainly require the type of motor you mention but are a rather recent development. While they have become almost ubiquitous, and might be convenient, they are not the only solution, and in some ways, are a rather poor and unnecessary solution to providing running water for a household.<br><br>A much simpler solution is to use gravity feed from a header tank. That is the simplest, cheapest and most reliable way to maintain constant water pressure in the face of hugely varying flow rates. (Most town water supplies use a gravity fed system) Plus one doesn't need the rather high pressures normally supplied. A reasonable head of pressure can be supplied from a simple header tank on a stand. For many years, both my grandparents and parents and all the neighbours in a small town on the outskirts of a major city had such a system, with the header tanks usually around 5 to 6 metres off the ground. It gave perfectly adequate flow rates using the appropriate plumbing designed to work at lower pressures. Plus it had the advantage that one could turn on all the taps without a loss of pressure.<br><br>For an idea of the power requirements to lift the water from the ground level storage tanks, we currently use water from the mains system at a rate of about 360L per day (this is significantly more than when we subsisted on rain water collection). This equates to around 1-2L per minute of sunshine during the day. Even a 5 watt solar panel with appropriate electric pump, would pump sufficient water during the day to supply that level of consumption, using a header tank of reasonable height. Also consider that a single person with a pedal powered pump could pump that amount of water in 5 to 10 minutes. (That used to be one of our chores at my grandparents', pump the water by hand, which took about 20 minutes every few days.)<br><br>Enough said, I think, on my part.<br><br>Cheers<br>Andrew<br><br><a href=#c2352164954285808690 title="comment permalink">5/16/15, 7:39 AM</a><br><br>

The radioactive elements in the crust have more energy potential, then and now.<br><br>You are right that the United States of America is not the world. I wonder if someone who had undertaken as careful a study of China's society, say (or Russia's, or Iceland's, or South Africa's or what-have-you) as you have, then comparing it to historical scenarios, as you have, would come the same conclusions as you have and make the same global predictions as you do?<br><br>Because not all economies are the same. Some haven't even been tried out yet. The American Empire's economy is unique. Like a fat man eating a bacon cheeseburger and french fries with a pitcher of yellow beer, we've taken energy per capita way past the point of maximum benefit and into the realm of immediate and lasting harm.<br><br> In terms of your concept of industrial civilization, American society can likely be said to define the high end of energy use per capita. The low end has also been defined. That would be the energy use per capita of the societies that participated in the First Industrial Revolution, which was powered by sun, water, wind, and muscle, with coal playing a minor role for heating largely, and also some early chemicals. Somewhere in between is the point where energy use per capita crosses from benefit to harm. Somewhere in between is the point where energy use per capita is indefinitely sustainable with current technological understanding and applied science. How do these points relate? If the latter is near the former, then energy use per capita is not a key factor in whether a technical society sustains itself or goes into decline. Social, political, cultural factors may well be the determinants. So, while from reading your books and blog since The Long Descent was first published I imagine you will disagree, I find it highly unlikely that historians several centuries from now will look back on a global dark age as you predict. Based upon my own studies so far, I believe that the indefinitely sustainable energy use per capita is close enough to the benefit/harm line as to be no matter. And therefore I am doubtful that in this century and the next, absolutely no society will find a combination of social organization, political structures, cultural outlooks, etc., that achieves this, and then be able to spread it.<br><br>But we shall see, I suppose. <br><br>Anyway, my two cents.

To what extent does the field these days allow the idea that there might be different, and even opposing, kinds of progress, and to what extent is it still a matter of where you are on the preordained line from the caves to the stars, and the only question is whether you're moving or not? <br><br>Cherokee, as I recall, the incidence of actual or attempted ripoffs goes up sharply in the latter stages of a boom, when the limits are beginning to be felt. That might have something to do with it!<br><br>Raven, hopium and despairoin are both deadly drugs just now. <br><br>Vilko, as with so much else in the US, everything depends on where you live. No, Chicago doesn't have a gravity-fed water system, but a great many Americans live in cities and towns that do. Thus we get another round of what's shaping up to be the classic American model of decline, which is very local: here a town, there a city, over there a rural district, all skidding downhill at different rates. <br><br>Bruce, I've discussed issues of timing to some extent in <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i>. As for the dismissal of White's Law, I've found in practice that there's literally nothing you can say that economists will hear; they'll insist that White's Law can't apply to us, and if you ask them why, you'll get something that amounts to "because it can't apply to us." It's not a matter of facing skepticism, but of trying to confront an airtight (and almost thought-free) dogma. <br><br>Raging Bull, there's a huge European peak oil scene. I don't know how much traction the peak oil concept has gotten elsewhere, though. <br><br>Andrew, oh, granted. I'm not opposed to social security, I just assume that it's not going to be there once the Boomers finish battening on it. <br><br>Trog, it's a real question which bone will break first -- so many are strained to the snapping point. <br><br>Varun, I think we're already in the second round of the Great Recession, based on observation of the few unmanipulated stats.

I had already looked into #1 and discarded it for the reasons you cited. I hadn't thought of the combination approach #2, though.

"So far from God, so close to the United States" still seems like a good summary. <br><br>Whomever, good. Yes, a lot of the more expansionist sort of empires crack up once they run out of people to conquer and enslave; compare that to current talk about "energy slaves" and you may notice some parallels. <br><br>Eduardo, I'd encourage you to look up how many times that's been proposed, with precisely zero effect. The world is full of marvelous plans that would bring all kinds of benefits if human beings could simply be made to stop acting like human beings and do what reformers want them to do. Since human beings persist in acting like human beings, though, all such plans are wasted breath. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, for some arbitrary value of the word "good," maybe. I grant you Roosevelt and Eisenhower, but Truman and Johnson were mediocre, and I wouldn't put Kennedy even that high -- his reputation is a posthumous hagiography plastered over a profoundly flawed man and a largely failed presidency. I find Seymour Hersh's <i>The Dark Side of Camelot</i> far more convincing than the effusions of the Church of St. JFK. <br><br>Ed-M, when those bubbles pop, the impact will be impressive. I'm currently writing a novel set on the Massachusetts coast north of Boston, and to the extent that it strays into near-future speculation -- a point I haven't decided yet -- the aftereffects of the tech crash on Boston will play a significant role.<br><br>Architrains, good. More and more often these days, I hear from teenagers who have taken a beady-eyed look at the college trap and are doing something else with their lives. <br><br>Valekeeper, every so often Barry hits one out of the park; this is one of those. As for the interface between the eras discussed here and the phases in <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i>, nah, the eras are on a much shorter time scale. We'll go through all five here in the US on the way from abundance industrialism to scarcity industrialism, and then probably repeat it over again at least once as we move through the remaining phases. <br><br>Ahavah, of course it's surreal.

As you correctly point out (as you have before), the issue of nuclear waste is something many communities will have to deal with for millennia. But it has the potential to get exceedingly messy before it settles down to the point where a carved marker saying "Beyond here there be Death!" in the local dialect is all that's required to keep sensible folk safe from this hazard. <br><br>The great technological end-time achievements of the Maya and other prior civilisations had the useful habit of just lying there quietly growing moss when their priests, victims and deities went away. <br><br>We are not so lucky. One of our end-time techno-achievements is embodied in the rather troublesome matter of about 440 nuclear power plants scattered around the planet (and another 60 under construction plus a few more 'experimental' reactors) which require sustained external power supplies to keep cores and waste fuel ponds cool, over human inter-generational time frames. Under any plausible scenario 'going forward' this level of centralised planning, entailing deliberately and prematurely shutting down base load generation to make it safe before the rest of the grid goes down, seems to be an unlikely possibility.<br><br>France in particular is in a real catch-22 situation in this regard as it gets a very high proportion of its energy (over 75%) from nuclear. A staged shutdown of all those 60 or so reactors runs the real risk of the grid collapsing completely due to demand exceeding non-nuclear generation capacity long before the last plants are in cold shutdown with all their fuel rods in huge air-cooled rain-fed spent fuel ponds, or in cask storage in that very useful place: 'somewhere else'. <br><br>Considering the cost of tidying up one reactor at Three Mile Island (a job not yet done) one reactor at Chernobyl, and now the three (four? six?) reactors at Fukushima, we are already at the point where we cannot gather sufficient resources together to tidy up even those three sites to a 'safe for ever' state. What about the other 437? Where will the cash and effort and planning come from to attend to those in time?<br><br>But without casting aside the pretense that all is well and will continue to a bright and glorious future, the real consequence of such dangerous myopia is the rapid failure of the electricity distribution grid and prompt and enduring ‘Fukushima-type’ consequences at a NPP near you. Dodging the down-wind plume from burning fuel pools (50 or more in the 'former U S o A') has the potential to become one of the most popular reason for international travel during the great unraveling, albeit on foot.<br><br><a href=#c8643233904903182686 title="comment permalink">5/17/15, 1:24 AM</a><br><br>

When you fail to sell laptop batteries to all the major car companies, but you have committed to a ‘super factory’ to build those batteries, you need a new story to tell to keep the suckers investing. “Hey, let’s sell batteries to all those people with grid-tie photovoltaics!”<br><br>Next year, there’ll be the marinised and containerised version of the powerwall, designed to keep global shipping functioning.<br>The year after, the high-g version to power the latest creation of Virgin Galactic.<br>And so on, ad nauseum.<br><br>As for the tech aspects of this piece of cr.p (sorry JMG, I find euphemisms difficult to come up with), when you consider that they are first generation lithium laptop batteries in a fancy box, you can chuck all the predictions out the window – eg, if you want them to last more than a year, your capacity is 3kW/h not 10. If you want to kill them instantly and burn your house down, overcharge them once (easy to do with a fault in the charge controller). If you want to kill them a little more slowly, but still way too quickly, discharge them fully a few times. Etc, etc, etc…<br><br>As for Ni-Fe, William, as Chris suggested, I’m running a set of Nickel Iron batteries in my (almost) off-grid house.

They’re also difficult to monitor to see what the state of charge actually is, so overcharging to buggery is the default method of operation (given the current price of pv panels, inefficiency is pretty well irrelevant, however).<br><br>Finding charge controllers and inverters that will work with them is also a bit of a trial, as they charge and discharge over a much wider range that lead-acid or Li-ion chemistries.<br><br>On the plus side, they have a proven long life (as much as 80 years;, they don’t care about being overcharged or overdischarged; they can be run without charge controllers or inverters without damage. If you do manage to poison them (usually with CO2 in the water), you can clean them out and add new electrolyte to get them going again.<br><br>They aren’t the easiest things to live with, but they work well when you treat them right. After nearly two years, I am still trying to develop a functional set of superstitions that will allow me to manage the batteries effectively. As it is, I run out of electrons occasionally still. I also distill and use 20 litres of water in the batteries every three to six months.<br><br>But I sure wouldn’t buy anything from Tesla.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Les<br><br><a href=#c4937133235512387728 title="comment permalink">5/17/15, 3:44 AM</a><br><br>

Latin American attitudes towards "El Norte" and Appalachia's desire to "catch up" with the rest of the country will probably die a slow death. It's why I'm hoping for a particularly fast, bubble popping, spectacular fall that JMG mentioned in his response to Ed-M, if nothing else, it will be an unmistakable sign that the dominant American model has failed and is not to be emulated.<br>I must agree with you, Tom, regarding Mexicans, at least my experience with immigrants here in the U.S. I find them uniquely situated to weather the coming storm with flying colors. Their resilience, social bonds and etiquette, and willingness to make the most of a situation with little complaint, and even a good attitude, will serve them well in the future we're facing, and puts them head and shoulders above the average depressed, demoralized juero. But getting them to see that is another story, since they've bought into the myth of "El Norte" as much as anyone. I do what I can. As an outsider, I point out the strengths of their culture, how I value them in contrast with the dominant juero culture, I encourage them to maintain their traditions, and most of all, I encourage them to view the dominant juero culture with a critical eye, seeing its flaws and drawbacks, and that it's a house of cards/ smoke and mirrors game that won't last. I'm trying to establish a local immigrant sustainable ag program that focuses on corn and three sisters planting. I'm grateful for the opportunity to take breaks from juerolandia, and am grateful that I don't even have to go very far to do so. It's good for my soul to take breaks from the ugliness that the dominant culture has become and to see a better way of handling poverty.<br>I've lived in KY my entire life, and if I had a nickel for every program the commonwealth has spent on "catching" Eastern KY up with the rest of the country. Talk about the myth of progress. Ever since Night Comes to the Cumberlands and Johnson's ARC, Appalachia has been one big subsidy dumpster for every harebrained idea to bring Appalachia "up to speed" with the rest of the U.S. SOAR is just the latest in a long line of failed ideas. Nobody dare ask if Boston or San Francisco are sustainable models for eastern KY, or even if it's possible to emulate the wealthy regions. Meanwhile, permaculturists and homesteaders are streaming into eastern KY in search of cheap land and a light regulatory hand (the freedom to do what they want without enforcement breathing down their neck) unnoticed by the powers that be. If anywhere is going to host the monasteries of the coming dark age, to preserve culture and knowledge, here in North America, it will be Appalachia. <br><br><br><a href=#c6217457890295746051 title="comment permalink">5/17/15, 8:00 AM</a><br><br>

The pain of dissonance leads to assigning blame on a cause--any cause--so long as it isn't a fact that the assignor can't handle. Eg, jews blamed for the indignities of the German people in the Weimar era, where WWI reparations were impossible to pay without hyperinflation.

First a data point from China. A while back you said that you had x many page views from China a week, 60 if memory serves. Blogger is blocked in China, one can get around the Chinese firewall with a VPN but it makes the traffic appear to come from somewhere else. Whatever number you are seeing is a lower bound. I don't know if it is possible to get a good number.<br><br> Second, the term "third world" is kind of insulting if one knows the origin of the phrase. It came out of the Cold War. First world refers to the western industrial democracies. Second world refers to the communist countries and third world refers to everything else, sort of. Not Switzerland or Sweden, the socialist countries in the armed neutrality camp, they were assumed to be on our side for some reason.<br> After the Cold War ended and distinctions based on ideology made less sense it was rebranded the global north and the global south for a little while, but that didn't really stick. Developed, developing and undeveloped are the current terms and they roughly translate to on our side for years, coming to our side, and haven't decided to join our side yet.

These hand-sanitizers, it seems, have some non-contact sensor so you don't risk picking up a germ while preparing to kill the ones on your hands. But then I heard a conversation between a couple of staff members: "Still no batteries for the dispensers?" "No. I don't know when we'll get them." Maybe that's why I didn't see anyone sanitizing their hands... <br> <br>A moment ago, a trailer for a story on All Things Considered (NPR news magazine) promised to defend The Luddite movement. I can hardly wait!<br> <br>On Saturday, I conducted a ham radio communications exercise, where I sat on 7205 kHz from 10AM until 3PM (with a few breaks), just inviting contacts. I logged 56 stations, from South Carolina to Massachusetts and west to Ohio. In most cases, the audio quality was better than my cell phone, even when the other guys were sending 5-10W. (I was using 100W.) The antenna was a simple wire dipole about 20' above the ground (home made). This is, I think, about what we should expect for a fine summer day, on the 40m band. Longer distances are more likely at night.<br><br><br><a href=#c8631800069568577120 title="comment permalink">5/18/15, 2:13 PM</a><br><br>

As a group, we Boomers have some traits and modes of behavior that are, to put it mildly, annoying, and that I wearily recognize in myself. Even if we were as a group wise, saintly and altruistic, the mere fact that there are so many of us and that middle age is the time when people typically occupy the seats of power and influence would be bound to cause resentment among younger generations who are impatiently waiting for us to get out of their way. That's how many Boomers felt about their elders in their own youth, and payback's a female dog.<br><br>Still, since you write "selfishness of boomers . . . I can't help but to think that our "greatest generation" is going to continue to grab the remaining resources for themselves and leave the younger generations to do without," do take note that the oldest Boomers entered adulthood around 1967, just shy of fifty years ago. Have you noticed that in the past half century, most of the philanthropic organizations, service organizations, youth organizations, churches, organizations for social improvement like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, environmental protection organizations, civic improvement organizations, arts organizations etc., have dried up and blown away for lack of volunteers and donors? Who do you think has been giving money and time to those organizations for the past fifty years? Do you think they run and fund themselves? <br><br><br><br><a href=#c2776443088279092273 title="comment permalink">5/19/15, 3:35 PM</a><br><br>

Wow, 15.3%! That appears to me to be one of the most beautiful scams I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing (I thought that it was bad here at 9.5% + 1.5%). And where is that money being spent? Is it used to "invest" in securities (charming terms, both)? Are the contribution rates stable or have they increased over time?<br><br>When you step back and look at the big picture, that scheme appears to reduce consumption for goods and services, which in turn reduces the possible inflationary impact of printing money. And "investment" asset prices are reinforced and supported. The top end of town must be falling over themselves laughing at us all! hehe!<br><br>The real problem will arise when the intersection of: people wanting to liquidate those "investment" assets into cash; the number of people entering the system declines significantly; and/or the population no longer desires to support the current or increasing rates of contribution into that system. Oh yeah, it'll be interesting.<br><br>Still an even bigger perspective will reveal the system to be the shell game that it is and perhaps as it appears not to be really based on "real world" assets then perhaps they genuinely will actually think of something. They got this far printing money without causing an inflationary spike, which is a real credit (pun intended).<br><br>Incidentally, with all of the shenanigans going on with exchange rates, things are actually getting more expensive down here regardless of what the official inflation figures say.
