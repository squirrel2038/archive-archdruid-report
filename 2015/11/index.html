I had intended this week’s post to be the next episode in the Retrotopia narrative, chronicling Peter Carr’s meeting with the irrepressible Col. Tom Pappas of the Lakeland Republic Army, and the trip out to Defiance County for the annual drone shoot, but that will have to wait another week. No, I haven’t decided to comment instead on the recent spate of terror attacks in France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As people in a variety of other corners of the world have pointed out, identical outrages happen all over the Third World every few days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The only reason this latest horror has gotten so much air time is that it affected people in one of the world’s privileged countries instead. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nor am I going to be devoting this week’s post to the latest, extremely troubling round of news from the climate change front—though that’s going to get a post to itself down the road a bit, when I’ve had time to do a little more research. That’s a far bigger story than the terror attacks in Paris, though of course it’s not getting anything like as much attention in the media.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From the beginning of serious salt water infiltration into South Florida’s aquifers, through ominously bulging sediments in Arctic Ocean shallows, to an assortment of truly frightening data points from Greenland, it’s clear that we’ve passed the threshold from “something may happen someday” to “something is happening now”—a transition that probably has quite a bit to do with the increasingly shrill tone of climate-change denialist rhetoric just now, and even more to do with the increasingly plaintive tone of those activists who still insist that everything can be fixed if we all just join hands and sing “Kum ba ya” one more time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No, this week’s post is going to explore a topic that’s far less important in the overall scheme of things, though it’s not without its relevance to the crisis of our age. I want to talk about the reaction I fielded in response to last week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, which was an exploration of our culture’s taboo against <a href=../../2015/11/the-heresy-of-technological-choice.html>choosing not to use the latest technologies</a>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I expected that post to field its share of outraged denunciations, and it certainly did. What I didn’t expect was that it would receive more comments than any other post in the history of <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, and the vast majority of those comments would agree heartily with the two points of that post. The first of these points is that there’s a significant number of Americans out there who, for one good reason or another, choose not to use cell phones, televisions, automobiles, microwave ovens, and an assortment of other currently fashionable technologies. The second is that there’s an even larger number of Americans out there who get really, really freaky about people who make such choices. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Some of the stories I heard from readers of my blog were absolute classics of the type. There was the couple who don’t enjoy television and so don’t own one, and had a relative ask them every single year, over and over again, if she could buy them a television for Christmas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They said no thank you every single year, and finally she went out and bought them a television anyway because she just couldn’t stand the thought that they weren’t watching one. There was the coworker who plopped a laptop playing some sitcom or other right down on the lap of one of my readers and demanded that the reader watch it, right then and there, so that they would have something to talk about. There was the person who, offended by another reader’s lack of interest in television, finally shouted, “You must be living in a dream world!” Er, which of these people was spending four to six hours a day watching paid actors playing imaginary characters act out fictional events in contrived settings? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Televisions were far from the only focus of this sort of technobullying. Other readers reported getting similar reactions from other people because they didn’t happen to have, and weren’t interested in having, microwave ovens, smartphones, and so on down the list of currently fashionable trinkets. The stories are really quite eye-opening, and not in a good way. Forget about all the popular cant that insists that you’re free in the USA to make your own choices and have whatever lifestyle you want.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>According to a significant fraction of Americans—and to judge from what my readers reported, that fraction isn’t limited to any one class, income level, or region of the country—the only freedom you’re supposed to exercise, when it comes to technology, is that of choosing which brand label will be slapped on each item in the officially approved list of devices you’re expected to own. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The prevalence of technobullying and technoshaming in today’s America is a fascinating point, and one we’ll explore in a few moments, with the able assistance of the denunciations flung at last week’s post by the minority of readers who reacted that way. What I want to consider first is the fact that so many people responded to last week’s post so positively. One blog in an uncrowded corner of the internet, written by an author whose day job as an archdruid locates him squarely on the outer fringes of contemporary American life, is very nearly the opposite of a statistically valid poll. Still, the sheer volume of the response makes me suspect that something significant is going on here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By that I don’t mean that there’s some sort of groundswell of renunciation, leading people to walk away from technologies in the same spirit that led medieval ascetics to don hair shirts and flog themselves for the good of their souls. That’s one of the common stereotypes directed at those of us who aren’t interested in the latest technotrash, and it completely misses what’s actually going on. I’ll use myself as an example here. I don’t own a television—I haven’t owned one in my adult life—and it’s not because I have some moral or political objection to televisions, or because I’m into self-denial, or what have you. I don’t own a television because I find watching television about as enticing as eating a bowl of warm snot. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s not the programming, either—that’s another of the standard stereotypes, that the only thing one can find objectionable about television is the programming, and it’s as inaccurate as the rest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To me, quite simply, the activity of watching little colored shapes jerk around on a screen is boring and irritating, not relaxing and enjoyable, no matter what the little colored shapes are supposed to be doing. Yes, I grew up with a television in the house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I experienced plenty of it back in the day, and I have zero interest in experiencing any more, because I don’t like it. It really is that simple. It’s that simple for others as well: they don’t find this or that technology enjoyable, useful, or relevant to their lifestyles, and so they’ve chosen to do something else with their money and time. Shouldn’t so simple and personal a choice be their own business, and nobody else’s? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To judge by the reactions that those who make such choices routinely field, apparently not. The pushbacks discussed in the comments page last week range from the sort of in-your-face confrontations discussed above to a much-forwarded article in I forget which online rag, where somebody was airily announcing that he wasn’t interested in being friends with somebody unless he could text some vacuous comment about lunch to the other person at 2:15 and get a response by 2:30. (My readers and I are good with that—somebody who insists on getting immediate feedback for their random outbursts of mental flatulence isn’t somebody we want as a friend, either.) Then there were the indignant responses to last week’s post, which belong in a category by themselves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m sorry to say that my favorite diatribe didn’t show up in the comment queue for <i>The Archdruid Report</i>. It appeared instead on one of the many other websites that carry my weekly posts, and it insisted, among several other less juicy bits, that my lack of enthusiasm for television obviously meant that I was conspiring to deprive everyone else of their teevees. You’ve got to admit that for sheer giddy delirium, that one’s hard to beat. By the same logic, if I dislike peanuts—as in fact I do—I must be committed to some kind of anti-peanut crusade devoted to eradicating the entire species. Not so;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Arachis hypogaea</i>
is welcome to live and thrive, for all I care, and my fellow hominids are equally welcome to eat as much of its produce as they happen to desire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In fact, they can divide my share among them. The only thing I ask in return is that nobody expect me to eat the things myself. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same rule applies equally to television, as it does to a great many other things. Like most human beings, I enjoy some things and don’t enjoy others, and in the vast majority of these cases, nobody feels particularly threatened by the fact that I don’t like something they do, and avoid it for that sensible reason. For this one commenter, at least, that obviously wasn’t the case, and it’s worth reflecting on the vast personal insecurities that must have driven such a bizarre reaction. Still, that was one of a kind, so we’ll pass on to the others. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A theme that showed up rather more often in the hate mail responding to last week’s post was the insistence that if I don’t have a television, a microwave, or a cell phone, I’m a hypocrite if I have an internet connection. I encourage my readers to think about that claim for a moment. I suppose a case could be made that if my lack of interest in having a television, a microwave, or a cell phone was motivated by the kind of passion for hair-shirt asceticism mentioned above, and I had an internet connection, I could be accused of the kind of slacking that used to get you thrown out of the really top-notch hermitages. From any other perspective, it’s a triumph of absurdity. If people are in fact allowed to choose, from among the currently available technologies, those that make them happiest—as the cheerleaders of the consumer economy delight to insist—what could possibly be wrong with choosing some old technologies and some newer ones, if that’s the mix you prefer? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then there are the people whose response to the technology of an older time is to yammer endlessly about whatever bad things happened in those days, even when the bad things in question had nothing to do with the technology and vice versa. People like the couple I discussed in last week’s post, who prefer Victorian furnishings and clothing to their modern equivalents, get this sort of bizarre non sequitur all the time, but variants of it turned up in my inbox last week as well. Here again, there’s some heavy-duty illogic involved. If a technology that was invented and used in the 1850s, say, is permanently tarred with the various social evils of that era, and ought to be rejected because those evils happened, wouldn’t that also mean that the internet is just as indelibly tarred with the social evils of the modern era, and ought to be discarded because bad things are happening in the world today? What’s sauce for the goose, after all, is sauce for the gander...</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finally, there’s the capstone of the whole edifice of unreason, the insistence that anybody who doesn’t use the latest, hottest technotrash wants to go “back to the caves,” or to even take all of humanity to that much-denounced destination. “The caves” have a bizarre gravitational effect on the imagination of a certain class of modern thinkers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Everything that’s not part of the latest assortment of glitzy technogimmicks, in their minds, somehow morphs into the bearskin kilts and wooden clubs that so many of us still, despite well over a century of detailed archeological evidence, insist on pushing onto our prehistoric ancestors. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When people of this kind archly dismiss people like the Chrismans, the neo-Victorian couple just mentioned, as going “back to the caves,” they’re engaged in a very interesting kind of absurdity. Do cavemen and Victorians belong on the same level? Sure, cavemen had flush toilets and central heating, daily newspapers and public libraries, not to mention factories, railways, global maritime trade, a telegraph network covering much of the planet’s land surface, and a great deal more of the same kind! That’s absurd, of course. It’s even more absurd to insist that people who simply don’t enjoy using this or that technology, and so don’t use it, are going back to “the caves”—but I can promise you, dear reader, from my own personal experience, that if you show a lack of interest in any piece of fashionable technology, you’ll have this phrase thrown at you. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That happens because “the caves” aren’t real. They aren’t, for example, the actual cave-shrines of the Magdalenian people who lived fifteen thousand years ago, whose lifestyles were quite similar to those of Native Americans before Columbus, and who used to go deep into the caves of Europe to paint sacred images that still stun the viewer today by their beauty and artistry. “The caves” of contemporary rhetoric, rather, are thoughtstopping abstractions, bits of verbal noise that people have been taught to use so they don’t ask inconvenient questions about where this thing called “progress” is taking us and whether any sane person would actually want to go there. Flattening out the entire complex richness of the human past into a single cardboard bogeyman labeled “the caves” is one way to do that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So is papering over the distinctly ugly future we’re making for ourselves with a screen shot or two from a Jetsons cartoon and a gaudy banner saying “We’re headed for the stars!”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s really rather fascinating, all things considered, that the image of the cave should have been picked up for that dubious purpose. Not that long ago, most literate people in the Western world tended to have a very different image come to mind when someone mentioned caves. That was courtesy of a man named Aristocles of Athens, who lived a little more than 2300 years ago and whose very broad shoulders got him the nickname Plato. In the longest, most influential, and most problematic of his works, usually called <i>The Republic</i>—a bad choice, as this word nowadays has connotations of rights under law that the Greek title <i>Politeia</i> lacks—he framed his discussion of the gap between perception and reality with an arresting image. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Imagine, Plato says, that we are all shackled in a cave, unable to turn our heads to either side. All we can see are dark shapes that move this way and that on the flat wall of the cave in front of us. Those dark shapes are all we know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They are our reality. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now imagine that one of these prisoners manages to get loose from his shackles, and turns away from the cave wall and the dark shapes on it. He’s in for a shock, because what he sees when he turns around is a bonfire, and people moving objects in front of the flames so that the objects cast shadows on the cave wall. Everything he thought was reality is simply a shadow cast by these moving objects. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If the prisoner who’s gotten loose pays attention, furthermore, he might just notice that the cave isn’t limited to the bonfire, the prisoners, the objects casting the shadows and the people who manipulate those objects. Off past the bonfire, on one side of the cave, the floor slopes upwards, and in the distance is a faint light that doesn’t seem to come from the fire at all. If our escaped prisoner is brave enough, he might decide to go investigate that light. As he does so, the bonfire and the shadows slip into the darkness behind him, and the light ahead grows brighter and clearer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then, if he’s brave enough and keeps going, he steps out of the cave and into the sunlight. That’s not an easy thing, either, because the light is so much more intense than the dim red glow in the cave that for a while, he can’t see a thing. He stumbles, rubs his eyes, tries to find his bearings, and discovers that the detailed knowledge he had of the way shadows moved on the cave wall won’t help him at all in this new, blazingly bright realm. He has to discard everything he thinks he knows, and learn the rules of an unfamiliar world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Bit by bit, though, he accomplishes this. His eyes adapt to the sunlight, he learns to recognize objects and to sense things—color, for example, and depth—which didn’t exist in the shadow-world he thought he inhabited when he was still a prisoner in the cave. Eventually he can even see the sun, and know where the light that illumines the real world actually comes from. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now, Plato says, imagine that he decides to go back into the cave to tell the remaining prisoners what he’s seen. To begin with, it’s going to be rough going, because his eyes have adapted to the brilliant daylight and so he’s going to trip and stumble on the way down. Once he gets there, anything he says to the prisoners is going to be dismissed as the most consummate rubbish:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>what is this nonsense about color and depth, and a big bright glowing thing that crosses something called the sky? What’s more, the people to whom he’s addressing his words are going to misunderstand them, thinking that they’re about the shadow-world in front of their eyes—after all, that’s the only reality they know—and they’re going to decide that he must be an idiot because nothing he says has anything to do with the shadow-world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Plato didn’t mention that the prisoners might respond by trying to drag the escapee back into line with them and bully him into putting his shackles back on, though that’s generally the way such things work out in practice. Plato also never saw a television, which is unfortunate in a way—if he had, he could have skipped the complicated setup with the bonfire and the people waving around objects that cast shadows, and simply said, “Imagine that we’re all watching television in a dark room.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course Plato had his own reasons for using the cave metaphor, and developed it in directions that aren’t relevant to this week’s post. The point I want to make here is that every technology is a filter that shapes the way we experience and interact with the world. In some cases, such as television, the filtering effect is so drastic it’s hard not to see—unless, that is, you don’t want to see it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In other cases, it’s subtle. There are valid reasons people might want to use one filter rather than another, or to set aside an assortment of filters in order to get a clearer view of some part of the world or their lives.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are also, as already noted, matters of personal choice. Some of us prefer sun and wind and depth and color to the play of shadows on the walls of the cave. That doesn’t mean that we’re going to drag those who don’t share that preference out into the blinding light, or that we’re going to turn ourselves into the Throg the Cave Man shadow that’s being waved around so enthusiastically on one corner of the cave wall. It does mean—or so the response to last week’s post suggests—that a significant number of people are losing interest in the shadow-play and clambering up the awkward but rewarding journey into the sunlight and the clean cool air, and it may just mean as well that those who try to bully them into staying put and staring at shadows may have less success than they expect. </div>

On an entirely personal note, I’m pleased to report that Founders House Publishing has just brought out a new edition of my first science fiction novel, <i>The Fires of Shalsha</i>. It’s closer to mainstream SF than anything else I’ve written—it’s even set on another planet—but fans of my subsequent novels, <i>Star’s Reach</i> and <i>Twilight’s Last Gleaming</i>, will find it an enjoyable read. Copies can be ordered <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2015/11/new-release-fires-of-shalsha.html>here</a>. </div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
Among the interesting benefits of writing a blog like this, focusing as it does on the end of industrial civilization, are the opportunities it routinely affords for a glimpse at the stranger side of the collective thinking of our time. The last few weeks have been an unusually good source of that experience, as a result of one detail of the Retrotopia narrative I’ve been developing in the posts here. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The detail in question is the system by which residents of my fictional Lakeland Republic choose how much infrastructure they want to have and, not incidentally, to pay for via their local tax revenues. It’s done on a county-by-county basis by majority vote. The more infrastructure you want, the higher your taxes are; the more infrastructure you can do without, the less of your income goes to the county to pay for it. There are five levels, called tiers, and each one has a notional date connected to it: thus tier five has the notional date of 1950, and corresponds to the infrastructure you’d expect to find in a county in the Midwestern states of the US in that year: countywide electrical, telephone, water, and sewer service; roads and related infrastructure throughout the county capable of handling heavy automobile use; and mass transit—specifically, streetcars—in the towns. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The other tiers have less infrastructure, and correspondingly lower taxes. Tier four has a notional date of 1920, tier three of 1890, tier two of 1860, and tier one of 1830. In each case, the infrastructure you’d find in such a county is roughly what you’d find in a midwestern American county in that year. With tier one, your county infrastructure consists of dirt roads and that’s about it. All the other functions of county government exist in tier one, tier five, and everything in between; there are courts, police, social welfare provisions for those who are unable to take care of themselves, and so forth—all the things you would expect to find in any midwestern county in the US at any point between 1830 and 1950. That’s the tier system:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>one small detail of the imaginary future I’ve been sketching here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Before we go on, I’d like my readers to stop and notice that the only things that are subject to the tier system are the elements of local infrastructure that are paid for by local tax revenues. If you live in a county that voted to adopt a certain tier level, that tells you what kind of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>infrastructure will be funded by local tax revenues, and therefore what the tax bills are going to be like. That’s all it tells you. In particular, the tier system doesn’t apply to privately owned infrastructure—for example, railroads in the Lakeland Republic are privately owned, and so every county, whatever its tier, has train stations in any town where paying passengers and freight may be found in sufficient quantity to make it worth a railroad’s while to stop there. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The tier system also, and crucially, doesn’t determine what kind of technology the residents can use. If you live in a tier one county, you can use all the electrical appliances you can afford to buy, as long as you generate the electricity yourself. Some technologies that are completely dependent on public infrastructure aren’t going to work in a low tier county—for example, without paved roads, gas stations, huge government subsidies for petroleum production, military bases all over the Middle East, and a great deal more, cars aren’t much more than oversized paperweights—but that’s built into the technology in question, not any fault of the tier system. Furthermore, the tier system doesn’t determine social customs and mores.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you live in a tier four county, for example, no law requires you to dress in a zoot suit or a flapper dress, drink bootleg liquor, and say things like “Hubba hubba” and “Twenty-three skidoo!” This may seem obvious, but trust me, it’s apparently far from obvious to a certain portion of my readers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I can say this because, ever since the tier system first got mentioned in the narrative, I’ve fielded a steady stream of comments from people who wanted to object to the tier system because it forcibly deprives people of access to technology. I had one reader insist that the tier system would keep farmers in tier one counties from using plastic sheeting for hoop houses, for example, and another who compared the system to the arrangements in former Eastern Bloc nations, where the Communist Party imposed rigid restrictions on what technologies people could have. The mere facts that plastic sheeting for hoop houses isn’t infrastructure paid for by tax revenues, and that the tier system doesn’t impose rigid restrictions on anybody—on the contrary, it allows the voters in each county to choose for themselves how much infrastructure they’re going to pay for—somehow never found their way into the resulting diatribes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

What made all this even more fascinating to me is that no matter how often I addressed the points in question, and pointed out that the tier system just allows local voters to choose what infrastructure gets paid for their by tax money, a certain fraction of readers just kept rabbiting on endlessly along the same lines. It wasn’t that they were disagreeing with what I was saying. It’s that they were acting as though I had never said anything to address the subject at all, even when I addressed it to their faces, and nothing I or anyone else could say was able to break through their conviction that in imagining the tier system, I must be talking about some way to deprive people of technology by main force. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was after the third or fourth round of comments along these lines, I think it was, that a sudden sense of deja vu reminded me that I’d seen this same sort of curiously detached paralogic before. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Longtime readers of this blog will remember how, some years ago, I pointed out in passing that the survival of the internet in the deindustrial age didn’t depend on whether there was some technically feasible way to run an internet in times of energy and resource limits, much less on how neat we think the internet is today. Rather, I suggested, its survival in the future would depend on whether it could make enough money to cover its operating and maintenance costs, and on whether it could successfully keep on outcompeting less complex and expensive ways of providing the same services to its users. That post got a flurry of responses from the geekoisie, all of whom wanted to talk exclusively about whether there was some technically feasible way to run the internet in a deindustrial world, and oh, yes, how incredibly neat the internet supposedly is. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s more, when I pointed out that they weren’t discussing the issues I had raised, they didn’t argue with me or try to make an opposing case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They just kept on talking more and more loudly about the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>technical feasibility of various gimmicks for a deindustrial internet, and by the way, did we mention yet how unbelievably neat the internet is? It was frankly rather weird, and I don’t mean that in a good way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It felt at times as though I’d somehow managed to hit the off switch on a dozen or so intellects, leaving their empty husks to lurch mindlessly through a series of animatronic talking points with all the persistence and irrelevance of broken records. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It took a while for me to realize that the people who were engaged in this bizarre sort of nonresponse understood perfectly well what I was talking about. They knew at least as well as I did that the internet is the most gargantuan technostructure in the history of our species, a vast, sprawling, unimaginably costly, and hopelessly unsustainable energy- and resource-devouring behemoth that survives only because a significant fraction of the world’s total economic activity goes directly and indirectly toward its upkeep. They knew about the slave-worked open pit mines, the vast grim factories run by sweatshop labor, and the countless belching smokestacks that feed its ravenous appetite for hardware and power; they also know about the constellations of data centers scattered across the world that keep it running, each of which uses as much energy as a small city, and each of which has to have one semi-truck after another pull up to the loading dock every single day to offload pallets of brand new hard drives and other hardware, in order to replace those that will burn out the next day. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They knew all this, and they knew, or at least suspected, just how little of it will be viable in a future of harsh energy and resource constraints.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They simply didn’t want to think about that, much less talk about it, and so they babbled endlessly about other things in a frantic attempt to drown out a subject they couldn’t bear to hear discussed openly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m pretty sure that this is what’s going on in the present case, too, and an interesting set of news stories from earlier this year points up the unspoken logic behind it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Port Townsend is a pleasant little town in Washington State, perched on a bluff above the western shores of Puget Sound. Due to the vagaries of the regional economy, it basically got bypassed by the twentieth century, and much of the housing stock dates from the Victorian era. It so happens that one couple who live there find Victorian technology, clothing, and personal habits more to their taste than the current fashions in these things, and they live, as thoroughly as they can, a Victorian lifestyle. The wife of the couple, Sarah Chrisman, recently wrote a book about her experiences, and got her
<a href=http://www.vox.com/2015/9/9/9275611/victorian-era-life target=_blank>canonical fifteen minutes of fame</a> on the internet and the media as a result. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You might think, dear reader, that the people of Port Townsend would treat this as merely a harmless eccentricity, or even find it pleasantly amusing to have a couple in Victorian cycling clothes riding their penny-farthing bicycles on the city streets. To some extent, you’d be right, but it’s the exceptions that I want to discuss here. Ever since they adopted their Victorian lifestyle, the Chrismans have been on the receiving end of constant harassment by people who find their presence in the community intolerable. The shouted insults, the in-your-face confrontations, the death threats—they’ve seen it all. What’s more, the appearance of Sarah Chrisman’s book and various online articles related to it fielded, in response, an impressive flurry of spluttering online denunciations, which insisted among other things that the fact that she prefers to wear long skirts and corsets somehow makes her personally responsible for all the sins that have ever been imputed to the Victorian era. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Why? Why the fury, the brutality, and the frankly irrational denunciations directed at a couple whose lifestyle choices have got to count well up there among the world’s most harmless hobbies? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The reason’s actually very simple. Sarah Chrisman and her husband have transgressed one of the modern world’s most rigidly enforced taboos. They’ve shown in the most irrefutable way, by personal example, that the technologies each of us use in our own lives are a matter of individual choice. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You’re not supposed to say that in today’s world. You’re not even supposed to think it. You’re allowed, at most, to talk nostalgically about how much more pleasant it must have been not to be constantly harassed and annoyed by the current round of officially prescribed technologies, and squashed into the Procrustean bed of the narrow range of acceptable lifestyles that go with them. Even that’s risky in many circles these days, and risks fielding a diatribe from somebody who just has to tell you, at great length and with obvious irritation, all about the horrible things you’d supposedly suffer if you didn’t have the current round of officially prescribed technologies constantly harassing and annoying you. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The nostalgia in question doesn’t have to be oriented toward the past. I long ago lost track of the number of people I’ve heard talk nostalgically about what I tend to call the Ecotopian future, the default vision of a green tomorrow that infests most minds on the leftward end of things. Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock for the last forty years, you already know every detail of the Ecotopian future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s the place where wind turbines and solar panels power everything, everyone commutes by bicycle from their earth-sheltered suburban homes to their LEED-certified urban workplaces, everything is recycled, and social problems have all been solved because everybody, without exception, has come to embrace the ideas and attitudes currently found among upper-middle-class San Francisco liberals. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s far from rare, at sustainability-oriented events, to hear well-to-do attendees waxing rhapsodically about how great life will be when the Ecotopian future arrives. If you encounter someone engaging in that sort of nostalgic exercise, and are minded to be cruel, ask the person who’s doing it whether he (it’s usually a man) bicycles to work, and if not, why not. Odds are you’ll get to hear any number of frantic excuses to explain why the lifestyle that everyone’s going to love in the Ecotopian future is one that he can’t possibly embrace today. If you want a look behind the excuses and evasions, ask him how he got to the sustainability-oriented event you’re attending. Odds are that he drove his SUV, in which there were no other passengers, and if you press him about that you can expect to see the dark heart of privilege and rage that underlies his enthusiastic praise of an imaginary lifestyle that he would never, not even for a moment, dream of adopting himself. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I wish I were joking about the rage. It so happens that I don’t have a car, a television, or a cell phone, and I have zero interest in ever having any of these things. My defection from the officially prescribed technologies and the lifestyles that go with them isn’t as immediately obvious as Sarah Chrisman’s, so I don’t take as much day to day harassment as she does. Still, it happens from time to time that somebody wants to know if I’ve seen this or that television program, and in the conversations that unfold from such questions it sometimes comes out that I don’t have a television at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Where I now live, in an old red brick mill town in the north central Appalachians, that revelation rarely gets a hostile response, and it’s fairly common for someone else to say, “Good for you,” or something like that. A lot of people here are very poor, and thus have a certain detachment from technologies and lifestyles they know perfectly well they will never be able to afford. Back when I lived in prosperous Left Coast towns, on the other hand, mentioning that I didn’t own a television routinely meant that I’d get to hear a long and patronizing disquisition about how I really ought to run out and buy a TV so I could watch this or that or the other really really wonderful program, in the absence of which my life must be intolerably barren and incomplete.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Any lack of enthusiasm for that sort of disquisition very reliably brought out a variety of furiously angry responses that had precisely nothing to do with the issue at hand, which is that I simply don’t enjoy the activity of watching television. Oh, and it’s not the programming I find unenjoyable—it’s the technology itself; I get bored very quickly with the process of watching little colored images jerking about on a glass screen, no matter what the images happen to be. That’s another taboo, by the way. It’s acceptable in today’s America to grumble about what’s on television, but the technology itself is sacrosanct; you’re not allowed to criticize it, much less to talk about the biases, agendas, and simple annoyances hardwired into television as a technological system. If you try to bring any of that up, people will insist that you’re criticizing the programming; if you correct them, they’ll ignore the correction and keep on talking as though the programs on TV are the only thing under discussion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A similar issue drives the bizarre paralogic surrounding the nonresponses to the tier system discussed above. The core premises behind the tier system in my narrative are, first, that people can choose the technological infrastructure they have, and have to pay for—and second, that some of them, when they consider the costs and benefits involved, might reasonably decide that an infrastructure of dirt roads and a landscape of self-sufficient farms and small towns is the best option. To a great many people today, that’s heresy of the most unthinkable sort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The easiest way to deal with the heresy in question, for those who aren’t interested in thinking about it, is to pretend that nothing so shocking has been suggested at all, and force the discussion into some less threatening form as quickly as possible. Redefining it in ways that erase the unbearable idea that technologies can be chosen freely, and just as freely rejected, is quite probably the easiest way to do that. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d encourage those of my readers who aren’t blinded by the terror of intellectual heresy to think, and think hard, about the taboo against technological choice—the insistence that you cannot, may not, and must not make your own choices when it comes to whatever the latest technological fad happens to be, but must do as you’re told and accept whatever technology the consumer society hands you, no matter how dysfunctional, harmful, or boring it turns out to be. That taboo is very deeply ingrained, far more potent than the handful of relatively weak taboos our society still applies to such things as sexuality, and most of the people you know obey it so unthinkingly that they never even notice how it shapes their behavior. You may not notice how it shapes your behavior, for that matter; the best way to find out is to pick a technology that annoys, harms, or bores you, but that you use anyway, and get rid of it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those who take that unthinkable step, and embrace the heresy of technological choice, are part of the wave of the future. In a world of declining resource availability, unraveling economic systems, and destabilizing environments, Sarah Chrisman and the many other people who make similar choices—there are quite a few of them these days, and more of them with each year that passes—are making a wise choice. By taking up technologies and lifeways from less extravagant eras, they’re decreasing their environmental footprints and their vulnerability to faltering global technostructures, and they’re also contributing to one of the crucial tasks of our age: the rediscovery of ways of being human that don’t depend on hopelessly unsustainable levels of resource and energy consumption. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
The heresy of technological choice is a door. Beyond it lies an unexplored landscape of possibilities for the future—possibilities that very few people have even begun to imagine yet. My Retrotopia narrative is meant to glance over a very small part of that landscape. If some of the terrain it’s examined so far has been threatening enough to send some of its readers fleeing into a familiar sort of paralogic, then I’m confident that it’s doing the job I hoped it would do.</div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the ninth installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator finally has his interview with the President of the Lakeland Republic, asks some hard questions, and prepares for a trip into unexpected territory. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finch flagged down a cab as soon as we got out onto the sidewalk, and within a minute or two we were rolling through downtown at however many miles an hour a horse makes at a steady trot. Before too many more minutes had gone by, we were out from among the big downtown buildings, and the unfinished dome of the Capitol appeared on the skyline. Finch was in high spirits, talking about the compromise Meeker had brokered with the Restos, but I was too keyed up to pay much attention. A day and a half in the Lakeland Republic had answered a few of my questions and raised a good many more that I hadn’t expected to ask at all, and the meeting ahead would probably determine whether I’d be able to get the answers that mattered. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The cab finally rolled to a halt, and the cabbie climbed down from his perch up front and opened the door for us. I’d been so deep in my own thoughts for the last few blocks that I hadn’t noticed where we’d ended up, and I was startled to see the main entrance to the Capitol in front of me. I turned to Finch. “Here, rather than the President’s mansion?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The intern gave me a blank look. “You mean like the old White House? We don’t have one of those. President Meeker has a house in town, just like any other politician.” I must have looked startled, because he went on earnestly:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“We dumped the whole imperial-executive thing after Partition. I’m surprised so many of the other republics kept it, after everything that happened.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded noncommittally as we walked up to the main entrance, climbed the stair, and went in. There were a couple of uniformed guards inside the outer doors, the first I’d seen anywhere in the Lakeland Republic, but they simply nodded a greeting to the two of us as we walked by. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We pushed open the inner doors and went into the rotunda. There was a temporary ceiling about forty feet overhead, and someone had taken the trouble to paint on it a <i>trompe l’oeil </i>view of the way the dome would look from beneath. In the middle of the floor was a block of marble maybe three feet on a side; I could barely see it because a dozen or so people were standing around it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of them, a stout and freckled blonde woman in a pale blue gingham dress, was saying something in a loud clear voice as we came through the doors: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“...do solemnly swear that, should I be elected to any official position, I will faithfully execute the laws of the Lakeland Republic regardless of my personal beliefs, and should I be unable to do so in good conscience, I will immediately resign my office, so help me my Lord and Savior Jesus.” Three sudden blue-white flashes told of photos being taken, a little patter of applause echoed off the temporary ceiling, and then some of the people present got to work signing papers on the marble cube. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finch led me around the group to a door on the far side of the rotunda. “What was that about?” I asked him with a motion of my head toward the group around the cube.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“A candidate,” he explained as we went through the doors. “Probably running for some township or county office.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A lot of them like to do the ceremony here at the Capitol and get the pictures in their local papers. You can’t run for any elected position here unless you take that oath first—well, with or without the Jesus bit, or whatever else you prefer in place of it. There was a lot of trouble before the Second Civil War with people in government insisting that their personal beliefs trumped the duties of their office—” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ve read about it.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“So that went into our constitution. Break the oath and you do jail time for perjury.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I took that in as we went down a corridor. On the far end was what looked like an ordinary front office with a young man perched behind a desk. “Hi, Gabe,” Finch said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Hi, Mike.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is Mr. Carr?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yes. Mr. Carr, this is Gabriel Menendez, the President’s assistant secretary.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We shook hands, and Menendez picked up a phone on his desk and asked, “Cheryl, is the boss free? Mr. Carr’s here.” A pause, then:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Yes. I’ll send him right in.” He put down the phone and waved us to the door at the far end of the room. “He’ll see you now.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We shed coats and hats at the coatrack on one side of the office, and went through the door. On the other side was another corridor, and beyond that was a circular room with doors opening off it in various directions. Off to the left an ornate spiral stair swept up and down to whatever was on the floors above and below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>To the right was another desk; the woman sitting at it nodded greetings to us and gestured to the central door. I followed Finch as he walked to the door, opened it, and said, “Mr. President? Mr. Carr.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Isaiah Meeker, President of the Lakeland Republic, was standing at the far side of the room, looking out the window over the Toledo streetscape below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He turned and came toward us as soon as Finch spoke. He looked older than the pictures I’d seen, the close-trimmed hair and iconic short beard almost white against the dark brown of his face. “Mr. Carr,” he said as we shook hands. “Pleased to meet you. I hope you haven’t been completely at loose ends this last day or so.” He gestured toward the side of the room. “Please have a seat.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It wasn’t until I turned the direction he’d indicated that I realized there were more than the three of us in the room. A circle of chairs surrounded a low table there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Melissa Berger and Fred Vanich, whom I’d met in the Toledo train station, were already<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>seated there, and so were two other people I didn’t know. “Stuart Macallan from the State Department,” Meeker said, making introductions. “Jaya Patel, from Commerce. Of course you’ve already met Melissa and Fred.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Hands got shaken and I took a seat. Macallan was the assistant secretary of state for North American affairs, I knew, and Patel had an equivalent position on the trade end of things. “I apologize for the delay,” Meeker went on. “I imagine you know how it goes, though.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Of course.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And you seem to have put the time to good use—at least for our garment industry.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That got a general chuckle, which I joined. “When in Rome,” I said. “I take it that’s not one of the things visitors usually do, though; Mr. Finch here looked right past me this morning.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finch reddened. “It really does vary,” Patel said. “Some of the diplomats and business executives we’ve worked with have taken to buying all their clothes here—we’ve even fielded inquiries about exporting garments for sale abroad. Still, most of our visitors seem to prefer their bioplastic.” Her fractional shrug showed, politely but eloquently, what she thought of that.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“To each their own,” said the President. “But you’ve had the chance to see a little of Toledo, and find out a few of the ways we do things here. I’d be interested to know your first reactions.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I considered that, decided that a certain degree of frankness wasn’t out of place. “In some ways, impressed,” I said, “and in some ways disquieted. You certainly seem to have come through the embargo years in better shape than I expected—though I’m curious about how things will go now that the borders are open.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s been a matter of some concern here as well,” Meeker allowed. “That said, so far things seem to be going smoothly.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Macallan paused just long enough to make sure his boss wasn’t going to say more, and then cleared his throat and spoke. “One of the things we hope might come out of your visit is a better relationship with the Atlantic Republic. I’m sure you know how fraught things were with Barfield and his people. If Ms. Montrose is willing to see things ratchet down to a more normal level, we’re ready to meet her halfway—potentially more than halfway.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That was quite an upset she pulled off in the election,” Meeker observed. “I hope you’ll pass on my personal congratulations.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ll gladly do that,” I said to the President, and then to Macallan:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“It’s certainly possible. I don’t happen to know her thoughts on that, but a lot of people on our side of the border are interested in seeing things change, and she’s got a stronger mandate than any president we’ve had since Partition. Still—” I shrugged. “We’ll have to see what happens after the inauguration.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Of course,” Macallan said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“One thing we’d be particularly interested in seeing,” said Patel, “is a widening of the opportunities for trade. Obviously that’s going to be delicate—it’s a core policy of ours that the Republic has to be able to meet its essential needs from within its own borders, and I know that stance isn’t exactly popular in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>global-trade circles. We’re not interested in global trade, but there are things your country produces that we’d like to be able to buy, and things we produce that you might like to buy in exchange.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Again,” I said, “we’ll have to see what happens—but I don’t know of any reason why that wouldn’t be a possibility.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She nodded, and a brief silence passed. Vanich’s featureless voice broke it. “Mr. Carr,” he said, “you mentioned that you found some of the ways we do things here disquieting. I think we’d all be interested in hearing more about that, if you’re willing.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Startled, I glanced across the table at him, but his face was as impenetrable as it had been the first time I’d seen him. I looked at the President, who seemed amused, and then nodded. “If you like,” I said. “At first it was mostly the—” I floundered for a term. “—deliberately retro, I suppose, quality of so much of what I’ve seen: the clothing, the technology, the architecture, all of it. I have to assume that that’s an intentional choice, connected to whatever’s inspired your Resto parties in politics.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meeker nodded. “Very much so.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“But that’s not actually the thing I find most disquieting. What has me scratching my head is that your republic seems to have gone out of its way to ignore every single scrap of advice you must have gotten from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the other global financial institutions—in fact, from the entire economics profession—and despite that, you’ve apparently thrived.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meeker’s face broke into a broad smile. “Excellent,” he said. “Excellent. I’ll offer just one correction: we haven’t succeeded as well as we have despite ignoring the economic advice of the World Bank and so forth. We’ve done so precisely <i>because</i> we’ve ignored their advice.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave him a long wary look, but his smile didn’t waver. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Mr. Carr,” Melanie Berger said then, “Since the end of the embargo we’ve been approached four times by the World Bank and the IMF. I’ve been involved in the discussions that followed. Each time, their economists have made long speeches about how the way we do things is hopelessly inefficient, and how we’ve got to follow their advice and become more efficient. Each time, I’ve asked them to answer a simple question: ‘more efficient for what output in terms of what input?’ Not one of them has ever been able, or willing, to give me a straight answer.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I had a lecture on that subject yesterday from a bank officer,” I told her. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Her eyebrows went up, and then she smiled. “Not surprising. It’s something most people here know about, if they know anything at all about money.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded, taking that in. “So what you’re suggesting,” I said, as much to Meeker as to her, “is that the rest of the world doesn’t have a clue about economics.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not quite,” said the President. “It’s just that our history has forced us to look at things in a somewhat different light, and prioritize different things.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was a graceful answer, and I nodded. “The question that comes to mind at this point,” he went on, “is whether there’s anything else you’d like to see, now that you know a little more about our republic.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“As it happens, yes,” I said. “There is.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He motioned me to go on.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“When I drew up the list we sent to your people right after the election, I didn’t know about the tier system, and I’ve got some serious questions about what things are like at the bottom rung of that ladder. I’ve read a little bit about the system, but I’m frankly skeptical that anybody in this day and age would voluntarily choose to live in the conditions of 1830.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s actually a common misconception,” Jaya Patel said, with the same you-don’t-get-it smile I’d seen more than once since my arrival. “The only thing the tier system determines is what infrastructure and services gets paid for out of tax revenues.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I saw a fair number of horsedrawn wagons on the train ride here,” I pointed out. “That’s not a matter of infrastructure.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Actually, it is,” she said. “Without a road system built to stand up to auto traffic, cars and trucks aren’t as efficient as wagons—” Her smile suddenly broadened. “—in terms of the total cost of haulage. That doesn’t keep people in tier one counties from having whatever personal technologies they want to have, and are willing and able to pay for.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Got it,” I said. “I’d still like to see how it works out in practice.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s easy enough,” the President said. “Anything else?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yes,” I said, “though I know this may be further than you’re willing to go. I’d like to see something of your military.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The room got very quiet. “I’d be interested,” Meeker said, “in knowing why.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded. “It seems to me that whatever you’ve achieved by this retro policy of yours comes at the cost of some frightful vulnerabilities. Ms. Berger told me a little about the war with the Confederacy and Brazil, and of course I knew a certain amount about that in advance. Obviously you won that round—but we both know that the Confederacy wasn’t in the best of shape in ‘49, and I really wonder about your ability to stand up to a modern high-tech military.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Like the Atlantic Republic’s?” Meeker asked, with a raised eyebrow. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I responded with a derisive snort. “With all due respect, I’m sure you know better than that. I’m thinking about what would happen if we ended up with a war zone or a failed state on our western borders.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Fair enough,” he said after a moment, “and I think we can satisfy you about that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’d like to suggest something,” Berger said to the President. “Defiance County is first tier.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He glanced at her. “You’re thinking Hicksville?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yes.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We’ll have to find someone.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Tom Pappas comes to mind,” she said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The President’s face took on a slightly glazed expression, and then he laughed. “Yes, I think Tom will do. Thank you, Melanie.” He turned to me. “Have you made any plans for tomorrow?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not yet.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Good. The day after tomorror, there’s a—military exercise, I think you would call it—in a first tier county a couple of hours from here by train. If you’re willing, I can have my staff make the arrangements for you to go there tomorrow, have a look around, stay the night, see how our military does things the next day, and then come back. Is that workable?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
“I’d welcome that,” I told him, wondering what I’d just gotten myself into.</div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the eighth installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator visits a city power plant that runs on an unexpected fuel source and a stock market subject to even less familiar rules...</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By the time Michael Finch and I left the streetcar plant it was pushing eleven. “Where next?” I asked. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We’re about four blocks from one of the municipal power plants,” the intern said. “I called ahead and arranged for a tour—that’ll take about an hour, and should still give us plenty of time for lunch. Ms. Berger said you’d<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>want a look at our electrical infrastructure.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded. “ Please. Electricity’s an ongoing problem back home.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“It hasn’t always been that easy here, either,” Finch admitted. “Would you like to take a cab, or—” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Four blocks? No, that’s walking distance.” From his expression, I gathered that wasn’t always the case with visitors from outside, but he brightened and led the way east toward the Maumee River. North of us I could see bridges arching across the river, and the unfinished dome of the Capitol rising up white above the brown and gray rooftops. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The power plant was another big brick building like the streetcar factory, and I looked in vain for smokestacks. Finch led me in through the office entrance, a double door in an ornate archway, and introduced us to the receptionist inside. A few moments later we were shown into the office of the plant manager, a stocky brown-skinned man with gray hair who came over to shake my hand. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Jim Singletary,” he said. “Pleased to meet you. I don’t imagine you have anything like our facility over in the Atlantic Republic, so if there’s anything you want to know, just ask, okay?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I assured him I would, and he led us out of the office. The corridor outside went straight back into the heart of the plant; at its far end, we went through a door onto a glassed-in balcony overlooking a big open room where six massive and complex machines rose up from a concrete floor. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Down on the floor, you couldn’t hear a thing but the turbines,” he said. “That’s the business end of the plant—six combined cycle gas turbines driving our generators. We get almost sixty per cent efficiency in terms of electrical generation, more than that when you factor in the heat recycling to the facility. You know how a combined cycle turbine works?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“More or less—you put the gases from the turbine through a heat exchanger, and use that to run a steam turbine off the leftover heat, don’t you?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Exactly. What comes out of the heat exchangers runs around 300 degrees Fahrenheit, which is more than enough to do something with. Here, a lot of it goes to heat the fermentation tanks.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I wondered what he meant by that, but it didn’t take long to find out. Singletary led us along the balcony to another set of doors, and through them into another glassed-in balcony overlooking a double row of what looked a little like the top ends of a row of gargantuan pressure cookers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The fermentation tanks,” he said. “Feedstock goes in, methane and slurry come out. At any given time, eighteen tanks are in operation and the other six are being loaded or unloaded. This way, please.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The balcony ended at another door, and a corridor led to the left. At its end was a balcony, this time open to the outside air. Below was the Maumee River, and a line of big blocky riverboats tied up along a quay. The one closest to us was having something unloaded from it through a big pipe. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And there’s the feedstock that makes the whole thing work,” said Singletary. “I don’t recommend going down to the quayside—it’s pretty ripe.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“What’s the feedstock?” I asked, even though I’d begun to guess the answer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Manure,” he said. “Cow, horse, sheep, human—you name it. We buy manure from an eight county region to supplement what gets produced here in Toledo.” I gave him a startled look, and he grinned. “Yep. If you’ve used the toilet since you got here, you’ve contributed to Toledo’s electricity supply.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I laughed, and he went on. “We use a three-stage fermentation process to extract nearly seventy per cent of the carbon from the feedstock while the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium stay in the sludge. By the time it’s finished in the tanks it’s sterile enough you could rub it on an open wound. We use heat output from the turbines to dry it, and ship it back to farmers as fertilizer. So everyone’s happy.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We went back to his office and I got a rundown on the economics of the plant. “How close do you get to breaking even, between feedstock costs and fertilizer sales?” I asked. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not as close as I’d like,” Singletary admitted. “Ever since the Maumee and Ohio canal got reopened, the farmers south of us can sell their feedstock to Dayton or Springfield—Lima’s tier three so it’s not in the market. North of us we’ve got Detroit and Ann Arbor to bid against; east there’s Cleveland, and the canal system west of the Maumee is still being rebuilt, so that’s out of the picture at the moment.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You depend on canals that much?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We can’t afford not to. Back in the early days, we used to ship in some feedstock by rail, but the costs are just too high these days. For any kind of bulk cargo, if you don’t have to worry about speed, canal shipping’s really the way to go.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I asked a few more questions, and then we all shook hands and Finch and I headed out into the crisp fall air. “Interested in lunch?” he asked me; we discussed restaurants while waiting for the streetcar, and then rode it north into downtown. A bar and grill around the corner from the streetcar stop where we got off served up a very passable BLT sandwich, and then we wove our way through crowded sidewalks to the big stone building that housed the Toledo Stock Market.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Vinny Patzek,” said the young man with black slicked-back hair who greeted us in a crowded office not far from the trading floor. “Pleased to meet you.” He had his jacket off and his sleeves rolled up, and looked like he spent a lot of his time running flat out from one corner of the building to another. “Any chance you know something about stock markets, Mr. Carr?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Actually, yes—I did two years on the NYSE floor before they moved it to Albany,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
His face lit up. “Sweet. Okay, this is gonna be a lot less confusing to you than it is to most of the people we see here from outside. It’s not quite the same as what you’re used to, but the differences are mostly the technology, not the underlying setup. Come on.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ll leave you with Mr. Patzek for now,” Finch told me. “I promised Ms. Berger I’d check in after lunch and see how things are going at the Capitol.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Fair enough,” I said, and he left through one door while Patzek herded me out through another, down a corridor, and onto the trading floor of the stock exchange. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All things considered, it wasn’t much quieter than the turbine room of the power plant, but since I’d worked on a trading floor the noise and bustle actually meant something to me. There was a reader board, a big one, covering most of the far wall; it was mechanical, not digital, and flipped black or eye-burning yellow in little rectangular patches to spell out the latest prices. There were trading posts scattered across the floor, where specialists handled the buying and selling of shares. There were floor traders and floor brokers, enough of them to make the floor look crowded, and the featureless roar<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>made up of hundreds of voices shouting bids and offers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You probably still use computers in New York, right?” Patzek said in something that wasn’t quite a yell. “Here it’s all old-fashioned open outcry, with the same kind of hand signals you’d see in the Chi-town commodity pits. Lemme show you. All we need is an order.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ll take one share of Mikkelson Manufacturing,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He grinned. “You’re on.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You get a lot of small orders like that?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“All the time. You get little old ladies, working guys, you name it, who save up the cash to buy a share or two once a month, that sort of thing, and come on down here to buy it in person.” He looked up at the reader board. “Mikkelson’s MIK—see it? Seventy-two even a share. Let’s go.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We plunged into the crowd, and I managed to follow Patzek through the middle of it to one of the trading posts, where the traders and brokers looked even busier than they were elsewhere on the floor. Right in the middle of it, the yelling was loud enough I couldn’t make out a single word, just Patzek gesturing with a closed hand and then a raised index finger and shouting something that didn’t sound much like Mikkelson Industries. It only took about a minute, though, for the market to do what markets are supposed to do, and Patzek came out of the scrum with a big grin and an order written up on a pad of paper he’d extracted from one of his vest pockets. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We’re good,” he said. “Seventy-two and a quarter—it’s pretty lively. I’d be surprised if it doesn’t hit seventy-five by closing. Let’s settle up back at the office; they’ll be sending the certificate there.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We went back the way we’d came. The office, busy as it was, seemed almost unnervingly quiet after the roar of the trading floor. “So that’s how it’s done,” said Patzek. “A little different, I bet.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not as much as it used to be,” I said. “When I first got on the NYSE floor, there were only a couple of dozen floor traders left, and it was as quiet as a library most days. With the satellite situation and some of the other problems lately, a lot of brokerages are putting trades back on the floor again. But of course it’s still done with handheld computers, not the sort of thing you’ve got in there.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Patzek nodded. “The way I heard it, there were handhelds on the floor in the early days after Partition, but the first time the outside tried regime change here they hacked the system and crashed it, and the exchange just let it drop. Computers are just too easy to hack. Floor traders? Not so much.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I bet,” I said, laughing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I wrote a check for the price of the share, then, and filled out a couple of forms covering my side of the transaction. When I got to the form for dividend payouts, though, I looked up at Patzek. “I’ll have to make some arrangements back home before I can finish this.” He nodded, and I went on. “What kind of dividends does Mikkelson pay these days?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Five, maybe six percent a year. Not bad, especially since it’s tax free.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That startled me. “Mikkelson, or dividends in general?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Dividends in general. They count as earned income, like wages, salaries, royalties, that sort of thing. Most other investments, you’re gonna pay tax, and if you sell that share and make a profit on it, that’s speculative income and you’re gonna get whacked.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“So earned income is tax free, but investment income isn’t.”
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yeah—again, except for dividends.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I remembered what Elaine Chu had said about taxes back at the Mikkelson plant. “So you tax what you want to discourage, not what you want to encourage.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Heck if I know,” said Patzek. “You’ll have to ask the politicians about that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A moment later a messenger came in through the door we’d used, plopped a manila folder on one of the desks, and ducked back out. Half a dozen people converged on the folder; Patzek waited his turn, and came back with a sheet of stiff paper printed in ornate script. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Here you go,” he said. “One share of Mikkelson Manufacturing. Congratulations—you’re now a limited partner with Janice Mikkelson.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave him a startled look, then glanced at the certificate. I’d read about printed stock certificates, but never actually handled one, so it took me a moment to sort through the fancy printing and read the line that mattered. Sure enough, it read MIKKELSON MANUFACTURING LLP. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Limited liability partnership,” I guessed. “So it’s not a corporation?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Nah, it’s a little different here. Back in the day—and we’re talking before the First Civil War, forget about the Second—corporations had to be chartered by the legislature, for some fixed number of years, and only for some kind of public benefit, not just because somebody wanted to make a few bucks. After all the problems the old Union had with corporations claiming to be people and all that, we up and drew a line under that, and went back to the original laws. Here, if a business wants to sell stock, it becomes a limited liability partnership. The limited partners are only on the hook to the value of their stock holdings, but the managing partner or partners—their butts are on the line. If Mikkelson Manufacturing ever goes bust, Mikkelson can kiss her mansion goodbye, and if the company breaks the law, she’s the one who goes to jail.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I took that in. “Does that actually happen?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not so much any more. Back when I was a kid, there were some really juicy cases, and yeah, some really rich people lost their shirts and landed behind bars. These days, you’re in business, you watch the laws as closely as you watch the bottom line—there’s too many people in politics who’d be happy to buy their constituents a new streetcar line with the proceeds from a court case.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That didn’t sound much like the politics I was used to back home. I was still processing it when the other door came open and Michael Finch came in. “Mr. Carr,” he said, “I just talked to Ms. Berger. They got everything settled around lunchtime. If you’re ready, the President will be happy to see you this afternoon.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I glanced at Patzek who grinned and made a scooting motion with one hand. We shook hands and said the usual, and I followed Finch out the door. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********************</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who are fans of deindustrial fiction will be interested to hear that Founders House, the publisher of my novel <i>Star’s Reach</i> and the four <i>After Oil</i> anthologies, has a new peak oil SF novel just out, <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2015/10/new-release-dark-peak.html>Dark Peak</a> by George R Fehling. It’s a crisp and highly readable thriller set a generation or two after industrial civilization unravels—worth a look. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
More generally, interest in deindustrial SF seems to be picking up; those of us who have been writing and reading fiction along those lines for a while may just have gotten in on the ground floor of a new genre. In a conversation a little while back with Founders House veep Shaun Kilgore, he mentioned that his firm has decided to branch out into Young Adult fiction with a deindustrial slant. Any of my readers who are interested in writing something along these lines should contact Founders House via <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/p/submissions_14.html>their submissions page</a>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

Along similar lines, I’m pleased to report that my tentative suggestion of an anthology of original short stories set in the world of my novel Star’s Reach is on its way to reality—or, more precisely, will make that transition with your help. I’ve set up a new website<span style='font-family: "times" , "serif"; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode"; mso-fareast-language: #00FF; mso-font-kerning: .5pt'>,<a href=http://merigaproject.blogspot.com/ ><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>http://merigaproject.blogspot.com</a>, </span>to coordinate the project and help writers work out the details of their stories. I’d encourage everyone who’s contributed stories to the three Space Bats Challenges hosted by this blog to check it out, and consider contributing to the anthology. </div>
