<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the eighth installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator visits a city power plant that runs on an unexpected fuel source and a stock market subject to even less familiar rules...</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By the time Michael Finch and I left the streetcar plant it was pushing eleven. “Where next?” I asked. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We’re about four blocks from one of the municipal power plants,” the intern said. “I called ahead and arranged for a tour—that’ll take about an hour, and should still give us plenty of time for lunch. Ms. Berger said you’d<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>want a look at our electrical infrastructure.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded. “ Please. Electricity’s an ongoing problem back home.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“It hasn’t always been that easy here, either,” Finch admitted. “Would you like to take a cab, or—” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Four blocks? No, that’s walking distance.” From his expression, I gathered that wasn’t always the case with visitors from outside, but he brightened and led the way east toward the Maumee River. North of us I could see bridges arching across the river, and the unfinished dome of the Capitol rising up white above the brown and gray rooftops. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The power plant was another big brick building like the streetcar factory, and I looked in vain for smokestacks. Finch led me in through the office entrance, a double door in an ornate archway, and introduced us to the receptionist inside. A few moments later we were shown into the office of the plant manager, a stocky brown-skinned man with gray hair who came over to shake my hand. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Jim Singletary,” he said. “Pleased to meet you. I don’t imagine you have anything like our facility over in the Atlantic Republic, so if there’s anything you want to know, just ask, okay?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I assured him I would, and he led us out of the office. The corridor outside went straight back into the heart of the plant; at its far end, we went through a door onto a glassed-in balcony overlooking a big open room where six massive and complex machines rose up from a concrete floor. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Down on the floor, you couldn’t hear a thing but the turbines,” he said. “That’s the business end of the plant—six combined cycle gas turbines driving our generators. We get almost sixty per cent efficiency in terms of electrical generation, more than that when you factor in the heat recycling to the facility. You know how a combined cycle turbine works?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“More or less—you put the gases from the turbine through a heat exchanger, and use that to run a steam turbine off the leftover heat, don’t you?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Exactly. What comes out of the heat exchangers runs around 300 degrees Fahrenheit, which is more than enough to do something with. Here, a lot of it goes to heat the fermentation tanks.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I wondered what he meant by that, but it didn’t take long to find out. Singletary led us along the balcony to another set of doors, and through them into another glassed-in balcony overlooking a double row of what looked a little like the top ends of a row of gargantuan pressure cookers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The fermentation tanks,” he said. “Feedstock goes in, methane and slurry come out. At any given time, eighteen tanks are in operation and the other six are being loaded or unloaded. This way, please.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The balcony ended at another door, and a corridor led to the left. At its end was a balcony, this time open to the outside air. Below was the Maumee River, and a line of big blocky riverboats tied up along a quay. The one closest to us was having something unloaded from it through a big pipe. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And there’s the feedstock that makes the whole thing work,” said Singletary. “I don’t recommend going down to the quayside—it’s pretty ripe.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“What’s the feedstock?” I asked, even though I’d begun to guess the answer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Manure,” he said. “Cow, horse, sheep, human—you name it. We buy manure from an eight county region to supplement what gets produced here in Toledo.” I gave him a startled look, and he grinned. “Yep. If you’ve used the toilet since you got here, you’ve contributed to Toledo’s electricity supply.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I laughed, and he went on. “We use a three-stage fermentation process to extract nearly seventy per cent of the carbon from the feedstock while the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium stay in the sludge. By the time it’s finished in the tanks it’s sterile enough you could rub it on an open wound. We use heat output from the turbines to dry it, and ship it back to farmers as fertilizer. So everyone’s happy.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We went back to his office and I got a rundown on the economics of the plant. “How close do you get to breaking even, between feedstock costs and fertilizer sales?” I asked. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not as close as I’d like,” Singletary admitted. “Ever since the Maumee and Ohio canal got reopened, the farmers south of us can sell their feedstock to Dayton or Springfield—Lima’s tier three so it’s not in the market. North of us we’ve got Detroit and Ann Arbor to bid against; east there’s Cleveland, and the canal system west of the Maumee is still being rebuilt, so that’s out of the picture at the moment.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You depend on canals that much?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We can’t afford not to. Back in the early days, we used to ship in some feedstock by rail, but the costs are just too high these days. For any kind of bulk cargo, if you don’t have to worry about speed, canal shipping’s really the way to go.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I asked a few more questions, and then we all shook hands and Finch and I headed out into the crisp fall air. “Interested in lunch?” he asked me; we discussed restaurants while waiting for the streetcar, and then rode it north into downtown. A bar and grill around the corner from the streetcar stop where we got off served up a very passable BLT sandwich, and then we wove our way through crowded sidewalks to the big stone building that housed the Toledo Stock Market.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Vinny Patzek,” said the young man with black slicked-back hair who greeted us in a crowded office not far from the trading floor. “Pleased to meet you.” He had his jacket off and his sleeves rolled up, and looked like he spent a lot of his time running flat out from one corner of the building to another. “Any chance you know something about stock markets, Mr. Carr?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Actually, yes—I did two years on the NYSE floor before they moved it to Albany,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
His face lit up. “Sweet. Okay, this is gonna be a lot less confusing to you than it is to most of the people we see here from outside. It’s not quite the same as what you’re used to, but the differences are mostly the technology, not the underlying setup. Come on.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ll leave you with Mr. Patzek for now,” Finch told me. “I promised Ms. Berger I’d check in after lunch and see how things are going at the Capitol.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Fair enough,” I said, and he left through one door while Patzek herded me out through another, down a corridor, and onto the trading floor of the stock exchange. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All things considered, it wasn’t much quieter than the turbine room of the power plant, but since I’d worked on a trading floor the noise and bustle actually meant something to me. There was a reader board, a big one, covering most of the far wall; it was mechanical, not digital, and flipped black or eye-burning yellow in little rectangular patches to spell out the latest prices. There were trading posts scattered across the floor, where specialists handled the buying and selling of shares. There were floor traders and floor brokers, enough of them to make the floor look crowded, and the featureless roar<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>made up of hundreds of voices shouting bids and offers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You probably still use computers in New York, right?” Patzek said in something that wasn’t quite a yell. “Here it’s all old-fashioned open outcry, with the same kind of hand signals you’d see in the Chi-town commodity pits. Lemme show you. All we need is an order.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ll take one share of Mikkelson Manufacturing,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He grinned. “You’re on.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You get a lot of small orders like that?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“All the time. You get little old ladies, working guys, you name it, who save up the cash to buy a share or two once a month, that sort of thing, and come on down here to buy it in person.” He looked up at the reader board. “Mikkelson’s MIK—see it? Seventy-two even a share. Let’s go.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We plunged into the crowd, and I managed to follow Patzek through the middle of it to one of the trading posts, where the traders and brokers looked even busier than they were elsewhere on the floor. Right in the middle of it, the yelling was loud enough I couldn’t make out a single word, just Patzek gesturing with a closed hand and then a raised index finger and shouting something that didn’t sound much like Mikkelson Industries. It only took about a minute, though, for the market to do what markets are supposed to do, and Patzek came out of the scrum with a big grin and an order written up on a pad of paper he’d extracted from one of his vest pockets. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We’re good,” he said. “Seventy-two and a quarter—it’s pretty lively. I’d be surprised if it doesn’t hit seventy-five by closing. Let’s settle up back at the office; they’ll be sending the certificate there.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We went back the way we’d came. The office, busy as it was, seemed almost unnervingly quiet after the roar of the trading floor. “So that’s how it’s done,” said Patzek. “A little different, I bet.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not as much as it used to be,” I said. “When I first got on the NYSE floor, there were only a couple of dozen floor traders left, and it was as quiet as a library most days. With the satellite situation and some of the other problems lately, a lot of brokerages are putting trades back on the floor again. But of course it’s still done with handheld computers, not the sort of thing you’ve got in there.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Patzek nodded. “The way I heard it, there were handhelds on the floor in the early days after Partition, but the first time the outside tried regime change here they hacked the system and crashed it, and the exchange just let it drop. Computers are just too easy to hack. Floor traders? Not so much.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I bet,” I said, laughing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I wrote a check for the price of the share, then, and filled out a couple of forms covering my side of the transaction. When I got to the form for dividend payouts, though, I looked up at Patzek. “I’ll have to make some arrangements back home before I can finish this.” He nodded, and I went on. “What kind of dividends does Mikkelson pay these days?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Five, maybe six percent a year. Not bad, especially since it’s tax free.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That startled me. “Mikkelson, or dividends in general?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Dividends in general. They count as earned income, like wages, salaries, royalties, that sort of thing. Most other investments, you’re gonna pay tax, and if you sell that share and make a profit on it, that’s speculative income and you’re gonna get whacked.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“So earned income is tax free, but investment income isn’t.”
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yeah—again, except for dividends.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I remembered what Elaine Chu had said about taxes back at the Mikkelson plant. “So you tax what you want to discourage, not what you want to encourage.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Heck if I know,” said Patzek. “You’ll have to ask the politicians about that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A moment later a messenger came in through the door we’d used, plopped a manila folder on one of the desks, and ducked back out. Half a dozen people converged on the folder; Patzek waited his turn, and came back with a sheet of stiff paper printed in ornate script. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Here you go,” he said. “One share of Mikkelson Manufacturing. Congratulations—you’re now a limited partner with Janice Mikkelson.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave him a startled look, then glanced at the certificate. I’d read about printed stock certificates, but never actually handled one, so it took me a moment to sort through the fancy printing and read the line that mattered. Sure enough, it read MIKKELSON MANUFACTURING LLP. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Limited liability partnership,” I guessed. “So it’s not a corporation?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Nah, it’s a little different here. Back in the day—and we’re talking before the First Civil War, forget about the Second—corporations had to be chartered by the legislature, for some fixed number of years, and only for some kind of public benefit, not just because somebody wanted to make a few bucks. After all the problems the old Union had with corporations claiming to be people and all that, we up and drew a line under that, and went back to the original laws. Here, if a business wants to sell stock, it becomes a limited liability partnership. The limited partners are only on the hook to the value of their stock holdings, but the managing partner or partners—their butts are on the line. If Mikkelson Manufacturing ever goes bust, Mikkelson can kiss her mansion goodbye, and if the company breaks the law, she’s the one who goes to jail.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I took that in. “Does that actually happen?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not so much any more. Back when I was a kid, there were some really juicy cases, and yeah, some really rich people lost their shirts and landed behind bars. These days, you’re in business, you watch the laws as closely as you watch the bottom line—there’s too many people in politics who’d be happy to buy their constituents a new streetcar line with the proceeds from a court case.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That didn’t sound much like the politics I was used to back home. I was still processing it when the other door came open and Michael Finch came in. “Mr. Carr,” he said, “I just talked to Ms. Berger. They got everything settled around lunchtime. If you’re ready, the President will be happy to see you this afternoon.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I glanced at Patzek who grinned and made a scooting motion with one hand. We shook hands and said the usual, and I followed Finch out the door. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********************</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who are fans of deindustrial fiction will be interested to hear that Founders House, the publisher of my novel <i>Star’s Reach</i> and the four <i>After Oil</i> anthologies, has a new peak oil SF novel just out, <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2015/10/new-release-dark-peak.html>Dark Peak</a> by George R Fehling. It’s a crisp and highly readable thriller set a generation or two after industrial civilization unravels—worth a look. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
More generally, interest in deindustrial SF seems to be picking up; those of us who have been writing and reading fiction along those lines for a while may just have gotten in on the ground floor of a new genre. In a conversation a little while back with Founders House veep Shaun Kilgore, he mentioned that his firm has decided to branch out into Young Adult fiction with a deindustrial slant. Any of my readers who are interested in writing something along these lines should contact Founders House via <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/p/submissions_14.html>their submissions page</a>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Along similar lines, I’m pleased to report that my tentative suggestion of an anthology of original short stories set in the world of my novel Star’s Reach is on its way to reality—or, more precisely, will make that transition with your help. I’ve set up a new website<span style='font-family: "times" , "serif"; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode"; mso-fareast-language: #00FF; mso-font-kerning: .5pt'>,<a href=http://merigaproject.blogspot.com/ ><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>http://merigaproject.blogspot.com</a>, </span>to coordinate the project and help writers work out the details of their stories. I’d encourage everyone who’s contributed stories to the three Space Bats Challenges hosted by this blog to check it out, and consider contributing to the anthology. </div>

I'm guessing that the San Francisco plants weren't specifically designed as methane producers, and of course they're not drawing manure from an eight county region well supplied with livestock, but no question, a poop-powered power system is not going to be lavish.

The south branch of the Chicago River used to flow into Lake Michigan... but a major engineering project in the late 1800s and early 1900s opened the river to navigation and reversed its flow. From thence to the Des Plaines River, and then to the Illinois. Today, it's possible to sail a boat from Chicago all the way south to New Orleans. <br><br>So Chicago and Toledo are not only connected by the northern water route through the Great Lakes, but also through the river routes between the Illinois and the Ohio rivers. Adding in the canal network is genius — a quick search for maps of the extant and recoverable canals in Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana suggests that there's many a county in those three states that would have easy access to bulk cargo traffic.

If that concept touches on a yet to be revealed plot narrative, no need to respond to that.<br><br>Yes, heat exchangers are a simple idea. I run my two solar hot water panels and the wood fires 8kW wet back into one and it works admirably well and takes a long time to cool down. A very simple technology and the stored heat I get from it is very handy at any stage of the year. The heat exchanger is stored in the very well insulated roof space too. Mind you, it is a low pressure vented system rather than the one in the story.<br><br>I agree with so much in this story. Yes, I don't waste a single scrap (pun intended!) of manure here - it is valuable stuff. On a serious note, I feel bad going to the toilet off the farm because all of those minerals are getting wasted - and to dump them in the ocean no matter how treated is a waste which leads to increasing ocean acidity. Plus the loss in potential top soils... I'm ranting, but it is a subject close to my heart and I walk the talk on that one.<br><br>Well done! The Wealth of Nature strikes back! I read that a few months ago and really appreciated your insights on the world of economics and taxes.<br><br>Speaking of badly behaved companies it appears that: <a href=http://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/vw-emissions-porsche-audi-and-vw-v6-engines-potentially-affected-20151102-gkp9ly.html rel=nofollow>VW emissions: Porsche, Audi and VW V6 engines potentially affected</a>. Who would have thought that companies would possibly lie to obtain commercial advantage?<br><br>Down here in Australia, I kind of feel that we are going through some sort of surreal change because the powers that be must possibly fear inflation because there is much talk in the newspapers about raising the tax on goods and services from 10% to 15%. That will destroy people at the lower income end of the spectrum.<br><br>The banks recently raised interest rates on mortgages too.

I expect to get it in the neck for having a stock market at all, but stock markets actually serve a valid purpose -- they're a venue for raising business capital, and a way for anybody with spare money to participate in the profits of industry -- and a few modest changes to deter speculative frenzies and keep the banks in check would make them much better at that. <br><br>Escape, I saw that.

As for DF, as I see it, it's still a subgenre of science fiction -- it's fiction about the future that, as all SF does, asks the question "what if?" about issues involving science and technology. The reason the SF mainstream won't touch it, of course, is that the specific "what ifs?" it asks begin with "what if technological progress turns out to be self-limiting, or even a dead end?"

Enough has been said of dacha gardening, compact, low energy cities with cheap, widely available public transport thee to round it off.

Some years ago they were made some methane power plants with government subsidies, but last year I read in local press that managers closed them because they weren't profitable. Oh, what a strange economic recovery! I think that more restrictive subsidizing politics were an other ingredient in that little fiasco.<br>Nowadays, pig farmers legally must process their livestock crap by themselves, pouring it as fertilizer in the fields or letting it to rot in big pools...first "solution" has saturated soils in some zones with too much fertilizer, so groundwaters are polluted with delicious nitrates...The second one scents farmers and tourist the whole time, and plastic membranes sometimes have pores or fissures.<br>What a great agrobusiness! Animal manure turned into another environmental problem.<br>I hope some methane and combined cycle plants Lakelanders style in the coming times, when peak oil and climate change start roaring louder...A smart, eco-friendly and hygienic solution.<br>Oh, I finish my comment with a scatological-historical reference: Cistercians Order monks used to fertilise monasteries fields withs their own "mystical" poo; I mean, they had a reservoir under monks common toilet, when it was full of poo they emptied it for agriculture use. I saw this toilet system last summer when I visited an old monastery turned in museum and semi-luxurious hotel. I made a joke parodying monks motto:"Ora et caca": Pray and make a poo. Unfortunately for Ebro river, hotel and museum toilets are conected conventional sewers.

On the other hand, one-way canals were very common in the rivers, making it possible to export timber from large parts of the Taiga of inland Scandinavia.

Some of the contributors are fairly well-known authors in the F/SF community, so <i>somebody</i> with industry clout seems to be paying <i>some</i> kind of attention.<br><br>I think the project's inclusion of the fantasy side of things is actually more impressive, as evidence of such a trend, than the science fiction. In SF, it's easy to see the point of ecological and thermodynamic constraints. In fantasy, you don't have to. <br><br>In a fantasy story, you can postulate any source of external energy you wish; constraints are devised by the author for thematic, and dramatic, purposes. When fantasy writers work with the materials of deindustrial fiction, they're doing it because they think (or their editor thinks, or their agent thinks) that the readers would be interested.<br><br>I'm also pleased that Founders House is looking for YA deindustrial SF. Science Fiction got its start largely from a mix of engineers, hobbyists, and geeky kids who avidly consumed narratives of where a science-based industrial society might go; but Kids These Days(TM) don't need that anymore. They need deindustrial fiction to make sense of the world they've been born into.

I've been living here for more than 30 years, but had not realized this facet. They really seem to have taken up smart phones with great zest, and so many people so engrossed in them that the TV is reporting accidents where people bump into each other. One person fell off a train platform. But this is just for pastimes, and I think it is true that for business, they are quite conservative. Japan believes in employing people, and except for companies such as IBM that are naturally into automation and trying to compete internationally (and are trying to change Japan's ethics and are thus getting a reputation as "black companies" where no one wants to work), they are loathe to fire people or lay them off, even when they are having trouble meeting the payroll. There may be bright young people that are tech-savvy, and given the TPP (trade agreement) and other forms of international competition being forced on them, the situation could change somewhat. There is a big disconnect between the government favoring internationalism to try to restart the "growth" engines and the majority of people trying to preserve a system that has worked well for them.<br><br>I abandoned urban life a long time ago for health reasons, so I don't really know what is happening in the capital. Thus your news has a lot of value to me, and gives me considerable hope. For most of my work as a translator/rewriter, we just use e-mails. The companies specializing in those services, though, try to keep up with technological advancements to avoid data leaks. One securities (stock market) company I used to work for was very slow to take up even transmission of files via the telephone network.<br><br>Most people here are very frightened of data leaks. The bureaucrats are not very tech savvy, and they seem to be easy targets for hackers. Recently my husband tried to avoid participating in the census, and people were saying to do everything possible to avoid it, because leaked data could deprive a person of, for example, their pension. (It's a danger that is not very well addressed in Japan, where misfortune is seen as resulting from "bad karma".) Finally, my husband complied, and it appears the government is trying to get 100% compliance, possibly related to the TPP.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html#c562363488149877228 title="comment permalink">11/5/15, 6:20 AM</a><br><br>

I'm also wondering about the profitability of farming if the price of shit (erm, feedstock) is rising like it is in Lakeland? The price of food would certainly be higher than it is today, and I would expect that farmers get a bigger share of the final price tag to the eater of their food than they do today.

The infamous Paris muck, a noisome mix of human and animal waste, human and animal cadavers, offal etc. was said to be able to eat through a man's leather boots. Remember that Paris pre-global warming enjoyed a mild, USDA 7 or thereabouts climate in which all sorts of microbes flourished. The municipal authorities caused this muck to be loaded into wagons and deposited at nine collection points on the edge of town. It was said that those nine cisterns were the cleanest places in all Paris because farmers came from across the Ile de France and transferred the muck into their own wagons. I don't know for sure, but I rather suspect that this explains the development of double digging in the Isle; farmers would have discovered that the nasty muck made excellent fertilizer if it was buried deeply enough to not contaminate newly planted crops. I suspect that Chinese farmers, using night soil collected in nearby cities, may have made a similar discovery.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html#c2863045725571925176 title="comment permalink">11/5/15, 7:21 AM</a><br><br>

My mom just built a new house, 1800 sq feet at most, 1 story, and there are SO MANY outlets, way beyond the 9 ft. (?) rule in the NEC. The panel is much larger, with way more breakers than the panel in the 1974 house she moved out of, that I grew up in, which followed the 9 ft. (?) rule and had much fewer outlets. Also, things that in the old house were on a regular branch circuit outlet, like the washer and the fridge, got their own dedicated outlet/breaker in the new house.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html#c1309288078752365361 title="comment permalink">11/5/15, 4:03 PM</a><br><br>

Keep it coming!<br><br>I am also delighted to see that Retrotopia has some not so “retro” appropriate tech! Way back in my Masters student days I fell in love with biogas: first by researching it and then by spending the better part of a year in remote Indian villages where biogas was used extensively. Most families had 3 or 4 head of cattle and the methane generated by the anaerobic digestion of their manure was sufficient to serve household cooking needs. The digester model was extremely simple with an inverted black “drum” sitting atop the pit: the drum would rise and fall according to the amount of methane produced. The black colour came in handy during the cool but sunny winter days, so as to use passive solar energy to bring the temperature closer to the optimum 32-43 degrees C (90-110 degrees F). <br><br>Unfortunately in temperate (or colder) climates, biogas production needs to be a bit higher-tech if it is to run year-round. Increasing the size of the “digesters” helps, but to combat temperatures below freezing, serious heat inputs are required. There are some farmers in Canada who have adopted biogas, but the gas is used to generate electricity that is then fed back into the grid rather than use the methane directly (as natural gas). It seems a pity to lose some of the energy in the conversion process. <br><br>Anyway, I am glad that the people of the Lakeland Republic have the good sense to use the plentiful resources around them (in this case, poo) in multiple ways, including electrical generation. Destroying all pathogens from manure also has great public health benefits too. Either deliberately or inadvertently, they have created a “Pootopia”!<br><br>Many thanks for the light and common sense that you spread in your two blogs and numerous books.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html#c6875756787172793890 title="comment permalink">11/5/15, 4:30 PM</a><br><br>

The motivation you give is taxation -- the assumption being that level of technology for infrastructure and public services correlates directly with cost, rising over time. In general, I don’t think that’s true. There are many cases where “modern” technology is much more energy-efficient, productive, and sustainable than the older technology it replaced. Nor is the efficiency necessarily achieved at the expense of the new technology being more complex or requiring a more complex industrial infrastructure to support it. It can simply be that a better way of doing things was invented.<br><br>What I’d actually expect to see in a post-industrial future would be a mix of old and new technologies, selected for functionality. “Appropriateness”. The result might well resemble the Lakeland Republic at first glance, but there would be materials and technologies unknown in the 1950 year base for Lakeland’s “tier 1“ counties.<br><br>One simple example is ETFE plastic film. Wonderful stuff for greenhouses and for enclosed “outdoor areas” in cold climate regions. Tough, highly transparent, not degraded by UV light, self-cleaning, and seems to last approximately forever. Technology level? Well... There’s nothing in the basic chemical engineering that would baffle educated chemists from the 19th century. They might be amazed by the automated process control of a modern chemical process train, and some of the precursor chemicals, the catalysts, and the chemical pathways leading to the product would be novel to them. However, having learned about it, I don’t think there’s anything that would prevent them from catching the time train back to their own era and setting up shop to make the stuff.<br><br>Another example might be genetically engineered yeasts and other microorganisms. It’s getting easier and easier to edit genomes. We’ve been doing “genetic engineering” since Adam via the “blunt force” method of selective breeding. But as our tools and understanding advance, we’re increasingly able to select and combine desirable traits from unrelated organisms. Even if social collapse and a period of chaos put paid to that line of work, it’s unlikely to destroy the more useful self-propagating strains that were previously developed. It’s fairly likely, IMO, that the anaerobic digesters in Toledo’s power station employ a cultured strain of microorganism that work faster than wild strains to produce CH4 while making much less CO2, H2S, NH3, and other “off” gases. The organisms might well produce formic acid in place of most of the CO2, which would then be distilled from the digester liqueur, and fed to another batch of organisms to produce butanol. Green motor fuel. I fully expect to see such developments within the next 10 years -- as long as things don’t fall completely to pieces before then.<br><br>There’s a lot that’s ailing about our current society. However, I think blaming the problems on technology, per se, as many do, misses the real culprit. The deeper problem is consumerism and the “race to the bottom” implicit in the way our current capitalist system works. Whether that race is inherent in <i>any</i> variation of the capitalist system, or is a result of misguided ideology, a corrupt value system, and corporate capture of the regulatory mechanisms needed to make a free market system remain free -- that’s an open question. I find Retrotopia a fascinating exploration of the topic.

The comment from thenoteswhichdonotfit is quite appropriate here. Future societies are not going to run roaring gas turbines on biologically sourced methane. To transport the poo to a central location would be energy-prohibitive. Maybe if you had each farm composting it and moving the gas through a pipe. But even then, I'm not seeing it. <br><br>By the way, I commented about sewage a couple of posts ago. The comment entered the queue late in the week, and it wasn't answered (not that it's necessary to answer every one) ... but it was an observation about my own city, where I happened to notice the lift pump stations in my hilly neighborhood. The Romans would have run sewer pipes along the natural inclines of the landscape, but modern city designers just slap down an arbitrary rectangular grid (or an equally arbitrary map of aesthetically curved streets and cul-de-sacs), and then they have to have these lift pumps. If the electric utility ever goes down, that creek in the greenbelt is going to get really stinky in short order. <br><br>Profligacies of scale. But even with gravity flow, the city won't make enough methane to keep the lights on. <br><br>Poo power is being used in some dairy operations today, I understand, but only in quite large dairy farms and it would be running more of a purring Generac. I don't think there is much surplus there. <br><br>On the other hand, a solar panel could easily last 100 years, give or take a few hailstorms. Attributing a 'lifespan' of 20 years is really just an accounting gimmick. Maybe a few lithium batteries for after dark. :-)<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html#c3923914679389631142 title="comment permalink">11/5/15, 6:56 PM</a><br><br>

I wonder how many times I have to repeat that <b>the tier system is only a measure of the infrastructure provided by tax revenue</b> -- as I've said many times already -- before those of you who insist on not hearing those words finally pay attention. The tiers don't define what technology can be used -- only what infrastructure gets provided by tax revenue. If you want a more complex technology, you can have it, as long as you don't expect the infrastructure for it to be paid for by tax revenue. Infrastructure. Tax revenue. Are you listening yet? <br><br>Jim, it would help if you'd read the post before critiquing it, because I've already dealt with your objections. The great majority of the manure used in the plants is transported to the plants by canalboat, which is an extraordinarily energy- and cost-efficient means of shipping -- not prohibitively costly at all. As for pumped sewage, here again, Toledo had to be rebuilt after the Second Civil War -- I've indicated that already -- and saner arrangements to get sewage to municipal power plants by gravity would have been easily put in place during that rebuilding process. As you'll find if you read some of the other comments, moreover, methane generation from manure is a commonly used technology in quite a bit of the Third World these days. What makes Toledo different is simply that it sources feedstock from an eight county area, and thus generates enough methane to provide a modest amount of electricity for streetcars, household lighting, and the like. <br><br>As for solar panels, they look really good as long as you don't factor in the costs of manufacture and maintenance, including all supply chains for raw materials and manufacturing equipment. Include those, and methane from manure is a better investment.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html#c3522995926427550026 title="comment permalink">11/5/15, 8:21 PM</a><br><br>

In general, the huge amount of water mixed with human waste in the sewer systems makes the water too diluted. They human waste then has to go into huge ponds when the water is constantly aerated to get the bacteria to purify the water. This makes it nearly impossible to get any usable amounts of methane productions out of human waste (too much water and not enough poo). If the poo wasn't mixed with the general sewers, it would be possible to get more methane production out of it (there are a couple methods this could be done, sewers that use vacuums rather than water to move the poo around, or simply having humanure buckets for the average household) (buckets also have the advantage of not requiring a $4,000 to $14,000 per house installation cost that a sewer line costs).<br>One good way to produce methane these days is from landfills. It does require petroleum products (because they have to cover the landfills with an impermeable tarp to collect the methane). North Little Rock has a 4.8 Megawatt Landfill gas-to-energy plant (https://www.wm.com/about/press-room/2008/20080812_WM_To_Dedicate_Arkansas_First_Landfill_Gas-to-Energy_Plant_and_New_Partnership_with_Audubon_Arkansas.pdf).<br><br><a href=retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html#c4942988761021961474 title="comment permalink">11/6/15, 8:32 AM</a><br><br>

Data here can easily be checked with a little googling. That's how I found it.<br><br> One "cow unit" consumes ~100 lb. of green grass per day, or ~35 lb. of dry hay;<br><br> It takes anywhere from 2 acres per cow in a well watered temperate region with good pasture and hay fields to 100 acres of open range in an arid region with cold winters;<br><br> One cow produces ~65 pounds of manure per day, containing ~ 7 lbs of dry matter;<br><br> The heat content of 7 lbs dry matter is about 60 MJ, or 17 kWh thermal;<br><br> Anaerobic digestion can convert ~75% of the thermal energy potential of its input to the equivalent amount of methane. That translates to methane with 13 kWh thermal per cow per day;<br><br> Assuming 60% conversion efficiency in a CCGT (combine cycle gas turbine), that would be 8 kWh per cow per day;<br><br> 8 kWh per day is one third of a kilowatt per cow. One megawatt would require a herd of 3000 cattle. <br><br>The cattle would need to be kept in a feedlot for collection of manure. Alternatively, in a rural subsistence economy where children are economic commodities, gangs of children could be sent out daily to comb the 10,000 or so acres of pasture for collecting cow patties. Neither approach quite fits the image of an enlightened, sustainable de-industrial economy.<br><br>That's not to say that an energy economy based on biogas can't be made to work. It just means that trying to base it solely on cow manure is a bad idea. Fortunately, manure is far from the only type of biomass that can be handled in an anaerobic digester.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html#c7555242846394765386 title="comment permalink">11/6/15, 1:28 PM</a><br><br>

How many of them will be left in the Lakeland Republic's territory after that's been a war zone for four years, subject to prolonged aerial and cruise missile bombardment, and then fought over via town by town infantry battles? There may be a few left, and I might even put one into a future scene, but it won't be a significant factor. As for steel rails and the like, of course that's not being produced by solar energy; there are any number of fuel sources that will allow for that, and we'll be getting to one or two of them as we proceed. <br><br>Dwig, it's an excellent book!<br><br>Misty, I'm not sure that sewers are the best means to get manure from the source to the plant -- I'll be working that out as we proceed. The primary cooking fuel in the Lakeland Republic is alcohol, and hayboxes and solar ovens are much used to make the heat go further -- and yes, flophouses, rooming houses, and the like are quite common. <br><br>Roger, I'm well aware where the misunderstandings are coming from. People in today's America are taught to believe that you can't pick and choose among technologies -- each technology is assigned to an era, and if you embrace that technology you have to embrace everything else about that era. I've run into that over and over again in these posts! Still, thanks for the reminder -- I'll have to have Carr use that same bit of illogic at some point in an upcoming post, and get corrected on it. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, I haven't worked out all the details, but alcohol stoves are common, and solar ovens and hayboxes even more so.

Electric grids make sense in restricted areas, such as cities -- it's when you extend them into rural areas that the losses really pile up.

Tomxyza here. Having worked on manure digesters as a design engineer for a number of years there are several issues and solutions that need to be considered. Someone commented that typical American sewers are a problem for producing methane feed stock and they are quite correct as typical sewage is way too dilute for anaerobic digestion. Most municipal plants that produce digester gas produce it from settled sludge. One advantage of dairies or pig farms over other animal operations is that both of these are often scrape or flush systems where the slurry is in the right range of 15% solids for easy use in a stirred style digester. You can use higher solid content mixes in a plug flow digester also. For really dry material the best bet is a “dry fermentation” system. Here is an example of a municipal system that has recently installed a dry system. http://zerowasteenergy.com/worlds-largest-dry-fermentation-anaerobic-digestion-facility-opens/<br>The other major issue with gas production is feedstock. Animal manure makes a great basic material for digestion as in the case of cows it comes seeded with bacteria ready to get to work. Many European systems (Europe is ahead of the US in using digesters) use a process where the feedstock is first sterilized so the bacterial content can be more closely controlled. This also eliminates the concerns about using post-consumer food waste as the sterilization eliminates the concern, often expressed in the US, about human pathogens. In Wash State it is not legal for the farm digesters to take any post-consumer food waste. <br>The question of proper feed stock management is highlighted by the Farm Power NW experience. http://farmpower.com/ They found that adding the proper kind of other waste material in fairly small quantities, on the order of 15% could double the gas production from a digester running dairy manure as a primary substrate. Really good additions are chicken entrails from processing and reject eggs. <br>On the subject of cows per kilowatt that depends on a lot of factors. Primarily what percent of the manure is collectable? If the cows are confined on concrete all the time then collection is high and the output is higher. This is more common on dairy farms than beef operations. The following is based on figures for operating Wash State dairy digesters.<br>Cows 800 5300 1100 1200 2000 1000<br>KW 600 1200 450 750 750 400<br>Cow/KW 1.33 4.42 2.44 1.60 2.67 2.50<br>The above is based on installed KW and in some cases the generator is oversized so the output potential would be overstated. This is done if there is ample opportunity for acquiring other wastes. In other cases the generator is undersized because the farmer has other uses for the gas and generators are expensive. My experience with dairy digester operations is that once up and stabilized they operate at a fairly constant output 24/7. <br>The above figures come from this report. http://agr.wa.gov/FP/Pubs/docs/343-WashingtonDairiesAndDigesters-web.pdf<br>There are a lot of factors that go into digester design and configuration. I pointed to the “dry fermentation” example above as it has two advantages. It can take very dry feedstocks, which transport well and it uses no extra water as the liquid is recycled. The material that is left is easily composted for use as fertilizer and can have excess thickened liquid added to increase value. <br>Googling cows per kilowatt or dry fermentation will get lots of hits if one is interested. <br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html#c6038403623798851162 title="comment permalink">11/6/15, 7:52 PM</a><br><br>

Waste heat from generation is used to maintain proper working temperatures in the digester. Digesters will still work if not heated but gas production and required retention time vary with temperature. Smell can be an issue if using gas for direct heat or cooking. JMG is quite correct in his comment that one advantage of a turbine or IC engine is that the smell is incinerated. There is a major issue in running IC engines or turbines and that is that they must be run 24/7 or acid condensation in the internals will cause problems. Even then careful maintenance is required. The biggest culprit is H2S but not the only one.

You managed to convey a number of sophisticated ideas in a very down to earth way. Having said that, I don't think this would make a good military solution for the Lakeland Republic.<br><br>I once read an article from a chess grand master on how to play against a computer. The core of the argument is that you have to change your style to negate the advantages of the machine; i.e. a computer can evaluate many more possible moves in much less time than yourself, so you shall force the match to go to closed positions whenever it's feasible. In this way, there are less options to evaluate, and you can benefit from creative thinking that the machine lacks.<br><br>A similar situation happens to the Lakeland army. They have foregone their reliance on computers for regular forces (though I suspect they may keep, and considerable expense, a small number of elite unit cyber-warriors to wreck the communications/logistics of invading armies) but the enemy still has their own computers and can use those really well. It would be a big waste of resources to generate and manage such large amounts of OTPs by hand and dice that a junior cryptanalyst will be able to brute force - I know OTP is theoretically unbreakable, but there is not such a thing as a "fair dice" in real life. there are always patterns, and there are always weak points in the implementation - in a few hours using specialized hardware.<br><br>What Lakeland wants to do is negate the computer advantage of the adversary, and the most straightforward way to do so is to use analog communications instead of digital. One possibility, which was invented during WWII, is frequency hopping. Imagine that instead of having a dial to choose one frequency to transmit, you plug a signal from a phonograph. As the music plays, your transmission will keep changing and changing "channels". Now, the "key" to this encryption is that both you and the receiver have to be playing the same disc at the same time. Any eavesdropper listening in any single channel will only read small bursts of "noise", and a jammer will need to transmit simultaneously (and at great expense) in most available frequencies in order to block your signal. Of course the details are more complex than that, but that's the general idea.<br><br>Other way to negate the computer power is in the encoding of the message itself. You can use again music as your carrier signal, this time live music. Let's say you have a flute playing the tune of "Yankee duddle dandy" over and over. First, you encode the message in music keys. Then the flutist will introduce the message in the tune, one wrong key at a time. A modern computer would have a hard time to figure that out, and even to an untrained human the tune will just sound like a really bad musician playing the flute... but the receiver side will have their own flutist that will tell right away what are the wrong keys and the message can be decoded from that.<br><br>Of course a computer can be programmed to defeat that, but you are also allowed to get creative. You change the tunes and the instruments every day. If the programmers get to figure out the basic rules of melody, you cheat and have your musicians add counterpoint (and they will love you for it), or you can create a whole orchestra of hell where every musician will make random mistakes at fixed intervals but only the intended receiver will know that on Tuesday evening the carriers of the real message are the oboes.... let them try to figure that out!!!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html#c7963645275418589107 title="comment permalink">11/7/15, 12:16 AM</a><br><br>

The optimum size of tank is uncertain. One big pressure vessel or many smaller ones?

Or could it be done in a continuous process, with fresh poo in one end, and gas and digested slurry out the other?<br><br>The underfloor turbines described are typical of a hydroelectric plant. Gas turbines are basically big jet engines and would be above ground, roaring away under load.<br><br>Agreed. that the stock market will survive.

Your concept of the Tertiary economy has always resonated with me as an unnecessary aspect of the current economy. But wow, is that beast being pump primed or what? It is like a ghost that is devouring the material world until it can eat no more. They're saying in the papers that house prices have flat lined here, but I'm unsure whether to believe those stories. Incidentally I came across an article where an old timer statistician of serious credibility was complaining in the public realm about the unemployment statistics: <a href=http://www.afr.com/news/economy/former-abs-head-says-employment-data-not-worth-paper-theyre-written-on-20151014-gk8syh rel=nofollow>Former ABS head says employment data 'not worth paper they're written on'</a>.<br><br>The ABS is the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the guy fell short of naming and shaming possibly for a reasonable fear of repercussions, but I thought that you may find it to be an interesting article all the same.<br><br>Another very laughable concept (except that it is not funny) that I read thrown about by current economists is this weird concept of the consumer economy as if we can somehow just spend and not earn. That consumer economy meme gives me a mental image of that concept as a circle that gets slightly smaller every single year as it feeds on itself. What do you think about that concept? I've seen it used as a foreign policy bludgeon too, so I'm instantly uncomfortable about it.<br><br>Did you get any quince fruit this year? I've started poaching the fruit which provides many different outputs: poached fruit (total yum!); quince jam/jelly; and quince wine. A very versatile fruit and also a hardy fruit tree.<br><br>Oh yeah, I've been observing an unusual occurrence recently here and thought that you may be interested in the observation: As the diversity of plant life increases here, so too does the diversity in both the bird and animal life. It is amazing to watch the entire farm get more complex with each passing season. A few weeks back a very rare pair of Black Cockatoos (with yellow tails) popped by to say hello and today a King Parrot turned up to enjoy a drink. Fortunately, the King Parrot was vain enough that the bird hung around for a photo opportunity - if I looked like that brightly coloured bird I'd probably be vain too! Hehe! ;-)! The flip side of the increase in diversity is that the farm produces a wider diversity of edibles and gets lower maintenance at the same time through more extreme weather conditions.<br><br>Incidentally, I was wondering whether you were going to work in a bit of agriculture into the story? The reason I ask is that people have this bizarre notion that somehow soils don't require green manures or resting in between productive crops. Mind you, your soils in the US are far more fertile and less fragile than here, so perhaps I'm a bit over zealous on such matters?<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html#c3555219360805125894 title="comment permalink">11/7/15, 2:22 AM</a><br><br>

As with a lot of science this is good in theory but hard to put into practice. Manure output depends on the breed, the feed and the ability to collect it. Diary cows produce more manure than beef as they are breed to process a lot of feed into a lot of milk. I quoted you the output numbers based on actual digesters earlier because as an engineer I am interested in the real world application. <br><br>Using a dense municipality's digestable organic refuse as feed stock to generate a small but useful amount of power and heat is very sustainable. Treating a plant as JMG described in the story as a combined heat and power station is a very practical way to optimize the outputs and supply very desirable fertilizer.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html#c2260133812525232680 title="comment permalink">11/7/15, 5:17 AM</a><br><br>

If the wind is right, a passer-by could detect it, but we've never had complaints. Just the same, I run out and pull up a bunch of weeds to put over it, and then there is no smell reaching the sidewalk. Everyone in town has pit johns like ours, but I think they just call for the honey wagon these days. But it is still within the memory of people in their sixties here of being sent out to run after the mailman on his horse for a little extra power for the potatoes. They don't mention it, but I think they also remember using night soil. It was practiced universally by farmers in post-war Japan until chemical fertilizers came along.<br><br>Each year, I dig several deep pits in various parts of the garden and transfer the material to those, covering them with about a foot of soil.

It is interesting to me to consider whether or not the area of computer science related to algorithm design could potentially survive and evolve in a world of energy descent, as if anything a human computer will need to be more particular about using the best algorithms which require the least amount of time.

I much enjoy reading your essays, if not perfectly prescient, they are interesting bases for discussion. <br><br>As for the centrally-located poo fermenter, and centrally-located electric generator, I'm not so sure of the "efficiency of scale" there. In our current living arrangement, we have overshot not only population levels, but common sense, and have done so to such an extent as to distort all of our thinking. The architects of the Internet (not the Web, by the way) pondered resiliency back in the '70s and '80s, and came up with a distributed/local model as being the most robust. They had an ongoing debate with the Bell System, whose model was centralized (and although it is a very large network, it is arguably fragile). <br><br>This tension between local/distributed and centralized/authoritarian controls is so far from being resolved, that the Internet itself has now been subsumed by a handful of gigantic networking corporations, and therefore now susceptible to disruption. Fortunately the IETF wrote down their protocols, and there are countless copies of it out there in the public domain. Someone, somewhere, has probably even printed most of them on paper (though probably not low-acid paper, nor with long-lived metal-based inks). <br><br>Back to the essay, your remarks about the canal system has me hitting up Wikipedia for some study. I was reminded of the Midwestern town where I grew up, which has a tiny piece of the Wabash-Erie canal preserved in a City park. <br><br>One of those amazing little facts about America that we don't think about all that much ... before the over-done railroad craze of the late 19th century, there was a similarly exuberant canal craze. The history of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabash_and_Erie_Canal rel=nofollow>the Wabash-Erie is probably a good rundown</a> of what *not* to do when building a canal system, but the rights-of-way still crisscross the Midwest, and center on Toledo! <br><br>Good one, the canal system!

The bonus of that policy is that it saves having previous decisions cast into question. It is a policy of escalation - and isn't that an inherent policy of our culture? I see it everywhere and it is not good.<br><br>Of course following such a policy is a recipe for disaster. This is the exact policy that appears to have destroyed the local seed saving group here. A bit sad really, but life and time moves on. But when it is being pursued by society as general policy, it is a bit more than a total disaster. To me it seems like lemmings running off a cliff at full speed! Spin and escalation does not put food on the table!<br><br>Anyway, my further insight on this whole problem is that it is a policy for individuals and other entities that have basically failed to display the ability to learn. You see, humans are pretty smart creatures, but they make mistakes - no dramas, I don't have a problem with that. But when we fail as individuals and/or entities to admit to those mistakes for fear of losing social "face" then we also neatly side step the process of learning from those mistakes. We instead appear to be employing other tactics to get around that messy problem like: doubling down; escalating; lying; cheating... I think you get the picture. And those are a dead end path.<br><br>Incidentally, and further to that when a situation can no longer be ignored we simply ask for our leaders to fall onto their swords. Look at the whole VW debacle as a case in point - but that one example is a microcosm of the larger worm eating away at the core of our culture.<br><br>When I ran a graduate program for a large corporate I said to the graduates: I've never shot anyone for making a mistake, so I suggest you always come clean on them because I have shot people for lying to me. It never took long before I got to make an example of someone - because our culture is so dysfunctional.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html#c2933555615605972285 title="comment permalink">11/7/15, 2:34 PM</a><br><br>

Then if the generator has an efficiency of about 70% this would reduce to about 1.3KWHr per Kg of dry cow dung or about 4 KWHr per day per cow.<br><br>50 cows should produce about 200 KWHr per day or about 8.5 KW continuously. Circumstances, such as changes to food type, could affect this a bit and it may be more efficient on a larger scale. <br><br>I would estimate that it would take at least 5000 cows to produce 1MW continuously.<br><br>(1) https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/environment/intensive-livestock/cattle-feedlots/managing-environmental-impacts/manure-production-data<br>(2) http://www.researchgate.net/post/How_much_methane_than_can_be_produced_per_1_kg_of_cow_manure_using_anaerobic_digestion<br>(3) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density<br><br>As for refrigerators. You don't need electricity for refrigeration but you do need some form of heat. In the old days we had a kerosine refrigerator but it could be made to run on just about any fuel. Then again the 60 L camping fridge we have uses about 0.25 KWHr per day. Even then it could be made more efficient. The limiting factor is the insulation and most fridges are built for style and ease of use, rather than efficiency.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html#c8452559125192933499 title="comment permalink">11/8/15, 5:26 AM</a><br><br>

IIRC still photography goes back to the 1840s and projected motion pictures to the 1890s. If the chemical industry in higher tier counties is capable of producing fast exposure film, they can make movies. Even if that isn't possible, animated movies can be made if there is a way to transfer images to a transparent medium for projection. <br><br>You need a camera with a fast shutter speed and gears to move the film strip along. The projector needs a bright light and more gears. Sound can be recorded and synced in a variety of ways. Speakers for a large theater require electricity. 1890s tech would be a hand cranked projector and a Victrola or a live musician/narrator.<br><br>Some of the 1890s era motion pictures are still watchable for entertainment (Melies) or historical information.If film is available, I can see movies being made in the top three tiers, and being exhibited in Tier Two. Movies are a form of popular entertainment and a way of conveying information. I would expect high demand for the products of a domestic film industry as an expression of national culture. I can even see motion pictures as an export industry if the sound quality is up to international standards.<br><br>Come to think of it, if the world of 2065 still includes an international fashion market, I can see Tier 5 exporting retro chic couture and the lower tiers exporting folk style clothing like the hand worked blouses from Mexico and Afghanistan that I bought on Telegraph Avenue in the 1970s.

Finding it he smiled and holding it on the tip of his fingers he lifted his shitty smeared arm over the cesspits edge, asking her to fetch the ring from his fingers.

Before folks start attacking me, let me explain:<br><br>One can certainly make methane out of animal (and human) waste, it has been known for some time and is currently being done at many places at varying degrees of size/scale. It works. But as in all things done within a system there are no free lunches; and along with what you are doing, there are unintended consequences which come along for the ride.<br><br>It may appear that since the end product of waste digestion is returned to the land, that it is no different than using the manure directly as fertilizer. But that is not really the case. Soils in the US, and most of the developed world (anyone using modern ag techniques/fertilizers for long) are suffering from a long term reduction of organic matter (OM). OM levels in virgin US soils were at &gt;5%; those soils today are typically around 1% OM or less. The results of this loss in OM are soils which are less productive, don't hold/adsorb water as well, and have reduced microbiological activity. The plants grown on them become dependent on human applied fertilizers. In short the soils don't grow crops as well as they could, as well as being more prone to causing floods and suffering from droughts. That extra carbon in the wastes which becomes the methane for electricity is needed in the soils, especially soils which have been depleted of OM.<br><br>The problems caused (or continued) by a large scale diversion of waste product carbon from the land to energy production are likely rather long term, so might not be visible for some time; unlike the problems of biofuel production which hit us in the face rather quickly. But regardless of the timescale, its a failed solution. There are no free lunches, the carbon for the methane and electricity will be paid for in further loss of fertility in the croplands of LR. Maybe no one will notice the declining fertility for a generation or so, and maybe the droughts and floods won't point a finger back at the electrical generation scheme. But regardless of whether or not anyone sees what is going on, it will happen.<br><br>Perhaps I am the only one who sees it this way, but the LR electricity system is not that much different than the biodiesel or ethanol fuels craze of a decade or so ago. Nice "green" solutions to our energy problems with no side effects. While I think such a system would be better than ethanol, at least would have fewer side effects and at a smaller scale. But that does not mean that it is without side effects. Everything has a place in system, and when you "steal" a resource from where the flow used to take it, you create an imbalance. There is no "waste" in the system, something/someone was counting on that stuff to live. You can't appropriate for your use without consequences.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-inflows-and-outputs.html#c9077770368136338977 title="comment permalink">11/11/15, 7:44 PM</a><br><br>
