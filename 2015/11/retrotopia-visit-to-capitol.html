<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the ninth installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator finally has his interview with the President of the Lakeland Republic, asks some hard questions, and prepares for a trip into unexpected territory. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finch flagged down a cab as soon as we got out onto the sidewalk, and within a minute or two we were rolling through downtown at however many miles an hour a horse makes at a steady trot. Before too many more minutes had gone by, we were out from among the big downtown buildings, and the unfinished dome of the Capitol appeared on the skyline. Finch was in high spirits, talking about the compromise Meeker had brokered with the Restos, but I was too keyed up to pay much attention. A day and a half in the Lakeland Republic had answered a few of my questions and raised a good many more that I hadn’t expected to ask at all, and the meeting ahead would probably determine whether I’d be able to get the answers that mattered. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The cab finally rolled to a halt, and the cabbie climbed down from his perch up front and opened the door for us. I’d been so deep in my own thoughts for the last few blocks that I hadn’t noticed where we’d ended up, and I was startled to see the main entrance to the Capitol in front of me. I turned to Finch. “Here, rather than the President’s mansion?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The intern gave me a blank look. “You mean like the old White House? We don’t have one of those. President Meeker has a house in town, just like any other politician.” I must have looked startled, because he went on earnestly:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“We dumped the whole imperial-executive thing after Partition. I’m surprised so many of the other republics kept it, after everything that happened.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded noncommittally as we walked up to the main entrance, climbed the stair, and went in. There were a couple of uniformed guards inside the outer doors, the first I’d seen anywhere in the Lakeland Republic, but they simply nodded a greeting to the two of us as we walked by. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We pushed open the inner doors and went into the rotunda. There was a temporary ceiling about forty feet overhead, and someone had taken the trouble to paint on it a <i>trompe l’oeil </i>view of the way the dome would look from beneath. In the middle of the floor was a block of marble maybe three feet on a side; I could barely see it because a dozen or so people were standing around it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of them, a stout and freckled blonde woman in a pale blue gingham dress, was saying something in a loud clear voice as we came through the doors: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“...do solemnly swear that, should I be elected to any official position, I will faithfully execute the laws of the Lakeland Republic regardless of my personal beliefs, and should I be unable to do so in good conscience, I will immediately resign my office, so help me my Lord and Savior Jesus.” Three sudden blue-white flashes told of photos being taken, a little patter of applause echoed off the temporary ceiling, and then some of the people present got to work signing papers on the marble cube. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finch led me around the group to a door on the far side of the rotunda. “What was that about?” I asked him with a motion of my head toward the group around the cube.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“A candidate,” he explained as we went through the doors. “Probably running for some township or county office.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A lot of them like to do the ceremony here at the Capitol and get the pictures in their local papers. You can’t run for any elected position here unless you take that oath first—well, with or without the Jesus bit, or whatever else you prefer in place of it. There was a lot of trouble before the Second Civil War with people in government insisting that their personal beliefs trumped the duties of their office—” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ve read about it.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“So that went into our constitution. Break the oath and you do jail time for perjury.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I took that in as we went down a corridor. On the far end was what looked like an ordinary front office with a young man perched behind a desk. “Hi, Gabe,” Finch said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Hi, Mike.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is Mr. Carr?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yes. Mr. Carr, this is Gabriel Menendez, the President’s assistant secretary.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We shook hands, and Menendez picked up a phone on his desk and asked, “Cheryl, is the boss free? Mr. Carr’s here.” A pause, then:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Yes. I’ll send him right in.” He put down the phone and waved us to the door at the far end of the room. “He’ll see you now.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We shed coats and hats at the coatrack on one side of the office, and went through the door. On the other side was another corridor, and beyond that was a circular room with doors opening off it in various directions. Off to the left an ornate spiral stair swept up and down to whatever was on the floors above and below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>To the right was another desk; the woman sitting at it nodded greetings to us and gestured to the central door. I followed Finch as he walked to the door, opened it, and said, “Mr. President? Mr. Carr.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Isaiah Meeker, President of the Lakeland Republic, was standing at the far side of the room, looking out the window over the Toledo streetscape below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He turned and came toward us as soon as Finch spoke. He looked older than the pictures I’d seen, the close-trimmed hair and iconic short beard almost white against the dark brown of his face. “Mr. Carr,” he said as we shook hands. “Pleased to meet you. I hope you haven’t been completely at loose ends this last day or so.” He gestured toward the side of the room. “Please have a seat.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It wasn’t until I turned the direction he’d indicated that I realized there were more than the three of us in the room. A circle of chairs surrounded a low table there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Melissa Berger and Fred Vanich, whom I’d met in the Toledo train station, were already<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>seated there, and so were two other people I didn’t know. “Stuart Macallan from the State Department,” Meeker said, making introductions. “Jaya Patel, from Commerce. Of course you’ve already met Melissa and Fred.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Hands got shaken and I took a seat. Macallan was the assistant secretary of state for North American affairs, I knew, and Patel had an equivalent position on the trade end of things. “I apologize for the delay,” Meeker went on. “I imagine you know how it goes, though.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Of course.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And you seem to have put the time to good use—at least for our garment industry.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That got a general chuckle, which I joined. “When in Rome,” I said. “I take it that’s not one of the things visitors usually do, though; Mr. Finch here looked right past me this morning.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finch reddened. “It really does vary,” Patel said. “Some of the diplomats and business executives we’ve worked with have taken to buying all their clothes here—we’ve even fielded inquiries about exporting garments for sale abroad. Still, most of our visitors seem to prefer their bioplastic.” Her fractional shrug showed, politely but eloquently, what she thought of that.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“To each their own,” said the President. “But you’ve had the chance to see a little of Toledo, and find out a few of the ways we do things here. I’d be interested to know your first reactions.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I considered that, decided that a certain degree of frankness wasn’t out of place. “In some ways, impressed,” I said, “and in some ways disquieted. You certainly seem to have come through the embargo years in better shape than I expected—though I’m curious about how things will go now that the borders are open.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s been a matter of some concern here as well,” Meeker allowed. “That said, so far things seem to be going smoothly.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Macallan paused just long enough to make sure his boss wasn’t going to say more, and then cleared his throat and spoke. “One of the things we hope might come out of your visit is a better relationship with the Atlantic Republic. I’m sure you know how fraught things were with Barfield and his people. If Ms. Montrose is willing to see things ratchet down to a more normal level, we’re ready to meet her halfway—potentially more than halfway.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That was quite an upset she pulled off in the election,” Meeker observed. “I hope you’ll pass on my personal congratulations.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ll gladly do that,” I said to the President, and then to Macallan:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“It’s certainly possible. I don’t happen to know her thoughts on that, but a lot of people on our side of the border are interested in seeing things change, and she’s got a stronger mandate than any president we’ve had since Partition. Still—” I shrugged. “We’ll have to see what happens after the inauguration.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Of course,” Macallan said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“One thing we’d be particularly interested in seeing,” said Patel, “is a widening of the opportunities for trade. Obviously that’s going to be delicate—it’s a core policy of ours that the Republic has to be able to meet its essential needs from within its own borders, and I know that stance isn’t exactly popular in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>global-trade circles. We’re not interested in global trade, but there are things your country produces that we’d like to be able to buy, and things we produce that you might like to buy in exchange.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Again,” I said, “we’ll have to see what happens—but I don’t know of any reason why that wouldn’t be a possibility.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She nodded, and a brief silence passed. Vanich’s featureless voice broke it. “Mr. Carr,” he said, “you mentioned that you found some of the ways we do things here disquieting. I think we’d all be interested in hearing more about that, if you’re willing.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Startled, I glanced across the table at him, but his face was as impenetrable as it had been the first time I’d seen him. I looked at the President, who seemed amused, and then nodded. “If you like,” I said. “At first it was mostly the—” I floundered for a term. “—deliberately retro, I suppose, quality of so much of what I’ve seen: the clothing, the technology, the architecture, all of it. I have to assume that that’s an intentional choice, connected to whatever’s inspired your Resto parties in politics.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meeker nodded. “Very much so.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“But that’s not actually the thing I find most disquieting. What has me scratching my head is that your republic seems to have gone out of its way to ignore every single scrap of advice you must have gotten from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the other global financial institutions—in fact, from the entire economics profession—and despite that, you’ve apparently thrived.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meeker’s face broke into a broad smile. “Excellent,” he said. “Excellent. I’ll offer just one correction: we haven’t succeeded as well as we have despite ignoring the economic advice of the World Bank and so forth. We’ve done so precisely <i>because</i> we’ve ignored their advice.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave him a long wary look, but his smile didn’t waver. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Mr. Carr,” Melanie Berger said then, “Since the end of the embargo we’ve been approached four times by the World Bank and the IMF. I’ve been involved in the discussions that followed. Each time, their economists have made long speeches about how the way we do things is hopelessly inefficient, and how we’ve got to follow their advice and become more efficient. Each time, I’ve asked them to answer a simple question: ‘more efficient for what output in terms of what input?’ Not one of them has ever been able, or willing, to give me a straight answer.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I had a lecture on that subject yesterday from a bank officer,” I told her. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Her eyebrows went up, and then she smiled. “Not surprising. It’s something most people here know about, if they know anything at all about money.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded, taking that in. “So what you’re suggesting,” I said, as much to Meeker as to her, “is that the rest of the world doesn’t have a clue about economics.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not quite,” said the President. “It’s just that our history has forced us to look at things in a somewhat different light, and prioritize different things.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was a graceful answer, and I nodded. “The question that comes to mind at this point,” he went on, “is whether there’s anything else you’d like to see, now that you know a little more about our republic.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“As it happens, yes,” I said. “There is.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He motioned me to go on.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“When I drew up the list we sent to your people right after the election, I didn’t know about the tier system, and I’ve got some serious questions about what things are like at the bottom rung of that ladder. I’ve read a little bit about the system, but I’m frankly skeptical that anybody in this day and age would voluntarily choose to live in the conditions of 1830.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s actually a common misconception,” Jaya Patel said, with the same you-don’t-get-it smile I’d seen more than once since my arrival. “The only thing the tier system determines is what infrastructure and services gets paid for out of tax revenues.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I saw a fair number of horsedrawn wagons on the train ride here,” I pointed out. “That’s not a matter of infrastructure.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Actually, it is,” she said. “Without a road system built to stand up to auto traffic, cars and trucks aren’t as efficient as wagons—” Her smile suddenly broadened. “—in terms of the total cost of haulage. That doesn’t keep people in tier one counties from having whatever personal technologies they want to have, and are willing and able to pay for.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Got it,” I said. “I’d still like to see how it works out in practice.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s easy enough,” the President said. “Anything else?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yes,” I said, “though I know this may be further than you’re willing to go. I’d like to see something of your military.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The room got very quiet. “I’d be interested,” Meeker said, “in knowing why.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded. “It seems to me that whatever you’ve achieved by this retro policy of yours comes at the cost of some frightful vulnerabilities. Ms. Berger told me a little about the war with the Confederacy and Brazil, and of course I knew a certain amount about that in advance. Obviously you won that round—but we both know that the Confederacy wasn’t in the best of shape in ‘49, and I really wonder about your ability to stand up to a modern high-tech military.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Like the Atlantic Republic’s?” Meeker asked, with a raised eyebrow. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I responded with a derisive snort. “With all due respect, I’m sure you know better than that. I’m thinking about what would happen if we ended up with a war zone or a failed state on our western borders.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Fair enough,” he said after a moment, “and I think we can satisfy you about that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’d like to suggest something,” Berger said to the President. “Defiance County is first tier.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He glanced at her. “You’re thinking Hicksville?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yes.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We’ll have to find someone.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Tom Pappas comes to mind,” she said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The President’s face took on a slightly glazed expression, and then he laughed. “Yes, I think Tom will do. Thank you, Melanie.” He turned to me. “Have you made any plans for tomorrow?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not yet.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Good. The day after tomorror, there’s a—military exercise, I think you would call it—in a first tier county a couple of hours from here by train. If you’re willing, I can have my staff make the arrangements for you to go there tomorrow, have a look around, stay the night, see how our military does things the next day, and then come back. Is that workable?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
“I’d welcome that,” I told him, wondering what I’d just gotten myself into.</div>

As a transportation engineer I particularly appreciated your point about the problems of maintaining serviceable roadways. Few people can imagine how quickly a modern asphalt road surface can break down in the absence of maintenance and also in the absence of traffic. An abandoned parking lot is a good example: cracking and crumbling pavement hosting hardy weeds and all of it exposed to winter freeze/thaw cycles and summer oxidation. Without the dynamic loading of vehicles, the asphalt loses its binding quality, and the pavement begins its own cycle of collapse.<br><br>The end of a modern roadway system is very bad news for small, isolated communities for which some future rail service would never make economic sense. Such communities would indeed go back to an 1830's condition set in a very basic economy which would struggle to export agricultural goods or import anything else.<br><br><a href=#c8977979570368581079 title="comment permalink">11/11/15, 8:47 PM</a><br><br>

The <i>Retrotopia</i> narrative is intended to speak to that. <br><br>Pygmycory, you will indeed. I'm looking forward to it myself -- my style of writing is such that I rarely know exactly what I'm going to encounter once I start typing!<br><br>Eric and Marcu, delighted to hear that the meetings are continuing.

It was a long rough road. <br><br>Onething, that's the one: southwest of Toledo, in the heart of rural middle America. Watch for drones dropping from the sky, and you'll know you're in the right place. <br><br>Howard, I don't think I'll be giving away too much if I mention that this is rather on the minds of certain people in the Atlantic Republic. <br><br>Ynnothir, that's exactly the point of this series -- I want to talk about the potential for a better future than the one toward which current trends are heading, and narrative fiction is an elegant tool for that.

We're only about a third of the way through the Retrotopia narrative. <br><br>Shane, I simply won't go into a bar or a restaurant that has wall to wall tele-buboes.

I suppose learning to twitch and foam at the mouth might be a useful skill, though...<br><br>William, thanks for the data! I'd picked that up partly from watching poorly maintained roadways disintegrate, and partly by reading obsessively about the ongoing infrastructure crisis here in the US. The one transport technology that really works well in an 1830 setting, though, is canal transport -- where the geography permits, that's an extremely sustainable, low-energy, easily maintainable method of bulk transport, and you'll see it in use as the narrative continues. <br><br>Nancy, thank you. Yes, the economic issues are crucial, and they're going to cycle back through in various forms all through the narrative. I think you'll find that a lot of people in the Lakeland Republic know the value of a penny! <br><br>Mark, I have no objection to spoilers, especially when what I have in mind is fairly complex, and draws elements from many different sources. Of course I'm not a Buddhist, and my take on the power and limitations of nonviolent resistance is rather different from yours, but to each their own.<br><br><a href=#c5895327446545069915 title="comment permalink">11/11/15, 10:12 PM</a><br><br>

Is there something like a 'stockbroker belt' or a circle of country houses or chateaux a little beyond daily commuting distance from the city, where they can live luxuriously but not too far from the centre of wealth and power? <br><br>If there isn't the fascinating situation of people living in the stone age and knapping flint in one tier, whilst others use flintlock muskets in another, and silicon chips in a third; if it's just a boring matter of local government finance, is there much point in the tier system and its associated (and no doubt expensive) bureaucracy? <br><br>If people get what they can pay for, without subsidies from other areas, won't the zones arise naturally? The smallish cities will have the densest population and highest per capita wealth and so small scale electricity provision etc and fairly elaborate urban government and sophisticated culture will be practicable. The rich will have all the luxuries they want in their country seats and can dominate that fairly affluent area, which will be more sparsely provided with roads and luxuries and bureaucracy, but be closely linked economically to the city.More distant areas would be less involved in a cash economy unless able to produce food or materials for cheap water transport.

There might even be a frontier zone fading into wilderness where central control is more a matter of lines on a map and agreements with neighbouring states, than of effective bureaucratic control. <br><br>If they have lost the fossil fuel subsidy and undergone economic dislocation and isolation as well as destructive wars, the population should be much less than it is today and resources available for bureaucracy and social handouts much smaller. The desire of the central state for road networks could also be much less, as they still seem to have railways, canals and radio communication and could presumably have the equivalent of WW1 era aeroplanes. The rich could have the same, so there would be little need for good roads outside the cities.<br><br>It will be interesting to see whether Mr. Carr gets a jaunt in an aeroplane!<br><br><a href=#c8794219353546249324 title="comment permalink">11/12/15, 6:07 AM</a><br><br>

As for a reading list, I've mostly been following news stories -- if anyone's done a well-researched, non-polemic survey of the infrastructure crisis, I'd be grateful to hear of it. <br><br>Stuart, the neoliberals get voted in repeatedly because they keep the middle and upper middle classes comfortable, and as long as that happens, loudly public crocodile tears to the contrary, the latter don't actually care who or what gets thrown under the bus to make that happen. Once it's the middle and upper middle classes' turn to get thrown under the bus -- and a civil war does tend to do that -- the potential for dramatic change goes up in a hurry. <br><br>Ed, by "reinventing the wheel" I take it you mean "learning from history" -- and yes, of course I'm doing that. Thanks for the link! <br><br>Gavin, moral systems do indeed change, and the moral code that passed its pull date in the 1970s -- with its obsessive demonization of sexuality, and its equally obsessive hunt for allegedly less than human Others onto which its own unacknowledged desires could be projected -- is no exception to that rule. It replaced the very different medieval morality in the English-speaking world over the course of the seventeenth century, and is being replaced in its turn. It's no accident, I'd also suggest, that what you're calling "modern morality" started coming in right as the first wave of energy and resource shortages hit the industrial world; a strong case can be made that of the two, the older and more rigid code has higher maintenance costs -- after all, it emerged and flourished in an age of unparalleled expansion, and began to break down as soon as the expansion slowed and began to reverse. <br><br>Edgar, we'll get to that. Carr's got two schools to visit, one in Defiance County and one in Toledo, and you doubtless know how efficiently schools transmit colds, influenza, etc.!<br><br>Mikep, they were taken over by the next set of global hegemons, of course, as convenient vehicles for economic exploitation. In 2065 the World Bank is headquartered in Rio de Janiero and its president is Chinese. <br><br>MigrantWorker, since the benefits the Lakeland Republic gains from its policies are not paid for by costs being pushed off onto other nations, the same system could be adopted elsewhere without disadvantaging Lakeland at all. One of the points of the narrative, though it's one I haven't developed much yet, is that decoupling a nation from the global economy, though it requires the acceptance of certain limits, has massive positive benefits -- and it's a game that everyone can play. <br><br>Chloe, heh heh heh...<br><br>Leo, interesting to see the meme catching on. <br><br>Ceworthe, the major import I can see right off the bat is salvaged steel from disused skyscrapers -- the Lakeland Republic's already used most of its stock in the process of building its rail and streetcar systems. Since New York City and several other low-lying coastal cities are having to be abandoned to the rising oceans in 2065, the Atlantic Republic has that resource in abundance, and buyers for Mikkelson Manufacturing among others have got to be looking east with eager eyes.<br><br><a href=#c2534821504702851684 title="comment permalink">11/12/15, 7:06 AM</a><br><br>

The tier one that we’ll be seeing next time, as I recall only offers public police, fire, and emergency infrastructure and presumably military protection and is basically the tier at which people are experimenting with fully pre/post industrial levels of infrastructure. That seems about as minimalist as can get. Going lower than that, I imagine would dispose of taxation, law enforcement, and emergency infrastructure altogether, which seems like it would make those counties natural places for people who wanted to conduct their business away from the watchful eye of the law (be they organized criminals, or outside funded insurgent cells) to congregate. In the Restos’ proposed Tier Zero counties, how would that aspect of government be managed? I imagine a lot of that may wind up being answered when we see exactly what all is provided publicly and how it’s managed in a Tier One county coming up. I expect seeing how the military is governed and regulated may tie in as well, since a Tier Zero county could potentially do its policing with a locally funded, publicly regulated militia. I guess that raises its own questions about just how independent the counties in general are, and how laws and law enforcement are managed on a federal, versus county level.<br><br><a href=#c5213712740485055589 title="comment permalink">11/12/15, 8:58 AM</a><br><br>

The notion that it will be bureaucratic arises from your comment to someone in a previous week that there will be fines and enforcement preventing people from living in a cheaper area and freeloading on the facilities provided more expensively by a neighbour. That will require bureaucracy.<br><br>More generally, I don't see how this system will differ in results from what I suggest would arise naturally. If the people in a particular area can't afford something, they can't really expect to get much of it, whatever they vote for as they won't be able to raise enough taxes. A well maintained road network, policing or medical or sewage or water or gas or electricity system for instance, in a large, poor, sparsely populated area is scarcely feasible. <br><br>The crucial point seems to be prevention of subsidies such as the central government paying for them out of taxation on the whole country.(Were the central government to provide a fairly uniform level of services, it would be foolish for any locality to impose extra taxes on themselves by voting for anything above tier one.) What is the particular, (and popular if it has had to be voted for,) benefit of a legalistic-political-bureaucratic system; and how (and why)is it maintained if it differs from what would tend to happen anyway?<br><br><a href=#c1894678136019641054 title="comment permalink">11/12/15, 9:21 AM</a><br><br>

Yes at the examining chair so the TV is 12 inches or less from the patient's face. Fox News is often on or some insufferable daytime TV talk show or cooking show. I took our teens in for their dental cleaning and exam and this is what they reported to me. The hygienist says "you can change the channel and turn on whatever you like". Each child reached up and turned the TV off. The hygienist then starts questioning them on why they did that and don't they like TV. We are finding another dental practice. Clearly the TV is there for the staff's entertainment or distraction and I am paying them to do their job which is cleaning and checking our teeth. I feel like I need to put a letter together around this for the dentist.<br><br>Second television incident: We toured a shelter for homeless families in our local city, learning about the services provided and seeing how we could volunteer our time. We went through the entire facility which is a full city block. Not one single television anywhere. No screens, no blaring noise, no incessant blabbing. Our person leading the tour shared how the organization helps families develop routines and a new focus on their life.

However, the criteria for making distinctions vary between cultures in ways that cannot be predicted by energy availability alone. <br><br>Racism--classifying people according to their appearance and ancestry and making assumptions about them on that basis--needs to be distinguished from ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism is widespread and ancient. Racism is relatively recent. It goes back to the early modern period in Europe. The ancient Romans were very class conscious but not especially racist. They recruited generals and emperors from all over their territory, including North Africans who must have been brown skinned. <br><br>The ancient Greeks were sexist and ethnocentric but famously not homophobic; they thought it was normal for adults, especially men, to be bisexual. The Greeks and Romans practiced infanticide casually until Judeo-Christian morality was imposed upon them. These shifts in moral attitudes do not seem to be directly tied to the amount of net energy available. <br><br>We are in agreement that moral standards change over time in response to other developments. There are a lot of factors to consider and I don't think outcomes are necessarily predictable. For example, plantation slavery was widespread in the southern American colonies, declined in the Federalist period, and expanded again when the industrial revolution in the form of the cotton gin and mechanized looms made large scale cotton production for export profitable.<br><br><a href=#c3968856091082619401 title="comment permalink">11/12/15, 11:00 AM</a><br><br>

Still, we'll see. <br><br>Raven, the point that you're missing is that a relatively prosperous area could also choose to vote to stay at a lower tier in order to keep more of the proceeds of their own labor, and do other things with those that don't involve tax-funded infrastructure. The value of the tier system is precisely that it removes the pressure to absorb wealth in increasingly complex infrastructure and the governmental systems needed to run it. More on this as we proceed! <br><br>Shane, I'm sure you're quite right about that. I suspect you'll find Hicksville a very appealing little farm town, by the way. <br><br>Varun, among other things, yes. <br><br>Patricia, sure. Now imagine that you've just come through a brutal civil war, and the chickens, geese, cow pats, etc. are all signs that for the first time in a decade, you know you're going to have enough to eat. Attitudes can change very quickly in that context! <br><br>Denys, you've got smart kids, and they definitely deserve a better dentist. <br><br>Dan, exactly. I may have to reiterate that point in the context of morality sometime soon. <br><br>Stonecypher, there's essentially no homelessness in the Lakeland Republic, because (a) the policies already sketched out provide jobs -- including entry level, unskilled jobs -- for anybody who's willing to work, and (b) the direct and indirect government subsidies that keep real estate at unaffordable prices in today's United States don't exist in the Lakeland Republic, so housing is cheap. Solving homelessness by spending tax dollars on it is like putting a band-aid on a cancer -- you need to get rid of the perverse incentives that make jobs too scarce and housing too expensive, and the problem will take care of itself. <br><br>Tom, like most other nations, the Lakeland Republic has a governmental department responsible for assessing and collecting taxes, according to the laws enacted by the national legislature. Of course the rates have to be adjusted regularly and that's a matter for politics, which is always an inexact science. As for the play, no, I haven't heard of it. <br><br>Ed-M, why do you think they were subject to an embargo, three attempts at regime change, and an invasion? That was the global economy under new Sino-Brazilian management trying to bring them back into line.<br><br><a href=#c608927251664850797 title="comment permalink">11/12/15, 1:09 PM</a><br><br>

It's a very important detail, because judging by my own country's quite recent history, this whole historical-period based tier system would stand no chance of being accepted without massive rejection by the population.<br><br>Back in the 1980s, Nicolae Ceaușescu was paying off Romania's foreign debt by imposing strict austerity on the Romanian people. Personal cars? Colour TV? Flying? Spending the vacation in some foreign country? The vast majority of people could not even dream of these things.<br><br>But most importantly, Ceaușescu and the Communist Party elite were living in luxury, while preaching utopian socialist ideals of equality to a population deprived of oh-so-many things that they, themselves, were very happily indulging in. Not surprisingly, the winds of change from 1989 blew with hurricane speed in this country, and caused a lot of collateral damage. <br><br>That certain technologies are sustainable and others are not, I'm not going to argue. It's not what I'm arguing against. It's just that in the real world, the leaders of your Lakeland Republic, democratically elected or not, would most likely be using veepads and all those other gadgets that the population can't access. If it would be a democracy, they would probably have tokeep this a secret, because the vast majority of people do not like being deprived of what they consider necessary, no matter how unsustainable those things may be. <br><br>Meanwhile, in Cuba, probably the closest thing today to your fictional country: <br><br>https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xlp1/v/t1.0-9/12105724_1898053673752313_8727965997216081648_n.jpg?oh=3a20f8744a540c07e6847582f1569b1b&amp;oe=56C2686E<br><br>"In Cuba people still do not have internet on their mobile phones, but for six months the government has installed in public places some antennas that transmit WiFi signal (...)

She should have announced her not-comply intent during her campaign for county clerk - wonder if she would have been elected anyway. After all, the gay marriage law came about via Supreme Court fiat; I doubt whether it would have passed by national referendum. Just as an aside, I have no prob with ministers/clergy conducting gay marriages if that is their wont. I do have a prob with the State compelling non-elected clergy to conduct gay marriages if they harbor sincere spiritual convictions in opposition to such. Indeed, a case could be made that they are on firm spiritual ground, even if they are often unable to articulate it - sexual and life-force issues falling into the metaphysical category as they do. How would Lakeland deal with that, assuming not all clergy are on board with gay marriage?<br><br><a href=#c7636665051847713665 title="comment permalink">11/12/15, 2:32 PM</a><br><br>

It goes along nicely, side by side, with your current narrative. Also, several of your descriptions in it, of what to expect in the future, are already playing out in ways you predicted.<br><br>The book was published in 2008 and so, while I've been reading it, I have tried to remember what was going on then and in the months just after. When you wrote in the book about the dissolution of the US transportation network and that we may revert to rail for awhile I remembered that during the lows of the stock crash, late 2008 and early 2009, Warren Buffet bought - lock, stock and barrel - a railroad at bargain basement prices. (That railroad now transports oil from Canada. Though it spills a lot along the way. And the oil in Buffet's tanker cars is the oil that isn't flowing through the pipeline that never got built.)<br><br>At the time, Buffet visited the Whitehouse and made several public statements encouraging investors to pile back into the hallucination of the esoteric investment markets; reassure the masses to buy financial-ized products (Stay away from tangible assets. They're no good.) while he himself was making big plays in tangible assets such as the railroad. While publicly he's a big advocate of roller coaster, bubble market investing it made me wonder if, privately, he has a firm grasp of the future of peak oil. Buying a railroad suggests so. Maybe he reads John Michael Greer:) If railroads are obsolete, why buy one. If they are the future a decade or so from now... then what a timely moment to pile in. The old school billionaires riding along Hubbert's curve were once railroad barons on the way up and will be railroad barons again, on the way down; rolling up their sleeves to crack the whip as track is laid. <br><br>Moving on from Buffet, my thoughts went to other billionaires - many the new elite of the tech world - buying islands or big chunks of real estate over the last few years for compounds, for the express purpose of survival arks - loaded up with survival tech - their plans seem to be to shut themselves away with their toys.<br><br>New billionaires of the tech world still have their religion though. That they will conquer death. That massive supplies of cheap energy to fuel their robot armies is the next discovery just around the corner.<br><br>Which type is best suited for the long descent? <br><br>Thinking of the tech elite, I remembered an article, from that time, about a strawberry that had genes from salmon successfully spliced into it so that it was more frost tolerant, and I thought the next creation should be "sham" - a cross between a shrimp and a pig. Which is ocean dwelling but is better suited than shrimp to tolerate warming waters and the growing pollution. Which the sham feeds upon to create a succulent flesh suitable for any holiday feast. <br><br>The religion of progress is quite seductive, as many already know (who wouldn't want sham), but I think it existed before fossil fuels; it's just become frenetic since then. It is perhaps a fallacy embedded into the foundations of science. I suggest reading Lee Smolin's "Time Reborn." It is the dream to reach the eternal state that is immutable, unaffected by time. Oil has allowed us to pursue the un-pursuable, and to ravage the natural world in the process.<br><br><a href=#c4194977785911234066 title="comment permalink">11/12/15, 2:32 PM</a><br><br>

Not exactly 'brandy for the parson, baccy for the clerk, and watch the wall my darlings whilst the gentlemen go by', but smuggling (with its concomitant corruption) could be a major activity if the government tries to exclude such items or impose high tariffs on them. If it admits imports of non-green items made by slave labour in industrial sweatshops or robot factories, say from Tibet, using rare earths or doing the sort of thing that would not be allowed locally, hasn't it sold or off-shored its principles and its conscience, and admitted the thin end of the wedge?<br><br><a href=#c3982675869699369227 title="comment permalink">11/12/15, 2:40 PM</a><br><br>

Just because you don't like the answer doesn't mean that demanding a new one will get you one. <br><br>Ursachi, perhaps at some point you can go back and read the post and notice that <b><i>the tier system only determines what infrastructure is paid for out of local tax revenues</i></b>, and thus has nothing to do with your counterexample. Honestly, it's not that difficult of a concept -- and it fascinates me that otherwise intelligent people insist on misinterpreting it even when I point that out over, and over, and over, and over again!<br><br>Will, you know perfectly well that nobody's suggesting that clergy ought to be forced to perform gay marriages if that's against the teachings of their faith. The fact that so many people on the pseudo-Right keep on trotting out that meretricious straw man, as you just did, really does make me wonder if "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor" got left out of a whole bunch of Bibles.<br><br>Daergi, good. At the core of the religion of progress lies a whole series of mythic images that, to believers, embody such overwhelming emotional power that reasoned thought becomes impossible once they come up. As for the billionaires, elites do not generally survive the destruction of the system that supports them, especially when they're the ones that wreck the system in question. <br><br>Shane, America opposed free trade with all its force when Britain was benefiting from it and the US was on the losing end. The moment the US gained the capacity to use free trade as a wealth pump, US economists suddenly started singing the praises of free trade. I expect to see the same pattern repeat at least once as we slide down the Long Descent. <br><br>Raven, we'll be discussing that, too. There's a wider backstory to this narrative than you've seen yet. <br><br>Patricia, that's one set of possible explanations, yes. <br><br>Maureen, oh, there was much more going on. The post-US international order of 2065 is also less centralized, with two major powers (China and Brazil) and several other nations by no means satisfied with the sort of subordinate status they're assigned by the two great powers. <br><br>Rob, good. It's a complex demographic due to two wars, and also to the fact that the tax code (and welfare laws) don't subsidize childbearing. It's not overwhelmingly young, no.<br><br><a href=#c4946801588138806403 title="comment permalink">11/12/15, 9:42 PM</a><br><br>

It really is an excellent way to talk about other possible futures and choices. And, I'm totally amazed that even when you write things in clear and simple English that you still get push back.<br><br>If I may be so bold as to suggest something for your story - given the concept of tier 1 is a bit dear to my heart? You mentioned that you may sneak a solar PV panel into the story at some future point - depending on the level of push back you get from commenters.<br><br>Well, it occurs to me as a canny tier 1 resident that solar PV panels can be quite useful even after a good and solid artillery bombardment. You see a clever tier 1 resident could grab the remaining and very damaged solar PV panels and remove whatever salvageable individuals cells from a whole different collection of very damaged panels and create a new complete solar panel. You see each solar cell in a solar PV panel works separately from the rest - they're all just wired up in combinations of serial and parallel cells to get whatever voltage you want. If you didn't have to care about maximum efficiency and maximum output a canny tier 1 individual could solder up a whole lot of individual solar cells so that they had a solar panel that could be directly connected up to a battery (or batteries or even an appliance) at whatever DC voltage they required - Meaning you don't actually require high end battery charge controllers and can reduce the overall complexity of a system. That solar panel may not look pretty or may not be particularly weather resistant - but it would sure as heck work out of a lot of salvaged and damaged panels.<br><br>I gift that idea to you - free of charge. Plus I do hope that the tier 1 folk come across as highly crafty as people have so many preconceived narratives of what such places are like?<br><br>Now on an altogether different note, I had a very strange experience on Wednesday morning. I was stopped in my vehicle in a quiet inner city street by a van full of armed police. Me, being me, got out of the car without invitation and met them halfway to their vehicle so I could get a closer look at what was going on. They license checked me and checked the registration of the car and then alcohol tested me and then nothing. I had a few laughs with the policeman and the tension did seem to dissipate once he got my ID, but still the whole thing was weird.<br><br>PS: I now have some serious Internet/modem problems and it looks like my modem may be out of action so I'll have to cut our chat short... It would be nice if these things lasted longer than 2 years...<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: Before the modem blows up, I have a new blog entry up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Pump up the Jam</a>.

I have always also thought that without modern welfare and/or middle class parents, people will tend to focus on chastity in the female so as to avoid the huge burden of unwed motherhood upon the family.

The wind and the sea (or lake) are free. Harbours (except good natural ones), dredged channels, breakwaters, bulkheads, buoys, lights, and lighthouses are not. Currently that's all provided at a Federal level courtesy of the Army Corps of Engineers and the Coast Guard; and paid for from the Federal budget. Does Lakeland do the same?<br><br>Or do they revert to the local level? That is to say, waterfront improvements within a County are funded by local taxes at the County's tier? There's obviously feedback potential both ways. Lousy harbours and no aids to navigation will not attract shipping, revenues decline. Good harbours, nice lights, more attractive port, revenues rise. This is also connected with location, road, rail or canal connections and proximity to whatever goods are being shipped too. But most of this was worked out in the 19th century, so except for the ore and coal ports, which are played out by 2065, there will already be port towns at the appropriate places.<br><br>In the past, this was addressed at a local level by harbour dues charged. Local craft paid an annual fee, and vessels in transit charged a small sum in proportion to tonnage (freight capacity) per visit. Large infrastructure projects such as breakwaters and dredging of major channels was usually not feasible with this system; so historically such things have been funded at the Nation or State level. I could see Lakeland using this model, with contentious debates in the Legislature with different regions pushing their pet projects, and the Senate (assuming a bicameral system) balancing this against national needs.<br><br>Glenn<br><br>in the Bramblepatch<br>Marrowstone Island<br>Salish Sea<br>Cascadia<br><br><a href=#c170559165588481946 title="comment permalink">11/13/15, 10:27 AM</a><br><br>

To take your example: in most places in the US, the infrastructure to support electricity, telephone, cable and the internet is privately owned. If there’s any tax support, it comes in the form of tax preferences or laws allowing the infrastructure right-of-way, and many of the companies pay the municipality a pretty penny in “franchise fees.” There are currently several major lawsuits about the incumbent company, who built the forests of telephone and power poles, not wanting to lease space on them to upstarts - which they’re required to do by law in most places.<br><br>The Federal Government regulates who can use what radio frequencies, however the airwaves are not tax-supported infrastructure, they’re part of the way the universe works.<br><br>It might be helpful if we had a list of what’s tax-supported infrastructure in which tier. So far, we know that Tier 1 has 1830-style dirt roads and police services (the county sheriff). Presumably, it also has a county government to keep track of deeds and so forth, a court system and so on. We’ll presumably see what happens in municipalities: do they have cobblestones, or are they using the Roman road system?<br><br>Note: before it comes up, the problem with Roman style concrete is that it requires volcanic ash from a specific (or specific type of) volcano. Modern concrete chemists are pretty certain that they know how it works, they just don’t have the necessary amount of volcanic ash on hand.<br><br>In Tier 5, we’ve got 1950-style paved roads and, I presume, municipal water and sewer. Electricity is, I presume, private, as is the phone system. Daily mail delivery? A whole bunch of etceteras?<br><br>@August Johnson.<br><br>Amusingly, I had a discussion about that very subject last Sunday at church, but from a different direction: the guy thought that another ice age was coming.

With everyone facing hard times and resource limits, blitzkrieg-style mass mechanized attacks (including e.g. fleets of bombers) might no longer be a concern, at least from Lakeland's neighbors. That would help, since it's hard to imagine countering such a threat without either going higher tech, or spending massively on heavy armaments.<br><br>While shooting drones might be important (and fine sport), I'll be more interested in the rest of the defense-in-depth iceberg. I'm thinking of things like strong firing points built into ordinary structures, agricultural infrastructure (berms, hedgerows, ditches) that hinders vehicle travel over open land, "deniable" roads and bridges, militia practiced in defending their home towns from different directions (war games between neighboring districts, perhaps?), scorched-earth doctrine (maybe), and the like. <br><br>But the rock-paper-scissors nature of weaponry and strategy complicates everything. (Hence my Carr-ish concern.) If attack from the AR or CSA would take the form of elite forces in relatively small numbers using high technology, then marksmanship, prepared terrain, hacking/monkeywrenching, misdirection, and occupation resistance tactics will all be of more value than e.g. hardened machine gun emplacements that would just become fodder for laser guided rocket grenades. But if a different enemy (from a failed state to the west, perhaps) notices the lack of hardened machine gun emplacements, they might just send in waves of infantry.

And if so, are those considered part of the infrastructure that tiers regulate? In theory, Lakeland could have everything from one-room schoolhouses where students write on hand slates in lieu of most paper, to the kind of schools I went to with chemistry labs and marching bands and "audiovusual equipment" (film strip projectors!). And at the end of the term, all the students of a given grade/age from all the schools could take the same exams in the same subjects, because all of those trappings have never seemed to make much difference in how educated the students ended up.<br><br>That to me metaphorically sums up the whole tier system.

As it happens, I think I've figured out why people are going so far out of their way to misunderstand the tier system, and I may just do a post about that next week. <br><br>Cherokee, I may just do that. I'm planning on having windmills (yes, I know "wind turbines" is the usual phrase nowadays, but Lakeland is old-fashioned) and solar water heaters all over Defiance County, but the occasional salvaged PV system might also put in an appearance. As for the roadblock, fascinating. I wonder just what's being kept out of your news media...<br><br>Tidlösa, a very good point. BTW, the portrait isn't quite right; as noted in the story, President Meeker has dark brown skin -- that is to say, his ancestors came from Africa. <br><br>James, <b>Thank. You. For. Getting. It.</b><br><br>August, I've seen that same sort of thing way too often. I wonder if the people who do it realize that all they're doing is making the denialists look plausible. <br><br>RPC, it was indeed a courtesy call, since Carr is there to check the place out, not to carry out negotiations. As for your second question, stay tuned...<br><br>Will, you'll have to provide me with a link; the only case like that I've been able to find on the internet involved a couple who were fined for refusing to rent a venue to a same sex couple -- they would have faced exactly the same fine if they'd refused to rent to an interracial couple, an atheist couple, or a Muslim couple, since public-accommodation laws rightly prohibit discrimination in that context. If you can give me an example of of someone who was actually charged for refusing to perform a same-sex marriage, not for refusing to rent a venue, bake a cake, take a picture, cater a meal, or what have you, that's a different matter. <br><br>Onething, I'm far from sure it was as pragmatic as all that, not least because plenty of societies with no effective birth control have managed things in completely different ways. <br><br>Pygmycory, that's a different matter, of course. In the US, up until the middle of the 20th century, most counties had institutional frameworks in place to take care of those who couldn't take care of themselves; the county farm -- a big piece of real estate with residential care for the mentally ill, developmentally disabled, and others who couldn't take care of themselves, which not incidentally produced most of the food needed for the residents -- was a common institution all over rural America. (If you've heard old jokes about "the funny farm," that's what they were talking about.) A society with a lot of entry level jobs for unskilled labor can usually employ those with mild developmental disabilities, by the way. <br><br>There's a family story of mine that may be relevant here. One of my great-great-grandmothers had Downs' syndrome. That's a retrospective diagnosis, mind you; all that anybody knew at the time is that she had red hair, very short fingers, and never did learn how to read or write. She loved to cook and was extremely good at it, though, and loved children; by all accounts she had an unfailingly sweet disposition; and so my great-great-grandfather on that end of the family tree courted her, married her, and considered himself the luckiest man in that end of Washington Territory. My grandfather, who was a firefighter and far and away the best firehouse cook in Grays Harbor County, learned everything he knew about cooking from her, and always insisted that she was better than he was; he used to reminisce about her now and then. The point I hope this makes is that in a less technologically complex society, a lot of people who fall through the cracks in today's industrial society can find places where they're valued for what they can do, rather than being punished and despised for what they can't do.<br><br><a href=#c4709456377381237831 title="comment permalink">11/13/15, 4:06 PM</a><br><br>

(My source here is <b>Roman Aristocrats in Barbarian Gaul</b>, by Ralph Whitney Mathisen.)<br><br>@Odin's Raven: "There might even be a frontier zone fading into wilderness where central control is more a matter of lines on a map and agreements with neighboring states, than of effective bureaucratic control." I would be surprised if such a zone didn't spring up -- I've been reading <b>The Art of Not Being Governed</b> recently, which has altered my mind a bit. ;) I wonder if Greer might tell us how the Lakeland Republic interacts with such refugees from the state; does it try to bring them back into the fold? Hunt them down? (It might very well, if they became bandits preying upon local citizens.) Trade with them, as southeast Asian states did with hill people? <br><br>@mallow: It's fascinating how people can't see the infrastructure supports for so many things. I watch YouTube documentaries on climbing Mount Everest a lot. The documentaries emphasize the low oxygen and extreme cold of the Death Zone, and just how dangerous climbing Everest is.

The perils in question are mostly human in nature, though there might be extremely complicated ecological causes at their roots as well.<br> Yet again in this year of 2015, another hideous terrorist attack, unprecedented in its horror and scale on our soil, has stricken our nation right in its capital, Paris.<br>First of all I'd like to give some background of where we were when it happened... on a general background.<br>Like most other rich nations in the world, we were concerned with the usual suspects of global problems : climate disruption (with the COP21 summit...), mass migrations, economical decline...<br>The political scene was getting troubled lately : the two major parties seemed to be veering towards a union, left and right, against the threat of the mounting far right.<br>On the local level, I try to live in a very big city, where our biggest concerns have become to get healthy vegetables or food from the countryside and avoiding the overcrowded tourist packs in the city center.<br>This (big) city is rapidly gentrifying, due to soaring rent levels, but the poor areas are still populated by the poor during business hours, it's just that they have to come from increasingly far away in the outer suburbs.<br>The big plans of the elected left running the city are to make the city even bigger, and close it to cars. basically, raze a lot of old houses in the suburbs to make big public transportation works and chase all the cars away from downtown Paris.<br>At this point it remains an open question whether the hidden intents are to chase poor people even further away from the affluent city center, help Parisians get to know their suburbs more, or help the poor folks locked away from the center to get easier access to it.<br>Bad news from the economy has not faltered, public investments in infrastructure construction work is decreasing, threathening dozens of thousands of contract jobs...<br>Living inside Paris, even in somewhat poorer conditions, has become a privilege in posh areas.<br>Having a wage job is <br>Tough noone would have articulated it loudly, everybody in offices is trying to run the daily routine in the hope that enough hushing would tame the disastrous effects of IT offshoring, mergers on unequal footing against companies from other rival rich countries...<br>But the hidden undercurrents of human perceptions were not exactly channeling very bright perspectives.<br>Until tonight, that is, where the game has been raised to whole new stakes.<br>The cat is out of the bag now.<br><br><a href=#c8282972191085957029 title="comment permalink">11/13/15, 6:00 PM</a><br><br>

Still, the President had to be evacuated.<br>In the meantime, three horrible distinct street shootings took place against the customers of cafes in the popular evening area of the Eastern center in Paris.<br>But the worst was a hostage assault on the most popular concert venue downtown for young people, which lasted for two hours - a record time for an assault of our special forces who did a really quick job of getting ready for assault.<br>The total assessment is pretty gruesome : around forty people killed in the cafes and the stadium, but most horrific, as the special forces discovered, were around 80 people killed inside.<br>Plus all the other people who got wounded, and the psychological trauma to the witnesses... not saying to the entire nation, in our blessed age of information.<br>Then ensued the emergency speech and disaster visits of the President. Entire areas of the city center locked up by police... public transportation in large parts cut off.<br>All the media are talking about a situation of war, and about the emotion that all journalists and witnesses experience.<br>And behold, the President himself declared the state of emergency nationwide, and the closing of borders (!). Nationwide home raids are now allowed to be conducted at need.<br><br>France, as the night between November the 14th and the 15th of year 2015 comes to a close, has become a nation at war.<br>Even if the temporary chatter dies off in a few months, the hidden undercurrents of human perception have been irremediably changed.<br><br><br><a href=#c7851116481125186695 title="comment permalink">11/13/15, 6:01 PM</a><br><br>

And retreating to the countryside.<br>For the record, the downtown areas stricken were VERY close to the Charlie Hebdo offices, stage of the infamous Januray 7th of this year's attacks.<br>The population will have to choose, in terms of political solutions, between the fascism instituated by the current, undisputable government of national union, and the fascism promoted by the National Front.<br>The previously de facto, and soon to become official now after the attacks, government of national union is defending the interests of mostly big corporations and the financial rentier class.<br>The Front National features an almost-Communist plan of relocalisation of the economy, but their true intents when they come to power, when it comes to the economy, are probably on a par with their hateful take on immigration and reinstatement of the death penalty.<br>I am not sure that the notion of a political party will make much more sense from now on, it wasn't making sense already anyway.<br>I have no idea, and noone could bring themselves to phrase it out loud, how a certain religion will sort itself out. Not like some other monotheist religions don't have their own problems right now...<br><br>I am writing these comentaries on one of the few years we probably have with a somewhat free Internet.<br>I have no idea what will unfold from this mess. What will I be doing to make living in the coming years ? Executive ? A mix of craftswork and gardening / tending chickens ?<br>Earning a living as an office executive will probably make sense for quite a few more years, but given the current state of the economy, and how quickly or abruptly normalcy can be shattered, even the most diehard believers in te global economy, deep down, are extremely worried.<br><br>Update on the attack situation in France, part 4<br><br>Since a more constructive vision of the future is definitely in order right now, I am taking the liberty to publish my own translation into French of JMG's Retrotopia posts. It takes time, both to perform, and to make it known in France.<br>I would be very honoured, and very pleased, if some of the French, or French-speaking, Wizards hanging around this blog would share this translation with people who could enjoy it better in the language of Molière.<br><br>http://aip8.blogspot.com/2015/11/retrotopia-episode-1-john-michael-greer.html<br>http://aip8.blogspot.fr/2015/11/retrotopia-episode-2-john-michael-greer.html<br><br>The rest is on the way...<br><br>Best of luck, so foul a day I have not seen.

It's no accident, I'd also suggest, that what you're calling "modern morality" started coming in right as the first wave of energy and resource shortages hit the industrial world; a strong case can be made that of the two, the older and more rigid code has higher maintenance costs -- after all, it emerged and flourished in an age of unparalleled expansion, and began to break down as soon as the expansion slowed and began to reverse. </i><br><br>Based on the evolutionary biology discovered by the scientists who wrote <a href=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1974714W/The_beak_of_the_finch rel=nofollow>The Beak of the Finch</a>, and I think this applies to humans as well, the strict moral codes are one manifestation of hard times, while the more liberal codes arise when "the livin' is easy". The finches would breed promiscuously when the rains came and made the island green, but during the drought times, and it was the females driving this, they became very picky about their mates. The mate had to have exactly the correct beak shape for the type of drought-tolerant seed plant for that finch species. <br><br>Even though the first draft of shortage appeared in the '70s, it was very much peak time. We have arrived at a secondary peak now. I expect that as the sea of cheap energy dries up, people will adopt a much more, ahem, 'Amish' view to social relations.<br><br><a href=#c425633985219104487 title="comment permalink">11/14/15, 10:22 AM</a><br><br>

I would tend to agree with Jim R, hard times does seem to encourage populations to tighten their social morals. Abundant times allows people to loosen them. BUT from the reading so far, Lakelanders are not experiencing hard times. Advanced or complex technology, (or societal structuring) is quite separate from scarcity or abundance, fear and insecurity vs. security. Lakelanders are low tech but they are secure. Pre-Columbian, Native North American tribes had extremely egalitarian, democratic structures and they were as low-tech as it got! <br>Maybe we need to revisit history to see where/when/if very strictly conservative morals coincided with existential insecurity? They certainly coincided in the Medieval ages, and the Victorian, (a.k.a. Dickensian) age, regardless of societal and technological complexity. IMHO, That is happening right now as well. In terms of the story - I would expect Atlantic Republicans to be more socially conservative than Lakelanders as they're less secure, as we saw with the plastic bag carrying immigrants Carr meets on the train to LLR.<br><br>2) It may be only a matter of time, (decades yet?) for LLR to feel a real military threat from Sino-Brazil? (Unless Meeker is assassinated and replaced with a Sino-Braz - friendly puppet?) Bordered on the west by mountain rough-necks, then chaos in CA/west-coast, Atlantic Republic doesn't sound strong enough to be a real threat and with Carr there - we can see they are trying to form some sort of alliance anyway. What about their neighbors to the south? <br><br>re: the IMF: My understanding of how the IMF and Global Bank work is mostly from reading John Perkins's "Confessions Of An Economic Hit Man". A massive loan is foisted upon a poor but resource-rich smaller country, with a suitable bribe going to the president or dictator, the rest going to foreign, (USA /Western) corporate contractors to "build infrastructure". They build say, a factory for another USA/Western company and the infrastructure to serve it and it alone. Nothing goes to actual infrastructure for the people and it often destroys their water, land and ability to sustain themselves - (forcing them to seek slave-wage jobs in said factory). Then because the poor country has not actually gotten anything, it has not 'developed', it cannot pay back the loan and is forced to barter for a song or give away it's natural resources. If a duly elected president, like Meeker, consistently refuses this deal, (offered by the Economic Hit Men) he is assassinated (by the CIA Jackals) and replaced with a puppet who will. In the western media we simply hear of another despotic dictator being taken down or a coup in a chaotic 3rd world nation - #aren't we lucky we have Freedom? #nothing to see here, move along. Central and South America, Indonesia, Middle East, on and on and on. These loans, this hegemonic take-over is not offered to a resource poor country because there is nothing to , well, steal from them. What resource does LLR have that( presumably Sino-Brazilian) corporations want? Why is the IMF wolf at the door?<br><br>Thanks again.<br><br>Peace and good harvests to all of you. :)<br><br><a href=#c616830194192762024 title="comment permalink">11/14/15, 5:10 PM</a><br><br>

Let us take this to an admittedly ridiculous extreme. <br><br>The highlands of New Guinea harbor several cultures based on swidden agriculture, with yams as the primary crop. The women and children do most of the gardening while the men raise pigs and guard the village and fields (and their women) from raiders from other tribes. As part of the formation of the warrior culture the boys are taken from their mothers at about 8 and go to live in the men's house. They are considered to be female in essence since their bodies to this point have been nourished largely by mother's milk. To turn them into men they must spend the next several years ingesting male fluids--i.e. they are expected to fellate the adult men. Then they are initiated into adulthood and have their chance to nourish future men. <br><br>If I asserted that any culture that adopted semi-tropical slash and burn agriculture had to adopt this cultural pattern I would be considered a nut case. It is certainly possible that some future society would come up with something similar, just as slavery will be revived in some areas, feudalism in others, Senates and Doges, etc. But nothing about swidden agriculture or yams dictate the rites of passage for a society that practices it. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c1469691146021998253 title="comment permalink">11/14/15, 5:50 PM</a><br><br>

What a ghastly situation; I wish I could say that it was incomprehensible, or even surprising, but of course it's neither. The increasingly explosive mix of religious conflict, environmental breakdown, and volkerwanderung that's shaping the paired destinies of Europe and the Middle East has been pushing in this direction for rather a while now.

I hope somebody can think of a good site on which they can be posted -- I don't know much about French internet venues. <br><br>Pygmycory, the situation was very similar here in the US. The old county farms were abolished in the name of medicalizing the treatment of people with mental illnesses and developmental disabilities, who were then put into huge, expensive hospital facilities paid for by state governments. The Federal government then took over funding them as the US welfare state expanded. Then, in the Reagan era, there was a great outcry to get people out of institutions and into community treatment centers; the institutions had their budgets eliminated, but somehow the money for the community treatment centers never showed up, and so the mentally ill and developmentally disabled were dumped on the street, where they are today. The old county farm system would be a major step up at this point. <br><br>Maxine, unfortunately I have no control over Blogger's management of the website.

The people of the Lakeland Republic experienced it, and got to see the other side of it.

Rock climbing is still largely a subculture in the United States (a bit more widespread/recognized in Europe), and receives little support beyond access rights from government agencies. So local cooperatives have formed, climbers donate money, and dedicated members use that money to replace hardware (metal anchors and the like) on highly trafficked climbs to help keep conditions safer. Far too many people have died rappelling/lowering off of anchors that 'looked' good but were decades old and structurally rotten. It isn't a tax, it is all voluntary, but it promote the greater good within this specific community.<br><br><a href=#c1152151327079443418 title="comment permalink">11/14/15, 9:36 PM</a><br><br>

Recall the immigrant family on the train; they were looking forward to a much higher standard of living in the Lakeland Republic than they had in the Atlantic Republic. The problem here is that you, like Gavin, assume that fewer technological trinkets necessarily means that times are hard; au contraire, when people are secure in their homes and their possessions, know that they can count on three square meals a day and a steady job at a living wage, and feel that they have some control over their destinies and the hope of a good life for their children, a lack of video games and dancing Santa dolls isn't likely to leave them feeling horribly threatened and deprived. <br><br>More generally, analogies from nonhuman species do a very poor job of predicting human behavior, just as analogies from one species are by no means definitive in making sense of others. If you look at the history of human morals generally, you'll find that which behaviors are considered moral and which are considered immoral vary drastically, irrespective of such things as technological level, degree of food security, and the like. Economy is not destiny!<br><br>Brian, that's enough of a hot button issue that I'm probably going to be devoting a post to it shortly. The idea that you can pick and choose among technologies, and embrace those of an older time if you don't happen to like the ones currently on offer, is blasphemy in the eyes of the religion of progress, and it elicits some remarkably irrational behaviors from the faithful. <br><br>Shane, that's a valid question, and I'll consider weaving it in. <br><br>Daergi, good.

However, “pre-modern” (note the modern-centric term!) societies were incredibly diverse. <br><br>Many people do indeed believe that “economy is destiny” since the modern society is dependent on a certain kind of economic structure to survive, usually a form of capitalism, and (of course) a certain kind of technology. Since the economy is global, nations trying to stay out of the system will be forced back into the fold (sometimes through sheer economic necessity), making it “obvious” that “the economic base controls the superstructure”. However, the diversity of “pre-modern” cultures seems to suggest the opposite: different “superstructures” are compatible with the same economic base, making politics or culture more important than economy.<br><br>I find this fascinating. While it may be difficult to change an already established pre-modern culture (if it works, people will rather stay with it), it seems that the “founders” of a pre-modern society have a wider range of options available to chose from than us moderns! Our modern culture is so dependent on its economic and physical infrastructure that we are simply dragged along with it, upwards (in the best of cases) or, ahem, downwards… <br><br>This may explain, for instance, why women´s equality is won under similar circumstances in all modern cultures (labor shortages and/or the expansion of a service sector being important factors), while pre-modern cultures have vastly different gender roles which cannot be predicted in advance based on their way of subsistence. Anthropologists used to believe that horticultural societies were often “matriarchal” while pastoralists were always “patriarchal”, but this doesn´t seem to be correct – diversity is much broader! <br><br>Disclaimer: I´m not saying that women´s rights were won without a fight – my point is that certain conditions in society made it easier for the powers-that-be to eventually concede women´s rights (or for women to get organized at all).<br><br>A propos New Guinea, Margaret Mead´s classic “Sex and Temperament” covers three vastly different New Guinean societies. The book is controversial, due to its description of a “matriarchal” society, but I think it proves the point under debate here: there is no necessary correlation between mode of subsistence, level of aggression and gender roles. <br><br>OK, hope this wasn´t too theoretical… ;-) <br><br>As for France, I don´t want to start a controversy here, but I believe now is the time for the Western powers and Russia to finally get together and negotiate (and enforce!) a settlement in Syria. As for the “Islamic” State, I´m still waiting for the next moonless night in Raqqa… <br><br><br><a href=#c4320506469581015040 title="comment permalink">11/15/15, 4:35 AM</a><br><br>

I have faint memories of a time when the idea of Chinese supremacy sounded like science fiction (one billion Chinese were still riding those accursed bicycles!) and people smirked when Brazil demanded a permanent seat on the UN Security Council (Brazil was Copacabana, poor Black street kids and the accursed carnival). <br><br>Circa 2000, the BBC showed a "how will the future look like” documentary, set around 2030. Russia and the EU were on the verge of a war over oil resources in the Arctic, Europe built super-large fences to keep out migrants coming over the Mediterranean, and (wait for it) the United States had a Hispanic president who railed against how America was oppressed by the imperialists! As one of the fake “talking heads” on the show expressed it: “America is the only first world nation that thinks like a third world nation”. This still sounds science fiction today, but with the American debt crisis, Chinese hegemony and a rising Hispanic population, who knows?<br><br>Also, every time I watch bad TV shows about “doomsday preppers” and similar people, I get the feeling that these guys sounded *completely nuts* just 15 years ago, but now… They will become main stream in the near future! <br><br>I like the Lakeland global narrative, since it contains both items that probably have been discussed among the cognoscenti for a long time (the China-Brazil thing but also the decline of Russia, usually connected to its low birth rate) and other options that sounded very speculative until recently (I won´t mention which ones – too hot!) or still sound “out there”, such as America splitting into a dozen different warring states.

The warnings about nuclear facilities turned out to be true.

Since then, hidden poverty in Japan has become an issue, that people here are, in fact, aware of.<br>Regarding America, 9/11 came across to me as a shock, but not a paradigm changer.

It also relates to differences between 'Retrotopia' -- and why it's a refreshing world to visit -- vs. some alternatives.<br><br>I just finished reading Paolo Bacigalupi's "The Water Knife". I can say without reservation that it's an impressive piece of fiction in the post-oil / climate change genre. I don't necessarily recommend it. It's a deeply troubling extrapolation of trends that we're living through now. That's exactly what it was meant to be, but it's not for the faint of heart. Definitely not a book for the YA audience. <br><br>'The Water Knife' takes on directly a period that 'Retrotopia' mercifully passes over: the near-term collapse period and how the collapse of the US might unfold. What makes the story so horrifying is that it's so credible. It's well-rooted in the history of water rights in the Southwest and the building of 'The Cadillac Desert'. As I read it, I found myself reluctantly agreeing that, yes, this is how it could happen. What it might look like. <br><br>Bacigalupi's story has believable characters, behaving in ways that real people do behave, when circumstances dictate. The book is emphatically not about 'good guys' vs. 'bad guys'. It shares that insight with JMG's writings and world view. The only real villain is our collective stupidity in living in denial and failing to act on issues that should be obvious. Feeling powerless, we carry on, pretending that everything will somehow work out.

Part One of Sir Andrew Davis's interpretation is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHS7MwAjN-E (an upload of 2011-10-31, under username "Don Goncau"). Part Two is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU8Oz6nGTZA (likewise an upload of 2011-10-31, likewise under username "Don Goncau"). <br><br>The climactic fortissimo, at which Gerontius has a momentary glance of the Godhead before pleading to be healed in Purgatory, comes some seconds after 00:47:00 of Part Two.<br><br>In considering Paris, it is necessary to consider not the victims alone but additionally the perpetrators. The depth of turmoil (the despair? the rage?) that led them to commit their crimes at first defies comprehension. One is tempted to think (now, again, as in 1917 Petrograd or 1933 Berlin) <i>Well, this does not from a standpoint of ordinary human psychology make sense.</i> And yet it in the end must make sense. Most human things have, in the end, an explanation which is banal and shallow. We may some day, discovering the explanation, find the criminality pitiful. <br><br><br>Tom <br><br>near Toronto<br><br><br><a href=#c3064653407487356644 title="comment permalink">11/15/15, 9:14 PM</a><br><br>

It is true that the Tanakh* contains rules about how household slaves should be treated but takes the institution itself for granted.<br><br>On the other hand there is the second book of the Bible, Exodus. This book is about how the Israelites were once a free people, were enslaved by a Pharaoh, suffered terribly and were oppressed, and were liberated by the hand of God under the leadership of Moses, Aaron and Miriam. You can't teach even a redacted version of what Protestants call the Old Testament without teaching Exodus because the book culminates with the giving of the Ten Commandments. Enslaved blacks took hope and inspiration from the Book of Exodus ("going out"). Negro spirituals and the code words for the Underground Railroad contain references from Exodus. It's no accident that Harriet Tubman was called Moses.<br><br>The Jewish holiday of Passover is about the Exodus story. Throughout most of the twentieth century, political alliances between African-Americans and Jews were partly based on an understanding of a common history, even though for the African-Americans slavery was a recent memory and for the Jews a distant one. <br><br>There is a certain thread of Christian apologetics which paints the Tanakh as oppressive in its message and the New Testament as liberating. IMO, it takes a highly selective reading of both collections to support that thesis.<br><br>*Or as English-speaking Jews call it, "the Bible". Tanakh is an acronym of the initial letters of the Hebrew words meaning "Law", "Prophets" and "Writings". Those are the titles of the three sections in which the books are arranged in Jewish Bibles.

Voluntary financing of projects for public benefit is a very old custom -- that used to be what corporations were for, and we'll be seeing one of those in action as things proceed -- and of course a trip to a tier one county is coming up shortly. I doubt that will stop the misunderstandings, though; this whole business is becoming increasingly reminiscent of some of the other times when I've touched on a modern taboo. More on this in this week's post! <br><br>Patricia, thank you. It's among the reasons I have trouble buying into some aspects of today's culture of contempt for those who are mentally and developmentally different from the norm. <br><br>Tidlösa, exactly. The mythology of progress, with its insistence that every other form of human society is a station on a linear route that leads to us, and through us to the stars, draws a great deal of its plausibility from the fact that if you live in a society dominated by modern industrial technology, you really don't have many choices -- you have to adapt your life to the machine. <br><br>WLB, nah, talking about the construction of a narrative in a post that's part of that narrative is always on topic. I don't invent my character names consciously -- I listen for them, and am routinely surprised by the names, and the characters, that turn up. Those of my readers who followed <i>Star's Reach</i> while it was a blog may be interested to know that I had no idea who Plummer was when he turned up -- he was as much of a surprise to me as he was to Trey and Berry! In the same way, the characters in this narrative are simply the people who come strolling into the story from the recesses of my unconscious mind, with names attached. <br><br>Margfh, we'll see some of that shortly, and more as things proceed. <br><br>Aron, the Lakeland Republic doesn't restrict distillation, brewing, etc. -- I think we'll see a small distillery in Hicksville, and I know Carr is going to have an encounter with Kentucky moonshine at the drone shoot. As for other vices, hmm. Yes, that does have to be addressed, doesn't it? <br><br>Patricia, thanks for the explanation!<br><br>Roger, one of the reasons I haven't yet made time to read Bagucigalpi's fiction is that I've heard from a lot of people that a lot of it is harrowing stuff. I get enough of that on the news, thank you. <br><br>Shane, my experience with the midwest is that it has very large nonwhite populations, and not just in the biggest cities. That's what's guiding the demographics of my story. <br><br>Scotlyn, if I must. All I said was that since the older morality came in with the first period of industrial economic expansion and went out with our first brush with the limits to growth, it was dubious logic to claim that our post-1970s morality was the product of prosperity and would be replaced by a return to that older morality. Bruno insisted on reading this as me saying that morality depends on economics, and demanded that I justify a claim I didn't make. Simplistic theories that make moral codes a function of some external factor such as economic prosperity or the reverse do not hold up in the light of history. That's what I'm saying. It's rather tiring to use no stronger word, to have people respond to that by insisting that I must be making exactly such a theory, and demanding that I justify it!<br><br><a href=#c5690845118873339392 title="comment permalink">11/16/15, 9:58 PM</a><br><br>

Most of us now understand you to have meant "the percentage of tax revenue spent on infrastructure at that time," but as has been pointed out, there is significant conflation by many people of "infrastructure" with "technology." There's also the problem of people equating "not subsidized" with "can't have." The two ideas are clearly not the same. Combine that with the difficulty determining what infrastructure is paid for by the state and what is privately owned *today* and it can be difficult to separate the two.<br><br>If the tier system is only about the amount of tax money spent, and not the type of infrastructure available, we might well see counties at the same tier that have chosen to prioritize entirely different types of infrastructure.

Most of the "subsidized parenting" we get in the US is in the form of tax credits and deductions on personal income. Income in LR is not taxed, and I suspect most residents of LR find it easier to support themselves *and their families* on what they earn than many of us do now. I expect the stigma currently associated with children remaining in their parents' house well into adulthood will be gone, so there will probably be many more multigenerational households, with the accompanying live-in childcare, etc. It's also possible that families with young children might choose to live in lower tier counties, making it easier for the family to live comfortably on a single income, and allowing one parent to stay home.<br><br>This also applies to care for the disabled. Multigenerational households would allow the grandparents to care for their grandchildren, and in turn for their children to care for them as they age.<br><br>The ability to earn a living *at home* will be what allows families in LR to afford children, eldercare, and care for those disabled enough to need constant support. I would expect that Cottage Industry will again be a viable livelihood in LR, rather than the supplemental income such activities tend to produce today. People in LR will still want baskets, sweaters, scarves, socks, etc. All those small items that are made in factories today, on automated equipment, can easily be made at home with manual labor, or small manually operated machines. Even a single parent can afford to raise a child if work can be done from home, and childcare doesn't have to be found.<br><br><a href=#c4890470270090760146 title="comment permalink">11/17/15, 4:40 AM</a><br><br>

We all in Britain in effect live in large cities, even if our postal address might be in some countryside. Our city life is situated in a rather small and very inadequate cultivable area. We rely on fossil fuels, trading and wider food-producing areas, but so do all urban areas these days.<br><br>Our post-WWII immigrants were from ex-Empire, Black Caribbean and then much more noticeably, Indian sub-continent. This immigration from mostly non-industrial areas followed previous flows to urban areas. (We did not suffer the huge relocations seen in Germany and E/C Europe and Balkans - refugees/'ethnic cleansing' and etc.)<br><br>The next big happening is 21st C - see below - EU enlargement, 'open borders' within EU (imitating USA?). Refugees from war zones are important but the numbers are yet relatively small.<br><br>I witnessed the end of most British working class industrial employment as we transitioned from coal to petroleum and natural gas and out-sourcing. This resulted in a social catastrophe, but not in terms of minimum living standards; see my list above. These latter have improved with modernisation. I witnessed 'old' poverty and its consequences for example in Glasgow and other parts of Scotland in the 1970s. The area in England with fewest migrants is NE England where I live now, but this de-industrialised area has worst prospects for youth unemployment. We have 'modernised' poverty! (A small note: farming employment round where I live is perhaps less than 5% that of the agrarian past, and I have witnessed a modern reduction of more than 60% in the last 30 years.) <br><br>Scotland?

If so, then there would be very little unemployment, if at all and no great disparity between the richest and poorest, and even the poorest would be rather well-off. That is what has happened historically whenever such systems have been implemented.<br>Therefore, in the tier system, some people will choose to keep services, even if it means higher taxes.<br>Case in point, in 2011, Mayor Ford (before he became the embarrassing staple laughing stock of late-night comedy TV) pretty much represented the TEA Party attitude of suburbans who felt neglected and overtaxed and under-serviced and resented the appearance that the downtown core was getting all the services. He promised to end the 'gravy train' at city hall of overpaid unionised civil servants, to lower taxes, &amp;c. He hired KPMG to produce a report to show that he could save much tax money by eliminating a large number of unnecessary departments, offices, and services. Apparently his solemn vow not to cut services wasn't as solemn or important as his vow to cut taxes. <br>The citizenry reacted. <br>Despite being airily dismissed as 'a handful of professional protesters and activists' thousands of people turned up to make representations at the various hearings. Meetings lasted for 18 and 20 hours at a time. The overwhelming support was to keep services, even if it meant higher taxes. Services such as the Riverdale Petting Zoo, the urban forestry department, and community recreation centres and swimming pools. In the end, the services were kept, and voter turnout in the next election was up 15%.<br>The whole question revolved around what, exactly, are the services we need or want and the stark conclusion was that, the bulk of services we demand as a city are in direct proportion to the inability of poorer people to pay for their own services. It also touched off a discussion on what is the function of government, what services should be provided, which are absolutely necessary, and so forth.<br>Your Tier 1 counties are not necessarily mired in poverty, they simply decided they do not need, say, a civic recreation centre, but rather those who wish to spend time swimming become paying members at a private health club, whereas Tier 5 provides public pools and gymnasiums and recreation centres for free. Tier 1 only maintains gravel roads, whereas by Tier 3, the roads are paved with asphalt. Tier 1 has private vehicles, but they pay higher maintenance costs because the roads are rougher. There are plenty of places that still have unpaved roads in Ontario, I can assure you, and the people drive trucks and SUVs with good reason. I suspect when gas becomes very expensive, many will start to drive horse-drawn buggies again.<br>Of course, all that assumes that people can afford to choose, which is what all the discussion in Toronto was about in 2011: there are a lot of voters who cannot afford to be members in private clubs, whereas most of those hoping for lower taxes can. Again, if the economy is set up along Georgist lines, where resources are taxed but not income, distribution of access to resources becomes widespread and even the majority of poorest people become wealthy enough to choose.<br>I submit LP probably uses something as simple as photo ID presented at the desk of the library in a Tier 5 county to determine that someone from Tier 1 needs to pay a fee to get in. But anyone from Tier 1 can afford to (because of the savings in lower taxes).<br><br><a href=#c8167771763970579355 title="comment permalink">11/17/15, 7:26 PM</a><br><br>

Another way to say the same thing is that if you've learned only one way to make the world make sense to you, you'll react viscerally against anything that threatens to take that away from you. <br><br>Alison, good. In point of fact, that's beginning to happen in the Lakeland Republic, as we'll see shortly. As for care for the disabled and so on, exactly. <br><br>Bruno, thank you. <br><br>Phil, interesting. A very different situation from the one on this side of the pond. <br><br>Ursachi, okay, let me get this straight. Referring to a year, even if it's just as a convenient way to sketch out the level of infrastructure in a given tier, is so horribly traumatic that it will cause people all over Romania not to notice that they're being given the right to choose the infrastructure their local tax revenues will pay for, and it's so shocking to you personally that you keep on insisting that it must amount to some kind of Stalinist scheme? Fascinating. Oh, and it's not a matter of districts inside a county, as I've noted over, and over, and over again. Are you sure you actually understand what I've been saying? <br><br>Patricia, interesting. I'm glad you liked the story!<br><br>Shane, also interesting. It's always possible that you and I have visited different parts of the Midwest, of course -- and I don't claim to have been to more than a few places there, for that matter. <br><br>Martin, the tiers aren't self-contained, they just differ -- ahem -- in what infrastructure the taxpayers are willing to pay for. In the event that a road runs right down the line between one county and another, and they're in different tiers, the county governments would doubtless have to work something out -- and it's not impossible that if there's a quarrel between obstreporous county councillors, a road here or there might end up paved on one side and dirt on the other. <br><br>Renaissance, good. One of the differences between 2065 and today is that petroleum is very scarce; internal combustion engines generally run on vegetable oil using diesel engines, and fuel is far from cheap. That's an important reason why horsedrawn transport has become common again across the Lakeland Republic -- horses can be fueled on grass, hay, and oats, which are much cheaper than vegetable oil, and their waste output can be sold, where the waste output of cars is subject to tailpipe taxes that aren't cheap.<br><br><a href=#c460401987584859089 title="comment permalink">11/17/15, 10:03 PM</a><br><br>

Our tiers are based on population density, resident wealth and ethnicity, and we don't necessarily get what we pay for, but there are definitely different levels of taxation and service. Gentrification is an example of turning a low service tier area into a higher-service tier area.<br><br>The bit about the road paving reminded me of a story. In 1965, when my folks moved us from Long Island NY to rural Maryland, my parents were aghast that we had to drive on so many loose gravel roads until we got to the paved county roads. But they were perplexed that there were no lines on the county roads. It turned out that every year, the contract to repave the roads was carried out about three months after the contract to paint the lines, so for nine months a year there were no lines on the roads. None of the locals saw this as a big deal.<br><br><a href=#c1175301299939109727 title="comment permalink">11/18/15, 6:40 AM</a><br><br>

I lived in Northeastern Minnesota (Iron Range) for 10 years and traveled quite a bit through Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. My experiences were quite similar to Shane's. The larger the city tended to result in having more diversity. <br><br>Having lived in Texas the first 17 years of my life, I experienced much more cultural and ethnic diversity than I ever experienced in Northeastern Minnesota and subsequent travels in the upper, Western Midwest. <br><br>There were many who relocated into Northeastern Minnesota though who had previously lived in Chicago, Indiana, and Ohio. They largely represented the class of people commonly referred to as "white flight," having quite a prejudiced view towards the people they left behind as the source of all their problems in those areas. So connecting the dots, I'd venture to say that there is quite a bit more diversity in Midwest regions of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and the lower peninsula of Michigan, with less diversity in most of Wisconsin, the UP of Michigan, and Minnesota. <br><br>I don't know that if these assumptions were accurate, that it will would really change the story much as thus far, the story has entirely taken place within the state of Ohio, but should it expand to include the areas mentioned above, I'd definitely consider the experiences of others familiar with those areas.<br><br><a href=#c4264839435048391789 title="comment permalink">11/18/15, 9:16 AM</a><br><br>

This may come as a surprise to most people: how temporary and temporily tenuous the thread of culture is, whose continuence we take for granted. we are accustomed to thinking that if it is digitally archived on Google (we've got technology dude!) culture is permanent. It is not so. Just think, how much of the ancent classical world has been preserved? We are accustomed to thinking that all is safe.

Hardly a complete world.
