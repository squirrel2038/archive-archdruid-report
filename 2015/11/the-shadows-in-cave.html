I had intended this week’s post to be the next episode in the Retrotopia narrative, chronicling Peter Carr’s meeting with the irrepressible Col. Tom Pappas of the Lakeland Republic Army, and the trip out to Defiance County for the annual drone shoot, but that will have to wait another week. No, I haven’t decided to comment instead on the recent spate of terror attacks in France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As people in a variety of other corners of the world have pointed out, identical outrages happen all over the Third World every few days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The only reason this latest horror has gotten so much air time is that it affected people in one of the world’s privileged countries instead. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nor am I going to be devoting this week’s post to the latest, extremely troubling round of news from the climate change front—though that’s going to get a post to itself down the road a bit, when I’ve had time to do a little more research. That’s a far bigger story than the terror attacks in Paris, though of course it’s not getting anything like as much attention in the media.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From the beginning of serious salt water infiltration into South Florida’s aquifers, through ominously bulging sediments in Arctic Ocean shallows, to an assortment of truly frightening data points from Greenland, it’s clear that we’ve passed the threshold from “something may happen someday” to “something is happening now”—a transition that probably has quite a bit to do with the increasingly shrill tone of climate-change denialist rhetoric just now, and even more to do with the increasingly plaintive tone of those activists who still insist that everything can be fixed if we all just join hands and sing “Kum ba ya” one more time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No, this week’s post is going to explore a topic that’s far less important in the overall scheme of things, though it’s not without its relevance to the crisis of our age. I want to talk about the reaction I fielded in response to last week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, which was an exploration of our culture’s taboo against <a href=../../2015/11/the-heresy-of-technological-choice.html>choosing not to use the latest technologies</a>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I expected that post to field its share of outraged denunciations, and it certainly did. What I didn’t expect was that it would receive more comments than any other post in the history of <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, and the vast majority of those comments would agree heartily with the two points of that post. The first of these points is that there’s a significant number of Americans out there who, for one good reason or another, choose not to use cell phones, televisions, automobiles, microwave ovens, and an assortment of other currently fashionable technologies. The second is that there’s an even larger number of Americans out there who get really, really freaky about people who make such choices. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Some of the stories I heard from readers of my blog were absolute classics of the type. There was the couple who don’t enjoy television and so don’t own one, and had a relative ask them every single year, over and over again, if she could buy them a television for Christmas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They said no thank you every single year, and finally she went out and bought them a television anyway because she just couldn’t stand the thought that they weren’t watching one. There was the coworker who plopped a laptop playing some sitcom or other right down on the lap of one of my readers and demanded that the reader watch it, right then and there, so that they would have something to talk about. There was the person who, offended by another reader’s lack of interest in television, finally shouted, “You must be living in a dream world!” Er, which of these people was spending four to six hours a day watching paid actors playing imaginary characters act out fictional events in contrived settings? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Televisions were far from the only focus of this sort of technobullying. Other readers reported getting similar reactions from other people because they didn’t happen to have, and weren’t interested in having, microwave ovens, smartphones, and so on down the list of currently fashionable trinkets. The stories are really quite eye-opening, and not in a good way. Forget about all the popular cant that insists that you’re free in the USA to make your own choices and have whatever lifestyle you want.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>According to a significant fraction of Americans—and to judge from what my readers reported, that fraction isn’t limited to any one class, income level, or region of the country—the only freedom you’re supposed to exercise, when it comes to technology, is that of choosing which brand label will be slapped on each item in the officially approved list of devices you’re expected to own. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The prevalence of technobullying and technoshaming in today’s America is a fascinating point, and one we’ll explore in a few moments, with the able assistance of the denunciations flung at last week’s post by the minority of readers who reacted that way. What I want to consider first is the fact that so many people responded to last week’s post so positively. One blog in an uncrowded corner of the internet, written by an author whose day job as an archdruid locates him squarely on the outer fringes of contemporary American life, is very nearly the opposite of a statistically valid poll. Still, the sheer volume of the response makes me suspect that something significant is going on here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By that I don’t mean that there’s some sort of groundswell of renunciation, leading people to walk away from technologies in the same spirit that led medieval ascetics to don hair shirts and flog themselves for the good of their souls. That’s one of the common stereotypes directed at those of us who aren’t interested in the latest technotrash, and it completely misses what’s actually going on. I’ll use myself as an example here. I don’t own a television—I haven’t owned one in my adult life—and it’s not because I have some moral or political objection to televisions, or because I’m into self-denial, or what have you. I don’t own a television because I find watching television about as enticing as eating a bowl of warm snot. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s not the programming, either—that’s another of the standard stereotypes, that the only thing one can find objectionable about television is the programming, and it’s as inaccurate as the rest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To me, quite simply, the activity of watching little colored shapes jerk around on a screen is boring and irritating, not relaxing and enjoyable, no matter what the little colored shapes are supposed to be doing. Yes, I grew up with a television in the house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I experienced plenty of it back in the day, and I have zero interest in experiencing any more, because I don’t like it. It really is that simple. It’s that simple for others as well: they don’t find this or that technology enjoyable, useful, or relevant to their lifestyles, and so they’ve chosen to do something else with their money and time. Shouldn’t so simple and personal a choice be their own business, and nobody else’s? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To judge by the reactions that those who make such choices routinely field, apparently not. The pushbacks discussed in the comments page last week range from the sort of in-your-face confrontations discussed above to a much-forwarded article in I forget which online rag, where somebody was airily announcing that he wasn’t interested in being friends with somebody unless he could text some vacuous comment about lunch to the other person at 2:15 and get a response by 2:30. (My readers and I are good with that—somebody who insists on getting immediate feedback for their random outbursts of mental flatulence isn’t somebody we want as a friend, either.) Then there were the indignant responses to last week’s post, which belong in a category by themselves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m sorry to say that my favorite diatribe didn’t show up in the comment queue for <i>The Archdruid Report</i>. It appeared instead on one of the many other websites that carry my weekly posts, and it insisted, among several other less juicy bits, that my lack of enthusiasm for television obviously meant that I was conspiring to deprive everyone else of their teevees. You’ve got to admit that for sheer giddy delirium, that one’s hard to beat. By the same logic, if I dislike peanuts—as in fact I do—I must be committed to some kind of anti-peanut crusade devoted to eradicating the entire species. Not so;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Arachis hypogaea</i>
is welcome to live and thrive, for all I care, and my fellow hominids are equally welcome to eat as much of its produce as they happen to desire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In fact, they can divide my share among them. The only thing I ask in return is that nobody expect me to eat the things myself. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same rule applies equally to television, as it does to a great many other things. Like most human beings, I enjoy some things and don’t enjoy others, and in the vast majority of these cases, nobody feels particularly threatened by the fact that I don’t like something they do, and avoid it for that sensible reason. For this one commenter, at least, that obviously wasn’t the case, and it’s worth reflecting on the vast personal insecurities that must have driven such a bizarre reaction. Still, that was one of a kind, so we’ll pass on to the others. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A theme that showed up rather more often in the hate mail responding to last week’s post was the insistence that if I don’t have a television, a microwave, or a cell phone, I’m a hypocrite if I have an internet connection. I encourage my readers to think about that claim for a moment. I suppose a case could be made that if my lack of interest in having a television, a microwave, or a cell phone was motivated by the kind of passion for hair-shirt asceticism mentioned above, and I had an internet connection, I could be accused of the kind of slacking that used to get you thrown out of the really top-notch hermitages. From any other perspective, it’s a triumph of absurdity. If people are in fact allowed to choose, from among the currently available technologies, those that make them happiest—as the cheerleaders of the consumer economy delight to insist—what could possibly be wrong with choosing some old technologies and some newer ones, if that’s the mix you prefer? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then there are the people whose response to the technology of an older time is to yammer endlessly about whatever bad things happened in those days, even when the bad things in question had nothing to do with the technology and vice versa. People like the couple I discussed in last week’s post, who prefer Victorian furnishings and clothing to their modern equivalents, get this sort of bizarre non sequitur all the time, but variants of it turned up in my inbox last week as well. Here again, there’s some heavy-duty illogic involved. If a technology that was invented and used in the 1850s, say, is permanently tarred with the various social evils of that era, and ought to be rejected because those evils happened, wouldn’t that also mean that the internet is just as indelibly tarred with the social evils of the modern era, and ought to be discarded because bad things are happening in the world today? What’s sauce for the goose, after all, is sauce for the gander...</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finally, there’s the capstone of the whole edifice of unreason, the insistence that anybody who doesn’t use the latest, hottest technotrash wants to go “back to the caves,” or to even take all of humanity to that much-denounced destination. “The caves” have a bizarre gravitational effect on the imagination of a certain class of modern thinkers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Everything that’s not part of the latest assortment of glitzy technogimmicks, in their minds, somehow morphs into the bearskin kilts and wooden clubs that so many of us still, despite well over a century of detailed archeological evidence, insist on pushing onto our prehistoric ancestors. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When people of this kind archly dismiss people like the Chrismans, the neo-Victorian couple just mentioned, as going “back to the caves,” they’re engaged in a very interesting kind of absurdity. Do cavemen and Victorians belong on the same level? Sure, cavemen had flush toilets and central heating, daily newspapers and public libraries, not to mention factories, railways, global maritime trade, a telegraph network covering much of the planet’s land surface, and a great deal more of the same kind! That’s absurd, of course. It’s even more absurd to insist that people who simply don’t enjoy using this or that technology, and so don’t use it, are going back to “the caves”—but I can promise you, dear reader, from my own personal experience, that if you show a lack of interest in any piece of fashionable technology, you’ll have this phrase thrown at you. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That happens because “the caves” aren’t real. They aren’t, for example, the actual cave-shrines of the Magdalenian people who lived fifteen thousand years ago, whose lifestyles were quite similar to those of Native Americans before Columbus, and who used to go deep into the caves of Europe to paint sacred images that still stun the viewer today by their beauty and artistry. “The caves” of contemporary rhetoric, rather, are thoughtstopping abstractions, bits of verbal noise that people have been taught to use so they don’t ask inconvenient questions about where this thing called “progress” is taking us and whether any sane person would actually want to go there. Flattening out the entire complex richness of the human past into a single cardboard bogeyman labeled “the caves” is one way to do that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So is papering over the distinctly ugly future we’re making for ourselves with a screen shot or two from a Jetsons cartoon and a gaudy banner saying “We’re headed for the stars!”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s really rather fascinating, all things considered, that the image of the cave should have been picked up for that dubious purpose. Not that long ago, most literate people in the Western world tended to have a very different image come to mind when someone mentioned caves. That was courtesy of a man named Aristocles of Athens, who lived a little more than 2300 years ago and whose very broad shoulders got him the nickname Plato. In the longest, most influential, and most problematic of his works, usually called <i>The Republic</i>—a bad choice, as this word nowadays has connotations of rights under law that the Greek title <i>Politeia</i> lacks—he framed his discussion of the gap between perception and reality with an arresting image. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Imagine, Plato says, that we are all shackled in a cave, unable to turn our heads to either side. All we can see are dark shapes that move this way and that on the flat wall of the cave in front of us. Those dark shapes are all we know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They are our reality. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now imagine that one of these prisoners manages to get loose from his shackles, and turns away from the cave wall and the dark shapes on it. He’s in for a shock, because what he sees when he turns around is a bonfire, and people moving objects in front of the flames so that the objects cast shadows on the cave wall. Everything he thought was reality is simply a shadow cast by these moving objects. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If the prisoner who’s gotten loose pays attention, furthermore, he might just notice that the cave isn’t limited to the bonfire, the prisoners, the objects casting the shadows and the people who manipulate those objects. Off past the bonfire, on one side of the cave, the floor slopes upwards, and in the distance is a faint light that doesn’t seem to come from the fire at all. If our escaped prisoner is brave enough, he might decide to go investigate that light. As he does so, the bonfire and the shadows slip into the darkness behind him, and the light ahead grows brighter and clearer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then, if he’s brave enough and keeps going, he steps out of the cave and into the sunlight. That’s not an easy thing, either, because the light is so much more intense than the dim red glow in the cave that for a while, he can’t see a thing. He stumbles, rubs his eyes, tries to find his bearings, and discovers that the detailed knowledge he had of the way shadows moved on the cave wall won’t help him at all in this new, blazingly bright realm. He has to discard everything he thinks he knows, and learn the rules of an unfamiliar world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Bit by bit, though, he accomplishes this. His eyes adapt to the sunlight, he learns to recognize objects and to sense things—color, for example, and depth—which didn’t exist in the shadow-world he thought he inhabited when he was still a prisoner in the cave. Eventually he can even see the sun, and know where the light that illumines the real world actually comes from. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now, Plato says, imagine that he decides to go back into the cave to tell the remaining prisoners what he’s seen. To begin with, it’s going to be rough going, because his eyes have adapted to the brilliant daylight and so he’s going to trip and stumble on the way down. Once he gets there, anything he says to the prisoners is going to be dismissed as the most consummate rubbish:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>what is this nonsense about color and depth, and a big bright glowing thing that crosses something called the sky? What’s more, the people to whom he’s addressing his words are going to misunderstand them, thinking that they’re about the shadow-world in front of their eyes—after all, that’s the only reality they know—and they’re going to decide that he must be an idiot because nothing he says has anything to do with the shadow-world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Plato didn’t mention that the prisoners might respond by trying to drag the escapee back into line with them and bully him into putting his shackles back on, though that’s generally the way such things work out in practice. Plato also never saw a television, which is unfortunate in a way—if he had, he could have skipped the complicated setup with the bonfire and the people waving around objects that cast shadows, and simply said, “Imagine that we’re all watching television in a dark room.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course Plato had his own reasons for using the cave metaphor, and developed it in directions that aren’t relevant to this week’s post. The point I want to make here is that every technology is a filter that shapes the way we experience and interact with the world. In some cases, such as television, the filtering effect is so drastic it’s hard not to see—unless, that is, you don’t want to see it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In other cases, it’s subtle. There are valid reasons people might want to use one filter rather than another, or to set aside an assortment of filters in order to get a clearer view of some part of the world or their lives.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are also, as already noted, matters of personal choice. Some of us prefer sun and wind and depth and color to the play of shadows on the walls of the cave. That doesn’t mean that we’re going to drag those who don’t share that preference out into the blinding light, or that we’re going to turn ourselves into the Throg the Cave Man shadow that’s being waved around so enthusiastically on one corner of the cave wall. It does mean—or so the response to last week’s post suggests—that a significant number of people are losing interest in the shadow-play and clambering up the awkward but rewarding journey into the sunlight and the clean cool air, and it may just mean as well that those who try to bully them into staying put and staring at shadows may have less success than they expect. </div>

On an entirely personal note, I’m pleased to report that Founders House Publishing has just brought out a new edition of my first science fiction novel, <i>The Fires of Shalsha</i>. It’s closer to mainstream SF than anything else I’ve written—it’s even set on another planet—but fans of my subsequent novels, <i>Star’s Reach</i> and <i>Twilight’s Last Gleaming</i>, will find it an enjoyable read. Copies can be ordered <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2015/11/new-release-fires-of-shalsha.html>here</a>. </div>

Here in Western Europe, people are a lot more pragmatic when it comes to technology. When it is useful, we use it, and we use all kinds of it, but we do not have technobashing. Maybe it does happen on a more unconscious level ?<br>In any case, here in Ecnarf, suddenly dipped into a valley of tears - ahem, like the rest of the world gets to know every other day of the week - there are still a lot of taboos on social, political, and technological choices. <br><br>Overall, this difference in perspectives probably makes your Retrotopia narrtive more relevant in the USA, where you are, as one should expect. But the narrative still makes a lot of useful points even for us, and turns out to be by no means less essential in these dark times. <br><br>Therefore I am trying to stick to my personal goal for the end of 2015, that is, to publish on my own blog a French translation of each of your Retrotopia posts published so far. Because I enjoy the world you are trying to create, albeit I do not necessarily agree on all of your assumptions regarding certain social choices. And because it is an engaging way to live your narrative a little closer. it can even be fun, as i have to come up with inventive phrasing to match your style and still feel litterate in the language of Molière.<br>And maybe it will help to give me a closer look at how short fiction is built, structured and shaped, so that I can shape my own ideas into words at one point.<br><br>Where to post links to it is still a challenge for me since I am mostly reading US blogs.

But the "you're using electricity, therefore you're a hypocrite" theme was a bit much.<br><br>I do have a TV myself, though my wife and I dropped our cable (kept the broadband connection, however) and the screen sits dark the vast majority of the time. And the small amount of viewing done is on broadcast (and yes, public TV) channels. But I do notice the difference, having been "off cable" for more than two years now, when I visit other's homes. The contrast with the general quiet of ours is striking.<br><br>My approach has been to gradually and selectively reduce my usage of various technologies and resources, from the TV described above to line-drying our clothes mid-spring to mid-fall. As I've mentioned before (I believe), I work at a municipal power/water utility and a few weeks ago my supervisor and I attended a regional wholesale energy conference. At my lunch table, we were all talking shop and the topic of consumption trends (which have been flat or declining, generally) came up. I mentioned that our household usage is down to ~230 kWh per month on average. I got a lot of stares.<br><br>On a different note, but in line with your ongoing point that we need to start where we are and get working, I have decided to take out nomination papers and run for city council in my small town (~12,000). There is an opportunity, I feel, to influence the direction of and decisions being made in my community, and hopefully I can do something to promote or at least enable the kind of resilient local networks we are going to be needing in these coming decades.<br><br>And of course, I am eagerly awaiting posts on each of the topics you mentioned in your opening.<br><br><a href=#c4510610310911335700 title="comment permalink">11/25/15, 6:01 PM</a><br><br>

We have a TV I just don't watch it. Always seemed like a waste of time.

I cannot add anything useful to these conversations and as I get older I don't like trying to. It takes a few hours just to deprogram a single person on a single political point just to get them opened up to a broader meme than what the teevee told them to think. It's frustrating.<br>A measure of a person's happiness may well be their lack of desire to change or control others, because if I'm happy I can't imagine why I'd care what other people do if it's not harming me.

She told me that I was lucky that this was Thailand because the Department of Social Services would take my children away if I lived in such deplorable conditions in the US. I had a nice two bedroom two bathroom house with full furnishings, a bathtub, refrigerator/hotplates and full kitchen, air conditioning, computers and Internet, et cetera. <br>We still don't have a working dishwasher--I never understood the point of the contraption, as it seemed like it was a reason to wash dishes twice....<br><br><a href=#c5971742372855753077 title="comment permalink">11/25/15, 6:28 PM</a><br><br>

Honestly, I just couldn't stand to read one of your posts and not see a hundred comments, so I'll start tonight's session. I have not had a regular TV at my home in the US in over 30 years (although I do have a DVD player hooked to a monitor), but I'm in a furnished flat in London for a semester which has one, so in the aftermath of the Paris attacks I turned it on to the BBC and let in run (sans sound, I admit) just because it seemed like the thing to do. It wasn't. I even wrote a post for my friends and family trying to sort out some of the stuff going on in Syria and found the news coverage to be very repetitive and almost worthless. It seems intended to just keep folks stirred up and anxious; perhaps anxious people buy more of the stuff advertisers are selling, perhaps not. But value received for time spent is very low - one good article would cover everything the TV covered in 20 hours in 20 minutes of time. Maybe less.<br><br><br><a href=#c1903569393451692398 title="comment permalink">11/25/15, 6:43 PM</a><br><br>

I grew up in the 60's-early 70's. For better or worse, my Boomer generation identified to a great degree with music; it was distinctly ours, it served as our revolutionary manifesto, etc. Fact is, we're still fairly age-chauvinistic about it, maybe with some justification. Millennials and Generation Z's, on the other hand, identify with the world of high-tech invention - that's what sets *them* apart, makes them distinct. A refusal to bow down to technoglitter - a refusal that just might *catch on* here and there - might seem a dagger to the heart of their collective identity, even if many of their own are doing the refusing.<br><br>Also, re fears that a tech-downsizing would equate with an ethics regression: there are those who believe that feminism and all the equality-of-the-sexes mvt's over the last several centuries really began with the Industrial Revolution. The preceding Agrarian Ages had men necessarily doing the heavy work, consequently women were diminished in archetypal stature and were relegated to second-citizen status. In the Industrial Revolution, women could work the same jobs as men, consequently their statue began to rise, and feminism was born. Our high tech civ just accelerates the liberating process. I don't buy into the notion that a return to a more agrarian-centered, less tech-defined world would equate with a return to traditional sexism - there's just some toothpaste you'll never get back in the tube - but I can see how some would have their concerns. <br><br><br><a href=#c1517812346368559377 title="comment permalink">11/25/15, 7:07 PM</a><br><br>

I'm going to meditate on the subject for a day or so before replying fully.

I remember clearly that when I first expressed interest in actually wearing something like a Victorian dress, a hoop skirt, or a beautiful cloak I'd seen in an illustration or 18th century painting.. I was told that "that isn't how people dress now" except perhaps as a Halloween costume or something. There was absolutely no possibility of wearing it any other time of the year, end of story. I accepted, as a child, that apparently choosing to wear an Edwardian dress or beautiful hat was wrong or silly for some reason, and I -mostly- let the matter drop, though I never could get an answer from adults as to WHY it was so wrong to wear such a thing.<br><br>As a young woman in college in NYC, I found a few lovely vintage 50's dresses, and took to wearing them (before Mad Men came on TV) and was EXTREMELY surprised the first time I received comments from other women, informing me that wearing such dresses meant that I (not kidding) endorsed the oppression of women, wanted to go back to pre-Roe V. Wade times, had wanted to go back to the days when women were just secretaries, or some other complete nonsense that had nothing to do with what I was wearing. Happily, I didn't let that change my choices, and whether I feel like wearing a 50's dress or jeans and hiking boots, I don't consult fashion magazines for permission. It was strange and a bit troubling at first though. I am still shocked at how much those choices seem to irk some people even now. (My husband and i also do not have a TV, microwave, or a number of other technologies, and have fielded the usual shocked/upset reactions from that as well..) It's all a part of the "cave" around us, I suppose.<br>Thank you for your posts, as always!<br><br><a href=#c6616898349678032409 title="comment permalink">11/25/15, 8:18 PM</a><br><br>

In my early twenties I quit watching teevee for a couple of years just as an exercise. I wanted to see what would happen. Well, I read more and played more music! <br><br>But then one day I dropped in on a friend and found him and a few others sitting in a semi-circle on chairs and a sofa all staring at a teevee and it seemed positively surreal. (They were all young men with bottles of beer in their laps, but we'll leave that alone for now.) I thought, "Don't you guys want to <i>do</i> something? Play music, walk the dog? Something, <i>anything</i> rather than this?" They looked like zombies.<br><br>(I never returned to a lot of teevee watching, just a little.)<br><br>Anyway... <br><br>I really wanted to say that technology acts as a molder (for lack of a better term) of behavior as a result of filtering perception.

In the days that followed several door to door salesmen wanted to sell me a new roof. A new roof would have been at least 3k. Before the next rain I picked up a pack a shingles and replaced all the blown off and damaged shingles and nailed all the roof vents down. I even straightened out and reset the zinc strips. Total cost: $25 and 3 hours.

The exception to that is World News Tonight, which is as a matter of custom louder and which I actually remember with a thin dint of fondness from childhood. It is terrible. Full bore terror this and terror that, claiming that we should be calm while the whole time oscillating between a mood of horror, disgust, and giddy school girl meeting her dream crush excitement while talking about the uniformly depressing topics. The weird this is that the mood oscillation doesn't seem synchronized with the topics. They are excited about some detail of that sad hospital in Afghanistan, disgusted about some boring lie from a lesser candidate. Its actually depressing, I feel sad for the talking heads, they pull my heart strings like seeing a bum on the street about to crack up. Casting shadow puppets for a living must be a weird head space.<br><br>Concerning my earlier point. By all means I think that the country is loosing its string. A lot of the unifying group creating stories are collapsing into plot hole singularities from which no meaning can escape. What's on the other side of the current event's horizon? It cannot be seen. I guess history implies the possibility of a story filling the vacuum of collapse and expanding to fill a frightening amount of our cultural space. A story capable of growing to critical mass cannot form before divergent stories pull the country in so many directions that it cannot function at all.

Glad also to hear of your decision to enter local politics. That's where some of the crucial steps will be taken next. "<br><br>I agree. I have no idea what my electricity consumption is because it is not metered. I haven't turned on the electric heat in my apartment yet, even though it is hovering around 0 degrees outdoors, my profligate neighbors ensure my apartment remains at a toasty 15 degrees. I kind of miss my previous accommodations, which, by future standards were luxurious - electricity automatically kept it heated above freezing, but due to my financial and environmental concerns, not more than a few degrees C. I occasionally talk to a city councilor who "gets it" (and is well liked despite it!) and wholeheartedly agree with the notion that change has to happen on the municipal level, the state/provincial levels and federal levels are too hopelessly hide-bound here in North America. I am seriously considering municipal politics as a career move.<br>"<br>Steck, if you find it useful, pleasant, and relevant, and don't mind the conditions in which it's made or the impact its manufacture and use have on the planet, by all means. "<br><br>I've spent the last two months engaged in highly paid work designing utterly stupid products at a company full of, honestly, not-so-bright-but-well-paid technophiles. I can only imagine the horrors of the Bay Area in SF. I justify this as a means to get out of debt I incurred as a result of several poor life choices. At least the thousands of dollars I receive for manipulating memory registers on a computer in an organized fashion aren't being used to buy more crap. My benefits (in a hilarious testament to today's priorities) are $500 dental and a new smartphone every year. For those who don't keep track of such things, a new high end smartphone costs more than 500 dollars. The idea that having the latest smartphone is more important than dental health is well, very progressive. Presumably in the future we'll have an app to chew our food for us. Anyway, a significantly challenging part of my occupation is playing along with these people. So, with much reluctance, I accepted the free smartphone, even though I had no intention of replacing my old, moribund smartphone purchased in a more delusional time. I feel awful about it, having resigned my digital life to that which can be sustained on the castoffs of others. It's reafirrmed my nigh-veganism, however.<br><br>Although I generally agree with the logic presented in your various posts about the death of the Internet, JMG, I will confess my complete addiction to it, but for reasons that are probably different than the average affluent westerner. I am not sure how I would relate to the world in the absence of an alt-media, which I would love to see happen locally (maybe I should make it happen...). I stay off clickbait sites, don't use pornography for personal reasons, and although I have access to Netflix, spend only a few hours on it a month. I am not sure what would happen to my mental health without access to something to counter mainstream drivel and remind me that I am not alone and am not crazy. I would definitely prefer nothing to "only corporate media". Although you've wisely avoided giving the Paris attacks - which at the peak rate of killing that sad night in Paris, failed to exceed the rate at which cars directly kill people, leaving ecological destruction and obesity/heart disease/diabetes aside - any more attention than they deserve, I think there is something worth talking about in the aftermath of them. Eventually, alt-media will be censored. It won't be called censorship. It will be an internet whitelist to keep us safe from terrorists and/or child pornographers, or simple corporate refusal to carry the content. At that point, the collision between our culture and reality will take on a new and hard-to-imagine trajectory.<br><br>End Part 1<br><br><a href=#c6747283738230370082 title="comment permalink">11/25/15, 8:58 PM</a><br><br>

I suspect that this phase of collapse will roughly coincide when we find out what the consequences of a decade of NSA and co. monitoring our internet use will be. I am not so optimistic about the future of anyone like myself, who reads a lot of media that doesn't exactly follow the official story. Or, for that matter, those who actually produce alternative media. I think the MaddAddam series by Margaret Atwood is a convincing vision of our future, and it's pretty clear that my place in that future is a forgotten corpse on some imperial battlefield after some crisis justifies a draft. Empire has a long tradition of what Russia called penal battalions during World War 2, where undesirables are drafted at pain of death for their loved ones and sent on suicide missions to maintain Empire.<br><br>I refuse to give up what I consider to be nigh-irrational optimism, and am still moving forward, learning good skills, hopefully buying land (keeping in mind last week's reminder that bugging out to a remote farmstead is not a realistic strategy) if I keep my job and things remain "normal" for long enough. However, the recent incidents in Syria and the recent spate of bad news about the climate is... disturbing. I know climate catastrophe isn't what's being talked about this week, but I can't shake the feeling that I'll be long dead a decade from now.<br><br>And finally, regarding climate action: I really thought that the COP21 protests would be something of a turning point - not that they would save the planet or industrial civilization or the polar bears - towards a future where at least a few tens of % of us die with our boots on. It seems that "ISIS" has kind of curtailed it, although I am very much involved in the local COP21 action which is going ahead regardless of what the cops say.<br><br>Although I expressed this last point in last week's discussion, every new form of media, if you ignore the environmental costs of the machines required to display it, provides worthwhile experiences to the concision user. I think it's worth ending this (extremely rambling) post with a quote from one of my favorite movies, Princess Mononoke (by a guy that's definitely in the collapse camp)... "you cannot alter your fate, but you can rise to meet it". Or, in the words of Iron Maiden, "if you're gonna die, die with your boots on".<br><br><a href=#c4454097991445362253 title="comment permalink">11/25/15, 8:59 PM</a><br><br>

I think the reason is that I started working with computers in 1963, and retired after 50+ years as an engineer. Of course it has nothing to do with my technological education and experience and everything to do with the fact that I'm 70 years old. I believe that as an "elderly person" I'm not expected to stay current with the latest plastic whiz-bangs, and people feel comfortable with just telling themselves "he's old and technology has passed him by".<br><br>So, if you want to avoid being hassled for your lack of a television, or for your collection of 78 RPM records, my advice is simply to get old. Once you're old people will let you get away with picking and choosing which technologies to use. They'll use adjectives like "quaint", "cute", or "harmless and eccentric". But mostly, they will just ignore you, which suits me just fine.<br><br><a href=#c6773311575316571229 title="comment permalink">11/25/15, 9:11 PM</a><br><br>

You identify "music" as central to Boomer identity. Very well. But why should that be unique to boomers? Members of the so-called "Generation X" were heavily influenced by, and would go on to shape, Punk and Hip-Hop. Moreover, this idea that "Boomers" even had a "revolutionary manifesto" calls on a particular set of boomer experiences, by which I mean those middle class white kids who got heavy into sex, drugs, and rock and roll. For every hippy in the sixties, there were plenty more straight types who contested civil rights, were drafted into the army, or got their high school sweethearts pregnant and spent the next four decades working in restaurants. <br><br>Every demographic generation contains innumerable individuals with their own unique experiences, rounded lives which cannot be pounded into the square hole of generational narratives without brute force. Sure, we live our lives in parallel and react to the many of the same forces and events, but we react differently, in accordance with our own situations and proclivities. So the "Millennials" and "Generation Z's" have indeed come of age in an era of rapidly changing information technology. But, those of us born after 1980 (or whatever the arbitrary line is) have experienced those technologies quite differently. Some of us, like Revolutionary boomers of the suburban sixties, are completely immersed in information technology, with smartphones and game consoles and laptops and streaming content and so on and so forth. Others of us grew up poor, with knock-off "smartphones" from Wal-Mart which we carry like iPhones to fit in, but loathe to use. <br><br>Most of us, at least those of us who were too young to jump on the Facebook bandwagon when it was the "it" thing, whose parents were already on Facebook when we asked to create an account, have since deleted our Facebook accounts, our twitter accounts if we had them. We prefer a discreet set of applications, most of which are peer to peer (snapchat, kik) rather than blurting information out into the void. Meanwhile our parents, even our grandparents, are addicted to Facebook like they were (and still are) to televisions. We don't watch cable. Some of us watch too much Netflix, though those of us who aren't rich have triaged streaming video and found it not worth a monthly subscription. Perhaps the crucial point is that there is a range of attitudes towards technology which track quite closely to ones income bracket (or perhaps ones' parents).<br><br><a href=#c7966865974801430873 title="comment permalink">11/25/15, 9:11 PM</a><br><br>

We are, you could say, the first post-growth generation. The younger age cohorts you look at, the more real this is. Someone born in 2000, who is today a high school freshman or sophomore, might have among their youngest memories their father losing his job or the family house being foreclosed on. This generation was the first that was told something along the lines of "you can't study whatever you want in college, the economy is tough, if you can't hack STEM you might spend the rest of your life flipping burgers." Most of us still are flipping burgers. <br><br>Excuse the rambling, I hope my point isn't too muddy. Generational narratives are tricky, doomed to smooth over the stories of those whose lives contradict the narrative. If anything, today's generation of teens and young twenty-somethings may be the most amenable to critically examining the narrative of progress and selecting which technologies we want to use. As I pointed out, it's something we're accustomed to with social media. As economic deterioration continues to squeeze our prospects, shedding more gizmos, like smartphones for flip phones or cars for bikes, buses, and hitchhiking may make more and more sense.<br><br><a href=#c264321443060580459 title="comment permalink">11/25/15, 9:12 PM</a><br><br>

I took a look through it, curious, and later did some internet research, and found <a href=http://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/nov/04/why-eco-austerity-wont-save-us-from-climate-change rel=nofollow>an article he wrote which sums up the main points</a>. <br><br>I'm flagging it up because he seems to get one of the central points of this blog: that, quote: <i>"Updated for the era of the genuinely exacting challenge of global warming and biodiversity loss, a retreat from economic growth is argued to be necessary today because <b>“We cannot have infinite growth on a finite planet”</b></i>. (emphasis mine)<br><br>BUT, he then proposes that in the face of this, the only solution is....... more growth. Quote:<br><i>It is true that the right-wing Pollyannas say: “Don’t bother your pretty little head; technology will save us.” The green left Cassandras meanwhile run around screaming: “Technology can’t save us; we’re doomed!” The socialist meanwhile says: “So long as we plan and regulate the economy carefully, we need never run out of anything, no matter how large we grow.”</i><br><br>And:<br><i>"The patchwork of hair-shirted, back-to-the-land, anti-industrial and degrowth prescriptions common on the green left should really be described as “eco-austerity”. Green anti-modernism is a cuckoo’s egg in the nest of the left.<br><br>The truth is that we can stop climate change and deliver expanding wealth for all. The end is not nigh and we do not need to rein in industrial society. If anything, we must accelerate our modernity."</i><br><br>Shrill? Yes. He does use some examples to make his points, I realize I am very selectively quoting here out of context. I almost bought the book, I may yet do so, because I wanted to understand his perspectives (always makes sense to understand both sides of an argument) but I can't yet tell if it a reasoned argument or simply a polemic.<br><br>I remember from an earlier post that you noted when some people's beliefs become challenged by evidence, they more tightly grasp them as changing them is harder for them to do - maybe this is an example of that?<br><br><a href=#c2405958534431468052 title="comment permalink">11/25/15, 9:13 PM</a><br><br>

Perhaps techno-bullying is a reaction against the intrusion of the Real World into the bullies' techno-bubble.

Those who are not paying homage, are being ridiculed and discriminated against.

The problem is if we refuse to believe in our limitations like plato's crowd of shadow watcher's.PO, climate change and the modern brain washing mainstream technological progress meme which have brought PO and climate change about are mutually contradictory.

Think of the terms the "gunpowder age, nuclear age or the bronze age." You could argue that the modern day perception of time is actually exponential and not linear. We were worthless brutes until a few rogue mavericks decided to introduce such and such technology. As our technology compounded on itself it grew exponentially until it will reach escape velocity just like our messiah rocket-ship launching us into what is completely unknown but surely assumed to be heaven among the stars.<br><br>In the information age there bias towards the present because from 10,000 bc to today we know orders of magnitude more about history the closer we get to the present. In a medieval society people probably knew more about the biblical time's than they did their own time or history. This would create a bias towards time in the past. If you take away technology as a time reference and use the dry cut dates in years history and time itself looks very different. There is no bias towards any particular date, the year 18,971 BC is no more noteworthy than 235 AD. When time itself is given its proper important and unit of measurement a look of history yields different sets of facts for me. How amazing is it that hunter gathering tribal cultures existed for almost a million years. It seems most civilizations have only lasted a few hundred years intact.<br><br>Education and culture that asserts that the only important feature of a particular date is the technology that was used, leaves people completely lost in the wilderness if technology doesn't hold to its "expected" path. The first thing many people do when they are lost in the woods is panic and begin to deny that they have no idea where they are. Why should we think people would react any different when lost in their own perception of time.<br><br><a href=#c885512183355748570 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 2:01 AM</a><br><br>

Here in England they literally do that on one of the news shows. <br>They have a section of the program like News, Sports, and Weather called "The Papers" where two or three people sit around the table and they project the front page of a series of newspapers onto a screen and the talking heads take turns talking about them. All the TV viewer can read is the headlines at best, and the commentary is so short that it's really just the headline and lead. <br>Seems very bizarre in a "The Media is the Message" way to me, something like the time I visited a friend's house during a sporting event of some type and noticed he had three screens on simultaneously to watch it: The big screen TV, a laptop off to the side, and his smartphone on the coffee table.

And it's hard for people to come back from that. It's not just individuals, you see it a lot in big organisations. Things are 'improved', without thinking about the consequences. I live in the Netherlands and we had a perfect example of that, just a couple of weeks ago. In our country you have an government organisation (uwv) that is supposed to help unemployed people get jobs. This is a moderately succesfor venture, that has functioned in one form or the other, since the fifties. Basically: every unemployed person get's someone assigned to their case, that helps them prepare, or retrain, etc, for jobs. A couple of years ago the former administration had the bright idea that all those government workers helping people get jobs, where unnecessary. It could all be done much cheaper with a brand new internet-information system. The unemployed could just go online, use the system to find their ideal career-path, and everyone would get jobs.<br>Last week they found out that it didn't help squat: the new system helped no one and was, because of extra needed welfare money, much more expensive. So the organisation had to turn back the clock: they are going to hire new people and do the job the way it worked before. We just lost millions and millions of euro's this way, but according to all involved 'it should have worked' and it could not have been foreseen. Well, live and learn I guess... <br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c919724739063002363 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 5:27 AM</a><br><br>

Myself, and a few people I know, are long time vegans. I have never tried to convince anyone that they shouldn’t eat animals or anything of the sort, I see it as none of my business and a matter of personal choice what people want to eat, but in the past two decades since I made this choice I can barely go more than a week without somebody discovering I’m vegan and challenging me on it, how I’m missing out, how I’m probably not getting sufficient of any assortment of minerals and vitamins they are sure meat and dairy contain in abundance, how I’m limiting my options in some hypothetical survival scenario, how some vegans died or their children died, etc.<br><br>If I manage to politely get out of this, then the real challenges start, why don’t I eat meat? “It’s not for the animals is it?” “You don’t care about animal rights do you?” And of course I say no, because I don’t want this conversation at all, I just want to eat my meal, and then I have to listen to weird confessions about how their bodies need meat, or that someone they know tried it and got sick and their doctor told them to eat meat and they got better. At any rate it just goes on and on. The only thing I can think is that people feel some sort of moral judgement must be coming from me by the mere fact that I am choosing to do something different from them, maybe they have encountered other vegans who did make judgements on them in this way, or saw some on TV, or possibly this moral judgement is internal in them, and meeting someone who’s showing that you can decide how you want to act causes this sort of weird emotional response.<br><br>For me honestly it’s a personal thing, I got into it as a means of reducing my impact on the environment, along with not driving (I never have, like yourself) and not flying places for vacations, not that I think I’m particularly green or anything, but they seemed like simple enough things I could do myself to chip in. I imagine other people chip in in ways they feel they can. One nice thing about it is that it seems to overshadow other choices I’ve made in people’s minds so I haven’t experienced so much of the technological backlash you and your readers have described.<br><br><br><a href=#c4601486083822857347 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 5:41 AM</a><br><br>

From Laurie Anderson's, Beautiful Red Dress, "You know, for every dollar a man makes a woman makes 63 cents. Now, fifty years ago that was 62 cents. So, with that kind of luck, it'll be the year 3,888 before we make a buck." I think I read recently that women are up to 74 cents. It would be hard to make a case that industrialization has achieved any parity for women, or for minorities for that matter. Certainly not in the countries where they assemble our stuff and collect resources for our Western lifestyle.<br><br>In 'Countdown: Our Last, Best Hope For A Future On Earth" by Alan Weisman he cites country after country where equality for women jumps dramatically ahead when women are given control over their reproduction. In some countries the number of women at university, after implementation of national women's health programs, comes to surpass the number of men; better jobs, more income, stable population are some of the other benefits. <br><br>In the US, women's ability to choose seems to have peaked along with peak energy. As we slide down Hubbert's peak we find that more and more states are managing to take away women's choices. Is this coincidence or is there causality?<br><br>Automation certainly makes lots of people redundant. Those redundant people are then "free" to pursue... whatever they can afford to pursue. And so we declare that they are free. With deindustrialization will so many people be able to sit uselessly on the shelf being 'free'? Will those people have access to land and access to choice about how they govern their own bodies, among other things?<br><br>Retrotopia is interesting in that choice is preserved in the face of sliding down from Hubbert's peak. Dignity and meaningful employment are also present. This, of course, is an ideal and not a certainty moving forward from here.<br><br><a href=#c1465122318381503564 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 5:51 AM</a><br><br>

I have always been a bit technologically "backward," and have never really gotten most of the push back that seems so common, either in my small home town or in Austin. <br><br>If anything, many people seem to laud my decision to forgo a TV, and when I didn't have a smart phone the worst I got was a sort of affectionate disbelief (some relative got an iPhone as a free promotion right when my old clunker of a Nextel dumb phone died, so now I have one, and I must say I rather enjoy it since I downloaded the Kindle for iPhone app and now it's like a combination mobile library and electronic dictionary, plus I can get myself un-lost using Google Maps now that I've moved back to the city. Also, people used to text me even though I couldn't receive texts, and then when I didn't answer I always feared that they thought me rude, so that problem's solved). Actually, I hear people comment in a rather self-congratulatory manner all the time on their lack of smart phone, the way that some people avow their lack of understanding of sports--sort of a coded way to claim a bit of intellectual superiority. Same with not watching TV, actually.<br><br>I also don't have a microwave or toaster, and no one seems to really care (except that many people are astonished and pleased to learn that you can make toast in a normal oven, which I find hilarious). I also hate driving, and now that I'm in the city I have no vehicle, which people also seem to find laudable since most folks in Austin are at least nominal environmentalists. My refusal to drive except in cases of dire necessity did earn me a bit of haranguing in my home town, but it seemed to be largely because my driving, when I was forced to it, was so anxious and inept that people feared I lacked an essential survival skill or hadn't quite made it to adulthood or something. <br><br>If anything, the only technological refusal I've ever truly been harassed for was a refusal to grow produce using chemical poisons or to buy food grown in such a manner, and that was I think because it was perceived as hoity-toity, which is anathema in small town Texas.<br><br>I wonder if I have just happened to live in unusually illuminated milieux? It seems unlikely, especially since I have lived in a small, very conservative town, and a liberal city, and experienced the same lack of negative response in both places. I'm not strident about my choices, so I suppose it's to my advantage that I don't come off as particularly threatening or supercilious about it, but it sounds like most people who have gotten such negative reactions were just minding their own business, not projecting smugness or proselytizing about their technological abstentions.<br><br><a href=#c5663354582695733311 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 6:13 AM</a><br><br>

I may rely on the Internet far too much to keep me company in my lonely boredom (I have no desire to personally relate to the hard-drinking, televised-sports-obsessed caucasian blue-collar folk in my immediate environment), but the Internet has always been something that I indulge once I get home and have done whatever business I have to do in the world outside my apartment, and I think I should keep it that way.<br><br>As for television, I think so much controversy and bullying exists around that technology on account of our corporate masters using it as a very effective mind-control device. Back when I was into reading New Age tracts from purported channeled entities, one claim I encountered that I still remember is that television sets are built with some kind of doo-hickey in their electronic guts that emanate a signal that renders people hypnotized and compliant. Now, this might be one of those New Age claims that makes skeptics roll their eyes and sigh, but the effect that television has on people in our society is such that it is not so easy to dismiss such claims out of hand!

The thing I notice most about television is the effort to shape the behavior of the viewer. Commercials, of course, but even during the programming. Lately, a few nostalgia channels have come on, with shows from the 50s, 60s, and 70s. Almost all of the "comedies" have canned laugh tracks. I read that in the early days of live TV, producers found that live audiences laughed, or failed to, at inconvenient times, so they started playing recorded laughter during the live show to prompt the audience. The final step of eliminating the inconvenient live humans seems inevitable.<br><br>My father particularly loathed what he called "the rehash." After a major speech, or sporting event, the talking heads would proceed to tell the audience what reaction they should have. My father passed away 40 years ago, but nothing has improved since then.<br><br>I myself notice what I call "the prehash." My wife likes to watch horse races, so each year we tune in to the Triple Crown. Throughout the buildup to the race, odds makers try to predict what will happen. About a minute before post time, they show a computer generated animation of what how they think the race will go. The first time I saw this, I actually screamed at the teevee. <br><br>It goes without saying this applies to political coverage as well.<br><br><a href=#c4931493133213228256 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 6:22 AM</a><br><br>

Predatory capitalism always defends is turf and has bought and paid-for govt regulators to enforce their will. That being said, wlxl is supposed to be pointed toward the NW part of the county. Since I can pick it up well south of there, maybe there is some problem with the way the transmitter is configured that can be fixed.

And I have to say that I am dumbfounded by the hostility to technological choice. I can never figure out why some people need me to validate their choices. Who knew I was that influential.<br><br>Back in the 90s, I taught philosophy at Tulane University, usually this included symbolic logic. Tulane added a new model technology classroom to Newcomb Hall (where philosophy was taught). It had computer connections (wired - no wifi yet), a projection screen, and multimedia capabilities. There was a bit of competition to book this room for teaching a class. I never joined in though. Why?<br><br>I taught symbolic logic. A chalkboard was the best tool to work proofs and analyze sentences in natural language. It was easy to write on, and easy to erase which is what you need when you are working through proofs or carving up sentences. You also want people to make errors when you are teaching them logic - its necessary for the learning process. You see you got it wrong, track down the problem and start erasing. You cannot do this anywhere near as easily on a computer. (Unless you are using a stylus and projecting on a screen - of course, you are just using a glorified electronic chalkboard at that point.) Powerpoint (a program I despise) would have been worse than useless.<br><br>I think I got accused of wanting to return to "the caves" a few times. Hmm, no caves around New Orleans, but the free cool air would have been nice and I could have wheeled a chalkboard into it.<br><br>Even when I taught "regular" philosophy (the kind that doesn't look like math) I avoided the technology room. I preferred pulling my students (at least the ones who cared) into a discussion. You can't have a discussion when all eyes are on the screen.<br><br>I have nothing against computers in education, the question is just the application.<br><br><a href=#c6395971283845055504 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 7:17 AM</a><br><br>

It just aches.<br><br>My father – in his 60's – is an avvid technology user, he keeps trying to have the latest gadget at hand thinking somehow that it wil improve on his productivity (he is after all a workoholic). I on the other hand am more relaxed, I quit TV a few years ago (had a couple of days of some sort of withdrawal syndrome), don't miss it now, don't have one at home, no MW oven, dishwasher, clothes dryer. Still use though my smartphone as I apparently must be within our customer's reach at all times (or else!) and we have more than one car. We (my family and my parents') are not on the lower end of the social scale.<br><br>Thing is my dad tried for a few years to convince me I need a TV (he's the kind that has one on at home, all the time), especially the period just after I moved to a new house. He used to come visit and sit uneasily on the couch and during the first few minutes suggest we get a TV set. Eventually that subsided, but it was rather difficult to convince him to turn off his TV when we went to visit at his house with my son (almost 4 years old now). Even now, when we go visit him, he looks at me when entering, with the same question on his lips: “should I turn the TV off?” even though we've had the same talk over and over again.<br><br>He insisted as well we should get a drone – as we regularly inspect rather high buildings (we sometimes work together), in the idea that it would be a great help. I argued with him that it would not bring much added value to our business (actual value, not only high-tech wiz image value) but he would not take it. We eventually got one and the result is that it is easier to get good quality photos of the buildings that we inspect. But the price paid for a marginal advantage is rather high. And maintenance of the device is a new topic in the picture now, and training for an operator as well. And if I have to actually measure something up there, I still have to climb. On the up side, I enjoy playing with it...<br><br>I also use a bicycle to get around whenever weather permits and I feel like (the two combined don't even yield a lot of opportunities to do so). He almost always asks “is anything wrong with your car?” if he sees me on the bike.<br>Once, I insisted he drop me off a few hundred meters away from home, as it was not in his way to drop me off at home. You should have seen his face when asking “and how are you going to get home, will you... WALK?”, as if the notion of walking more than 10 meters was untihnkable.<br><br>end part 1<br><br><a href=#c1815392653239643041 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 7:37 AM</a><br><br>

No tech, no wiz. I guess some of what drives him is a desire to recoup what he's been missing earlier, but while I know him as a reasonably cerebral and an intelligent person otherwise, whenever we get to technology he keeps saying more is better without taking into account advantages and disadvantages and rejecting any evidence as to how expensive and difficult to produce technology is. It's like something is blinding him.<br><br>Still I must tell you that TV penetration is rather high and pretty much everyone is in the “I've got the latest smartphone” competition, regardless of social condition – even though general tech penetration level around is quite low, wages are generally low and general quality of life is not at its highest. I guess he takes example from what he sees in the western world – looking at what he sees as his peers over there.<br><br>His views are shared mostly among the reasonably well off to the point that the reaction to the introduction of a trolleybus line in the area where we live was generally met with incredulous replies in line with “and who's going to use it?” as opposed to the not so well of people who cheered at it.<br><br>I've noticed that the only acceptable direction for him is “forward”, after me having once mentioned something about permaculture and the like he almost had a fit about the impossibility of returning to work the land and whatnot.<br><br>Luckily for my mental health I have found people that share our (me and gf) view of technology: we use it when and if actually useful – incomprehensible for my father why I do not fully commit to the tech trend (I am also a hamradio operator, I can configure a computer and am competent at all sorts of tech stuff – but I do not buy into everything that comes along).<br><br>I guess it comes down to a different "Weltanschauung" in the end, combined with the addictive/blinding capacity of media/social media. I am (more or less secretly – as my dad would see it as something unfathomable) preparing for the unwinding that's to come, for the pension that I won't get and so on while he tells me that I've just got to work on and good things will come.<br><br><a href=#c9024637576714095199 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 7:37 AM</a><br><br>

The Pew Foundation keeps surveying us and it is obvious that religion is standing on its last legs in American. For millennium there have been some sort of moral strictures that the shamans, priests, or preachers were hysterical about. It was a good way to control society and probability necessary back in the day. It what was keeping the men in the cave facing the wall. But now our over-grown legal system has superseded that need. <br><br>For example, I lived through the first days of the “pill.” It finally has done what the opponents claimed it would: break down socially acceptable sexual behavior. However, no one could imagine in 1961 that 50 years later the pill would lead the Supreme Court would actually go for same-sex marriage. I’m reminded of what a Supreme Court justice – can’t remember which one – said in Loving vs. Virginia (1967). Something like: “…would allowing Negroes and whites to marry lead to allowing brothers and sisters to be allowed to marry”? The thought that two men might marry didn’t even come to mind. <br><br>The point I’m think I’m trying to make is that once you don’t have the moral strictures confirmed by religious views, we make them up. Not watching my favorite TV show? Shame on you. What wrong with you? You don’t have a smart phone – I get that a lot. Personally, I suspect this same thing is happening on a much wider scale with food as opposed to technology. The imposed moral strictures concerning eating the “right” food today is every bit as controlling as kosher food laws once were, and in some communities still.<br><br><a href=#c6464620654142667211 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 7:42 AM</a><br><br>

I don't necessarily dislike the medium. I could watch a good film on T.V. with considerable satisfaction -- though a film projection in a cinema is always preferable. What I dislike about T.V. is more the content, and specifically the "spectacle" of the medium, which involves so much advertising (ideological programming of viewers, propaganda, and consumerism all rolled into one stream of unconsciousness). And of course this spectacle has made enormous inroads into the content of the actual shows, never mind the highly produced commercials. I will suffer through some of this from time to time to watch a good hockey game, but I have gravitated to listening to these on the radio, which frees one up to actually do other things while taking in the action. T.V. watching is SO passive. Then there's the issue of what the mesmerizing effects of the flickering image has on the brain -- especially those of younger viewers. Terrible stuff. Video games are even worse, but I'll stop there -- for now!<br><br><a href=#c7913695986187327735 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 7:48 AM</a><br><br>

That leaves us with some very odd combinations of tech and not-tech which honestly doesn't make any coherent philosophical sense because it can't. I have no way to predict what gadget will die next. We are to poor to throw away previously invested funds. So I am sure what we do have and don't have could be interpreted to be somewhat hypocritical. We can only adapt on an as needed basis. But perhaps slow and steady wins the race after all...<br><br>Regarding the generational differences, it is far too simplistic to lump everybody together by age. At least in our community, a very stratified social structure exists that transcends age, race, religious affiliation, and even political philosophy to some extent. The elite stay with their own, and look out for their own interests, period. They don't even acknowledge the realities of the lower classes, or if they do, they play the blame the victim game. Even wealthy philanthropists give primarily to feel-good large national charities with little to no real local impact, to arts, or to something that will have a plaque with their name on it. Almost never do they give to house the homeless, or volunteer to cook for the hungry (except as a photo op around Christmas), or work for any real local social justice. They have no real concern for others. Not only that, they don't understand why they even should. They can't think in theme of whole systems, I guess.

The tone of the article (found here: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/garden/21cold.html?_r=0) is one of slightly genteel befuddlement rather than ridicule, which was refreshing. Having lived in south-of-the-Yangtze China, where houses are not generally heated or insulated (though many locations are subject to snow and freezing), I've picked up a skillset that involves clothing layers, hot-water bottles, going outside in the sun (warmer than the house), drinking tea, etc.<br><br>Back in California, we only periodically turned on the forced air in the various apartments we lived in for a number of years. Now, though, the kids are older and seem less flexible (fashion dictates much), my husband embraces upwardly-mobile trappings and habits probably in reaction to growing up in Cultural Revolution austerity, and my 70 year old father lives with us in a single-family home. It took me a few weeks this Oct/Nov to train him off wearing shorts and turning the heat on. This summer I couldn't get him to open his windows at night and so he repeatedly "needed" AC to cool his room. I only partially blame encroaching dementia. Mostly it's a lifetime of expecting convenience and comfort and purely reflexive (rather than reflective) living.<br><br>Here we are, making different technological choices in one household and I find that when there isn't agreement (as other readers have noted about their familial connections/significant others), the low-techer has a harder time living their "lifestyle choice." I am not capable of convincing my family members of much (let alone changing aspects of the greater society). I'm trying hard to not take it as though my path is diverging from my family. I'm gradually tugging them along with me as best I can - even if it's just through conversation and slight tweakings to the thermostat (etc.). If I were to extrapolate our microcosm onto the future of greater society, I'm not too hopeful about the majority collapsing before it's required. This family: 1/5th aspiring green wizard making concessions and selling-out in some areas (me), 2/5ths BAU (husband and dad) and 2/5ths (the teenagers) recognizing decline intellectually but often wishing not to act on their knowledge mixed with finding some green-wizardry as natural as breathing. <br><br>I guess my point, playing off A Post Millenial's, is just that it's easy to generalize about people and their groups (from small scale couples/families to locales and generations) - but the abstraction doesn't show the complexity of reality. Not only is each family a microcosm, our society is an amalgamation of all phases of energy reliance and resource use. No wonder we struggle.<br><br><a href=#c7302211904073344022 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 8:34 AM</a><br><br>

The company, as far as I could make out, offered some kind of expensive real-time news service for wealthy individuals and companies with business interests in the Third World.

Usually it would be a group of 'freedom fighters' (and this is how I learned there is an entire universe of rebel groups out there) gunned down by security forces. These would tend to feature a handful of deaths, but every few days it would be several dozen or even multiple hundreds (the bigger ones tended to be in East Africa or the Congo). You'd never read about these in the news, but rest assured that multiple groups of people die in a hail of bullets and bombs every day.

The main difference is that cars do have a decidedly practical functionality such that even one who tries to do much with my bike trailer as I do, resorts to using the local car-share service from time to time. Ideologically speaking, the Car's presence in our society is super problematic to be sure, and the reasons I refuse to own one are many. In a downtown urban setting it's not hard to find like-minded compatriots either, but the car-driving conformists threatened by the likes of me outnumber us enormously... The common thread that I see between all these technologies (TV, cars, cell phones, etc.) is that we are conditioned to accept the industrial scaled, consumerist business model of their application, the real agenda behind which is that of immense disparity in power and wealth, widespread distribution of technology notwithstanding. The question that comes to mind is whether (for example) the common use of cars would even be possible if the "business model" used was strictly based on communal/ sharing applications? Or, what if advertising was not allowed on TV?<br><br><a href=#c8520567771411685918 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 9:24 AM</a><br><br>

I'm thankful for this blog and for the green wizards I've met through it. <br><br>I confess to having been glued to the computer during the French bombings (I have no tv), but partly because I am a communications major, and the first live broadcasts give a unique chance to see the action as it's happening, not as it's spun later - and I have a compulsion for seeing the process of spinning and smoothing and the whole (usually non-transparent) process of media reporting. I was moved by the tragedy, very much so, but a part of me is always monitoring the reporters - what gets dropped in a later report, what gets "spun"... fascinating.<br><br>As to the rest - I'm always dropping jaws when I tell folks what technology I don't own or use.

One example is bike riding. When I first began biking through the city, over 30 years ago, there was absolutely no public infrastructure that supported this activity, none- no bike lanes, no off road bike paths, no bike racks to lock your bike to downtown. I would often get hostile reactions from car drivers, even though I was practically riding on the curb, to "get the hell off the street, streets are for cars!" Some even tried driving me off the road. The difference now couldn't be more dramatic. Biking culture, while not nearly as prevalent as car culture, receives much support from the city as well as the general public, with bike lanes and paved paths- even bridges- built exclusively for bicycles and pedestrians all over the twin cities. Same goes for urban gardening. While people once were fined for tearing up their front lawns and growing food now the practice has taken off with support from local government, and you can even get a discount off your monthly water bill if you plant a rain garden in your yard. Each year I see more people tearing up the grass and restoring their yards to native plant communities or planting food gardens like people did during the Great Depression. It's these kinds of activities that are making me a bit more hopeful for the future.<br><br><a href=#c357393358511537939 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 9:49 AM</a><br><br>

People simply could not believe we did this. Friends cannot believe we wash our own dishes in a sink, and laugh at my 5 year supply of firewood. Somehow, splitting wood for heat and exercise is weird, but going to a gym and mindlessly lifting iron on a bar, or running on a treadmill makes sense?

Personally I think the neo-V's are freaking awesome, to be greatly admired, and that their faces should be on postage stamps. <br><br><br><a href=#c1218265226274138836 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 12:05 PM</a><br><br>

Declining to participate in various cultural practices often elicits the same kind of response. I remember when my son once mentioned at school that we weren't having a Christmas tree. When asked why, he said that his mother didn't want to have one. (It was actually because I'm a Pagan and don't celebrate Christmas.) But nonetheless, my son was sent home from school with a Christmas tree, purchased out of a fund for the disadvantaged. It was assumed that it couldn't possibly be that I didn't want a Christmas tree, but that I must not have been able to afford one. He also was sent home with a turkey that Christmas, even though the school knew our family was vegetarian. Apparently even vegetarian families are supposed to eat turkey on the culturally appropriate occasions. I know they meant well, but I felt that our freedom to be different was not acceptable.<br><br>Even though it limits my circle of friends, I'm mostly stopped hanging out with people who continually respond to texts or answer their phone while we are spending time together.

<div class="avtb a_fa375e" id=c4269803900071193756></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11082602126850605083 rel=nofollow>Brian Kaller</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>JMG,<br><br>I’ve been reading the last series of posts with great interest, and find they match my own experience. Rather than simply add my experiences to the long list here, I’d like to bring up a few related points. <br><br>Firstly, it’s not just that more people are increasingly adopting technology in their private lives – it’s that technology has invaded public spaces until it’s almost impossible to escape their influence. For example, I find it increasingly difficult to ride the bus, eat at a restaurant, work in an office, or relax in a coffee shop, without loud music blaring over loudspeakers, interfering with normal reading or conversation. <br><br>In our office there is a daily battle to get the pop music turned down, and the idea offends many people – “What would we listen to?” they ask. I invested in my own headphones to listen to something else, but this also makes conversation more difficult, and it takes away my right to silence. <br><br>The same is true of television screens. Just in the time we’ve lived in Ireland, it seems, more and more pubs have abandoned the conversation or sing-a-longs for which they were traditionally known; many have purchased wide-screen televisions, and more patrons just sit there staring at it. More and more restaurants too have a television on the wall, playing television while people are trying to eat. I have even seen offices that set up televisions on every wall – showing company propaganda rather than actual programming, but programming all the same. <br><br>Secondly, I notice that many people – especially in my native USA – regard adopting the latest technology not just as a fashion, but as a patriotic or religious duty. I hear many people talk about “supporting the economy” – meaning the money economy, a coalition of international corporations, beholden to no one -- as though they are tithing in church. I can’t tell you how often I hear people stare at their glowing rectangles and make announcements about how “the economy” is doing, as though they have sworn loyalty to it rather than to their family or community, and as though they have some control over it. <br><br>Finally – while I largely agree with you and everyone here about the dangers of technology, and have argued as much in my own life – I would argue that just using technology sparingly makes a big difference. <br><br>For example, I know many people who only watch one television programme, and gather at friends’ homes to watch it 12 times a year or however often it is on, and live the rest of their lives largely media-free. They find their television gatherings a powerful experience, partly because they are seeing it with others, but partly because they are not surrounded by such things all the time. For my part, I watch old black-and-white films with my daughter, and have written about their value in envisioning a low-tech future. <br><br>When our ancestors saw plays or operas, or my grandparents saw cinema in the 1930s, I suspect they felt a power and catharsis that few of us will ever know, precisely because what they experienced was so different from their daily life. Just as loudspeakers playing the same songs over and over prevent me from ever enjoying those songs again, so does constant exposure to television or media rob us of the ability to savour them. <br><br>Thank you for your posts, <br><br>Brian Kaller<br><br><a href=#c4269803900071193756 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 1:20 PM</a><br><br>

"To pummel the city councillors, see them fleeing before you, and hear the lamentations of the media -- that is best." <br><br>JoAnna, delighted to hear it. I'm beginning to think that it's time to campaign for the right to be unfashionable!<br><br>Steve, I ain't arguing. This week's post is presenting a minimalist case -- "it's perfectly okay not to use the latest trendy technotrash" -- but yes, there are deeper issues as well, and deeper reasons to back away from said technotrash. As for Twitter, beats me. If a potter makes pots, by the way, what does Twitter make? <br><br>Clark, exactly. Every technology is a filter; every technology has built-in biases; every technology shapes the behavior of its users. That is to say, technology is never neutral and never value-free. <br><br>Misty, that's a good point -- and a very relevant one. It doesn't bode well for the long term, either...<br><br>Ray, I'm glad I don't see television news more than once in a blue moon. As for alternative stories, well, yes -- that's one of the core things this blog is about.<br><br>Repent, if people are really starting to wake up and ask those questions, that's a good thing in one sense and a very worrying thing in another -- the latter because most Americans these days have no idea how to sort out good answers from bad ones, and a plausible demagogue with a lot of easy answers could go very, very far. <br><br>Trog, that's heartwarming. I can imagine a family sitting around the living room after a good Thanksgiving dinner, relaxing by turning televisions into scrap metal -- certainly the most family-oriented thing you can do with a TV!<br><br>Nick, of course alt-media will be censored eventually; it's not censored now, because having it out there in the open makes it much easier for the authorities to keep track of would-be dissidents, a vast number of whom don't seem to realize that every word they text or type is going straight to a NSA database. The challenge you face is learning how to establish relationships in the real world (the internet, remember, is not the real world) that will carry on when censorship finally comes. That's your fate; will you rise to meet it? <br><br>Gary, oh, granted. I'd just like to make things easier for those who don't yet have that advantage. <br><br>Jbucks, "The truth is that we can stop climate change and deliver expanding wealth for all" is exactly the kind of thinking that's going to hasten the collapse of industrial civilization and the death of billions. The truth, rather, is that you can't have limitless growth on a finite planet, no matter how badly you want it or how many buzzwords ("decoupling") you invent to try to justify it. I'm afraid, though, that that's only going to be clear to the descendants of the survivors...<br><br><a href=#c2616752317600981285 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 1:48 PM</a><br><br>

Just today I had an encounter with an old friend of mine. He asked me for feedback to an article of him. I wrote it down for him in a paragraph. Because he didn´t comment on it, I pressed upon him, to tell me, how he thought about it. He responded: "Well, I see that´s your belief, how future will be. You are a doomer" Well, true. What I actually did, I gave him some tought of a simple rural villagepeople life I imagined. On the contrary he discribed, what I told him, as concentration-camp quarrymen. After I insisted on my idea being rather different, little while passed and he told me with a flat voice, I should let him go, because he be tired. So I said good bye.<br><br>What a coincidence, as we just happen to disscuss that bias-ridden people, who do insist on misunderstanding what we talk about or simply run away, it just happened to me today.

That's right druids, we have reached peak sand! Are we going to run out of salt water next? A mere two-thirds of the world's surface is covered by salt water so we better watch out. In fairness, a particular type of sand is needed by the construction industry as your generic Saharan desert sand does not offer the desired material properties required to construct modern day architectural marvels. On the one hand. On the other hand, cry me a fracking river. <br><br>Speaking of fracking, that is actually another one of the things for which the sand is used. After being forced down at high pressure, the sand helps to maintain the integrity of existing seams through which gas is expelled, then collected for a marginal gain in energy. Given the quantity of chemicals also pumped down, you're probably concerned about the level of propane in your local water supply. But in places where sand is intensly extracted, water supply is also threatened since this leads to sinking of the water table.<br><br>I'll be in my cave if anyone needs me.<br><br>* one of these is unfortunately not discussed in this edition<br><br><a href=#c6926179144230835027 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 2:48 PM</a><br><br>

I think that since my family grew up on a farm, having 'nice things' is a sign of prosperity and security. <br><br>The weirdest occasion was at a pre-marriage counselling session, where a group of us were learning about how to keep a marriage healthy. We were asked to list activities we could do together as a couple, and TV was mentioned. My fiancee said we didn't watch TV, and the room went completely silent. Even the people in the other group across the room stopped and stared. Then the questions started. What do you do with your time? Well we drink tea, watch the chickens in the yard and talk to each other, you know? Eventually I said we watched movies on DVD sometimes, and at that moment an audible sigh of relief went up. All the tension in the room disappeared when I confirmed that we weren't entirely cut off from the screen.<br><br><a href=#c7892036913785233177 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 3:19 PM</a><br><br>

I think a lot of the screen tech reinforces just how little people are governed by the rational, and how much they're governed by the non-rational. No one's ever disproven all the reams of studies on the damage caused by TV, or ever really contested the claims made in the Shallows, yet, people just keep on with their screen addictions. For me, the more I disengage, the more sensitized I get to the medium, such that when I encounter it, I have a strong negative reaction. I'll extend that to cars &amp; driving--I've gotten really sensitized to how much I HATE sitting in a car, being on the road, or driving for long periods. This from a person who racked up a HUGE carbon footprint over the years behind the wheel. Of course, it probably didn't help that I was with a pro-positive New Ager on these road trips that was focused on increasing her "positive" energy such that she was "GO! GO! GO!" 24/7 and censoring any and all perceived "negative" comments. I had to regularly meditate to detox, relax, and unwind from the constant bombardment of "GO! GO! GO!" energy. I'm appreciating NOT driving, and making a real, intimate connection with my surroundings, and I'm sure that it helps my carbon footprint, as well.<br>@a Post Millenial<br>I see so much promise in you, and others like you. First of all, your not the 1st generation to get the raw end of the stick. As I mentioned last week, my cohorts have managed to get to 40-50, old enough to be your parents, without much to collectively show for it (a lot of debt, for one thing) So, we may not have it as bad as you do, but we certainly, collectively, haven't arrived. My biggest guilt as I look back on it, is that I DID take the blue pill, pretty much unconsciously. I was 5 when Reagan first took office, my earliest recollections were of gas prices bottoming out, yuppies flashing wealth, and limits to growth being pooh-pooh'd and dismissed, and discouraged ex hippies somehow fading into the woodwork. But you won't have that option, as JMG has mentioned, things WILL fall apart before long. Even though Lakeland and Twilight's Last Gleaming are fiction, they're based on what JMG thinks will actually happen. So, unlike me, you really DON'T have the option of "opting in" to a system whose days are numbered. Anyone who tells you otherwise is not being honest and DOES NOT have your best interests at heart. Lakeland is set in 2065, only 50 years from now (within your lifetime). To get to Lakeland, we first have to have all those crises first, we have to get beyond the US. My preference is for the rather Burkean peaceful dissolution laid out in Twilight's Last Gleaming. The point is, as JMG has mentioned, revolutions are carried out by the young. Look @ how old Che &amp; Castro were in '59. Look at the ages of other revolutionaries. That's why JMG said he's not concerned about the Tea Party--look around any Tea Party rally, and all you see are a bunch of angry old people. So, someday soon, people your age and younger are going to be looking around in bewilderment at themselves, standing in the middle of a state capital, wondering what the h*ll they just accomplished, just like the people dancing on the Berlin Wall. Don't be the Loyalist, this time--there won't be a Canada or Bahamas to flee to, this time. It's going to fall to you, and the people that come after you, that's who Lakeland is directed to. It can go anyway, and JMG's purpose in writing such a story is to help head off some Dystopia by providing some alternative. And it doesn't just have to be the Midwest, people in the South, inspired by I'll Take my Stand, could just as easily create something similar to Lakeland. What an awesome time for you to be the age you are, and to have such power!<br><br><a href=#c822571238899643737 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 3:29 PM</a><br><br>

It started out with food - stopped buying soft drinks and junk food in general; then came personal items - I make my own soap, for example ("but you buy shampoo!!"), use coconut oil as a moisturiser, and make my own salve for dry skin.<br><br>The microwave was donated a long time ago, 8 out of 10 loaves of bread in my home I make from scratch, though I am yet to master the art of sourdough. <br><br>In the past couple of years, I started learning about herbs and herbal folk medicine - the peasant's medicine. I infuse oils (for my herbal balms) and vodka (for tinctures) though I am at the very beginning of this learning curve. This is by far the most challenging given I live in tropical Queensland, Australia, and there is very little knowledge on how to use native tropical trees or herbs (yes some books will say "use for toothache" but the actual process of how to use it is not recorded, only what it's for).<br><br>I have a mobile phone with buttons, which I paid $20 brand new a couple of years ago. We do not have mobile coverage where we live, it is mainly to have with me when I travel in case of an emergency etc. People are almost in shock to see me use it. Needless to say I do not have a smart phone, or intend on ever getting one.<br><br>Some of these changes people find amusing; other changes, they are rather visibly stupefied by - women in particular are horrified that I use cloth pads, and don't get me started on my highest achievement to date, making washable "wee-wee" wipes from op-shop flannelette (this cut our toilet paper use considerably). As a new mother, I am the only one in my mother's group of 8 women to use washable nappies. Even when I tell people this, I've been challenged by some who insist that washable nappies use more resources in fact than disposable ones do... It just goes on and on.<br><br>We live on 5 acres in central Queensland, Australia, so have our own water collection, and also we are lucky that the house was actually built for the climate - thus we do not have air conditioning (summer here lasts for 6 solid months with daily average around 30-35 Celsius, more if it's a really hot summer). Not so the case with virtually 80% (conservative) existing housing stock, and about 100% of the new housing stock - all built with air conditioning throughout, because the houses themselves do not take into account climatic factors.... <br><br>Anyway - thanks for the slide ruler tip for my astrology class on chart drawing. Will have to check this out sometime soon. Thank you for another great blog post, I thoroughly enjoy reading these :) Monica.<br><br><a href=#c2849613021050276690 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 3:37 PM</a><br><br>

I very much recognise the reactions you describe. It's not just in the US that people react like that, but also many people here in Sweden (the country with a reputation for being so progressive and open).<br>Apart from not having a TV or smartphone as I commented on your last post, another thing I get people reacting to like I'm a weirdo is the fact that I don't have a car. When I need a car (a couple of times a year) I rent one, which saves me an immense amount of expenses compared to owning a car. Many of my cousins and colleagues often comment on that. For example when I turn up for a family gathering in a shiny rented car a cousin might say "Hey what a cool car you've bought!" but when he realises I've just rented it's not cool any more.<br>These people come up with all sorts of reasons why I should buy a car - "freedom" is one of the most common. But "freedom" to me is not having to bother about repairs, taxes, insurance, changing tyres etc, and let the car rental firm take care of all that.<br>When I explain this freedom and also the detailed calculations I've made of how much money I save, and that since I save so much money I often take a taxi when I'm feeling lazy they say that they understand but they still want their "freedom". I've even had people telling me they are insulted when I say that they would also save money and time by not owning a car. "My car is a non-negotiable part of my life style." (Yes that's an actual quote)<br>Then they might try to convince me of the "impression factor" that owning a car has. I never cared for that kind of "status marker".<br>I live in a middle class suburb of Stockholm and as far as I can see mine is the only household in the neighbourhood that doesn't own at least one car. This is in spite of the fact that public transport in the area is excellent with buses into town running so often I don't even have to bother checking the time table.<br><br><a href=#c6422951247862292634 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 3:37 PM</a><br><br>

We may actually have a President Trump, and if he does somehow get assassinated before taking office, it will be even worse. In that case, it will be the RESPONSIBILITY of reasonable people to separate/dissolve from such a disaster. People's opinions are all over the map--my own mother expressed support for both Gov. Bevin &amp; Trump today, after just recently saying what a horror they would be. (To our Canadian friends, particularly in Ontario, yes, the Trump/Ford connection has been made, complete with plenty of photos of the two together.)<br>I've been voraciously consuming the spectacle that is Donald Trump of late, and I'm quite bemused, in a horrified kinda way. I'm not at all convinced that it's a given he'll lose the nomination, or the general election, if it comes to that. Popcorn time, indeed.<br>I'd just spend the past summer on a biodynamic farm in Ontario, and it was a joy seeing how little you need, how much you can learn, and just how comfortable you can be in a cold home. To Pablo above, my mother, too, is adamant that I can't just "give up" and "go be a hermit", and it's impossible to discuss collapse with her, we just go round and round in circles on the topic.<br>Related to the above, I'm so disappointed how so much is coopted in to the system. "Black Lives Matter" isn't in the fold, of say, Stokely Carmichael and Black Power, it just about going to the powers that be and demanding justice, working within the system, not working outside of it. Same for the riots that happen. I get so disappointed seeing violence wasted in such a disorganized fashion. It's a shame it's not yet being organized against the system. Then something like "Oath Keepers" is run by old Tea Partiers, and reliably supports controversial right wing stuff, complete with the "stamp of approval" of a GOP congressman. If you have an idea, people are like, "oh, here, start a 501©3 and start up your charity" (coopted by the system) People waste so much time "being legit" and having their ideas and energy neutered in order to be "above board" &amp; "legal".<br><br><a href=#c2273026227618723705 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 3:56 PM</a><br><br>

A worthy quote! We could go on like this for quite a while too. ! I noted in the story of the “Hour of the Dragon” that Conan considered a three thousand year old coin handed to him and I wondered what our left over materials would look like in three thousand years and thought that perhaps some may even survive intact. I know that my clippers were advertised as containing titanium in the cutting edge blades and thought that manufacturing inclusion was perhaps a bit over the top and extreme for simple clippers.<br><br>The actual quote from the story was: "Conan had handled many coins in the years of his plunderings, and had a good practical knowledge of them. The edges were worn and the inscription almost obliterated. But the countenance stamped on one side was still clear-cut and distinct." Fiction is an excellent medium.<br><br>Incidentally, I've also been trying to get my head around the coming retreat of the comfortable jobs that people have become used to in developed countries. I have seen how it rolls for people living in third world countries and am under no allusions on the subject. Also it appears to me that jobs have little in the way of historic parallels so it can only be a product of the industrial revolution and as such is directly linked to its rise and fall. Dunno, just thinking aloud really, because it appears to me that a lack of jobs ultimately foments violent actions and change.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c1156433029791060505 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 7:36 PM</a><br><br>

What the hell? You'd think that by the reaction to this post that the Archdruid had just suggested that all bicycles be crushed up and recycled as SUVS or something. OK, I'll add a random thought or two here.<br> We talk here about how people are so wrapped up in TV, the internet and the like that we forget that this is not a new phenomenon. Not even close. In researching the town that my grandfather was brought up in, I came a cross an article of the "I-remember-when" type on this town written back in the 1920s. In it, the person was talking how the streets of this town at the turn of the century were always bustling and that especially on a Saturday night the streets were thronging with people and the town lit up by gas lights. He noted in sadness that now the streets were nearly deserted of a night and the place was like a morgue. The reason for this change? People were all inside theaters now watching the new moving pictures! Was it the same when mass book printing first started up?<br> Here is a thought experiment for now, though. What if those of us with TVs (hand up in the air!) could set them to ration out, say, 7 hours of TV a week using software. A decade ago I would have used the word device. Now watch us sweat when we start adding up what we watch in the TV guides in terms of time allowed. Then put the pressure on by saying that any TV ads in any TV program also count as part of that 7 hours. You certainly would not waste any time watching a TV program based on watching people's reaction to watching TV programs. I kid you not - it is called Gogglebox! You also would not waste time on watching a news program where TV journalist are interviewing other TV journalist on how to react to a story because talking to people on the street can be too unpredictable. You could do the same experiment by limiting how long a mobile phone would work as well so that it would only work for a total of one hour a day. I reckon that it would be a fascinating experience for many people.<br> One final thought here. After some twenty years of staring through our screens into the internet it is only the past few years that we have become aware of how much the internet is staring back at us. Makes it sound like some sort of abyss, doesn't it? In stating this thought, it is only now that I am realizing that a book by contrast is a very private thing. It doesn't watch you or measure how often you turn the pages (unlike its digital counterpart) and the act of reading it implies both privacy and downtime. I note how both the last concepts seem to be falling out of favour the past few years. Some now even find the concept of solitude as either uncomfortable or even unnecessary. We live as strangers now in a very strange land.<br><br><a href=#c1482095313048487199 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 7:43 PM</a><br><br>

Conversely, I have to constantly remind myself that there are lots of people that like sterile, over-crowded, stressful environments where no fresh breezes scented by green grass blow and no birds sing in the morning. <br><br>It is interesting that you have appropriated Plato's cave and taken it in an almost diametrically opposite direction. Whereas, if I remember correctly, Plato used the analogy to argue for the reality of a non-material realm of ideal forms i.e. a higher level of abstraction, you are using it to refer to and highlight the reality of the natural phenomena outside the cave, in other words less abstraction.

Who is losing out? Is it serving us or consuming us?' And this last question is one that is often lost in the rush towards big, new, shiny technologies. Is it actually better, for you and me, in our lives, right now? Is it so much better that its benefits mitigate its inevitable downsides?<br><br>This is where I see the benefits of an education in the humanities. Science and technology produce marvellous things, but it is not discriminating. It also produces terrible things, and only by asking very penetrating questions about the meaning and quality of our lives are we able to judge whether a particular product of science is enhancing or degrading the quality of our lives. This links back directly to JMG's series on the religion of progress. If we reject 'progress', then we are unbelievers, and we undermine society, therefore we must be excommunicated.. <br><br>and I think that in judiciously selecting technologies that work for us, we are committing a worse crime than if we rejected them all (all?? Where do you draw the line?) because then we are also rejecting the binary on-off switch of modern thinking - that you are either for us or against us.<br><br>In choosing some technologies and refusing others we are, in effect, rejecting 'progress' as a god, and putting it back where it belongs, as something that should serve us and our ends. <br><br>I read hundreds of books every year, and write down the best bits in my little blue notebook. With a pen. Here is a gem from Schumacher's 'Small is Beautiful' - 'No doubt, a price has to be paid for anything worthwhile: to redirect technology so that it serves man instead of destroying him requires primarily an effort of the imagination and an abandonment of fear.'<br><br>Now this cuts directly to the heart of JMG's thesis as I read it, and have experienced it. Some technology makes us more stupid, less happy, less connected, more unhealthy, wrecks our habitat, hurts our fellow humans. Abandoning such technology makes us happier, calmer, healthier human beings. Why, as a society, would we not throw it away en masse? Because, as a society we are terrified of reality, and have lost our capacity for bold, imaginative action.<br><br>But here at ADR, we are of course, happy and creative freedom-fighters:)<br><br><br><br><a href=#c3592483828930631683 title="comment permalink">11/26/15, 11:07 PM</a><br><br>

We were talking about how climate change will impact our careers and what we could do to prepare for it. One fellow had already mulled it over and his reasoning appeared to be quite mature. Most held a version of the technofix myth that ranged from the unlikely to the outrageously impossible. The conversation then steered toward geoengineering, which seems like a possible career path more and more every day. I don't want to get into the " as if humans (...) " and " you can't mess with one variable without it rippling through the entire system ". I get all that; I spent most of my adult life studying such things. Anyway, everyone said what they wanted to say, but there was one guy who was frankly insulted that almost nobody in the technosphere -- the group -- we're very fond of orbital elevators and mining asteroids. At one point I told him : " It's just that even if it were technically feasible, I don't think it's a good idea to send small nuclear bombs up the atmosphere in a physics-defying elevator to go mine asteroids so that we can keep building more iPhones while Indonesia and much of the world is on fire and the oceans are going from breathing CO2 to exhaling methane " and all hell broke loose. He literally got up his chair and shouted " Are you even engineers or are you a bunch of Amish? " to which I burst out laughing and calmed things down by telling him how much I liked him for being so insane. Anyway, my point is that I think geoengineering is one of the elephants in the room when it comes to technologies that will be forced down the throats of many when the day comes. Maybe one day instead of reading about the Fed's rate hike in the morning's newspaper we'll read about how much aerosols were dumped in the sky the previous week and we'll look back and wonder how we ever made due without tailor made hurricanes and pretty(ier) sunsets.<br><br><a href=#c2382821144405601996 title="comment permalink">11/27/15, 12:52 AM</a><br><br>

He elicited the co-operation of a twenty-two-year-old secretary and taped a single electrode to the back of her head. The wire from this electrode connected to a Grass Model 7 Polygraph, which in turn interfaced with a Honeywell 7600 computer and a CAT 400B computer.<br><br>"Flicking on the TV, Krugman began monitoring the brain-waves of the subject What he found through repeated trials was that within about thirty seconds, the brain-waves switched from predominantly beta waves, indicating alert and conscious attention, to predominantly alpha waves, indicating an unfocused, receptive lack of attention: the state of aimless fantasy and daydreaming below the threshold of consciousness. When Krugman's subject turned to reading through a magazine, beta waves reappeared, indicating that conscious and alert attentiveness had replaced the daydreaming state.<br><br>"What surprised Krugman, who had set out to test some McLuhanesque hypotheses about the nature of TV-viewing, was how rapidly the alpha-state emerged. Further research revealed that the brain's left hemisphere, which processes information logically and analytically, tunes out while the person is watching TV. This tuning-out allows the right hemisphere of the brain, which processes information emotionally and noncritically, to function unimpeded. 'It appears,' wrote Krugman in a report of his findings, 'that the mode of response to television is more or less constant and very different from the response to print. That is, the basic electrical response of the brain is clearly to the medium and not to content difference.... [Television is] a communication medium that effortlessly transmits huge quantities of information not thought about at the time of exposure.'<br><br><a href=#c3876904419303688300 title="comment permalink">11/27/15, 3:58 AM</a><br><br>

(He was on a tv talk show, 'natch). Movie stars, said Mailer, come across as hyper-realistic, mythic figures, and because they are bigger-than-life glamour-totems, they are also ultimately unreal. Yes, having an 8 ft tall face can tend to do that to a person. Mailer then pointed out that television, by contrast, seemingly diminishes a person to an easily digestible, user-friendly figure who's in your living room with you. The effect, said Mailer, is that you get the impression that you actually know the people who are just "being themselves" on tv. But of course, you don't. <br><br>Thinking about this now, I tend to see tv as a glamour-posing-as-anti-glamour hellbeast. As glamourings go, that's pretty insidious. You don't necessarily feel seduced, but yes, you have been. <br><br>Btw, Mailer prbly picked up some of his ideas on tv from Marshall McCluhan who I've never really read. <br><br><br><a href=#c1320516315860383791 title="comment permalink">11/27/15, 11:20 AM</a><br><br>

Back then, it was 30 channels, and nothing to watch. Instead of 300. After about 6 months, I realized how silly the whole thing was. And, how much time it was taking out of my life. So, I returned the cable box to the cable store. There was a bit of a line.<br><br>When I got up to the window, to return the box and discontinue service, the nice young lady asked why I was discontinuing service. I said "I can't stand to watch "Clash of the Titans", one more time." The people behind me, cheered.<br><br>Back when I had a bookstore, I needed a phone somewhere in the whole electronic mess that allowed me to take credit cards. I had an old rotary phone that worked just fine. A young woman came in to ask to use the phone. Phone booths being few and far between, these days. I said sure and handed her the rotary phone. She starred at it for the longest time and I had to take it back and show her how to use it. :-). Lew<br><br><a href=#c1949741193198386443 title="comment permalink">11/27/15, 12:47 PM</a><br><br>

I do have cable internet and use Netflix. For the little it costs, and commercial free, I can watch things I find interesting, and skip those that are not. So it has literally been years since I watched even news, preferring to read a paper or internet sources.<br><br>As an exercise, yesterday I hooked the cable box up and turned the TV on. I saw the news, and a goodly portion of the local news constantly suggested I make comments on Twitter or 'like' them on Facebook. Portions of the sports segment did the same, referring me to "blah-blah.com" or else to Tweet or comment on their Facebook page. A segment was used to talk about Fantasy Football, where a local guy had won over $10,000. <br><br>So, IMHO, when TV is referring us to online sites, and online sites are buying TV ad space, aren't we in sort of a Mobius Strip of madness that only benefits a very few folks? When the TV news urges us to go to their website for more information, why?<br><br>To be fair, I went to the local station website, where I watched in amazement as my Disconnect App recorded 35 tracking or analytic programs attempting to load....and then surfed back to sites I prefer with quite the wry smile on my mug.<br><br>I don't use Facebook (Faceplant, as my kids now call it) or Linked-In or Twitter. These are all simply time wasters - I have no need to converse in little tweets (twits?) about my day with people I have never met. I have no desire to build a large following or a trend of likers - I just don't care about that.<br><br>The news was awful - banal, inaccurate and very over-hyped. Including terror warnings and veiled suggestions of islamic radicals pouring into the US from Mexico. International news was relegated to a single story about refugees in europe. The weather was hyped beyond belief - talking of scattered severe thunderstorms and warning people to be careful - for goodness sake, it was a cloudy day with some scattered thunderheads. Every other local news item included a reference to online websites and solicited comments for the same.<br><br>I am now very firmly convinced that regardless of "content", TV has become as boring as most of the internet. Most of what is blasted across websites is untrue or highly slanted, lots of clickbait and time-wasting headlines that go elsewhere. It seems TV has become similar, even to the point of urging one to go to the internet for more 'information'. It is almost like a cult of cons and shills playing to the masses. I detest it, and unhooking the cable box from my screen was honestly a relief. Instead, we played guitars and drank beer and talked - guess my family is just very old fashioned and Luddistic?<br><br>And I was utterly amazed at the number of drug ads where the benefits took 10 seconds to cover and the side effects took the remaining 50...egads!<br><br>No, I do not need commercial television. Netflix is fine as I control content choice and am free to watch at my convenience rather than a particular broadcast time. And nobody is urging me to make a twit or faceplant about anything.<br><br>I don't need a smartphone - talking and SMS when out of talking range suffices. I do enjoy the internet, but the instantaneous nature of it lends itself to rabid knee-jerk discourse and thus it isn't at all courteous discourse in most venues. Anonymity lends itself to rudeness because there are no social repercussions. <br><br>No - I think picking and choosing technologies which you prefer to use or participate in should be the norm. There are some very unrealistic expectations working in our world, and both television and the internet seem to require everyone to accept these expectations. With smartphones now being an extension of phone and TV and internet - the same holds true and now resides in your pocket. <br><br>No - I much prefer real people, social consequences and the honesty required for those.<br><br><a href=#c1064780360776367316 title="comment permalink">11/27/15, 1:56 PM</a><br><br>

That is to say, most if not all of what we carry around in our heads and think of as ourselves arise from our interactions with the world, starting when in infancy we instinctively reach out and grasp things and pull them toward our mouths. By "world" I mean everything we encounter, including the natural world, other people, artifacts, text, and images. Our physical brains give us the ability to collect and process that "stuff," and our individual genetic makeup strongly affects how we process and select and assemble the bits and pieces, but neither of those account for the actual content of ourselves. Experiences, knowledge, memories, skills, and beliefs aren't built in. We gather them from without. (If we do have souls or past-life karma, we don't seem to have much access to what might have been written there before we started interacting with the world.)<br><br>So, what happens to that process when much of that world is screened from our view and replaced with stylized caricature? What happens when it's replaced with reflections of ourselves? (That latter question has an answer, provided by noting what happens to every dictator and celebrity whose portrait ends up papering city walls: we go insane.) What color is a chameleon on a mirror?<br><br>Narcissus's problem wasn't seeing his reflection, it was missing everything else in the process, until there was no self left to stare at.<br><br><a href=#c688109597482835770 title="comment permalink">11/27/15, 2:30 PM</a><br><br>

There is something wrong with that.<br><br>Last but not least, I can't help but think about what we're gonna see later tonight. Consumerism on steroids.

Twits of course! <br><br>I have always disliked nuts (though I am a great fan of peanut butter) and as a young child it always irked me that people who cooked walnuts into brownies seemed to think it was a great treat. I would always meticulously pick out the nuts so I could eat the brownies, much to the vexation of the adult who had gone to all the trouble of cooking them in. I recall many years ago at a Christmas party being offered a bowl of nuts and trying to politely turn it down. The lady offering me the bowl (I dont even remember who she was now) just didnt seem to believe that I didn't like them and kept insisting I should try one. Finally, just to get her to leave me alone, I picked out a nut and sat chewing it with a very sullen expression <br>on my face. Needless to say I was offered no more nuts!<br><br>Four hundred and ten, Yikes no wonder it's taking so long to read through the comments! I missed some of the ones you note in your latest post. If someone gave me a TV I didnt want, I would politely accept but after waiting a decent interval, stick it out at a yard sale. That might smack of ingratitude but the gift of more stuff that you repeatedly indicated you don't want but got anyway doesnt exactly constitute generosity on the part of the giver. And don't forget bread making machines. That's another gee-whiz gizmo we don't really need (sorry). I only happened to think of that when making bread today (by hand), an activity I <br>much prefer to the one involving visiting the local madhouse known as Walmart.<br><br>As someone else mentioned, you definitely hit a nerve with last weeks post. The feeling we have been heading down the wrong path over the past half century or more seems to be growing. Those of us of the older generations see no real advantage to much of the cornucopia of allegedly labor saving devices that have popped up over the years and so cheerfully do without. Increasing numbers of the newer arrivals are catching on to the fact that none of these devices actually improve the quality of life but only add to the waste stream when they break.<br><br>For those still mesmerized by the myth of progress, we're an uncomfortable eye-opener to the fact that it's not only possible to live without this stuff but actually be happy doing it.

I appreciate the negative too, as it allows me insight and compassion to what the angry techno-philes are feeling, where they're coming from. I get why they're angry.<br><br>For me personally, like others here, writing from outside the US, I don't feel a lot of pushback or hostility about my low and very selective tech use. Maybe I'm just not paying attention, but here in Asia, we're kind of schizophrenic uber-tech-embracers and rejectors. We luuuurve shiny high-tech-gizmos, even obviously pointless ones, but we are horrifically cheap, cheap, CHEAP! We are also closer to the externalized costs of those gizmos. I'm not alone here, in individually based selection, even amongst the wealthy.<br><br>I also love/hate the use of Plato's Analogy of the Cave - it has always given me the heebee-jeebee's. IMHO, it's far more dire and impacting that those Matrix films. But<br>@ mgalimba: Forgive me but I think you're wrong in your comment. From what I've understood - Plato was saying the reality we see day to day, like the shadows on the wall, are only a tiny facet of what's really out there, so tiny as to really be a filter or an unreality. The real reality includes a whole universe we may sense and feel, but cannot tangibly see or hold - we've been taught from childhood to ignore it as unreal, so most of us cannot sense it anymore, like the cave dwellers, the shadows, (filter) become our reality and we don't even want to see or sense more. In this understanding, I think JMG is simply updating the Analogy of the Cave to virtual/media reality. TV sets in the caves - perfect, IMHO.<br><br>* Just a note, In the following, I'm not intending to lecture - just thinking/typing out loud to figure things out:<br><br>As a US citizen living abroad, I totally get this as I get my news and understanding of what's happening back home, the buzz, what the 'social temperature' of my fellow Americans back home are thinking; I get most of this the only way I can - virtually, through the internet and TV. I am FULLY aware that what I'm getting is a skewed, filtered picture. From what we see abroad, Americans are the stupidest, craziest people on the planet! Nothing they do makes sense! Yet, as I've lived most of my life as one, I KNOW this is not true - what I'm, (we're) seeing is a very warped sensationalized picture. BUT My fellow American's 'on-the-ground', back home are getting the same info via internet and TV that I'm getting here, in addition to real info, (talking to neighbors, friends, etc) I think they don't see as clearly, that they are also getting a massive dose of skewed version of reality about themselves, their country, their place in the world. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c7356679005332483031 title="comment permalink">11/27/15, 6:00 PM</a><br><br>

This is found here locally as well. It has it's up-sides: It's easy, lazy, it offers a much much broader range of people and perspectives, I can stay in touch with friends and family all over the world. <br> but it also has it's downsides. Apart from instances like my 15 yr old's, most of the virtual connections, info and insights are extremely shallow and vaporous. The heaviest downsides have been outlined here repeatedly by JGM and fellow commenters: prosthetic/amputation, a tsunami of externalized costs, and finally, simply unsustainable, oh yeah - there's that!<br><br>When I first came to HK, I was a stay-at-home-mom with 2 babies - we joined 3 of the many free available neighborhood or apt. building playgroups and got together with other moms and babies weekly. We moms gave each other advice, comfort, laughter, friendship, as locals and expats from everywhere we had parenting insights from every corner of the globe to follow, laugh at or both. As my kids got older, many expats moved on or back home, the demographic and life changed. I'm still in touch with those moms, for that I'm happy to have the internet (upside!). I went back to work and am not in that SAHM 'world' anymore, but have joined a facebook group called Hong Kong Moms. It's all I've required of late, in 'staying in touch', (this for personal emotional reasons). Sadly, I have noticed that occasionally there are new moms asking where to find an in person playgroup or just a bunch o moms getting together with their babies and toddlers - and there are none! None!! I feel very sad for them - we've all gotten so used to 'connecting' online that no one does it in person anymore. <br><br>As to those personal emotional issues - I know I've used the distance / filter of shallow connections as a crutch for the past 4 years. Only in the last 2-3 months, I'm starting to forget to sign in from day to day, so I think I'm beginning to outgrow my crutch. I do really appreciate this site and venue, but there will probably come a Thursday, (your Wed.) when I'm too busy and forget to check in. I'll say Thank You again now, in case I just wander off at some point! <br><br>JMG: Your essays and the commentary here have been super helpful and very very much appreciated.<br><br><a href=#c2483147957801166705 title="comment permalink">11/27/15, 6:01 PM</a><br><br>

I have read theories that staring at fires late at night in some way enhanced or sparked human intelligence. I wonder if there is some deep neurological trigger that fire (or a flickering TV in a dark living room) that enables deep thought. The difference, of course, is that a fire does not project human ideas and therefore requires the watcher, or his/her community to provide them. I wonder, for example, is there is much difference between reading a book from paper, e-ink or a backlit LCD screen (there are aesthetic differences, but whether they affect how the reader responds to the information contained in the text is not clear to me). Based on my own subjective experience, although I like reading out of real books much more than I like reading off electronic devices, and prefer an e-ink display to a LCD display, I am not sure I interpret what I am reading differently.<br><br>Regarding an earlier comment about the people who cast shadows on the cave not being dumb... knowing some very amateur level cave-shadowers, NO THEY AREN'T.

Tools work for us, but our fancy gizmos have somehow convinced people it's the other way around.<br><br>Consider how many people text while driving, knowing that people get badly injured and killed this way. Even people who drove for decades without a phone and know full well that constant communication while driving is unnecessary, are completely unable to turn the darn thing off and put it away while they drive. It's as if their smartphones tell them what to do, and not the other way around.<br><br>Television is treated the same way, especially by older generations who don't stream their favorite movies and programs onto tablets and smart phones. Many people think you aren't properly informed if you don't have a TV or if you aren't watching the 6 o'clock news. It's useless to point out that you read multiple news sources online and cross-check stories of interest to get a more in-depth and nuanced view. You're somehow not as well-informed as the person who believes every sound bite. Go figure.<br><br>Consider the behavior of early-adopters, who will camp overnight outside the nearest Apple Store to be one of the first to purchase a slightly speedier version of the perfectly good phone they already have. This is a classic case of having one's life dictated by technology and not the other way around.<br><br>I'm far from being a luddite, but I rarely watch TV because I'm not fond of any sort of passive entertainment. I'd rather paint than go to an art museum. I'd rather play music than go to a concert. I'll dance as often in the day as the spirit moves me, but dance recitals quickly bore me. There would be no TV in my house at all if not for that my husband loves it.<br><br>I also tend to be a bit behind the times on technology, but this is mainly a cost/benefit analysis. If my current phone and computer meet my needs, why waste money on an upgrade? What would I do with a fancy tablet that I can't do with my laptop? Once I see a good use for something, I'm happy enough to buy a gadget, but I refuse to be bullied into it just because it's the latest thing.<br><br>What's interesting to me is that even people who claim to be uninterested in the latest technology often speak of it in terms that suggest that these aren't tools but evil overlords that once purchased, must be obeyed. How many people say they don't want a smartphone because they don't want to be on call all the time? How could that happen unless you want it to? All phones, smart and otherwise, have off switches or can have the alerts turned off. (Try to call me at an unscheduled time and see how far you get with that!) The only way you can be a slave to a phone or any other device is if you allow yourself to be. <br><br>We, the humans, have the ultimate power over our technology. Maybe this is what some people find so disturbing about those of us who aren't led around on a technological leash: at some subconscious level they realize they've willingly chosen their tech-slavery and we're living proof that it doesn't have to be that way.<br><br><a href=#c5818987100452652847 title="comment permalink">11/27/15, 10:46 PM</a><br><br>

Fortunately, I had the comfortable train trip into and back out from the big smoke today after the Green Wizards meetup to meditate upon your essay. I must say that my reaction was a bit grumpy, but please perhaps indulge me a few minutes of your time for me to explain myself more fully.<br><br>Some people set out to leave vast monuments of their works for later generations to marvel at. Look at the pyramids for example - or even our nuclear reactors of today. In millennia to come they'll still be there and people will wonder at them and marvel - perhaps not in a good way with ours though. In a century no one will remember me and that is how I prefer the whole matter to rest. It seems to me that Plato was a pretty switched on dude, because in your cave example he provided a mental model for people to wonder upon. I can almost hear him laughing at us all now: What did Plato mean by that cave model? Learned discussions will be had, papers will be written on the model, degrees will be handed out by august institutions and careers will be made. And Plato steers the conversation still.<br><br>But to me it appears that what Plato is trying to achieve is to get people to think in abstract terms, thereby collectively turning their backs on their learned and observed experiences and introducing the concept that it is OK to ignore all of those experiences and lessons and concentrate instead on the abstract. He's good, I certainly couldn't have come up with such a clever ruse. It is genius really and I guess that is why we are discussing the dude 2,300 years later.<br><br>However, I give Plato the middle finger (which is me trying to be very punk!) because whilst that sort of thinking can be very valuable, it has been so thoroughly over used in our society that it is no longer a valuable method of looking at the world. People don't even see that they are using such outmoded ways of interacting with the natural world.<br><br>And just in case anyone is interested as to how I came up with that conclusion, it was quite simple really. Plato is effectively describing the existence of a human being in a dungeon deprived of sensory input. That is a bad place and I imagined it myself as I read the text. That human then escapes the dungeon and learns of the experience of the outside world. Tidy work! At that point however, Plato lost me because his protagonist in the story went back to the dungeon. No one in their right mind would do that, but here Plato slips in the meme that it is OK to ignore your perceived reality and experience and just go with this wholly imaginary other world of make believe and abstract concepts. I don't buy it as it stinks of black magic to me.<br><br>The unfortunate thing is that today you can find yourself living in a magician state where every day people as well as people in authority say the most preposterous things and you have to stand back and say I'm not going into that cave that you lot inhabit. Plato's cave is a prison of the mind and I strongly suspect that he created that prison for his own purposes. Anyway, the cave is clearly full of trolls and should be avoided at all costs. Be wary people!<br><br>I'm not playing his game. Nuff said.<br><br>PS: By the way, excellent essay and I declare that the Melbourne Green Wizards meeting today was a total success! Now, a nice ginger wine will help soothe my completely jangled nerves, I’m not built for going head to head with the likes of Plato, you know. Thanks for the challenge though. Plato – Pah! A good swift kick would have taken him out! Conan would never have fallen for such abstract silliness. This thought popped into my mind right at the final proofread: Beli is a much wiser guide to life in uncertain times.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c4508709213399706030 title="comment permalink">11/28/15, 1:44 AM</a><br><br>

Also they pass on warnings and tips to each other (Barrett House is full, Joy Junction kicked out a couple with heathen tattoos last year, etc...)to each other at times.

Some of these new "premium cable dramas", I have found worth watching and have sacrificed not inconsiderable blocks of time occasionally in so doing. I always feel ashamed, though, after spending a couple of hours watching a show or broadcast movie, as If I could have done something much more productive with the time.

I've gone years without a car living in big towns working as a cutting edge computer engineer. I spent years without a cell phone, even to the point that my job finally offered me a free one - which I accepted but said I would only use for business calls during business hours. <br><br>I received comments, pushback, and occasionally have been the punchline of some not-so-funny jokes about this from friends, family, and coworkers. But I've never felt pressured to change, and I've never felt it impacted my friendships or career. People don't understand some of my choices, so I explain it. Sometimes they listen, but usually they don't. But rather than feeling like a victim, I'm grateful that they want to be a part of my life, and are sincere in wanting the best for me (even if I believe they are misguided), and I also want the best for them (and admit that I could be misguided about them). <br><br>If someone were to put a laptop on my lap and ask me to watch a show I didn't care to watch, I would politely decline and probably never think of it again. If they were a real friend who just wanted to bond over something as silly as a TV show, I would consider it a complement that they reached out to me in such a way - even as I rejected the offer. I'd use it as an opportunity to find some other connection we could share, because obviously the desire is there.<br><br>I don't bring this up to reign down judgment on all the green wizards out there, I am very much like you guys. But I think as soon as you feel defensive about your choices, then you quickly risk becoming a negative voice of the cause you are trying to support. My observation is that people who have actually affected positive change in the world are always confident, self-assured, and remain positive in their message. I won't claim to be some great voice of the eco-technic future that adopts only appropriate technology, but I am beyond feeling insecure about my choices. I hope most of you are secure in that as well, because it makes life a lot more fun. I know I'm having a blast.<br><br><a href=#c9191758856875604910 title="comment permalink">11/28/15, 8:20 AM</a><br><br>

Interpretations of reality are very important to many or most people in this hell/prison/funny farm because subconsciously we all know that we have very little access to it (reality) and yet how are we to make a jailbreak if we don't even know a little bit about the layout? Religion and science/progress are strong competitors. It does not matter if you know a religious person who is strongly attached to salvation through progress. People quite often don't worship the deities they claim to, or are promiscuous.<br><br>Device addiction: Why does it bother (some of) us so much? I have noted that nature and physical reality are our anchors to sanity. It is our bedrock. Since life is but a dream anyway, without that constant contact with physical reality, our minds would quickly come untethered and we would all begin to dream different dreams. Total chaos and isolation. Which would be terrifying. When we see our compatriots engaging in less and less reality check, it makes us nervous. But if life is a dream, is it even true that physical reality equates to sanity? And yet, those are the rules of this maze -- ignore physical reality and you get offed.<br><br>TV and dreams: It is really, really important that we dream the same dreams together. Since most belief systems are largely nonsense, we need that confirmation that our belief system is not utterly silly (which it usually is). Since TV is fantasy anyway, it is nice to have lots of others who have indulged in the same fantasy. This desire is related to the confirmation we get when others interpret reality as we do. <br><br>JMG "To pummel the city councillors, see them fleeing before you, and hear the lamentations of the media -- that is best." <br><br>Genghis Khan?<br><br><a href=#c2459493154432272557 title="comment permalink">11/28/15, 11:11 AM</a><br><br>

I do not want the fixed monthly bill that comes with a house phone or regular cell phone. A prepaid phone costs me about $200 a year, at the rate I use minutes, used only when necessary. This precludes long conversations, which is fine because a long email or meeting at the coffeeshop is better anyway. I would be OK with not having a phone at all except that I would risk becoming a nonperson, in the world as it is now. In a future scenario where universal phone service is absent, where I am not expected to have one, I will be very happy to speak to others in person.<br>So I guess that makes me a "moderate," on the Luddite/Technophiles scale. I just spent 20 days in the back country, and took the cell phone along. Even to me, that seems a little incongruous, but it was practical because I had hired someone to take care of my cats and wanted to know if anything was wrong. I was forced to use the cell phone sparingly to save the battery; I would turn it on once a day on top of a ridge, so it seemed like a correct use of technology.<br><br><a href=#c2742261416897768002 title="comment permalink">11/28/15, 11:52 AM</a><br><br>

But I remember when you went to the store with a written list. The idea that someone would buy an auxiliary power system, just to play computer games is a bit strange to me. I feel that one of the reasons the whole Alternative Tech thing went away, is that it showed how simple manual machines could easily replace powered ones. Trade in your weed wacker for a brush whip, etc. And finally I contrasted two TV shows about wood working. "The Woodwright's Shop" explained traditional manual working of wood, by means of fairly simple tools, easily constructed. "The New Yankee Workshop" took you through each step of constructing something useful or decorative in wood. The problem was that each step seemed to require another power tool (their sponsor was a power tool mfg) .<br><br><a href=#c3206750635956895001 title="comment permalink">11/28/15, 1:13 PM</a><br><br>

The debate currently seems to be hinging on a very narrow definition, primarily electronics and how this particular type of technology rules people's lives or how we are able to free ourselves from its grasp. (Content delivered through the technology, though, seems to be just as despised as the technology itself.) However, a talking stick is technology. The Great Wall of China is technology. (Can I posit that religion is a technology. Building a society from a doctrine - a suite of tools - is technology.) Is the unspoken assumption that older, or more primitive technologies, or those less electric-y are safe and/or don't have the power to corrupt or consume lives. Let's ask the remains of the slaves buried in the foundations of the Great Wall or in the pyramids. I've suffered through a talking stick being abused. Certainly I'm not the only one, where one person has tried to dominate a gathering through its control. Humanity's history is full of excess in the utilization of its technology.<br><br>The issue, to me, is in our own nature. JMG's example of the mice with the spilt grain at the beginning of Ecotechnic Future is as pertinent to the overuse of technology, the abuse of ideas, as much as to the overuse of fossil fuel. <br><br>Imagine a new technology (invented at any point in history to solve some particular problem) as a stack of 'get out of jail free' cards. The card is played and we're out of that pickle. It worked so wonderfully, so we play another... and another. We get used to getting off scot-free, enjoy not having to wrestle with that particular pickle, the ease it creates, so we come to play from the stack of cards more and more. Is the technology that solved a problem the issue or our inappropriate and incessant use of it. Antibiotics have a valid and important function, which putting into animals' daily feed or into hand sanitizer are not examples of. I guess if Lassie had a cellphone handy when Timmy fell down a well we might consider that a good thing. But as a crutch to mask our soul-crushing loneliness or inability to interact with others? It prevents us from the necessity of having to learn important lessons or to face inevitable facts.<br><br><a href=#c4581442689141404660 title="comment permalink">11/28/15, 1:37 PM</a><br><br>

As I understand it, unless you are on call for work, in which case it's one call and goodbye, you arrange that the time you spend in company is not repeatedly interrupted by the phone. You do not initiate calls. You turn the ringtone off and let calls roll over to voicemail. If you receive one particular call that is important to you, when it comes you apologize, step away, tell the caller when you will call back, or you converse for less than a minute, ring off, and apologize again for the interruption. You get one of these per social occasion. If you get another, sticking around is plain rude. <br><br>Some kinds of multitasking may be acceptable on informal social occasions; I would include in that list minding children and dogs, needlework and some chores. Communicating with people who aren't present is not allowed unless all the people who are present can join the conversation.<br><br><a href=#c6443347627245548031 title="comment permalink">11/28/15, 3:52 PM</a><br><br>

"<br><br>I immediately thought of all the anecdotes related here recently about how people's family and friends and especially parents had mini freak outs when we decided to forgo some or all tech devices. What are they afraid of? We don't - at least yet - have enforcers who stalk you and break you kneecaps for going against the system. <br><br>It is also interesting to note the book repeatedly returns to the theme of racism as being as symptom of autocracy, and states on this same page that "those regions with a history of autocracy have significantly lower values of trust and respect for others..." As we see being demonstrated right now in reaction to Syrian refugees. But if you ask anybody they will insist that we absolutely do not live in an autocracy.<br><br>Yet evidence would seem to indicate we are the thralls of the tech lords, or of the priests of the myth of progress who are gleefully profiteering off of our fear of.... What, exactly? <br><br>I know this is part of what we are exploring here, but surely the fear of having to write a letter instead of an email, of look at a map instead of a GPS, or carry a date book instead of a phone or tablet is far too shallow an explanation.

My laptop is one of the few complex technologies I have clung to like grim death, partly for my writing and partly for research and reading material and access to information (things I desperately wanted but did not have growing up); normally I would not even have entertained the thought of not replacing it; it has been one of my "non-negotiables." But thanks to this post and the last one, I was able to step outside that automatic pattern of response and realize that I could choose not to replace it. Not only does that mean hundreds or, more honestly, thousands of unspent dollars still in my pocket, but the sense of psychological relaxation and relief is very liberating; I feel like my mind had been clenched up around the idea of it like a spasming muscle (a state I was unaware of until it changed) and now can move smoothly and freely again. Just goes to show that even those of us who live happily without cars, televisions, or powered kitchen appliances can still have our own oddly potent mental off-switches when it comes to our favored technologies. My most sincere thanks, JMG and fellow commenters, for the timely assistance in deconstructing that particular pattern of non-thought.<br><br><a href=#c3408765163226566451 title="comment permalink">11/28/15, 5:11 PM</a><br><br>

So, yes, choosing to go an alternate path has definite social costs, but, from our perspective, going along with a pathological society costs the soul even more. Not to mention the very real unsustainability of it all, that the gig's up for us in the US, at least. So, as I've mentioned before, my goal is to disengage as much as possible, as I find most interactions with most people trying, keeping interactions as superficial as possible to avoid "taboo" topics/arguments. I will say that my most promising engagements are with younger people--the closest I've ever been able to "turn on the light" and "connect the dots" with people have been with young adults. I find nature to be my battery recharger from living in dystopia. I simply don't have the spiritual tools at this point to engage with present society very much. Maybe when I've cultivated those tools sufficiently, I'll be ready to engage more. Certainly, JMG's expressed here so much the damage all that modern industrial society has caused, especially since it ignored limits to growth.<br>Regarding politics, I'm holding back there. I definitely do NOT want to do anything to support/endorse the "system"/status quo if I can. I'm just monitoring the situation. If there was something on the horizon that held great promise for overturning the current order without bringing in something much worse (a needle to thread, I'll admit), I'd definitely come out of the woodwork to participate. But it seems best in such volatile times as these, when things could go any number of ways, not all good, to hold back and see if anything promising develops first.<br><br><a href=#c8830518252078137672 title="comment permalink">11/28/15, 5:30 PM</a><br><br>

Cuneiform is an elegant way of writing, and it also has the advantage that baked clay tablets last a very long time. Hundreds of thousands of tablets from the libraries of Mesopotamia are perfectly readable millennia after they were originally written, whereas information on the internet will be gone forever a millisecond after the relevant server goes dark. <br><br>Mickey, yes, I think that's an important part of it. <br><br>Eric, good heavens. Freemasons and other fraternal orders routinely attend church services, but I didn't know that ruinmen were doing the same thing now! <br><br>Tom, sure, data processing could help -- well, until you start factoring in the whole systems cost of the infrastructure needed to generate the hardware that would be needed for the purpose. You're right, of course, that the sheer cost is also a nontrivial factor. As for Schumacher's system, stay tuned... ;-)<br><br>Eric, of course the greens are upset at you. The entire mainstream green movement at this point rotates like a broken record around the rhetoric of "You have to do what we want or horrible things will happen!" If you point out that the horrible things are already happening and doing what they want won't change that, they've lost their one and only argument, and they also have to face the possibility that the horrible things they've been using as a stalking horse for so long are actually going to happen. <br><br>Prizm, yes, that's certainly a plausible analysis. What I'm trying to do, though, is focus on the fact that it's happening, pointing up how absurd it is, and encouraging those who've suffered from technobullying to remember that they're not alone and follow their values rather than peer pressure. <br><br>Unknown Toni, oh, granted. It's a challenge, though not an insuperable one, to live in two worlds at the same time. <br><br>Ed, well, yes -- the lack of technology is also a filter of sorts.

With all due respect, what a flamebait. Against my better judgement, I will bite on it this time.<br><br>"...actually, those smartphones are not a luxury nor an addiction for the homeless, but a lifeline."<br><br>When did I indicate criticism of "the homeless"? Are "the homeless" the only ones, or even the main ones that use a food pantry? What stereotypical nonsense. I merely indicated that clients at our local food pantry were diddling on smartphones whilst in line, and could perhaps put their monies to better use. FYI most clients nowadays are gainfully employed and have a home. The jobs they have just don't pay enough to support themselves. I am sympathetic with that, but don't make the argument to me that your Facebook account is more important, or equally important, to the grocery bill. Do we really think they are filling out job aps or checking out the best price to sell recycled copper/aluminum in line at the pantry? Really? Newsflash: I overhear the conversations- they are about funny memes or what Sally did over the weekend.<br><br>I may be wrong, but I have a strong suspicion that a great many not only have a smartphone, but also home internet access, which is fine. But if the argument is that the disadvantaged need internet access, and therefore 50-100/month plus a two-year contract is justified when you are having trouble eating, I have news for you, free WiFi is readily available, from the local Mickey D's to the local library. 4G wireless smartphone internet is about the most expensive service you could pick.<br><br>Finally on "the homeless" I have had the privilege of being friends with and being related to several homeless people. My brother-in-law and a co-worker, being two. It took Harry 2 years to get back on his feet after he was laid off in Houston and my boss (God bless his heart) picked Kevin up from the family shelter until he could afford a car. Neither had smartphones.<br><br>"Actually, it's the same reason so many people have them in the nonindustrialized nations"<br><br>The comparison between us in the US and the 3rd world is not valid. The 3rd world doesn't have the sunk infrastructure costs in landline or fiberoptics, nor the corporate monopolies, and have chosen to bypass those modes for wireless. Their costs are far lower, per capita, than ours. Even in Europe, they pay on average less per month for more bandwidth than do US consumers. Is this right, or just? Maybe not. But it is the way the telecom world is right now. And all the righteous indignation of the Tumblr social justice warriors in the world can't change it.<br><br><br>"...No, a New Mexico driver's license doesn't count because it doesn't satisfy the Real ID requirements." <br><br>Sounds like there is a political problem in NM. By golly, IL managed to work out Real IDs replete with bar-codes and holograms. Western Civilization didn't fall. Renewing it costs a whopping $10. Maybe y'all need to un-elect your black-helicopter watching, Tea Partying, New World Order types. They probably don't frequent this blog anyways...<br><br>"But again ... *before* assuming that something you don't like or understand is because "he's a bum, she's a slut, they just have poor values.."<br><br>Shame on you! I certainly didn't call anyone a bum. I didn't say anyone's values were poor; I merely pointed out that some priorities were out of whack. I NEVER engaged in slut shaming. I raised three daughters and wouldn't do that. It seems to me that there may be some projection here. <br><br>As we used to say "don't stick your finger in my Kool-Aid when you don't know the flavor."<br><br>Stepping off the soap box...<br><br>Best regards<br><br><a href=#c3012066576802380717 title="comment permalink">11/28/15, 6:40 PM</a><br><br>

The only people you might have upset were the trolls whose comments got delected. <br><br>Bryan, congrats, and I hope the adventure goes well. <br><br>Raven, as I mentioned the last time you suggested this, that begs the question -- why does this difference elicit such frantic behavior, while so many other differences get no reaction at all? <br><br>DesertedPictures, what astonishes me in your story is that somebody noticed that the new high tech system wasn't working, and the decision was made to go back to something that worked. In the US the response would have been to punish the people who were using the system, on the assumption that the only reason it didn't work was that they must be doing something wrong. <br><br>Johnny, you're getting pushback about your veganism for two reasons. The first is that Americans basically aren't sane about food, and quarrel about diets at the drop of a hat. The second is that a great many vegans aren't as courteous as you are. I'm an omnivore, and I've been in exactly the same position you describe, with vegans hectoring me about my diet -- in several cases, screaming insults at me because they happened to see me at a food co-op putting meat into my shopping basket. So a great many omnivores have gotten into the habit of launching preemptive strikes of the sort you've described, in the hope of heading off yet another vegan diatribe. I agree, it sucks to be treated badly as a result of somebody else's bad habits! <br><br>Daergi, I'd point out that some countries are restricting rights on their way down the far side of Hubbert's peak, some are expanding them, and some are doing some of both. For this and other reasons, which probably deserve a post of their own one of these days, I suggest that there's no statistically significant correlation between energy per capita and civil rights, and the descent into a deindustrial world could involve almost any combination of expanding and contracting rights. <br><br>Jen, Texas is Texas, and such experience as I've had with that state and its residents suggests that eccentricity is actually less of a taboo there than in many other parts of the US -- after all, it's the only US state that fought a civil war over whether to have laws at all! I suspect that may be shaping your experience. <br><br>Mister R., I've read numerous studies -- though I don't have the references handy -- that claim that the flicker effect of television entrains the human brain into alpha wave activity, making rational thinking difficult and sinking consciousness into a vague emotional haze. The channelers you were reading may have gotten the details wrong but they had the principle right! <br><br>Leo, they do <i>what</i>? Oog. I'm even happier that I don't have one of the wretched things. <br><br>Patricia, that might be part of it -- but why does that difference call up a more frenzied reaction than most others? <br><br>Wwoofbum, my take is that a lot of people these days have no inner life, and have to vent their opinions on the internet to find out what they think, or prove to themselves that they think at all. The mere fact that they're blurting out thoughtstoppers they picked up from random websites just adds irony to the situation. <br><br>Barrymelius, glad to hear it. <br><br>Lynnet, maybe that's one of the beliefs I should target, then. <br><br>Patriciaormsby, ah, yes -- the Tinkerbell theory of social change. It's a common bad habit of the privileged, who are so used to having their whims catered to that they become convinced that the universe itself is obligated to do so.<br><br><a href=#c1408152586208400641 title="comment permalink">11/28/15, 6:41 PM</a><br><br>

Which technology is best for any particular task has nothing to do with how "advanced" the various options are. <br><br>Spanish Fly, thanks for the link!<br><br>Dan, one of the awkward things about the current historical situation is that so many parts of the world outside Western Europe, North America and Australasia have been sold on the consumer economy just as the consumer economy is running hard into the limits to growth. I suspect that's going to generate spectacular social stresses as the goodies everyone in your part of the world is waiting for don't show up. <br><br>Tazmic, did you think I was making that assumption? <br><br>Luddene, and that's also part of the picture, of course. <br><br>Kyoto, and that's valid, for you. My point is that people ought to have the right not to use technologies they don't like, for whatever reason. <br><br>Ahavah, that's what I've described as the senility of the elites. It's very common in declining civilizations, and generally ends very, very messily. <br><br>Howard, good!

When I heard "food pantry", "homeless" was the first thing that jumped to my mind. <br><br>The rest was a hot button than comes from having lived too long around affluent liberals (no, I won't move; I was here first and the house is paid off) whose response to people not doing what they think should be done is that either "these people" need more educating or that there is something wrong with them. From the right, BTW, you get a lot of the "something wrong with them." And don't get me started on the media.<br><br>And my father sensitized me early on to the dangers of poor-bashing. He was an Episcopal minister of hillbilly background (and proud of it) who had adopted the Social Gospel early on, probably in college, and was a proud left-of-the-New-Deal Democrat. And so when I indulged in the mindless poor-bashing of the day, he set me straight, with a tongue that could lash every Pharisee in Scripture. This whether it was being lofty about football scholarships ("How else do you think some of these poor kids can afford college at all?") to the flashy cars driven by people living in ratty houses. ("They aren't allowed to live anywhere but [the local ghetto]. Nobody will rent decent housing to them. Those cars are all they have.") And so on.<br><br>And of course, I was on the other end of a fair amount of oddball-female bashing until the late 1960s. <br><br>So again, I apologize. But I stand by my claim that whatever else the poor use those phones for, it's communication, information, and access without waiting for a library computer to come free. I've seen that with my own eyes. (And would no more begrudge the frivolous uses thereof than I'd sip my wine while begrudging some poor devil his beer can.) But then, I never asked who had what level of smartphone or on what contract - and what sort of gadget do you need to use the free wifi at McD's? Surely not a laptop, which is cumbersome to carry around. A Kindle? A tablet? Because one thing the free wifi spots do not have is free laptops. Seriously.

All this talk about how in a variety of ways we are better off without certain types of technology got me thinking about doing without some pieces of technology. And the talk about how many suffer from technobullying makes me realize how important it is to make people aware that it's OK to not use technology that feels useless to you, and that we could help others understand why. So, I feel this year I will sacrifice a piece of my technology, and spend the year explaining to people why I've given it up. To some extent, I know I'll be ridiculed. I'm planning on getting rid of the smartphone I've been using. Ever since I started using it two years ago, the voices in my head screamed to get rid of it. I'm constantly using smartphones as a topic of debate in my ESL classes, and I'm always on the con side. There's really no reason not to sacrifice it and let others know in the hopes that less people will be bullied. Even in China, where as Caryn has mentioned, most people are pretty open minded to doing things because they save, I was in the past the object of some ridicule because I had refused to use smartphones and the social networking media du jour. <br><br>Now the question arises.. how should I get rid of it? As mentioned earlier, all the cult talk makes me want to burn it. Oh how I would love to watch the flames engulf the phone.. but it's not environmentally friendly. Anyone have any suggestions?<br><br>And I would like to take a moment to ask others to join me in sacrificing an item of theirs which represents modern technology and the cult of progress, but is that which you could do without. And I'd encourage you to tell others why you've done this. <br><br>Oh, and it may be worth writing about how you get along life without the piece of technology you sacrifice.

Someone has to fetch wood because trees won’t grow in a cave. 3) they have to eat and eliminate waste and if they don’t do the latter outside the cave will become a latrine. So, we need to recognize that this is also just a story, not reality. Today this situation has been called a “living in a bubble”. The difference between Plato’s fake story and the bubble is that those in the bubble can see that there is a real world out there but they choose to ignore it. The latter more adequately describes today’s situation.<br><br>Other than looking at a screen in your den or living room TV is essentially no different than attending an opera or a stage presentation featuring one of Shakespeare’s plays.

If one is unable to travel or is disabled sports events are fun to watch when you can root for a team.

The example that seems to encapsulate what's going on here is the one where a coworker set the laptop down and told the person to watch a particular show so that they would have something to talk about. There's lots of examples, though, and I've been tsk-ing and shaking my head along with everyone else. But this morning a light went off, and I realized I was as bad as the people in all of the examples.<br><br>For the last few years climate change, peak oil, our collapsing economic system and so on has been consuming a lot of my attention. But I can't ever find people to talk intelligently with about it. So I started buying extra copies of the books I was reading and lending them out to friends, colleagues and customers. Basically saying, "Read this so that we have something to talk about." I've handed out copies of Overshoot, Collapse Now and Avoid the Rush, Currency Wars and several others. All to no avail. I shudder to think that maybe all these people I handed books to are on some mirror site of The Archdruid Report (maybe The Carbon-Burner Patriot Report) complaining about people who shove books and articles in their faces about some leftist, doomsday conspiracy nonsense.<br><br>It's human nature, I think, to want to be connected to those around you; to have a common understanding of the world. One problem seems to be that the world has grown so much larger and more complex than the small, localized groups we evolved in. Another problem seems to be that in all of the chatter, the incessant noise and static, people can no longer distinguish between things with meaning, with valuable content, and things that are meaningless. And perhaps vacuity is actively promoted. Advertising is, after all, about creating perceived value. If you can sell nothing for a lot of money, well then, that's a home run. People have devoted their lives and their hard earned money for an advertised reality - a lot of content-devoid nothingness. To admit that is to render meaningless their lives. I think that under these circumstances these people would double down on their current path (check), create some all encompassing philosophy to validate their choices (check), and villain-ize anyone who challenges or tries to expose what's happening by offering up a more meaningful reality (check).<br><br><br><a href=#c2449612114798406309 title="comment permalink">11/29/15, 6:17 AM</a><br><br>

This is true even of content that I think has interest and value, although something very good can hold my attention for a bit longer before I can't take it anymore. Second, I have returned to the city and have been socializing with some friends who enjoy plays, a couple of whom are playwrights. I have attended performances with them and have found that the physical presence of skillful actors in a shared space makes for a riveting experience. A good play leaves me engaged and energized and appreciative of my fellow human beings. Even a mediocre performance does not leave me feeling like I want to crawl out of my skin. For me, at least, the medium of performance has a very marked effect on my response. Perhaps it is down to bald personal preference, but my superficial familiarity with the neurological and sociological literature on the subject of television leads me to suspect that something more is at work, and I am less inclined than previously to dismiss the denunciation of television by those who prefer more "cultured" pursuits as mere classism or cultural chauvinism.<br><br><a href=#c7051709095261417738 title="comment permalink">11/29/15, 1:04 PM</a><br><br>

The only reason I successfully avoid that sort of thing is that I tend to live in down-at-heels neighborhoods where a lot of people can't afford cars or, if they have them, don't drive them much to save on gas money. <br><br>Sgage, true enough. <br><br>Ron, funny! I didn't think of that, and I should have; thank you. <br><br>Glenn, my guess is that anything that will take down a duck will take down a drone, so you're probably right. <br><br>Repent, my guess is that more and more young people are starting to realize just how thoroughly they're being screwed by today's American society, and it's beginning to sink in that playing another round of video games or what have you isn't going to change that ugly fact. <br><br>Cherokee, we could indeed, by Crom! I think you're quite right about jobs. One of the ways the senility of the elites is really showing itself these days is the extent to which the privileged blandly assume that if they deprive more and more of the population of any way to make a living, there's going to be blowback. As Lao Tsu said, if people have nothing to live for, it doesn't do a lot of good to threaten them with death...<br><br>Kevin, it is an abyss, and in the best Nietzschean sense, when you stare into it, it stares back at you. I definitely recommend counting exactly how many hours a week you watch television, and then thinking of everything else you could have done with those hours. <br><br>Nicholas, here again, the question in my mind is why technology should be so much more loaded as a uniform than any of the many other things we use every day for similar purposes.<br><br><a href=#c6522683570752826713 title="comment permalink">11/29/15, 4:29 PM</a><br><br>

For some years, since I shut of the TV after 9/11, when someone asks me if I am familiar with (insert name of show, or commercial) I say, "No, I don't watch TV. I live in a bit of a cave." I don't, of course, actually live in a cave. I daresay I spend more time outdoors than most folks - I have a small, one-acre farm with meat rabbits, laying hens, and dwarf dairy goats, plus perennial fruit trees and several large garden beds. I hang my laundry out more months of the year than not, despite needing two days to get everything dry at this time of year in New England. So why do I say that I live in a cave?<br><br>Pulling my MA in English Literature and Language out of storage, I have come to a preliminary conclusion that I say it partly to poke a bit of humor at myself, and partly because by claiming to live in a cave, I make it clear that my lack of TV is my choice, and that since nobody actually expects anyone to live in a cave, folks need not feel that I'm judging their TV habits.<br><br>Now I'm realizing that when my teenage Scouts snicker at my flip phone, I cheerfully acknowledge to them that I'm a dinosaur.

I am so glad to read, too, that you are connecting with younger people. I connect with Japanese youngsters fine until they get their first device, usually in junior high and then they mostly drift away, and part of the problem seems to be that I have to ask them to turn off their devices when I'm teaching them.<br><br>@Everyone, I've read through most of the comments these past two weeks, and I am heartened by this discussion, but there have only been two of us actually bringing up negative health impacts of modern wireless technology. The cell phone industry is up in arms over a new ordinance in Berkeley, requiring purchasers to be warned to keep their cell phone away from their bodies (5 to 25 mm). Such warnings have been buried in the fine print until now. https://www.rfsafe.com/cellphone-radiation-right-to-know-ordinance-unanimously-passes-in-berkeley-ca/ And more and more lawsuits are being brought against the industry regarding brain cancer https://www.rfsafe.com/wsj-reports-murray-cellphone-cancer-case-may-cost-wireless-industry-over-1-9-billion-dollars/ . Cancer is just the tip of the iceberg.<br><br>We should be discussing the human right to a healthy environment, but no one wants to touch this too hot of a potato, for fear of ridicule. About 15 years ago, the Tokyo train stations put up posters urging people not to use their cell phones on the train. The posters showed little lightning zaps coming from the phone BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT PEOPLE WERE UPSET ABOUT (sorry to shout). A few days later, the posters were replaced with identical ones, but the lightning zaps were gone. Do you have any idea how much effort has gone into keeping you ignorant? The meme got spread far and wide that people were upset about overhearing chatting. The real issue was buried under an avalanche of cosmetic concerns that obfuscated the real issue.<br><br>I am happy to know that most of you realize what a turkey we've been sold, but the problem goes much further than what we've been discussing.<br><br><br><a href=#c6378546946276491407 title="comment permalink">11/29/15, 6:21 PM</a><br><br>

A nicely honed irony. <br><br>Mgalimba, exactly. As I noted in passing in my post, there are some very problematic features in Plato's original discussion; I took a certain amount of pleasure in taking his metaphor and using it for a purpose almost diametrically opposed to the one he had in mind. <br><br>Jo, excellent. That's exactly the point: there's no reason (aside from peer pressure and superstitious faith in progress for its own sake) to embrace a technological "advance" if it's harmful, or simply doesn't happen to please or interest us. The negative reactions to those who embrace that freedom of choice need to be confronted and challenged. <br><br>Iangagn, I'm sure geoengineering will be tried, to the extent that the funding and resource base can be managed. I'm just as sure that trying to tamper with a system as complex as the global climate will promptly result in disasters at least as extreme as anything climate change will do to us all by itself. "Er, that tailor-made hurricane we were trying to launch caused so much hot wet air to surge north from the Gulf of Mexico that it triggered a wall of thunderstorms and a burst of EF-5 tornadoes, which completely destroyed St. Louis -- hope you don't mind!" <br><br>Ivan, many thanks for the reference!

My books don't yell at me, telling me to go read twelve other books, six magazines and a newspaper article! (At most there's a shy little footnote perched on the bottom of the page, in small print, saying, "If you want to learn more about this particular fact, here's where to go...")<br><br>Myriad, good. You're quite right, of course; the self is an interface, not an enduring substance, and if the only things it encounters are manufactured pseudorealities pushing a given culture's irrationalities, it gets highly dysfunctional in a hurry. <br><br>Blueback, I note with some pleasure that initial reports on the Black Friday sales suggest that it's down 10% from last year. My wife and I contribute to that: to us, the day after Thanksgiving is Buy Nothing Day and we keep it quite strictly. <br><br>Jeanne, you did indeed miss them. People who try to troll this blog discover in short order that their comments never see the light of day. (Well, not all of them make that discovery; I have repeat offenders who have apparently never noticed that I'm deleting whatever they try to post automatically, without reading their screeds. You have to work to achieve that status on this blog, but the internet has its share of overachievers!) <br><br>Caryn, I wish you were right. No, it's just as crazy here in the US as it looks. I really do think that we're moving toward an explosion in the fairly near term.<br><br>Nick, that would be interesting. It would be particularly interesting to set up a little device with a red light and a little loudspeaker, set to detect alpha waves -- my guess is that you could put something together very easily using Arduino or some other simple microcontroller that would do this. You put it on, and whenever you drop into the TV trance, it beeps at you to warn you. I wonder what that would do to the experience of television watching...<br><br>LatheChuck, have you checked into the local MakerSpace scene? There may be a bunch of young people who would be delighted to learn how to use machine tools...<br><br>Bunnygirl Ann, exactly! The thing that needs to be brought up again and again, until it sinks in, is that it's valid to judge any given technology in terms of how well it meets human needs, and to choose the technologies you want depending on how well they meet <i>your</i> needs. <br><br>Kfish, good. If I used a car I'd use a map for guidance. As it is, I let the engineer running the locomotive do the navigating... ;-)<br><br>Philip, funny. I may give that one a try. <br><br>Cherokee, good. You'll have noticed, to begin with, that I stood Plato's metaphor on its head, and redefined the cave as the realm of mediated abstractions and the outside world as the real world -- where he meant the cave to represent the world as experienced by the senses and the outside world as the realm of the abstract Ideas. Taking the metaphor my way, though, why do we go back into the cave? Because, things being as they are, you can't earn a living out there in the sunlight, and everyone you know is sitting in the cave staring at glass screens. This focuses attention on the passage that leads from the cave to the outside world and back again, and thus to changes in consciousness that take place on that passage. More on this later on -- though much of it will be in the other blog!<br><br><a href=#c5901481365002048520 title="comment permalink">11/29/15, 7:40 PM</a><br><br>

Climate isn't slow-moving at all -- as any close study of paleoclimatology will show you, it tends to shift from one equilibrium to another in relatively sudden, discontinuous, and disruptive shifts. We're nearing one of those -- in a very real sense, rather, we're in the opening stages of one -- and it's going to leave southern Florida a brackish swamp full of soggy ruins, Las Vegas a ghost town half buried in drifting sand, New York City trying to cope with flooded subways, and similar cascading disruptions all over the world. That's not the end of the world, or even of our species, but it's going to push industrial civilization a good bit closer to history's compost bin. <br><br>William, have you considered going off TV for a month or so, and then assessing how you feel about it after it's been out of your life for that long? You may learn some unexpected things. <br><br>TJ, insecurity isn't something that can be turned on or off like a machine. It's the result of bitter experience that's lodged in the human psyche. It's good that you're free of it, and I enjoy the fact that my insecurities aren't amenable to being triggered by bullying, but not everyone is so fortunate, you know. <br><br>Valekeeperx, thanks for the links. <br><br>Onething, no, Conan the Barbarian, as quoted in the 1980s movie of that title. Arnold Schwarzenegger was so hilariously campy in that movie, and especially in that line, that I can't resist parodying it. <br><br>Other Tom, here again, if you find a technology useful or necessary, and you can live with what it's doing to the world, by all means use it. <br><br>Bob, maybe it's just that we live in Appalachia, but written grocery lists are still tolerably common here. My wife and I use one ourselves every week. <br><br>Daergi, we've had such a broader discussion in earlier conversations here. No doubt we'll cycle back around to that again. The point I want to discuss just now, though, has less to do with technology and more to do with the way that people treat technology, and -- more to the point -- treat those who don't choose to use the latest fashionable technotrash. I'd like to keep that focus, at least in general, because it hasn't been discussed at all in recent years and it deserves close attention. <br><br>Janet, good for Paul! <br><br>Unknown Deborah, etiquette generally is something in which a lot of people need a refresher course these days. Of course that's something that needs doing at least once a generation!<br><br>Ahavah, good. I'm quite sure the fears involved go very deep, but I'm far from sure that racism has much to do with it -- "those people" (however defined) typically spend as much time watching this or that screen as the rest of us.

Still, I suspect there's something else at the core of it. <br><br>Carl, bizarre.

Put the "smart"phone into the bag. Get the heaviest hammer you can find -- a five pound sledge with a short handle would be ideal. Put the bag on a piece of wood, and use the hammer to reduce the "smart"phone to "smart"powder. (Bloodcurdling war cries are a popular option at this stage.) Then take the powder down to your local electronics recycling station; on the way, think up some colorful story to explain to the person on duty how your "smart"phone got reduced to small fragments. Return home and celebrate your newfound freedom with the beverage of your choice. A nice, simple, ecologically sound ritual! <br><br>Russ, er, Plato meant it as a metaphor, not as a statement of fact; quibbling about the details you cited is rather like insisting that the Beatles song "Yellow Submarine" is fallacious because nobody lives next door to a submarine! <br><br>David, good.

Anyway, the principle will be familiar to many here: the devout worshippers would sacrifice their animal offering to [$DEITY] on the quite reasonable assumption that the divine being in question would be satisfied with the animal's spirit. The mundane remnants - beef, pork, mutton, etc - were surplus to requirements and available for, eg, a slap-up feast for the aforementioned worshippers. A win-win solution, apart from the animal of course.<br><br>I suggest you adopt this approach, and sacrifice the spirit, but not the body, of your phone.<br><br>Announce a competition amongst your EFL students. The phone, plus associated peripherals, will be donated to the student who comes up with the best sacrificial ritual, to be judged on humour, grammar, cultural awareness, vocabulary, and reverence of Crom. The ritual might, for example, end with a ritual pressing of the "Reset to Factory Condition" button. A key requirement would be that for the winner to actually obtain the phone, all entrants must actually participate in the ritual - otherwise, JMG's alternative gets used, "to assuage the wrath of Crom".<br><br>Hopefully, of course, you will still have the same phone number in oeration so that I can contact you the next time I find myself in Dalian...<br><br><a href=#c8542835185774681286 title="comment permalink">11/30/15, 2:35 AM</a><br><br>

I’m sorry that has been your experience! My personal feeling about this is that I am not perfect, and if I want to morally judge someone, the only person it makes sense to judge is myself, since they are my own morals after all, and I’m not living completely up to them – that keeps me busy enough that I don’t have time to bother with worrying about what other people are doing. Clearly we are omnivores (or this conversation wouldn’t even be conceivable) and that means that these things are up to personal choice.<br><br>One thing I think you might like about vegans and vegetarians though is that it is a movement that is defined by actions and not opinions about things (in fact the opinions range widely but the singular actions unite people). For me as a young person who got into it, veganism was a rather valuable thing to discover, because it showed me that I could take action and change things about my behavior that were maybe outside what was considered normal in order to affect change in the world. I don’t think that would be valuable for you, obviously, but I thought there was possibly something in there you might respect.<br><br><br><a href=#c7404191775634908472 title="comment permalink">11/30/15, 5:45 AM</a><br><br>

I have been through a broadly similar experience, getting water into a <br>"Kill-A-Watt" digital electric meter, at that time costing around 60 USD at retail. It took a long while, perhaps even some weeks or a few months, for my rather awkwardly expensive device to start working again, but recover it eventually did. <br><br>In my case was the water had probably shorted out one or more connections. Although distilled water is a reasonable insulator, my water may have had some quantity of mineral salts in it: as soon as there are ions from, e.g., salt, the brew, alas, conducts easily.<br><br>Eventually, in such a scenario, one's device dries out. A bit of crystalline salt deposit (or for that matter a bit of crystalline sugar, as with your laptop) is I believe NOT a good conductor. So your device is happy once again. Whether points A and B are separated by an insulating air gap or an insulating sugar crystal is, to the device, a matter of happy indifference. <br><br>Admittedly, the drying process might be hastened in your situation by opening up the case, so that air can get in. <br><br>It goes almost, but not quite, without saying that you want to avoid expedients like hot wind from a hair dryer. Electronics get on poorly with heat, since the application of heat causes different things (the copper on the one hand, the plastic on the other) to expand at different rates, ultimately inducing some ever-so-thin connections to break. <br><br><br>Tom <br><br><br>PS: On hair dryers and the like: By causing a thousand or so servers at Google to spring into momentary activity, as I typed in the search string <br><br> poodle microwave case <br><br>a few minutes ago, I got the facts on the exaggeration-tempting story of that famous individual who did something ANALOGOUS to using a hair dryer on a wet laptop: <br><br>((QUOTE<br>SOURCE="http://www.smecc.org/microwave_oven_legends.htm")) <br>The "urban legend" about the elderly woman who put her<br>toy poodle in the microwave oven to dry off isn't<br>really an urban legend!

Scrambling for economic survival sharpens the mind and senses wonderfully – fortunately I was young enough and unencumbered with family responsibilities and could simply peer out of the cave to see if there were any metaphorical lions prowling around – which there were! If I was being totally honest too, I don't believe that I've ever managed to completely lance the anger that lives deep down in the murky crawl spaces of my mind which arose after that experience.

I was the reader who reported this exchange, which I had with a student of mine on campus here. He was basically an intelligent young man, but cocky, entitled and arrogant. He wanted to become a politician for the sake of the wealth and power he thought he could gain thereby. Whenever our paths crossed on campus, he would toss out some challenging remark designed to provoke an arguent which he planned to win (but often did not). That was fine: how else will the young find out what they are capable of, if they don't test their wits and strength against the world? <br><br>Then one day, when our paths crossed, he asked what I though of Seinfeld last night. I honestly did not know what or who a Seinfeld might be, and said so. Incredulously, he told me it was a TV show. I told him I hadn't watched TV for about 20 years. He was thunderstruck for a moment, and then yelled loudly at me, "What do you do, live in a dream world?!" Without waiting for an answer, he turned on his heel and literally ran away. He never spoke to me again, and whenever he saw me coming, he quickly changed his path so as to avoid me. <br><br>I suppose that for him the real world was determined mostly by the media he consumed. For an aspiring politician that approach to life even makes a modicum of sense. Oh, well ....<br><br>After graduation (a year or two after our last exchange), he ran for some local public office, but he lost massively to his long-established opponent. He vanished from public view afterwards, and he may have simply run away from the scene of his defeat -- at any rate, I didn't see his name ever again in the local newspapers. <br><br>Now, a decade and a half later, I can't even remember what his name was. But our final conversation remains seared in my mind.<br><br><a href=#c1203881059026888065 title="comment permalink">11/30/15, 2:23 PM</a><br><br>

In Plato’s ideal state, an elite of philosophers occupied the top of the pyramid. A military caste took orders from the philosophers and kept social discipline lower down, and everyone else occupied the bottom, with no role in community decisions except obedience to dictates from above.

Depending upon the type of tea, sweetener and where exactly the liquid entered the unit (and how much), it is very likely to be OK if given proper recovery care.<br><br>Whether or not to revive it, is your choice of course. But don't toss it just yet. (Dare I say this) Check online via another computer for steps to repair from spilled coffee or tea. Basically you want to do a few things: <br><br>1. Do NOT try powering it back up until it has dried completely which may take up to a week or so. <br>2. Get as much liquid out as you can (shake, prop up with vent holes down, battery door off, cd tray open, etc), use paper towels to absorb what you can, etc. <br>3. If your tea had sticky sweeteners or acidic (lemon)stuff or other residue leaving stuff in it (milk), it may be useful to rinse it out with distilled water or 91% rubbing alcohol some before drying (Actually the alcohol can help dry it but may damage some components. I usually use alcohol when I can see what parts I am using it on rather than just pouring it in blindly). <br>4. Remove the battery, open the CD drawer and any other openings to let more air in and hasten the drying.<br>5. Putting it in a warm (not hot) place to dry helps. As does mild heat and airflow (hair drier on low probably OK, Oven on low NOT). Anything your hand can stand on a permanent basis is fine. <br>6. The most thorough way to dry it out is open the case up, clean and dry individual areas that got wet. Not that hard for the technically inclined, but very often not needed. If your manual steps don't work, you can consider opening it up yourself, or bringing it to a shop that specializes in PC repairs and see if they can fix it for a reasonable fee (be sure to set a maximum you're willing to spend before leaving it in their care). At the very least, such a shop should be willing to make an offer to buy your old laptop for parts if you don't want to repair it.<br><br>Good luck, whatever you decide to do.<br><br><br>@Prizm do NOT burn your smart phone without removing the Li battery first. As you may recall from the Apple laptop fiasco of some years back, those batteries tend to explode when overheated. Your choice as to how much anger you have towards this object, and if you'd rather act on that anger or sell/recycle it.

So here's my 2 anectdotal cent on the general topic.<br>My impression is that "signaling" is really important in this context, and it is generally the receiver(s) who defines the meaning of the sent data. Likely this would be based on unwritten competitive social group dynamics short on altruism. This may also explain why old people (not considered a potential threat) can do as they please with respect to tech. Perhaps it also may go some length in explaining asymmetries between males and females in such respects. Then there probably are certain functions which put your "loyalty to Our Cause" beyond doubt, such as techie, or high status. Being on the techie side, often close to emerging techs people rarely questioned me why I would skip 2 of the 3 next big things. Yet, in certain places, if you held a presentation using open source software and there happened to be one glitch in the way some special character was represented - you could be sure to hear about it. Blue screens of death, bloatware pop-ups, not having some special characters at all, having to mess around with an Apple adapter to run the presentation at all would not be half as bad - as these were mainstream problems. <br>Failure of mimesis is not welcome in a society that prevails through unified command/exclusive monotheism I guess. And doing this with small things doesn't make it better really. Because you must know that you still incur you master's wrath without even the chance of substantial gain. From a game theoretical perspective this does not make your infringement less severe I'd say. <br>Perhaps that is one reason clothing is such a hot button issue over the last couple of centuries. I had a few sirwal (Iranian pants) that friends gave me once. I would mostly wear them around the house though. Going to school/work with them after 911? Nah. On the other hand, jeans pretty much anywhere in the world? No problem.<br><br><a href=#c4695513926289916391 title="comment permalink">12/1/15, 4:13 AM</a><br><br>

What allows us to keep a straight face when discussing them while ignoring the rest is probably the victims (potential/imaginary) contribution to "Our Cause". As you discussed much of that has to do with some fuzzy notion of attaining godhood and going to the stars, of which Elon is perhaps a humble representative. <br>And this conveniently allows us to burn through inordinate amounts of energy reserves - as long as we help the "innovation thing" by adopting whatever new tech you can get. Cause every little bit help us get closer to godhood, and it is for a lack of early adopters that many techs never mature. If you don't you are just barely a homo sapiens - most likely you would be living in a cave if you hadn't been caught in "Our Cause's" slipstream. And then there are of course variations of the Us and Them game when when desired (e.g. cold war).<br>I wonder if you would normalize the mainstream media attention by the resource use of the respective victims what that would get you? <br>On a different note I just listened to Neil MacGregor's History of the World in 100 Objects, which features the astrolabe. Interestingly he calls it the smartphone of its age. I wonder what makes most people focus strongly on smartphones, tv, and somewhat on cars when talking tech overkill. By the way here are some numbers on the printed circuit board used in smartphones and other high end electronics: (source: fairphone supplier http://www.ats.net/de/files/2015/11/ATS_NHB2015_EN_v14.pdf). Page 33 is interesting where they put resource scarcity (incl. peak oil) on a timeline. I was surprised by the amount of waste produced for 10 sqft (1m²) - 10 lbs normal waste + 10 lbs hazardous. On the other hand (according to Sony) a mobile phone (W890 LCA) supposedly only generates 23.8 kg of CO2 equivalents (avg. NAmerican creates 16.5Mg, Mexican 3.7Mg). A smartphone would perhaps be up to 10x more - but then the smartphone would probably be somewhat more useful, even with less infrastructure - as long as you don't drop it. <br>In other news: There has recently been interesting commission discussions on the matter some small financial details of nuclear waste storage. It is really quite interesting to listen to - rough bottom line 17 reactors will require about 90 G€ (or $) in securities. Corporations begin to shuffle and restructure, politicians begin to look tense/into mirrors (I hope). If this scaled to US proportions its cost would be more than the Korean War but less than the Vietnam War. Perhaps not surprisingly this has encouraged many law firms to try themselves at reinterpreting the "polluter pays principle"/extended producer responsibility. So much so that it might actually backfire on them if mainstream media was to pick that up.<br>Last tidbit to celebrate dissensus: a (excruciatingly?) long podcast done on Elon's Mars thingy done by a guy Elon picked cause he liked his stuff http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/09/spacex-audio-stuff.html<br><br><a href=#c113406601268339316 title="comment permalink">12/1/15, 8:18 AM</a><br><br>

Other advantages out weigh this problem, and my aversion to TV motivates me to find interesting side adventures. Anyway, I had an interesting experience with the TV recently.<br><br>I was asked to watch a special recorded from off the History channel that sounded terrible. But, the person asking was so nice, and was willing to make an agreeable deal to compensate me for watching the special. Some things in the "documentary" didn't make sense to the person asking me to watch it, and my help was wanted to make sense of some of it. In the first minute I noticed that the "documentary" had a disclaimer written in tiny font. Thank some Dark Spirit for TV with a pause button, because only by its powers was I able to read the disclaimer. The story and figures in the Documentary was all set in the early 21st century, but according to this tiny brief on screen note we were watching a dramatization of an article written in the early 70's. Suddenly the mystery at the end of the show made sense to me, it happened for the same reason that reversing the polarity of the anti-particle beam works in Star Trek, because the shows allotted time is about over and SOMETHING has to resolve the plot. Still I watched the whole thing, and interestingly despite the mystery being solved at the beginning I was still continually being asked about "how is that possible" or "how does that work", and I tried fairly hard to come up with kinder answers than "otherwise the Enterprise wouldn't make it to the next episode". What was striking was the way the show was designed for a non attentive mind. It was extremely repetitive, I of at least one substantial clip repeated more than SEVEN times, and little of it was repeated less than twice. Also, the narrator would mention an idea put forth by the main character,and repeat it many times, each time shifting from presenting it as an abstract idea toward a certainty that is established beyond all reasonable doubt.<br><br>Blah, I survived, and the person I was watching with was only a little hurt about me being so cynical about the experience. TV, its a heck of a drug!<br><br>I did gain something from this, being so uncomfortable my brain did not fall into a hypnotic state, and it was an interesting study into how the way our culture breaks up information is so corrosive. Tragic really, I believe the amount of mind damage spread by these systems is a critical limiting factor to what positive responses to our eras problems are possible. Addressing these factors are one of the most challenging problems of our time.<br><br><a href=#c682170036121014142 title="comment permalink">12/1/15, 10:17 AM</a><br><br>

On the other hand, there are strong financial incentives for the power companies to be pushing smart meters. I was given the following info by one of the local line repair guys who I questioned about how smart meters work, so please correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>Without getting too technical, he said there are 2 types of electrical "loads", inductive and resistive. <br>Resistive loads are things like water heaters, old style light bulbs, toasters, electric ovens, in short any appliance that operates by running electricity through a wire to create heat (light bulb filaments get white hot and create light as a result). <br>Inductive loads are things like electric motors, all those AC to DC chargers for your iPhones, computers and any electronic device like TV, stereo, etc.<br>Old style non-smart meters can only measure resistive loads; smart meters measure both kinds of loads. <br>30-40 years ago, most houses had fairly simple basic appliances, and probably 90% of the loads were resistive, so the power companies were only missing out on charging you for a small amount of the inductive load you used. Things are now different with many houses having a significant portion of the load being inductive which the power companies can't measure with non-smart meters. <br>The power companies thus have a big incentive to measure all the electricity used by installing smart meters. This is in addition to making fault finding easier so they can employ fewer and less-trained line men, and of course get rid of all those meter readers.<br><br><a href=#c3665429081934564008 title="comment permalink">12/1/15, 2:14 PM</a><br><br>

It sounds likely, because a lot of people have reported a severe rise in their electric bill after a smart meter was installed. On the other hand, this is the first time I've heard this argument, so I would be suspicious. If they had been up-front about this from the start, people may have been open to solutions such as non-transmitting digital meters rather than total rejection. The information could be transmitted by wire if the company insists on firing workers. A lot of the most severely affected people have given up inductive motors, chargers and other "wall warts" anyway, because the EMF from those affects them badly, but most of the people coming forward about smart meters are new inductees to the wonderful world of electrosensitivity, and it is likely they have been overdoing the gadgetry, unaware of possible consequences.<br><br><a href=#c8458862719089245215 title="comment permalink">12/1/15, 8:19 PM</a><br><br>

I've been punctilious about seeing the dentist regularly ever since I skipped appointments for a few years and had to have several root canals when I finally went. So I was getting the annual exam and the biennial cleaning, and every time the dentist and the dental assistant urged me to switch to an electric toothbrush. I resisted for two or three years because I dislike using powered equipment for something I am accustomed to doing by hand, and I didn't want to spend the money.<br><br>Finally I gave in and bought a high quality electric toothbrush from the dentist. Guess what? It was worth the money to me. <br><br>Most adults don't get cavities if they brush regularly and are able to see the dentist twice a year, but if you happen to be susceptible to rapid plaque build up, you can develop gum disease between visits. When I brushed manually, on every visit the hygienist would scold me for the state of my gums. They bled and cleaning took a long time. <br><br>Switching to an electric toothbrush greatly reduced the plaque. I would have to manually brush for about twenty minutes to get the results that the motorized toothbrush provides in two. (Whipping cream by hand with a wire whip is a chore too, but one only does that on special occasions, not twice a day.) Maybe there are lower tech ways to get the same result but I don't know what they are. Yes, the thing is an obnoxious symbol of privilege, but I spend less time in the dentist's chair and I have hopes of keeping all my teeth for most of my life.<br><br><a href=#c54792070203445669 title="comment permalink">12/2/15, 12:45 AM</a><br><br>

The large utility providers, often with (brown) coal and nuclear in their portfolio were having trouble already. RWE is perhaps a good example with 26 G€ debt. For me it is kind of hard to work out how they could cough up that sort of money now that they are pretty close to the end of the line. Media portrays it in very moderate terms "Adding to the burden are provisions for nuclear decommissioning that companies must set aside as the country shuts down all reactors by 2022." (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-01/rwe-to-spin-off-partly-list-renewables-grids-retail-business). <br>Perhaps the smarter way to quit nuclear in other places would be to make sure they set aside reserves for decommissioning.<br>@ Mountain Mama: Congrats on walking the talk. I think selling it on (ideally to someone who makes good use of it) is a good way to do it. I remember the cost of using data on a smart phone in the US was prohibitive! (http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/10/daily-chart-5?fsrc=scn/gp/wl/dc/mobilebroadbandprices)<br>With regards to the lighting I was tempted to have something similar for a day a week or a weekend per month but could not really get around to it and I also have some health concerns to be honest: "More than 50% of premature deaths among children under 5 are due to pneumonia caused by particulate matter (soot) inhaled from household air pollution." - WHO. Now if you are careful and make sure most of the soot is adsorbed properly, you could probably push the level way below 2 packs of smokes a day equivalent. But you'd have to be careful. On the up-side you could collect the soot to make ink or loads of other cool stuff out of it. <br>I think I remember a review of the book on Kunstler-cast. The first half was indeed quite intriguing. However for now I ended up in the slow process of putting together a charging station + mobile LED lamp based on a smallish 12V lead battery for the little one. The voltage is harmless and she'll be able to handle the charging herself. As the battery is still massively oversized for the LEDs it'll probably last ages. For me the difficult bit is finding the right color LED(s) though.<br><br><a href=#c4245596567375726557 title="comment permalink">12/2/15, 2:18 AM</a><br><br>
