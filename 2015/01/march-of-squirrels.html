Prediction is a difficult business at the best of times, but the difficulties seem to change from one era to another. Just now, at least for me, the biggest challenge is staying in front of the headlines. So far, the crash of 2015 is running precisely to spec. <a href=http://peakoil.com/business/oil-price-crash-bankrupting-small-oil>Smaller companies in the energy sector are being hammered</a> by the plunging price of oil, while <a href=http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/91-11/as-oil-prices-fall-banks-serving-the-energy-industry-brace-for-a-jolt/ >the banking industry insists that it’s not in trouble</a>—those of my readers who recall identical expressions of misplaced confidence on the part of bankers in news stories just before the 2008 real estate crash will know just how seriously to take such claims. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The shiny new distractions disguised as energy breakthroughs I mentioned here two weeks ago have also started to show up. A glossy puff piece touting <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/endless-sea-energy-erico-matias-tavares>oceanic thermal energy conversion (OTEC)</a>, a white-elephant technology which was tested back in the 1970s and shown to be hopelessly uneconomical, shared space in the cornucopian end of the blogosphere over the last week with an equally disingenuous puff piece touting <a href=http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2015/01/07/nuclear-power-turns-to-salt/ >yet another rehash of nuclear fission</a> as the answer to our energy woes. (Like every fission technology, of course, this one will be safe, clean, and affordable until someone actually tries to build it.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No doubt there will shortly be other promoters scrambling for whatever government subsidies and private investment funds might be available for whatever revolutionary new energy breakthrough (ahem) will take the place of hydrofractured shales as America’s favorite reason to do nothing. I admit to a certain feeling of disappointment, though, in the sheer lack of imagination displayed so far in that competition. OTEC and molten-salt fission reactors were already being lauded as America’s energy salvation back when I was in high school: my junior year, I think it was, energy was the topic du jour for the local high school debate league, and we discussed those technologies at length. So did plenty of more qualified people, which is why both of them—and quite a few other superficially plausible technologies—never made it off the drawing board. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Something else came in for discussion that same year, and it’s a story with more than a little relevance to the current situation. A team from another school in the south Seattle suburbs had a brainstorm, did some frantic research right before a big debate tournament, and showed up with data claiming to prove that legions of squirrels running in squirrel cages, powering little generators, could produce America’s electricity. Since no one else happened to have thought of that gimmick, none of the other teams had evidence to refute them, and they swept the tournament. By the next tournament, of course, everyone else had crunched the numbers and proceeded to stomp the squirrel promoters, but for years to come the phrase “squirrel case” saw use in local debate circles as the standard term for a crackpot proposal backed with seemingly plausible data. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The OTEC plants and molten-salt reactors currently being hawked via the media are squirrel cases in exactly the same sense; they sound plausible as long as you don’t actually crunch the numbers and see whether they’re economically and thermodynamically viable. The same thing was true of the fracking bubble that’s messily imploding around us right now, not to mention the ethanol and biodiesel projects, the hydrogen economy, and the various other glittery excuses that have occupied so much useless space in the collective conversation of our time. So, it has to be said, do the more enthusiastic claims being made for renewable energy just now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Don’t get me wrong, I’m a great fan of renewable energy. When extracting fossil carbon from the earth stops being economically viable—a point that may arrive a good deal sooner than many people expect—renewables are what we’ll have left, and the modest but real energy inputs that can be gotten from renewable sources when they don’t receive energy subsidies from fossil fuels could make things significantly better for our descendants. The fact remains that in the absence of subsidies from fossil fuels, renewables won’t support the absurdly extravagant energy consumption that props up what passes for an ordinary middle class lifestyle in the industrial world these days. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the pterodactyl in the ointment, the awkward detail that most people even in the greenest of green circles don’t want to discuss. Force the issue into a conversation, and one of the more common responses you’ll get is the exasperated outburst “But there has to be <i>something</i>.” Now of course this simply isn’t true; no law of nature, no special providence, no parade of marching squirrels assures us that we can go ahead and use as much energy as we want in the serene assurance that more will always be waiting for us. It’s hard to think of a more absurd delusion, and the fact that a great many people making such claims insist on their superior rationality and pragmatism just adds icing to the cake. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s go ahead and say it in so many words: there doesn’t have to be a replacement for fossil fuels. In point of fact, there’s good reason to think that no such replacement exists anywhere in the small corner of the universe accessible to us, and once fossil fuels are gone, the rest of human history will be spent in a world that doesn’t have the kind of lavish energy resources we’re used to having. Concentrations of energy, like all other natural resources, follow what’s known as the power law, the rule—applicable across an astonishingly broad spectrum of phenomena—that whatever’s ten times as concentrated is approximately ten times as rare. At the dawn of the industrial age, the reserves of fossil fuel in the Earth’s crust were the richest trove of stored energy on the planet, and of course fossil fuel extraction focused on the richest and most easily accessible prizes first, just as quickly as they could be found. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those are gone now. Since 2005, when conventional petroleum production peaked worldwide, the industrial world has been engaged in what amounts to a frantic game of make-believe, pretending that scraping the bottom of the oil barrel proves that the barrel is still full. Every half-baked scheme for producing liquid fuels got flooded with as much cheap credit as its promoters could squander. Some of those—biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol come to mind—turned out to be money pits so abysmal that even a tide of freshly printed money couldn’t do much more than gurgle on the way down; others—above all, shale fracking and tar sand mining—were able to maintain a pretense of profitability for a while, with government subsidies, junk bonds, loans from clueless banks, and round after round of economic stimulus from central banks over much of the world serving to prop up industries that, in the final analysis, were never economically viable in the first place. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The collapse in the price of oil that began this June put paid to that era of make-believe. The causes of the oil crash are complex, but back of them all, I suggest, is a straightforward bit of economics that almost everyone’s been trying to avoid for a decade now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To maintain economic production at any given level, the global economy has to produce enough real wealth—not, please note, enough money, but enough actual goods and services—to cover resource extraction, the manufacture and replacement of the whole stock of nonfinancial capital goods, and whatever level of economic waste is considered socially and politically necessary. If the amount of real wealth needed to keep extracting resources at a given rate goes up steeply, the rest of the economy won’t escape the consequences: somewhere or other, something has to give. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The economic history of the last decade is precisely the story of what gave in what order, or to put it another way, how the industrial world threw everything in sight under the bus to keep liquid fuel production around its 2005 peak. Infrastructure was abandoned to malign neglect, the last of the industrial world’s factory jobs got offshored to Third World sweatshops, standards of living for most people dropped steadily—well, you can fill in the blanks as well as I can. Consumption remained relatively high only because central banks flooded the global economy with limitless cheap credit, while the US government filled the gap between soaring government expenditures and flat or shrinking tax receipts by the simple equivalent of having the Fed print enough money each month to cover the federal deficit. All these things were justified by the presupposition that the global economy was just going through a temporary rough patch, and normal growth would return any day now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
But normal growth has not returned. It’s not going to return, either, because it was only “normal” in an era when cheap abundant fossil fuels greased the wheels of every kind of economic activity. As I noted in <a href=../../2007/04/cycles-of-sustainability.html>a blog post here back in 2007</a>, the inevitable consequence of soaring oil prices is what economists call demand destruction: less formally, the process by which people who can’t afford oil stop using it, bringing the price back down. Since what’s driving the price of oil up isn’t merely market factors, but the hard geological realities of depletion, not everyone who got forced out of the market when the price was high can get back into it when the price is low—gas at $2 a gallon doesn’t matter if your job scavenging abandoned houses doesn’t pay enough for you to cover the costs of a car, and let’s not even talk about how much longer the local government can afford to maintain streets in driveable condition. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Demand destruction sounds very abstract. In practice, though, it’s all too brutally concrete: a rising tide of job losses, business failures, slumping standards of living, cutbacks to every kind of government service at every level, and so on down the litany of decline that’s become part of everyday life in the industrial world over the last decade—leaving aside, that is, the privileged few who have been sheltered from those changes so far. Unless I miss my guess, we’re going to see those same changes shift into overdrive in the months and years ahead. The attempt to boost the world out of its deepening slump by flooding the planet with cheap credit has failed; the global economy is choking on a supersized meal of unpayable IOUs and failed investments; stock markets and other venues for the exchange of paper wealth are so thoroughly gimmicked that they’ve become completely detached from the real economy of goods and services, and the real economy is headed south in a hurry. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those unwelcome realities are going to constrain any attempt by the readers of this blog to follow up on the proposal I made in last week’s post, and take constructive action in the face of the crisis that’s now upon us. The energy situation here in the US could have been helped substantially if conservation measures and homescale renewables had received any kind of significant support from the oh-so-allegedly-green Democratic party, back when it still had enough clout in Congress to matter; the economic situation would be nowhere near as dire if governments and central banks had bitten the bullet and dealt with the crisis of our time in 2008 or thereafter, rather than papering things over with economic policies that assumed that enough money could negate the laws of physics and geology. At this point, it’s much too late for any sort of collective action on either of those fronts—and of course the political will needed to do anything meaningful about either one went missing in action at the end of the 1970s and hasn’t been seen since. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus all of us will have to cope with a world in which the cost of energy suffers from drastic and economically devastating swings, and the sort of localized infrastructure that could cushion the impact of those swings wasn’t built in time. All of us will also have to cope with a global economy in disarray, in which bank failures, currency crises, credit shortages, and crisis measures imposed by government fiat will take the place of the familiar workings of a market economy. Those are baked into the cake at this point, and what individuals, families, and community groups will be able to do in the years ahead will be constrained by the limits those transformations impose. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who still have a steady income and a home they expect to be able to keep would still be well advised to doublecheck their insulation and weatherstripping, install solar water heating and other homescale renewable energy technologies, and turn the back lawn into a vegetable garden with room for a chicken coop, if by any chance they haven’t taken these sensible steps already.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A great many of my readers don’t have such options, and at this point, it may be a long time before such options are readily available again. This is crunch time, folks; unless I’m very much mistaken, we’re on the brink of a historical inflection point like the ones in 1789 and 1914, one of the watersheds of time after which nothing will ever be the same again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s still much that can be done in other spheres, and I’ll be discussing some of those things in upcoming posts. In terms of energy and the economy, though, I suspect that for a lot of us, the preparations we’re going to be able to make are the ones we’ve already made, and a great many people whose plans depend on having a stable income and its associated perks and privileges may find themselves scrambling for options when the unraveling of the economy leaves them without one. Those of my readers who have been putting off the big changes that might make them more secure in hard times may be facing the hard decision of making those changes now, in a hurry, or facing the crisis of our age in the location and situation they’re in right now. Those who’ve gone ahead and made the changes—well, you know as well as I do that it’s time to review your plans, doublecheck the details, batten down the hatches and get ready to weather the storm. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the entertainments to be expected as the year draws on and the crisis bears down on us all, though, is a profusion of squirrel cases of the sort discussed toward the beginning of this essay. It’s an interesting regularity of history that the closer to disaster a society in decline becomes, the more grandiose, triumphalist, and detached from the grubby realities its fantasies generally get. I’m thinking here of the essay on military affairs from the last years of the Roman world that’s crammed full of hopelessly unworkable war machines, and of the final, gargantuan round of Mayan pyramids built on the eve of the lowland classic collapse. The habit of doubling down in the face of self-induced catastrophe seems to be deeply engrained in the human psyche, and I don’t doubt for a moment that we’ll see some world-class examples of the phenomenon in the years immediately ahead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That said, the squirrel cases mentioned earlier—the OTEC and molten-salt fission proposals—suffer from a disappointing lack of imagination. If our society is going to indulge in delusional daydreams as it topples over the edge of crisis, couldn’t we at least see some proposals that haven’t been rehashed since I was in high school?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I can only think of one such daydream that has the hallucinatory quality our current circumstances deserve; yes, that would be the proposal, being made quite seriously in the future-oriented media just now, that we can solve all our energy problems by mining helium-3 on the Moon and ship it to Earth to fuel fusion power plants we have absolutely no idea how to build yet. As faith-based cheerleading for vaporware, which is of course what those claims are, they set a very high standard—but it’s a standard that will doubtless be reached and exceeded in due time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That said, I think the media may need some help launching the march of the squirrels just mentioned, and the readers of this blog proved a good long time ago that they have more than enough imagination to meet that pressing need. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Therefore I’m delighted to announce a new contest here on
<i>The Archdruid Report</i>, the Great Squirrel Case Challenge of 2015. The goal is to come up with the most absurd new energy technology you can think of, and write either the giddily dishonest corporate press release or the absurdly sycophantic media article announcing it to the world. If you or a friend can Photoshop an image or two of your proposed nonsolution to the world’s energy needs, that’s all the better. Post your press release or media article on your blog if you have one; if you don’t, you can get one for free from <a href=http://www.blogspot.com/ >Blogspot</a> or
<a href=http://wordpress.com/ >Wordpress</a>. Post a link to your piece in the comments section of this blog. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Entries must be posted here by February 28, 2012. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Two winners—one picked by me, the other by vote of the registered members of the <a href=http://www.greenwizards.info/ >Green Wizards forum</a>—will receive signed complimentary copies of my forthcoming book <i>After Progress</i>. I can’t speak for the forum, which will doubtless have its own criteria, but I’ll be looking for a winsome combination of sheer absurdity with the sort of glossy corporate presentation that frames so many absurd statements these days. (Hint: it’s not against the rules to imitate real press releases and media articles.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As for the wonderful new energy breakthrough you’ll be lauding so uncritically, why, that’s up to you. Biodiesel plants using investment bankers as their primary feedstock? A vast crank hooked to the Moon, running a global system of belts and pulleys? An undertaking of great energy profit, to misquite the famous ad from the South Sea Bubble, but no one to know what it is? Let your imagination run wild; no matter how giddy you get, as the failure of the fracking bubble becomes impossible to ignore, the mass media and a great many of our fellow hominids are go much further along the track of the marching squirrels than you will. </div>

For me what has been misrepresented as an attack by radical islam on a furry froggy peace loving egalitarian critter is in all probability the latest stirrings of serious uprising by the internal proletariat of a notoriously imperialistic country whose middle class elites seem completely oblivious to the carnage that modern consumer middle class lifestyles wreak on the imperial periphery as well as its own internal periphery . 10000 troops now deployed domestically , for heavens sake .<br>(One million dead Algerians , anyone ?? )<br><br>Writers such as Mark Levine on Al Jazeera opinion section and chris hedges on truthdig have calmly deconstructed the most likely nature of these attacks , quite apart from the war drums against "Islam" which are now beating loudly to distract the harried and anxious endangered species middle class from the unsavoury prospects of impending financial collapse and the excesses of the transnational stateless ruling class ...Of course the shining white light of radical islam is bound to become an irresistible beacon to draw moths of all disaffected stripes to its flame , but to fall for this obvious chimaera is a disaster for all thinking people who hope to not be used as cannon fodder in the collapse .<br><br>Down here in fuzzy cute egalitarian god save the queen nirvana , we are sitting on two thirds of the worlds known uranium deposits , and if my hunch is correct we will soon be having the mother of all debates about nuclear power in this country , as the indigenous people at the maralina nuclear test sites have finally started glowing a slightly less luminous shade of green ! <br>I have noticed various companies quietly moving chess pieces in to south australia in advance of the Olympic Dam uranium project firing up , though the attempt to install a neo con state government earlier this year has failed . I get the sense they are waiting for the coming economic purge before ramping this project up , as once we are all sitting among the smoking ruins of the world economy the debate over nuclear will be that much easier to prosecute with the shell shocked public who by then will mostly be curled up in the foetal position whimpering " mummy <br>". <br><br>South australia is also the site of significant naval sub building facilities as well as the home of the arckaringa shale oil deposits near coober peedy ( as well as the cooper basin geothermal projects ) asx listing "GDY " a there you are , my crazy energy projects for Skippy Ozland ! <br>Halliburton went within an ace last time the neocons were in power down under of gaining the contract to ship nuclear waste from all around the world from SA spencer gulf up the railway line to alice springs ( pine gap ) and then up to remote Mukaty Station near tennant creek , againt the wishes of the already slightly radioactive locals .( waste from the reactors of u.s nuclear warships , anyone ??) . My guess is that this project is still very much alive <br><br>Our next green wizard magical project should be to re- manifest the ageing bards of Midnight Oil for some serious Dead Heart Diesel and Dust , against the backdrop of some hard core Blue Sky Mining .<br>Interesting that Richard Heinberg points out in his book that there is only 80 odd years of uranium left in the world at current rates of usage , though breeder reactors such as the one at Fuka- sashimi in Japan have been constructed to try and string this out by burning the much more unstable and dangerous Plutonium ....<br>Happy Days ...now to water the veges ! <br><br><br><a href=#c333819437156750781 title="comment permalink">1/14/15, 5:05 PM</a><br><br>

Would the Industrial Revolution still have occurred only with renewables or would it have been impossible without our first coming upon the vast and easily accessible FF first? I think about how much knowledge has been gained(including in renewable energy) since we started using FF full stop and wonder if we would still have that knowledge without all those (FF created) inventions. Also how will future civilizations even know how to to make things like solar panels or just general electricity through some other means if that knowledge is lost?

My current favorite mass delusion: the idea of moving to Canada when the poopy hits the fan here in the United States. Because yes, over here there are plenty of people in that stereotypical Hollywood bubble that everyone hears about, folks who are totally self absorbed and not paying attention to the rest of the world except in the most superficial sense. At the same time, I know plenty of "creatives" (actors, writers, directors) who are not like that. These are people who follow the news, are well-educated and have some capacity for critical thought. And when I'm together with my friends in social settings, and the topic turns to politics or the state of the world, everyone will basically admit that they feel like something horrible is about to happen to our country and that we are on the verge of a really serious crisis of some sort. Even the ones who can't explain it just have that feeling. (I often try to distill this blog's wisdom in this situation, but most of them aren't even ready to begin hearing it) So what are everyone's plans for how they are going to handle the crisis when it hits? To a person they all entertain the same half-baked idea that they are going to get in their car as soon as the crisis hits and hightail it to the imagined safety and universal healthcare of Canada. <br><br>Now granted, the entertainment industry here in Hollywood is full of Canadians who have every right to return home, but still, one wishes them luck fighting the traffic jam that's sure to show up at the border, since even full-blooded Americans with no claim to Canadian residency espouse this as their plan. Then again, maybe this ambition of getting up and moving to Canada en masse is not really a delusion after all, maybe it's just a really stupid idea. When you consider how long and unguarded the Canadian-American border is, and how many people live on the southern side compared to the northern, it's hard to see how the Canadian authorities could do more than intercept a handful of asylum seekers if there was ever a mass movement to cross that border. Still though, people espousing that hope seem to imagine that they would have universal healthcare and house in the Vancouver suburbs. The reality of it would probably be more like people crammed like sardines into tents and trailers at a frigid refugee camp in the boondocks of Alberta.<br><br><br><a href=#c3584013587412357222 title="comment permalink">1/14/15, 6:10 PM</a><br><br>

Chopra told us that "both energy and consciousness are infinite", and his business partner Brutoco explained by foolproof analogy that every time we change energy sources, from wood, to coal, to oil, to natural gas, and then to hydrogen... "every time it switches, you get this massive increase in global national wealth. GDP goes up dramatically." ... " Think of what that buys.

It's good stuff, but makes for unpleasant reading for expectational folk.<br><br>Anyway, I was using solar electric energy today to bake a loaf of bread in an electric oven and thought up a useful (?) concept for the readers to get a feel for how much energy is available in a 4.2kW solar electric off grid system - in the real world.<br><br>It's called the loafometer (cool, huh?)! To bake a loaf of bread uses up about 0.8kWh of electrical energy. So 0.8kWh is equal to 1 loaf as measured by the loafometer (should that be a TM?).<br><br>So, on the very worst day of energy production here, the 4.2kW of photovoltaic electrical panels produce 0.5 loaves (note the use of the plural) for an entire day.<br><br>On the very best day that I've recorded here over many years, the 4.2kW of photovoltaic electrical panels produce 14.3 loaves for an entire day.<br><br>As a comparison, the loafometer is quite flexible and it can be used to measure the average households daily electrical usage for a house down under to give approximately: 30.8 loaves. <br><br>Those loaves are available whether the sun shines or the wind blows or not as may well be the case. It is an unrealistic expectation of future performance.<br><br>It is quite frightening really. Personally I'm happy with far fewer loaves.<br><br>PS: I've just thought up a very amusing and dodgy cornucopian premise for the competition. <br><br>I also assume that the first person that posts a dodgy media release, gets the credit for it and the idea and can't be copied or modified by later entries?<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: There is a new blog post up discussing: hot weather; bees; flowers; fruit harvests; native grasses; electric chipping; mulch in quantity; and unexpected tropical monsoons.

Satire is always welcome, though. I think I’ll be focusing more on “crunch time” stuff myself. I wonder if a challenge on that theme would be a good idea for next year? Maybe something like the Krampus challenge, but geared more towards tips and tricks than big engineering projects.<br><br>I’ve been thinking a lot about that process of doubling down, and how easy it is to use progress to mask decline. I overhear people talking about the Self Driving Cars that are working their way through the prototyping phase, for instance. Since they rely on Google maps, they would only be able to drive in areas that are programmed into the maps and have reliable wi-fi. The same is true of electric cars that are only viable near an industrial power grid. I can easily imagine a world in which all maintenance and repair is reserved for a few major arteries and a few decaying urban centers but google cars, virtual reality games, and household “robots” that are little more than glorified i-phones make it impossible to notice what’s actually going on until it’s far too late. I think about the “inducer” from the first story in the latest After Oil collection, which was the center of people’s lives in a few urban centers with internet, but was rubbish for a little girl’s odds and ends connections just a few hundred miles away. That ability of technology to provide shiny distractions from the surrounding decay presents a powerful case for less stimulation.<br><br>The “as the torch held downward regains fresh strength, so from lowly fortune will Rome soar even more radiantly aloft” language in Rutilius Namatianus’ “A Voyage Home to Gaul” is a constant reminder to me that people will continue to believe in the return of prosperity even long after the world has moved on. But I do wonder if there’ll ever be a day in the foreseeable future when people who value the pursuit of a simpler, handmade life and put spiritual fulfillment before mindless entertainment are more than a scattered fringe.<br><br><br><a href=#c5753313401871759280 title="comment permalink">1/14/15, 7:22 PM</a><br><br>

Why is freedom of speech heralded as a Holy Standard when it comes to defending one of the best cultural legacies from the 70s, a time when prosperity was not just for the White upper-class... and why is that same Standard lowered when the French government blindly takes a black (dishonest, law-despising, mediocre, used to vile provocation) humor comedian into custody because he published one edgy Facebook comment ?<br><br>This double standard, enforced by our Heads Of State, is going to add more resent to an already strained society. Said crappy comedian's pique was actually a covert antisemitic pique, referring to the Cosher store part of the attacks. By stupidly advertising that guy with taxpayer money (custody can only make him more popular, AND it is paid by our taxes), the government is at risk of adding antisemitism to the building up of social strains. The elites are truly blind here. Having Israel's Head Of State march to defend peace and the freedom of caricaturing Islam's Prophet last Sunday is certainly going to help ease the growing discontent with our Middle-East policy after last summer's slaughter of Palestinian civilians.<br>I hope the unity of last Sunday's march is not a horribly realistic illusion, or that it will stand the test of economic hardships facing us.<br><br>The worldwide context is also pretty grim. No one knows how Saudi Arabia is going to rule itself, which will add to the US's home energy problems. So I agree with you or JMG that 2015 is standing at the threshold of vastly disruptive events. And yet here people still have trouble grasping simple economic realities, for example that low oil prices are not due to abundance but to a global deflation.<br><br>A really useful step on a social level would to find a way of applying the Green Wizardry paradigm to our suburbs. The French suburbs, in terms of landscape and social structure, is our social equivalent of a giant pile of nuclear waste waiting by the roadside. If any other French reader/commenter of this blog has any practical idea in that direction, I would be very interested to hear it. The question for France is not as much going to be How without oil ? as it is going to be What to do with the suburbs and peripheries ?<br><br><a href=#c3416456350429196184 title="comment permalink">1/14/15, 8:13 PM</a><br><br>

I enjoy the intellectual culture, and lately, have enjoyed seeing how the young adults handle very adult matters. You know, childhood extends a long time nowadays - often right into the early to mid twenties. The kids are very well informed, and funny to say, as blind as ever. <br><br>In the Lincoln-Douglas, or values/philosophical debates, the topic in the Spring 2014 was the balance of environmental impact vs. economic benefit in the pursuit of natural resource extraction. I was fortunate to judge some semi-final rounds in the state championship, so the debaters were quite polished. In a memorable debate, the affirmative side presented a case in which the central value was "Pantheism" with a criterion of social justice. Her opponent - so, affirming the economic benefit of natural resource extraction - countered with the obvious and indefatigable position that development makes people's lives better.<br><br>Neither mentioned the possibility of an absence of the fuels required for their either grandiose or destructive plans. It reminded me of a line from, I think, somewhere in the Mahabharata, in which Dharma (as a god) is questioning Yuddhistira (who is his son), and among the questions was, "What is the most wondrous thing?" to which Yuddhistira replied, "Every day we die, yet we go on living as though we are immortal. That is the greatest wonder."<br><br>I was reading through the projections, both the realistic projections by Post-Carbon Institute (which when considering that PCI cannot factor in capex, and political/environmental concerns, their realistic estimates are really optimistic!) and the EIA projections. The trouble is that to what extent plans are being made, they are being made based on overzealous estimates - and ones that are terribly front-loaded. That is the trouble for a consumer as well - consider someone contemplating buying a car, thinking gas prices are low. Because fracked wells tail off production by about 80-90% after three years - think about the nature of the process of extraction here, not just drawing off a reservoir, but pulverizing sediments - so the prices of the commodity will bounce up considerably by 2018 or 2019 at the outside.<br><br>You have discussed "demand destruction". I imagine that by the above time frame or sooner, there will begin to be mounting reasons for us to either get involved, or arm somebody, in overseas conflicts, which yet again get to play their favorite role of demand creation.

I just picked up an office job with a local nonprofit I've been involved with for the last couple years. It's a good organization doing worthwhile work, building the local food system and supporting small farmers. But it's very grant-dependent, meaning it's system-dependent. And that system won't be here forever--and may well be in tatters in a year or two.<br><br>On the other hand, I purposely declined to apply for the job as a full time position and instead teamed with another person in the organization to co-apply, with each of us working part time. Why? Well, so I would still have time to grow and raise food. I'm keeping a bit of side work with the two farms I've been working for over the last three years and will continue to garden and grow food for myself. I still have my flock of chickens. I'm still making yogurt, both for myself and for trade. My hand crank, Wondermill grain grinder just arrived today. I'll use it to grind the flour corn I grew last year. I just joined a local work party group and will get my work party in April, which will be the building and installation of a batch solar water heater. I'm the Treasurer of the local Grange. I have a whole lot of community members who seem to like and respect me. Even though I've given some of my farm work to my new roommate, I've kept some and still know of two local farmers who are looking for extra help, and both of whom expressed interest in me specifically.<br><br>My new position's funded for at least one year and probably two, though I can't guarantee a haywire economy won't derail that second year. I'm very purposefully not investing my ego in this new position. I've taken it on, but I'm remaining cautious and not expecting anything permanent from it. I've already accepted that it could end abruptly, and that I could find myself largely or mostly out of work. Obviously, I don't want that to happen--but if it does, it won't shatter my mental and emotional world, and I have some idea of what I'll do to get by (though I also know I'll have to figure much of that out on the fly.)<br><br>No, I don't imagine my timing was good on this work change. But I still think there's a good chance I'll manage to scrape by, whatever happens.<br><br>We'll see, though. Interesting times, right? I suppose my biggest hope is that I'll find my way and help others find theirs. That I'll be able to offer something to my community. I know I'm doing that now and I'm pretty sure I'll be able to continue doing it in some capacity, whatever happens.<br><br>I have to say, I'm nervous to see what this year brings. But I'm fascinated, too. I suppose having a foot in both worlds will just make it all the more fascinating.<br><br><a href=#c3432140929847191368 title="comment permalink">1/14/15, 9:45 PM</a><br><br>

These are the true 'alternative energy sources' we should be focusing on.<br><br>Though the amount of energy that can be harvested from any one star is admittedly infinitesimal, the number of stars is so large that we can, as they say, make it up in volume. Do not let anyone, whether some hotshot professor or your dear old mum, convince you otherwise. If they even try, do what must be done to silence them and let your conscience be quiet about it.<br>…<br>We therefore call for a national-level 10 trillion dollar Stellar Energy Harvesting Initiative that aims to bring the percentage of our energy harvested from the non-Sol stars up to 5% of GDP by 2035, or your money back.<br>…<br>This Initiative will eventually pay for itself a thousand times over, but up front it will require us to bite the bullet and raise taxes on DVD rentals, lane changes, and kettle corn..."<br><br><a href=http://proverbialbejesus.blogspot.tw/2012/03/energy-independence-real-enemy.html rel=nofollow> Stellar Energy Harvesting Key to Energy Independence </a><br><br><a href=#c8683389747177625733 title="comment permalink">1/14/15, 10:43 PM</a><br><br>

The last time a 1914 type scenario happened, large parts of the world went to war. With the drums of war beating against Russia, I'm mentally preparing myself to deal with the idea of being drafted for a war I would principally oppose in every way (including sympathy with the 'enemy'). <br><br>To lighten my mood I'll try and rise to your challenge - I always had an amusing thought about making convicts generate power on stationary bicycles in return for slightly reduced sentence times.<br><br>On another note, I thought you'd be interested to know that nowadays international debating has another meaning for the word 'squirrel'. A squirrel is an case set up with truisms or bad definitions so that it can't be proven false. As an example, I adjudicated a high school debate last year about banning religious symbols in schools. The affirmative team decided to define religious symbols as 'expression of faith' but not physical symbols like crosses and veils (did they think that I wouldn't know English?), to basically 'squirrel' away from the real argument.<br>Obviously the modern 'squirrel' is just as common as the 'squirrel' of your time.<br><br>YCS<br><br><a href=#c7667854659878522772 title="comment permalink">1/15/15, 12:59 AM</a><br><br>

The price of said rapidly depleting substance just went down again by nearly 2% today to $47. At that rate it will be free by Easter. Every day on this planet a billion vehicles that need that substance are switched on and move, more or less, happily along streets. I can’t explain how this happens, but apparently it does happen.

Direct mechanical energy (windmills, water mills) can be used for manufacturing. Most all scientific advances before early-mid 18th century are by definition attainable without an FF-based system. Many medical, scientific or methodical insights (like vaccination) are completely independent of that. So in terms of devices off the bat there can be decent clocks, printing presses, telescopes, microscopes, global navigation &amp; cartography etc.<br>A simple electrical generator can be built without FF input but will be expensive in terms of input (lots of copper wire). However it can last for generations. Its energy will not be squandered on heating, transportation, lighting etc. A good application would be telegraphy, which requires very little energy. No intercontinental undersea cables as we had in the 1860s though, but regional telecommunication. Radio should also be doable.<br>Roads will have to be built mostly like the Romans did. No cars, bicycles will be only a curiosity because there will not be sufficient paths to make them really useful. Heavy and long-distance transport will be by waterway. Railways with animal-drawn rolling stock as on-site/local transport enhancement (friction reduction) but locomotives will also remain a curiosity if they can only be fueled with wood.<br>Hot air balloons, gliders, sailplanes are attainable but no motorized aviation or zeppelins - flying will also be a curiosity or local reconnaissance only.<br>As hinted at, good general medical practice, proper obstetrics, vaccination, antiseptic surgery routines, diagnosis and discovery of major bacterial pathogens, discovery and production of antibiotics will remain principally possible.

Not only is it a greenhouse gas, it's also a waste of energy, of both acoustic and chemical kinds. The proposal is simple - rig us a collector on wheels to be towed behind each cow (or bull, if you can get close enough). Imagine a Victrola horn situated about six inches behind said cow or methane generator. The horn concentrates the sound waves produced by the gaseous blast and produces a small electric current, which runs a fan, which propels the methane into the collection chamber. The collection chamber is separated from the horn collection unit by a one way flapper valve, and in the collection chamber is an aluminum sponge which bonds to the methane by electrostatic force, provided by the aforementioned gaseous blast. Every night eah collection unit is pocked up and exchanged with a fresh one, and the methane saturated sponge is freed from the methane and returned to its fresh state, the methane collected being used for various things.<br><br>The name? The B---S--- Generator<br>The motto?

During their conversation, Martenson wondered out loud whether various tight oil firms, which rely on fracking, would fail and file for bankruptcy as a result of the recent severe drop in oil prices. Berman assured Martenson that it was more likely that such firms would be bought out by bigger ones before they filed for bankruptcy. As soon as I heard that it dawned on me that petroleum geologist Art Berman has been spending too much time talking to conservative investors, stockbrokers, hedge fund managers, etc. As a result, Berman has developed an artificial sense of the stability of the present financial system.<br><br>A recent interview of Art Berman --- http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-01-07/real-cause-low-oil-prices-interview-arthur-berman<br><br>Gail Tverberg has no such illusions. She's one of my facebook friends, and has even lapsed into faith-based rhetoric to counter what she sees as a hopeless situation for US society in particular and for industrial civilization in general. She has even said something to the effect that "there is a basic order to the universe" and perhaps something, someone, some entity or some mysterious force would possibly intervene on behalf of humanity in the midst of such darkness. I thought to myself how a certain Archdruid might react at the pollyanna-ish nature of Tverberg's musings.<br><br>Tverberg is friends with Ozzie Zehner, whose work "Green Illusions" you might know about. Zehner is quite pessimistic about what would happen to society if it made a massive commitment to renewables in an effort to maintain our current set of living arrangements. According to Zehner, a collapse of industrial civilization would result from such an effort. Of course such a collapse is nearly inevitable anyway but Zehner doesn't go into that matter.<br><br>It's quite rare even among public intellectuals to find someone with an appropriate sense of urgency and foreboding but without apocalyptic tendencies. Scientists tend to be focused narrowly on their particular discipline. Public intellectuals such as Morris Berman, Henry Giroux and Chris Hedges don't have the background in ecology (they probably never read much William Catton or Garret Hardin)<br>to have an appropriate level of alarm and poignancy with regard to the future not only of civilization but also of humanity and the biosphere.<br><br>Creative thinker Derrick Jensen cannot bear to ponder the thought that humanity is itself flawed and that humanity's destructive impulses might even be inherent to our nature. Instead, Jensen speaks derisively of the "dominant culture" to which all blame for humanity's destructiveness can be leveled.<br><br>Ugo Bardi has been writing about the Seneca cliff, and has developed the mathematics to justify it. If you understand what Bardi is saying, it's not at all reassuring. It means that Richard C. Duncan's "Olduvai theory" [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olduvai_theory]<br>could be realized in just a few decades.<br><br>Guy McPherson's near-term extinction might not be so far-fetched after all, but "near term" more appropriately is referring to a few hundred years, not a few decades. An enormous global human die-off within a few decades seems plausible though and quite catastrophic.<br><br><a href=#c7616655475892319959 title="comment permalink">1/15/15, 4:16 AM</a><br><br>

To be honest my beef with nuclear power in an Australian environment is this: all the known designs for nuclear fission reactors currently extant require large amounts of clean, drinking-quality water as a coolant source for the reactor pile. They return this water in a form which is unfit for human consumption, or indeed inclusion in any biological cycle at all (it can't be used to water plants, wash clothes, or even to flush toilets) because it's so heavily contaminated (deuterium, tritium etc). So the boosters for nuclear power here in Australia are suggesting we switch to this incredibly water-dependent form of power generation, in a country which is already so poorly supplied with drinking-quality water that every single mainland capital city has been on continual water restrictions for at least the past decade or so. Where do they think they're getting the coolant from? (Are they willing to pass this information on to the water supply utilities in each state?). As for not using water as a coolant... I think this was tried (briefly) in Chernobyl, and it worked right up to the point where the reactor pile went boom. <br><br>It's right up there with the agricultural thought-bubbles floating about for "developing" the northern part of Australia (the bits above the Tropic of Capricorn) into a "food bowl".

What most people on the planet today envision as "renewable" energy are industrial solar and wind capturing devices: the huge wind turbines and vast arrays of solar panels decorating glossy magazine ads and the covers of expensive reports.<br><br>In the early 70s, when I first became aware of what was then called Alternative energy movement, what was being built were homegrown, low tech solutions. Soon the geeks got involved, bringing solar cell technology developed for the space program into the mix. Then, inevitably, the fossil fuel industry got interested and entered the market hoping to cash in on this new wave: few remember that Arco was a manufacturer of solar panels for a while. BP invested in solar up until quite recently. But the end of the energy crisis kicked the money out of the burgeoning industrial renewable energy, until its resurgence with high oil prices of the early part of this century.<br><br>These modern industrial "renewable" power plants are 100% dependent on fossil fuels for materials, construction, maintenance, and their ultimate delivery of electricity. Take wind turbines, for example: they actually require external energy when idle. Land based wind turbines draw from the grid to keep transformers charged. Off shore turbines in cold areas need diesel generators or grid power to keep the gearboxes from freezing. Wind turbines require oil for gearboxes, replacements for bearings and controllers, and the use of huge cranes or ships to accomplish these maintenance tasks. Solar power plants are a bit less maintenance hungry as they aren't enormous generators perched atop 400 ft steel masts, anchored in hundreds of tons of concrete. But solar power plants require sophisticated electronic controllers, and the manufacture of solar cells is a highly technical industrial manufacturing process--both of which depend upon fossil fuel mining and a complex global supply chain.<br><br>The future Renewable energy of which the Archdruid speaks is more likely to resemble 18th century energy sources, such as run of the river water wheels. Twentieth century tech such as insulated walls and passive solar design will enable the wealthier future humans to live more comfortably in the absence of central heating. Simple solar thermal setups of water filled pipes covered with glass will also be effective low tech energy sources. Solar ovens, likewise. <br><br>But the vast majority of what we now think of as "renewable" energy sources will not exist with the loss of cheap fossil fuels. We should start now and distinguish in our language the difference between industrial renewables and low tech renewables. Helping others understand this difference is crucial to responding to the limits of our energy future.<br><br><a href=#c2888716464737817439 title="comment permalink">1/15/15, 9:07 AM</a><br><br>

Build a series of carbon fibre tubes from the seabed up to geo-syncroness orbit. Freight elevators will run in some of these tubes, to take large mirrors up to space, where they will be used to focus sunlight down other tubes. The quality and quanity of sunlight in space is much greater than at the earths surface, so this will be a major advancement in solar power. The sunlight will be used to boil sea water at the base of the tower, and the steam will be directed through turbines to generate electricity. The waste steam will be directed up other tubes to condense at high altitude, then the water collected will fall back down other tubes to supply hydro-electric generators. The water will be stored in the tubes at altitude, enabling on demand generation during hours of darkness. This collection of carbon fibre tubes will be mutually supporting , much as a large tree is. The economic value of the space elevator taking shipping to and from orbit will ensure the long term profitability of the project, as well as the abundant power resources will support a vibrant ecomomic hub of industry at the base of each tower. This will be called the "Space Power Tree Project", as the carbon fibre tubes will appear to be a tree trunk, with a crown of mirrors at the top.<br><br><a href=#c290830965121386019 title="comment permalink">1/15/15, 10:02 AM</a><br><br>

The first crisis of Rome (the wars in Judea, Germania, and Scotland from Hadrian to Aurelius or the World Wars and Depressions of the 20th century) are often seen as both a period of crisis and a golden age. They opened the way to an era of decadence, prosperity, and political shortsightedness. The third crisis (the gothic wars and edict of Thessalonica through the death of Alaric) is seen as the beginning of the end, and the final death gasp (Attila to Odoacer) is what history books skip to. The second crisis, though (the Edict of Milan, the Persian Wars, the death of Julian, and the splitting of Rome under Diocletian) was a stage setter. Rising tensions between the state and a despised religious minority that finally broke and opened the way for a second religiosity (interestingly enough that’s a feature of this round at least in Europe, mainline Christianity in America isn’t quite far enough along on its decline quite yet), but that wasn’t the end of the old temple cults or the secular philosophies. The dividing of Rome was very similar to your scenario in Twilight’s Last Gleaming. In that novel though, day to day life didn’t change much. There were more homeless in abandoned shopping malls, but for most people it was history seen from living room couches and smart phones. After the last amendment, people just went back to work the next day. I guess that’s one of the big points of this blog. Wet mackerels have an emotional impact. People remember where they were at the crash of ’29, or Pearl Harbor, or Kennedy’s assassination, or the fall of the Berlin Wall, or on 9/11. But for most people those were punches in the chest delivered over the radio. If I’m sitting down to Christmas dinner in 2050 looking back, I’ll remember the emotions of the big events of the crisis, if I’m there I’ll remember a few harrowing days, but mostly my life will just be working to make ends meet.

For example, if one lives in a major urban center where farmbale land is extremely expensive and often miles from where one lives anyway. Or people who live where there is just not enough rainfall to make it work without water rights or an enormous amount of money. The other problem is that many of us young people just don't have access to jobs that pay enough to finance trying to buy enough land to start working on this skill, if they even have a job at all. I know I shouldn't ask for your "advice," but do you think that heading out of urban centers etc. sooner rather than later and learning the trade of food production is something that can't be put off to 15 or 20 years from now, given current economic decline? I mean, its easy to fall into thinking that making a modest amount of money flipping burgers this year is gonna be more important than starting that process.

The last ones went out of business in the fifties I think. Rather than worrying about mundane products, such as glue (some incremental revenue could be derived from it) the fats from uneaten garbage, livestock, and deceased pets would be processed into liquid fuels. If you took it to the next level, you could take the pressure off local municipalities having to fund potters fields for the indigent, ensuring political support. And surely, one could encourage irritating green types concerned about fouling the environment through cremation or embalming to donate their corpse. Just imagine, your body "fueling the future."

I have (for now) a steady well-paying job as a software engineer for a company that provides services for multifamily rental companies, which seems like it would do well in a recession (it did in 2008/2009), at least at first, but in the long run maybe not so much.

Radical Islam made them feel like the warriors they wanted to be, not the pathetic, unemployable failures they were in the real world. There are many of them here in France, because it's more and more difficult to be employable.

Well, let me be very un-PC here. Who is able to keep relative peace among impoverished, mutually hostile groups? Men like Saddam Hussein and Bashar Al-Assad, who protected minorities and imposed relative secularism.

If we take oil as an example, the “size of oil deposit” versus “number of such deposits” is typically plotted on a base ten log-log plot. Such a plot, as for any power law phenomena, typically shows up as a more or less straight line sloping down to the right. <br><br>Needless to say, straight lines in nature are cool;)<br><br>The basic equation is of the form: <br><br>log(Size of Oil Field) = - k1 * log(Number of Fields per Size Category) + k2 <br><br>i.e. a straight line with a negative slope on a log-log plot; where the “k”s are positive valued constants <br><br>One increment drop in number on this plot (meaning 10 times as rare) does not necessarily yield a 10 fold increase in size (meaning concentration) unless k1 = 1 (and it rarely is).<br><br>One can also represent the relationship between size and number if one raises 10 to the power of each side of the equation above to get<br><br>Size of Oil Field = (10^k2) * (Number of Fields per Size Category)^-k1 <br><br>In the case of oil, what this curve above tells us (when fitted to the data we have to date) is roughly how much ultimate recoverable oil there is on the earth (i.e. the area under this curve – the “integral” of the curve). Thus we can know this amount despite not having discovered all the recoverable oil there is. And so arguments that “We just discovered a big new oil field” are largely irrelevant to peak oil.<br><br>Further, the basic shape of Hubbert's curve for the world can be derived from the curve above. As the larger oil fields are typically discovered first, these are developed and produce first. Now one has a time dimension by assuming that (for the most part) one is gradually working one's way to the right on the size versus number curve (i.e. picking the (big) low hanging fruit first). Basically one just plots the integral of the curve above but replaces the horizontal “number of deposits” with “time” and bingo: one has the humped shaped Hubbert's curve that peaks more or less in the middle. The hump in middle is from the act that the midranged number of midsized oil fields have more oil than either the few big fields or the many really small fields (the two tails of the integral curve). <br><br>So yes, the power law for oil is a very powerful law (excuse the pun). It tells us roughly how much ultimate recoverable oil there is and roughly when oil production will peak (about half way through production of the total).<br><br>I am very certain you know these conclusions; but its fun to see how relatively simple it is to obtain them from the power law. <br><br>Thank you for your indulgence. Now you can go back to comments more relevant to your post.<br><br><a href=#c8296348932726696974 title="comment permalink">1/15/15, 11:07 AM</a><br><br>

Mr Greer, I admire your immense knowledge and sense of history and our place in it. But I'm not convinced that we're looking down the barrel of Crisis just yet. Look, you're trying to call the breakdown of a centuries-long economic and social cycle. You have to be aware the margin of error is probably +/-50 years! Calling the principle events to within 50 years puts you head and shoulders above any of the great seers of the past (Cicero, Voltaire, etc).<br><br>I would like to offer an alternative opinion (still dark, but not black) if I may. Yes, it looks like a recession is coming, likely this year. But I don't think we'll see a real down-step of free energy available to society just yet. Yes fracking activity will decline, but the tight oil resource is not spent yet, and things will remain in place for it to start up again if favorable conditions return, which they could.<br><br>At the moment it looks like we'll see a drop of business investment to the tune of 15-20% and a bond market disruption, followed by the usual knock-on effects (local government spending contraction, a pulse of unemployment, weak, maybe declining personal spending). But I do not expect to see the forces of actual *depression*, a la the 2008 banking crisis, this time around. The reason is that the government (together with the banks) have, since 2008, put in place all of the machinery to transfer the losses onto the government essentially in real time. The 2008 panic took policy makers by surprise: systems had to be improvised, laws carefully circumvented, etc. This time around, the response systems are in place, and the laws have been changed.<br><br>Plus there are tools yet. Major opinion makers (NYTimes etc) are openly talking about direct central bank transfers to the people. A quarter trillion of this per month will cure a depression fast, though not the deeper problems.<br><br>So here's the alternative view: the new trouble will inaugurate a 5+ year period of even crappier growth (by gov measures), maybe an averaged 1-2% rate plus in-and-out of recession, instead of the 2-3% since 2009. After ~5 years of this, even the incredibly dense mainstream economists will start toying with the idea that we're facing deeper problems, and that will scare them. At that point it will be interesting to see which way policy-makers will take us. No way to predict.<br><br><a href=#c1574011900063709871 title="comment permalink">1/15/15, 1:18 PM</a><br><br>

That will come when one of three things happens: 1) financial problems get so bad that even governments can't cover the losses, and consequently they lose control of the currency. Yes, that could be triggered by a big step-down in available free energy. But despite recent problems, we're not facing that yet. 2) A social tipping point is reached and threatens chaos, a la 1967, 1848, or 1789. Yes, unrest has been growing, but we're nowhere near a 1967 yet, let alone an 1848 or a 1789 (though I know things can happen quickly). If/when we get there, the consequence will be overnight legitimization of authoritarian-style government, and we'll get our Fred Haliot or, more likely, a technocratic-beaurocratic party rule, likely some kind of Rep-Dem/corporate coalition. We'll get a temporary stabilization. 3) We get a Black Swan international event, a la 1914. Eg. if NATO and Russia are stupid enough to start directly shooting each other and China is forced to choose sides, or maybe if Japan swings into hyperinflation, or maybe regional war breaks out in the mid-east (could be a homegrown anti-ISIS coalition forms, then breaks up as bids for territory or Iraqi oil fields force the national players onto opposing sides).<br><br>I still think a 1 or a 2 is a minimum of 10 years away, and probably more like 20. No one can predict a 3, but I don't think the tinder is dry enough quite yet for a black swan to bring a general crisis---for all the issues (terrorism, racism, right-wing retrenchment, proliferating but poorly thought-out leftist ideologies) that everyone is concerned about now, things have been much, much worse at times in the past. And we're still too comfortable in our lives to risk the really big die-throws.<br><br>Bottom line: the hour is late but the bell isn't tolling yet: there's still a little time. Let's make the best of the precious minutes (the next few years) that we still have.<br><br><br><a href=#c4846514923023822147 title="comment permalink">1/15/15, 2:49 PM</a><br><br>

I was listening to John David Ebert’s lecture series on Oswald Spengler’s Decline of the West. Ebert argued, as Pat Buchanan and William Lind have, that World War I and World War II were really about the clash between Culture and Civilization in the Spenglerian sense, with Germany and its allies representing the forces of Culture and the Western alliance representing the forces of Civilization. <br><br>In Spengler’s theory of history, Culture represents the earlier, organic stage of development in the lifecycle of a civilization and is based on a religious worldview. Civilization by contrast is materialistic, irreverent and irreligious by nature and this is the stage the West is currently in. Islam represents an ancient civilization that has returned to its spiritual roots, a phenomenon Spengler called the Second Religiousness, one which lacks the vitality and dynamism of the earlier Cultural phase but is based on a sense of deep piety and reverence for one’s spiritual heritage.<br><br>As I listened to Ebert’s discussion of the difference between Culture and Civilization in Spenglerian philosophy, it occurred to me that the clash between French secularism and Islam is another classic example of a clash between Culture and Civilization. Here we have a nation within a decadent civilization that has allowed millions of Muslim immigrants in and then condones and protects a newspaper that routinely engages in racist hate speech against Muslims and insults their deepest beliefs, what in Russian is known as “spitting in someone’s soul”. Charlie Hebdo has been spitting in the souls of 1.6 billion Muslims as well as those of Christians for years. But whereas Western Christianity is a weak and spent force, Muslims have repeated demonstrated a willingness to defend their religion by force if necessary. It was only a matter of time before an act of retribution like the one in Paris occurred.<br><br>Given the vast numbers of Muslim immigrants that France has allowed in over the last several decades, the sort of Islam bashing that Charlie Hebdo has been engaging in is an act of rank stupidity. If this continues, it will fuel the fires of Islamic rage and since France seems bent on continuing its multiculturalist policies, this guarantees that when Islam takes over due to a combination of mass immigration and the differential in birth rates, there will be terrible consequences that follow. It seems likely to me that Jean Raspail’s nightmare is virtually inevitable at this point and that the antics of Charlie Hebdo and the folly of the French government is going to make a great tragedy even bloodier. As I said, bear baiting is usually a bad idea. It’s even worse when you invited the bear in the first place and then allow a bunch of irresponsible, juvenile bigots and hate mongers to keep baiting the bear until it finally gets fed up and decides to bite back.<br><br><a href=#c1459638396267438048 title="comment permalink">1/15/15, 3:30 PM</a><br><br>

Anyone is free to expand them further if they feel they can get investment money for their effort.<br><br>The first one is simple and builds upon your own squirrels example and a topic from last week's comments. Imagine the squirrel power plant, with rows upon rows of the furry creatures in their little wheels chasing suspended acorns. But what if there was something chasing the squirrels themselves? You could double your energy output! This is where the feral dogs come in. Import a few shiploads of them from Eastern Europe and all our problems are solved. The US fulfills its energy needs and the EU has a strong economy again. Plus, I don't know how many squirrels you have, but we probably have more dogs.<br><br>The second idea is the greenest I can think of. It uses gravity and could be better than solar power. Instead of large, fragile glass panels destroying the aesthetic of your house, you could simply connect all your roof tiles to pressure sensors, which would use the impact of rain drops, snowflakes and assorted bird droppings to make your home independent from the grid. Granted, a more large-scale approach could be implemented by using the pavements of financial districts, like Wall Street, but that's not really a renewable source, only recurring.<br><br>For the third one I'm going to get a bit darker. There are ideas to use movement or residual body heat to charge smartphones, but that's thinking small, since is a concentrated energy source just beneath the surface and we have a time-tested means of extracting it. I'm talking, of course, about blood and leeches, respectively. About 30 or so of them attached every day and you can fill a barrel by the end of the month, which is then taken to a power plant to be either converted to biofuel or burned directly. I even have a title for this one: "The new fashion craze that could save the planet: renewable, organic accessories that give free energy".<br><br><a href=#c3555469472534099202 title="comment permalink">1/15/15, 3:57 PM</a><br><br>

Several months back, Russia imposed an embargo on agricultural imports from the US and EU in response to American and EU sanctions and warned that further retaliation might be forthcoming if the Americans and Europeans continued their policies. Since then, we have seen a escalation of anti-Russian sanctions, economic pressure and propaganda by both the US and the EU. So its not surprising that Russia decided to do some retaliation of its own and take advantage one of Europe’s greatest vulnerabilities. Note too that Russian officials have said they have other means of retaliating in addition to cutting off or reducing gas and oil supplies to Europe. One of the ideas they have floated is cutting off the overflight rights of American and European airlines through Russian airspace. This wouldn’t hurt American airlines so much, but if European airlines have to go around Russian airspace while their Asian and Middle Eastern competitors don’t have to, that’s going to hurt them big time.<br><br><a href=#c5150043751893729979 title="comment permalink">1/15/15, 4:05 PM</a><br><br>

Here are a few (this is actually my project list, but I am very bad at accomplishing any project) :<br>- growing crickets in a cage (and make pâté out of it :))<br>- growing snails in a box (in the countryside they are a pest like grass, but in an urban context, a good source of protein, no ?)<br>- making an incubator out of an aquarium resistor and plastic boxes. Use it (at 25ºC) to learn the basics of cheesemaking. I know, raw milk is illegal in the US, because it is more dangerous than guns...<br>- mycology, using a lot of the same hardware as for cheesemaking.<br>- leatherwork is not very practical, since skins take up space. Then just basic knitting...<br>- preparing and canning food. Meat, for example, does not require that much space for preparation. Learning to macerate it, and macerate stuff in general with oil.<br>- learning to make leavain out of organic flour and water. Very difficult actually.<br>- learning to make vinegar (wine culture required in your country)<br>- a bike repair club / community is also an option if it does not require you to keep tools at home.<br><br>All these are vertically stackable options (since you only need plastic boxes or a regular kitchen).<br><br>The big problem with urban environments is the lack of sunlight. All options listed can be reasonably helped within that constraint, so long as we get electricity in our homes.<br>Most of the options would not produce enough to feed you, unlike what countryside living offers (a chicken coop). But they can help you develop unique skills that still deal with living systems. It is very far away from the Green Wizard Glamour of a tender orchard, and less physically demanding.<br><br><br>Even using a pen and notebooks for personal writing projects would be a good option.

He survived by spending that night in an open grave.

They are happening right now. When scientist-priests suggest whatever implausible techno-fix that will save us, they are are reciting the millenarian liturgy of progress. With energy declining, it appears to me that collectively we are increasingly like the Melanesian left on their island, suddenly cut off from the stream of manufactured goods.

G. Landels (U. of California Press). It's the same "hamster wheel" concept, except the ancient engineers had to build their wheel from wood instead of clear plastic. <br>The Ancient Hamster Wheel didn't generate electricity, of course; the torque was mostly used to pump water and operate hoists. (Wind and water wheels would have been used for stationary applications.)<br> <br>The Modern Hamster Wheel (MHW) output analysis is consistent with what I mentioned earlier: ~100W output power times (maybe) 10 hours per day; 1 kWh of energy. The factor that's missing from the MHW paper is a comparison of the capital cost of the MHW (~$1000?) versus the cash value of the electricity it generates: $~o0.15 per day. So, it breaks even after 18 years of daily operation (with no maintenance expense). <br> <br>The Ancient Hamster Wheel, on the other hand, can be built with renewable and/or recycled material, and could be used to run machine tools, grain mills, water pumps, etc. "on demand", when you need slow torque and have an excess of unskilled labor. You could even design a wheel to be turned by water, when you have it, and labor when the water is scarce.<br><br><br><a href=#c3479852483795686333 title="comment permalink">1/15/15, 6:40 PM</a><br><br>

When I got home again I looked around and, like you, found no further stories in the MSM, which I also found strange. <br><br>I did some more digging around in the few stories that were coming up in fringe stories, and what I found is:<br><br>- Russia has confirmed that the South Stream project, the pipeline to the EU that would pass through Bulgaria rather than Ukraine, <a href=http://rt.com/business/222619-bulgaria-south-stream-gazprom/ rel=nofollow>has definitively been cancelled</a> as a response to meddling from the European Commission; this was announced in December, but the EC thought they would be able to face the Russians down. In this, they have completely failed.<br>- Instead of Bulgaria/South Stream, Russian gas will now go to Europe via Turkey/Turk Stream. This pipeline will be completed two years from now.<br>- South Stream would have travelled into the EU via pipelines constructed and then owned by Gazprom. The EC, in the name of 'competition', was trying to force Gazprom to give up ownership of the infrastructure. In response, Gazprom has announced that under the Turk Stream, they will build their own pipeline as far as the border between Turkey and Greece, and it will be up to the EU to continue it from there under whatever rules they choose.<br><br>Those are the certain facts. The confusion is over what happens when Turk Stream goes live. <a href=https://euobserver.com/news/127216 rel=nofollow>Will it be a complement to the Ukrainian pipelines, or will it replace it entirely?</a> I've seen statements that could support either view. This is incredibly important. If the second statement is true, then the EU has only two years in which to build an entirely new trans-European pipeline network connecting to Turkey before the supply of gas through Ukraine goes dead. If they can't get it built, they freeze in the following winter.<br><br>Much of the ambiguity and confusion is likely to be deliberate. Nevertheless:<br><br>- the clock is now ticking for the EU. They are going to have to find the political leadership, and financial resources, to get the pipelines built in short order. Is this possible?<br>- Germany and Poland already have separate pipelines to Russia via the Baltic, France has nuclear, and the UK has the North Sea. Will they want to contribute? The countries really threatened by this are Greece and other Southern-EU countries, the ones already hurting from EU-imposed austerity. This move will massively increase existing intra-EU tensions.<br>- Turkey has consistently been left waiting at the altar in its efforts to join the EU, and appears to be losing interest. At the same time, it's been trying - so far unsuccessfully - to join the Sino-Russian led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. It could be that Turkey will also 'pivot to the East' and pursue a less Western-oriented policy. It may join Russia's Eurasian Union rather than the EU, for example; it could even, possibly, leave NATO. What is certain is that it's going to have a financial bonanza from the transit fees for all that Russian gas, so inevitably it will join Iran in moving into Russia's orbit. <br><br>So, this news really is a bombshell, but it'll take some time for the consequences to become clear.<br><br><a href=#c6200553528482440337 title="comment permalink">1/15/15, 10:24 PM</a><br><br>

What I do want to say though, is that food growing isn't the only critical skill. If you're in an apartment in a high rise you can still learn to use a sewing machine, take a week long intensive in wilderness first aid, or even make delicious food on the cheap from bulk grains and legumes. These are just a few ideas, others have been suggested which are just as good.<br><br>I imagine the skillsets as basically two pronged: there are skills you use to meet your own needs directly and there are skills you can use to make yourself useful to others and meet your needs through exchange. So even if, hypothetically, your situation precludes you from learning about growing food you can develop the second prong of skills.<br><br>Along with this I'd like to offer two other suggestions. The first is seek out community that shares your values and that you can trust. Trust takes time and community is of similar valuation to skills, methinks. If you're close with someone skilled in horticulture you can, potentially, have a relationship with them where you exchange your skill for theirs. If this is someone you like and can trust all the better.<br><br>Second, if you accept that there are things you can learn that will better your life given any circumstance, the only thing that separates you from mastering those skills is DISCIPLINE. If you set aside two hours a day to mastering anything, you will rapidly improve. It's that simple. Choose something that catches your fancy, and obsess about it until it gets in your blood. Read books about it, take notes, find others with the same interest to talk about it with, and then practice, practice, practice like your very life depends on it because it very well might.<br><br>Hope this is of some help. Best wishes!<br><br><a href=#c7483183792132381422 title="comment permalink">1/16/15, 6:58 AM</a><br><br>

More specifically, if two different enterprises are working on the same energy reservoir and running it down to increase entropy, the enterprise which does the best job of running down the energy reservoir, that is, the one doing it the fastest is most favored by nature.<br>So if we look at a given human culture as a scheme for running down a reservoir of stored energy, let's say fossil fuels, then the society that runs it down the fastest is the one most favored by nature. Nature favors industrial societies over non-industrial societies because industrial societies run down the fossil fuel reservoirs while non-industrial societies leave them in place.<br>Conversely we should also point out that it is free energy which powers industrial civilizations and not civilizations that create the free energy. Fortunately or unfortunately, once the reservoir of free energy has been exhausted, nature no longer has any need for the industrial civilization that ran it down. It is nature's policy to turn its back on a civilization once that civilization has finished its job. There is no retirement program that keeps a civilization around after having so valiantly worked at running down energy reserves and increasing entropy. <br>We also need to keep in mind that although nature does not necessarily plan its future except of course to dictate that the future shall have more entropy than the present, it was nature that provided industrial civilizations with oxygen in the atmosphere which made the burning of fossil fuels possible. The creation of an oxygen containing atmosphere was nature's first detour from entropy creation and the accumulation of fossil fuels the second which of course nature corrected by allowing the creation of industrialized civilizations which combined free oxygen with fossil fuels to increase the pool of entropy.<br>So I think we should look ahead to a time of greater ease where there is no longer this mandate of running down the fossil fuel reserves and maintaining a complex culture.<br><br><a href=#c7079371242706328715 title="comment permalink">1/16/15, 9:06 AM</a><br><br>

We're the ones who are left after millennia of conquering, and we've brought with us all of the assumptions, mental habits, and assumed rights of conquerors. <br><br>I recently read that the Maori of New Zealand - originally warlike in their own way, but still much more earth-centric &amp; respectful than ours ever has been - had originally conquered New Zealand from a very peaceful, enlightened (supposedly) people who were pretty much wiped out after that event.<br><br>It seems we've gotten rid of (or sufficiently marginalized) anyone or any group that knows how to live in balance with the earth or in any type of peaceful co-existence with other people. <br><br>The only problem is that we're out of places to conquer (not that we've quit trying). And in order to survive (in any numbers) in the future, we have to give up/change many of the habits &amp; assumptions of the conqueror mindset. That won't happen, but it is interesting to notice/reflect on just how much of the way we go about things come from a deep-seated belief of Ultimate Right. <br><br>Don't know if this makes any sense to anyone.

Oddly enough, one" green" friend opposed seems to be in denial that fracking is a bubble that is imploding.<br>Back to the Canada thing, if there was a humanitarian/political crisis that DID overwhelm our neighbor to the north and create a crisis, they could certainly appeal to China/India/Russia, or all of the above for help containing it. I see no reason why, with assistance, they couldn't put up as much a deterrent as exists on the southern U.S. border, and I'm not certain that it wouldn't be in China/India/Russia's interest to help them in a crisis situation. <br>Kaitain<br>I don't think a Muslim takeover of Western Europe is a given. I think there's enough residual pushback among Europeans. It's certainly possible that Western Europe, with the assistance of law and order Christian Russia, could repel Islamist terrorism. Not that we're to that point yet, but I don't think you can underestimate terrorism pushing Europe into Putin's hands, especially in a crisis. Putin's already found it useful to financially support right wing, law and order, anti Muslim parties, and they've returned the favor.<br><br><a href=#c422400973631196578 title="comment permalink">1/16/15, 10:16 AM</a><br><br>

I should be able to reverse course easily, if need be.

I'll say, aside from all the external preparations I've made for decline over the last number of years, I think the most important thing I've done is adjusting my internal expectations. In other words, I've slowly moved away from expecting good things to happen to me--or thinking they <i>should</i> happen to me as a matter of necessity--to not taking anything for granted. That doesn't mean I expect bad things to happen to me--it's just that I recognize they very much can, regardless of if I've done anything to deserve it.

If I were you I'd make sure to talk to the people who run any farm I'm plan on going to on the phone and ask them straight up about any concerns and feel out the situation. Some farms can be sketchy.

Both of those are clean, space efficient, simple entertaining ways to do agriculture in even the smallest apartment.<br><br>Another niche that I think apartment dwellers are well suited for is turning raw materials into products. Violet and others already mentioned craft skills like sewing or leather crafting. There are also ways to do things with food if that's your interest. I know some apartment dwelling friends who brew fermented foods and beverages. Canning is also a good option, especially if you know people who garden, since a jar of jam, relish or canned vegetables make really good barter for raw produce from someone's garden.<br><br><a href=#c2918780906257910263 title="comment permalink">1/16/15, 1:43 PM</a><br><br>

As a suggestion, have a look at your previous electricity bill and find where it provides your total electricity consumption in kWh for that period. Then divide that number by the number of days (usually 30, 60 or 90 days) and that will provide and average daily electricity usage. Let me know what that number is and we can talk more about what it actually means.<br><br>Not to stress as I've seen all sorts of numbers from 3.5kWh / day to 55kWh / day.

If you accept the possibility and probability of the future JMG describes, then I encourage you to think very hard about what that future will mean for your child. I try to envision my parents' childhood in the rural south during and after WWI (yes, that's a "one"). Our future may look much like that past - without electricity, indoor plumbing, vaccinations, antibiotics and other medical care, to name a few things we bow consider "basic". Our future will also have the unrelenting backbreaking work - but with the added problems of an unstable climate and an unstable (if any) government, depleted resources of many kinds, possibly unpredictable amounts of violence. <br><br>And maybe the worst part will be the recognition that there's no hope, there's no way out, that things are going to get a lot worse before they start to get better. My mother could dream of becoming a teacher ( which she did), my father could leave home to seek a job "up north". All of which resulted in a nice middle class home and college educations for my sister and me. Not a likely outcome for a child born this decade, I think.<br><br>Sorry to be such a downer, but that's the future I see. I'm trying to figure out how to prepare my grandkids for the decline, but I grieve for them and what awaits them. <br><br>And whoever says they consider this future an exciting challenge or an improvement over today's situation, I say: more power to you! whatever attitude works for you to get through the coming long descent!

I am inclined to agree that is the most likely scenario. <br><br>So will France end up in the Russian or the Islamic sphere of influence once the frontier begins to stabilize in a century or two? Sadly, Europe is likely to become a battleground between a resurgent Russia and a resurgent Islam, especially if another of Greer's predictions pans out and Russia loses control of most of Siberia to China. In that case, Russia will likely expand to the west instead, drawn in by the ongoing wars between Islam and what's left of European civilization. <br><br>Spengler also predicted that Russia would form the basis for the next great civilization, which I tend to agree is also very likely. Spengler pointed out that one of the more common catalysts for the formation of a new Culture is a major war with religious overtones. The role of the Crusades in the emergence of Western civilization is a case in point. I suspect that the coming wars between Russia and Islam for control of Europe and Russian attempts to liberate Europe from the coming Islamic invasions and conquests will play a similar role in the flowering of the nascent Russian Culture, in much the same way that the Crusades to liberate Jerusalem and the rest of the Holy Land from the Saracens helped bring about the flowering of the Faustian Culture that underlies Western civilization.

A pre-WW1 life is an amazing thing in and of itself. The hardships you speak of were 'normal' before the Age of Oil and through much of the short Age of Coal. There will always be "new normals" for humans who survive change - they are the adaptive ones, the flexible ones, the ones who love living. <br><br>People find a way to happiness, especially if they are encouraged with love and laughter in the face of ugliness. Children are fine with the world they are born into - they know nothing else unless they are taught, but even then it is not their memory.<br><br>Children are born with happiness - why do 2 year-olds prefer playing with an old refrigerator box rather than a smartphone? Simplicity and imagination and creativity and FUN! Most want to laugh.<br><br>If things do revert to supremely harder working conditions (doubtful IMHO, as civilization retains more with each resurrection), then this will simply be the new reality. Only the boomers and those from the Age of Oil will even realize there was something else. This is why boomers had to be taught about the Great Depression - we did not live it. <br><br>I am not preaching to you - rather encouraging you to try to embrace the coming change in lieu of lamenting loss of 'stuff'. Be the guy who teaches grandkids the simpler and smarter way. Excite them to choose differently. It is an opportunity to lose the bad parts and hang on to the smart and better parts. <br><br>I look at my own offspring and then wonder how I could imagine denying them life because of my own fears for them...<br><br><a href=#c3968309125400356458 title="comment permalink">1/17/15, 5:20 AM</a><br><br>

The sales of French made berets don't look that good, mainly because of the cheap Chinese crap passing for Basque berets these days which you can get for about 2 Euros on Ebay. The only remaining French industrial manufacturer (Laulhere) is struggling. The former technical director of Laulhere, Denis Guedon, quit his employer and built up a small production site on his own, with himself as only worker. He even put the machinery together himself.<br><br>Now while Laulhere needs annual sales in the order of magnitude of a million pieces, Guedon makes about 3500 per year. He doesn't even try to beat the Chinese competition in price, as one of his berets costs around 35 Euros for the end customer (that's 17.5 times the Chinese price). But there's still a market for people who want the real, hand-made thing and who don't mind that good work costs good money.<br><br>With the cheap fossil fuel (and thus, industrialisation) gone, things like clothes will cost more than now anyway. We will have less of everything. While we will lack the resources for e.g. ten crappy things, we will have the work force to make one good thing that's built to last. So we will have to compensate the decrease in numbers by increasing the quality.<br><br>Denis Guedon said that the companies that need big sales volumes in order to be economically viable are about to disappear, that's why he went down in scale. Actually, that's the point relevant to this blog.<br><br>The other advantage is that he can make these berets in the traditional, pre-industrial manner - which dropped out of use because it isn't suitable for industrial production. He makes them adjustable, i.e. not fixed to a certain head size. I think that's how it once was since you could not stock a large number of pieces in all sizes back then.<br><br><a href=#c1881582820222581275 title="comment permalink">1/17/15, 6:16 AM</a><br><br>

I have a couple comments though. I don't think Alberta oil sands can be lumped in with the Dakota tight shale oil boom. While the oil sands have of course enjoyed low interest rates and easy financing like everything else, it doesn't suffer from the same ponzi financing as shale oil. Oil sands are profitable on their own merits at $100. Granted, if interest rates rise then new projects will come on slower but they will still come. This plays in to the peak oil reality that while the oil may be there at $150, it will be slow. And the oil sands reserve amounts to 50 years of N American consumption so there is quite a bit, but again it can't be ramped up fast enough to offset imminent conventional declines.<br><br>Regarding nuclear, I have heard that the reason uranium reactors were favoured over thorium ones decades ago was because they can provide feedstock for warheads which the thorium reactors do not, despite thorium being a better and safer design. Regardless, the thing that really gets me chuckling is the insistence by nuclear proponents that we are somehow short of electricity, when we aren't. We have a liquid fuels problem and that will cause social decay long before we run out of electricity. Furthermore, Alberta alone claims to have over 6 centuries of recoverable coal at today's N American consumption rates so I see no shortage of electricity on the horizon. And beyond this, coal can be turned into oil... for a price. I imagine that $200 oil will bring this out as well. Of course it will be slow, which again plays into peak oil.<br><br><a href=#c1556154958095963585 title="comment permalink">1/17/15, 12:13 PM</a><br><br>

It would be great if we all were semi-retired, living on a rural small-holding, or in a weatherized house in town with no mortgage, a big ol' garden, chickens, bees, goats and happy neighbors. <br><br>Personally if someone gave me a farm tomorrow I would starve to death or die in the process. I can't farm, tend livestock, and I never saw a potato come out of the ground before last summer. My carpentry skills amount to putting in an ikea kitchen really crooked.

This year I managed to get my hands on a real allotment, which admittedly will take half an hour's travel by bike and train to access. This list sounds more impressive than the reality because we both work full time and have two small children so our time is very limited, but the skills are there or in progress - and some of it can be done as a family activity if I'm not too picky about the results.

Electric power is something like water. There's high-value usage (water to drink, power for communication), and there's low-value usage (water for irrigation and sanitation, power for refining metal, pumping water, and running the heating and air conditioning equipment). The hidden, low-value consumption is taken for granted, because that much power is (and must be) managed by professionals. So though the high-value usage is more visible, it's a small fraction of the low-value usage. <br> <br>So, when a creative squirrel-cage scheme offers enough power "to charge a phone", it appears significant. Practically, it's just "a drop in the bucket".<br><br>It's like riding my bicycle 3 miles to church on Sunday, then driving 500 miles per week commuting.

I am not a farmer and I can only admire and marvel at what Cherokee Organics and others are doing. <br>I live in a very small, compact city where everyone is very connected. The street grid and buildings are largely unchanged since 1930. I don't need to drive unless I'm leaving the city. I think Kuntsler would approve of the apartments over storefronts, and the fact that you can live, work, and play I'm the same area. This just might be a viable post-collapse city. <br>I'm expecting a great demand for modifications of homes and apartments in the coming years, to smaller units that can be heated. That will be my niche, to use my experience for barter, I hope. <br>As a fallback option if life in a city is impossible I have established two primitive camps about five miles apart. I can walk to these camps in four days with a pack. (I did a rehearsal trip) I have been going to the camps to practice my skills for 25 years now, and have buried basic tools and supplies there on the woods. Since it is impossible to know how quickly or violently things will unwind it seems best to keep all options open. <br>I think it is interesting how there is no blueprint for riding this out. Depending on one's skills and physical ability, and especially on location, there are many paths to a new life. I often wonder what I have overlooked, if I could be wrong about everything, but knowing that others take decline seriously and are preparing the best they can for a meaningful future is a great inspiration for me.<br><br><a href=#c8925069457304526447 title="comment permalink">1/17/15, 3:25 PM</a><br><br>

And with regard to processing technologies - to the best of our knowledge there are physical limits. And before you ask, good silicon is one of those bottlenecks. If you have good ideas to fix that please tell me and I'll pass them on. Then we can concentrate on the next bottleneck - finding enough of the rare metals to make more crucibles. If you happen to have some iridium lying around in the garden (be sure to look hard - you'll have to go through about a billion other atoms to find one) you could send that to http://heraeus-pt-labware.com/en/products/standarizedcruciblesdishesandlids/cruciblessinglecrystalgrowing/crucibles-single-crystal-growing.aspx<br>I am sure they'd be happy to take it. Alternatively you could mine it from asteroids as seems to be en vogue. You might have to convince someone to kickstart your logistics part though. Shouldn't be too hard cause with a solid 40 times higher abundance (vs a generally expected payback time of 5 years) you can surely make a business plan they can't deny. If for one reason or another it does fail to convince (or work out) we just go back to point 1).<br><br>Notwithstanding there are things we can do, and there are things we should do (and there are loads of things we should not do). I know how it feels to be "almost there". When you see those curves intersecting and you want to shout: "Double or nothing!" <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t93PJlv3EgQ<br>And then you either get there (e.g. traveling close to mach 1) or you don't (traveling above mach 1). But even if you do, somehow you still have to go to work on Monday and your co-workers and boss suck just as much (if not more), you're not losing that weight, and coke is now sold in green bottles as well as red, and if you are lucky you find out why it wasn't such a good idea in the first place. If you are extremely lucky it might turn out to be a good idea after all. Then the question remains if this is the right time for the idea, or if you get shouted down. <br><br>Two more things to get you started with materials science and information processing:<br>The first law of materials science is: "Everything can be broken." It is not: "Everything can be made."<br>On information processing: please try very hard not to mix up "data processing" and "information processing". <br><br>That said, please don't let people get you down, and keep at it &amp; keep some hope. I would be very happy to read another post of yours in a week, maybe after you read 2-3 more articles on the ADR or e.g. the "Do the math" blog if that style is more to your taste. If you can bring yourself to do another honest comment next week or the one after it would probably be much appreciated by the commentariat.<br><br><a href=#c171966339001991220 title="comment permalink">1/17/15, 4:37 PM</a><br><br>

But international conflict and native rebellion are stirring in the tropical forests.<br><br>- The study of synthetic hydrocarbons arising from the quest for "artificial whale oil" for lighting results in the invention of exotic chemicals like "butane" and "octane." With war brewing in Europe, it would be dangerous if those formulas were to fall into the wrong hands.<br><br>- So-called "daylight foundries" use concentrated solar heat for small-batch smelting. casting, and other applications. But they're limited by the difficulty and expense of making smooth shiny surfaces. (Silvered mirrors are as expensive as fine jewelry.) Newly-discovered solid hydrocarbons and the abundant yet elusive element aluminum seem to hold a solution, but the government, beholden to greedy grasping untermenschen, wants to seize the secret from its uncompromising square-jawed inventor.

And I really have no idea what you mean by "each child is keep of faith."<br><br>@morganfrue &amp; oilman2 - <br><br>I tried to choose my words carefully, but apparently there's some misunderstanding.<br><br>First, I'm not telling Carolyn or anyone else that they shouldn't have children, and I'm not accusing someone who has children of doing something wrong or bad. To do that would be both presumptuous and useless.<br><br>Second, I'm not lamenting the lack of "stuff" for your children and my grandchildren. What I listed were three things that I think most parents want to provide their children: health, safety, and hope.<br><br>- Despite the bashing that goes on around here of the modern medical <b>system</b>, modern <b>medicine</b> is by and large a wondrous thing. Childhood diseases - measles, whooping cough, polio - used to kill lots of kids; they still do in parts of the world that don't have vaccinations and sanitation. The arm injury I suffered in 1950 would have left me crippled if it happened in 1920. On the other hand,my mother lost her first child in childbirth in the 1940's in a situation that (as far as I can determine) 1990's medicine could have remedied. As we go bumping down the slope of collapse, those are the kinds of things we're going to lose. And as much as I respect traditional medicine, I would submit that it is not going to compensate for those losses on a one-for-one basis as they happen. As in many other areas, we're looking at a chaotic and dangerous future. I think potential parents should think long and hard about bringing children into that future and, if they do, how they are going to defend and protect those children.<br><br>- Safety: surely you've read the discussions here about warlords and other violence. Surely you've read about the likelihood of food shortages caused by changes in climate and disruptions of agriculture and distribution systems. Somehow this planet is going to get back to a sustainable number of inhabitants. The 6 or 7 or 8 billion deaths needed to accomplish that are not going to all be "somewhere else", and they are mostly, in my opinion, going to be fairly unpleasant. Again, I think potential parents should think long and hard about bringing children into that future and about how they will protect and defend them.<br><br><a href=#c3043044838314063980 title="comment permalink">1/18/15, 11:58 AM</a><br><br>

Also, I apologize if I mischaracterize or misinterpret something you have said. If I did that, it certainly wasn't intentional.<br><br>------------------<br>Oilman said "I look at my own offspring and then wonder how I could imagine denying them life because of my own fears for them..." <br><br>Well, I guess it depends on what you mean by "life", doesn't it?<br><br>Do not romanticize the pre-WWI or pre-oil or pre-coal life styles until you've lived one of them for awhile. Take a look at some of those programs that other people have referenced here. The one I remember most vividly was about people trying to reenact 19th century homesteading in Montana (or Wyoming, or some other place with dreadful winters). At the end of the summer, the experts judged that most of the families would have no chance of making it through the winter, based on the amount of food they had stockpiled. "Not making it through the winter" means that they and their livestock would have starved. And remember that these were people who (a) started off healthy and well nourished and probably with all their vaccinations; (b) had the benefit of experts and researchers to tell them how things could be done with the supplies they had available; (c) spent only one summer and KNEW that this was not really life and death for them and their kids; (d) knew that they could be rescued if there was a medical emergency (death by tetanus from stepping on a rusty nail is a really horrible way yo go).<br><br>Now put yourself (mentally) in that situation with young kids but without the expert advice and knowledge and without the escape route at the end. Add in the possibility that climate has become more unpredictable, the probability that the whole area is less safe (no US Cavalry to protect you from outlaws), and the near certainty that you are not dealing with pristine land or water. Sure, you can mitigate the situation to some extent by being part of a community and by acquiring some knowledge on your own. But without a surrounding civilization to provide resources (tools, cloth, seeds), how well are you really going to do? Are you really prepared to watch a child due of starvation or malnourishment or tetanus or the flu? <br><br>Here's another thought experiment: Imagine that you and your family have retreated to a location where you think you can ride out the coming collapse. (In my thought experiment, which may or may not become a novel, that location is in northern Michigan, near water and with relatively unpolluted soil.). Assume for the moment that you have acquired a house and a bit of land. Now imagine how you are going to provide food, clothing, health care, safety for your family. <br><br>Now carry that story along for several years or decades, as our civilization declines. Maybe you grow vegetables and raise chickens and a cow or two. Where do you get the flour for your bread? Who grows the the grain? Who grinds it? How do you pay for it? Where do you get the cloth for clothes and blankets, etc (assuming someone can sew)? Who grows the cotton, processes it, and produces the thread? Who weaves it? Who raises the sheep and processes the wool? How do you pay for it? How do you heat your house? How do you pay for it? Suppose your chickens are killed by a fox or a dog? Where do you get replacements? <br><br>Just think about getting through each day, moment by moment. I'm not saying it can't be done. Obviously millions of people have done it.

No, this is you, 21st century American, who has to learn all of this from scratch in a social, political, and natural environment that is continually deteriorating.<br><br>And hope? How much hope is there for the next dozen or three dozen generations? You might start from that 19th century lifestyle, but for the next few centuries, each generation will be going backward, as cheap fossil fuels and technology are more and more lost. What hope will you have to pass on to your children? Yeah, kids grow up mostly accepting what they have as "standard", but the likelihood is that they will have less and less as they grow older, and their kids will have less and less, and their kids, and so on. It's called the Dark Ages.<br><br>That's what the Archdruid saying, isn't it? This "preservation of knowledge" project isn't for your kids or grandkids; it's for people two or three or more centuries from now when things stabilize enough for some kind of new civilization to emerge. "Star's Reach" isn't set in the 22nd century, after all.<br><br>Now, when I posed similar concerns to JMG some time ago, his response (paraphrasing and my recollection, so I may have this not quite right ) was that he didn't/couldn't know what the future would actually bring, and his intention was to do what he thought might be helpful to future generations, ie, preserving knowledge that will help that new civilization emerge. <br><br>I think this is a wonderfully sane approach, so I keep working on it myself. But it does not change the very strong possibility that the future will be pretty awful for many who live through it. And I personally think that one should think long and hard before bringing children into it. <br><br><br><a href=#c5593922499815974654 title="comment permalink">1/18/15, 12:00 PM</a><br><br>

I was especially convinced by <a href=http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2012/04/18/hacking-the-non-disposable-planet/ rel=nofollow>this article</a> that argued that we could make a 'hackstable' future. The author defines this future as: "...a marginally stable future where the upward lift of diminishing-magnitude technological improvements and hacks just balances the downward pull of entropic gravity, resulting in an indefinite plateau..." The reason I want to choose this model/narrative is because it gives me some hope to change the future in the short-term by working on technology so that the improvements can just slightly balance entropy. As you know, the techno-environmentalists support this view.<br><br><a href=#c8967903757865578852 title="comment permalink">1/18/15, 12:37 PM</a><br><br>

But assuming your motives for wanting to have children go deeper than securing your long-term financial stability, I don't see any reason why the long descent should be a deterrent for having children.<br><br>It just seems like bogus logic to me to say to oneself, "Oh, future generations won't enjoy the same standard of living as I do, so let's just pack up this whole humanity thing and call it a day." There's violence in every generation, political upheaval, exploitation, strife, you name it. Doesn't mean we should shut down.<br><br>To me, it speaks to the depression phase of coping with collapse that JMG describes in "Not The Future We Ordered."<br><br>Perhaps I am just defensive because my wife and I are facing a similar choice. We've put off the decision so far, but as she we tip over into our 30s, questions of fertility make the decision on whether to have kids a now or never prospect. At this point, it seems a question of timing more than anything, and things aren't exactly going to get easier than they are now.<br><br>As for the house question, that's probably specific to your particular financial situation, but I hope we're able to buy a house to have some kind of tangible asset and place to garden in the event things go willy-nilly.

One comment was that posts and comments about Green Wizardry were “boring” and another was that JMG should somehow “put the overflow to good use with the Green Wizards Forum”.<br><br>First, I do not in any way find the subject of Green Wizardry boring at all. However, JMG has written a rather large amount on the subject and I imagine he doesn't really want to repeat it for newer readers. I'm very interested in wherever he takes this blog as well as The Well of Galabes. I read that too. I think that anyone who wants to see what JMG has written, do what I did since I discovered the ADR back in 2009 or so. I have gone back and read not only all of JMG's posts, but all the comments. There's more than a wealth of information there. JMG doesn't need to re-post his older writings, they are all there to read. (Now if somebody wanted to make up an index, that would be a great project.)<br><br>Read his books, Green Wizardry, The Ecotechnic Future. If you don't have the money to buy them, see if your local library has them or can get them. If that fails, try a post on the Green Wizards website and maybe someone can let you borrow a copy.<br><br>I think it's time that WE put the <a href=http://teresamcguffey.com/greenwizards.org/index.php rel=nofollow>Green Wizards</a> site to good use, I don't know if it was JMG's intention when he mentioned that Registered Users of the site would be able to vote on the “The Great Squirrel Case Challenge of 2015” but I was hoping he did it to entice more people to sign up. Go back to the time around July – September 2010 and read JMG's posts about his thoughts. His post of <a href=../../2010/06/merlins-time.html rel=nofollow>June 30, 2010</a> introduces the concept of a Green Wizard. It's up to US to carry this forward and develop the repository of knowledge and the means to pass it on the future Green Wizards. JMG can't do all this for us.<br><br>...<br><br><a href=#c1435154807833421060 title="comment permalink">1/18/15, 2:54 PM</a><br><br>

JMG had a great post on <a href=../../2008/07/lessons-from-amateur-radio.html rel=nofollow>July 2, 2008</a> that I believe is an excellent path to follow. The future is going to need to have people skilled in communicating with less than ideal equipment and under less than ideal conditions. This knowledge needs to be gathered and learned well before it is needed. The time to start this is now, not 50-100 years in the future.<br><br>I have set up the <a href=http://www.greenwizardsradio.org/ rel=nofollow>Green Wizards Radio</a> website and have a small forum there for interested parties to discuss some of the more technical aspects that may not be of interest to the other Green Wizards that frequent the regular Green Wizards forum site. One thing that I am also hoping to do is to help interested Wizards obtain equipment in an affordable way. I like taking equipment, both tube and solid-state, that I either get very cheaply or for free, and repairing it and getting it out to others to use. I have a backlog of rigs sitting on shelves waiting for me to get to them, a move got in the way and delayed work.<br><br>I can't do this by myself, any more than JMG can direct a Green Wizardry program by himself. I had started contacting some of the other Hams that were already on here, but had to stop to make a major move and deal with some other family problems (that in itself would take 5 years to describe my disgust at the legal/justice/elder-law system). Now we're working on getting our gardens and other things set up again. I finally got my antenna up just a few days ago and made decent contacts around the US and even Brazil on only 50 watts.

That means if everyone wanted to live that way, we would need five earths. Without sustainability, of course. For a Western European style of living, we would still need 2.5 earths.<br><br>However, that means if the absolute zombie apocalypse broke down on the US right now and the US were forced to suddenly cut down consumption by whole 50%, even then they'd just arrive where we in Western Europe have never passed. Of course not, because Western Europe is "first class vassals" while the US are the centre of the empire. But be assured that quite a nice way of living is possible with such a consumption. Of course, that's not sustainable in the long run; but it isn't the complete collapse right now, this year, either.<br><br>Another point is that the US leadership has had the wisdom of not starting wars that would fire back on their own lands. That's unlike Germany where it took the leadership two times (and the hard way) to find out that a centre position isn't suitable for major wars on both sides. Maybe a better geography education at school would have been helpful. After WW2, Germany was in ruins, major cities completely destroyed. If I walk through my city, there are whole quarters of glass and steel. The reason is that these quarters had been razed to the ground by 1945. In silent, foggy nights, some still can see the fires burning.. Forget some skyscrapers collapsing, think of whole cities that looked that way.<br><br>The whole infrastructure was also down. On the other hand, many refugees from the eastern territories who feared the revenge of the Russians for what Germany had done to them. I'm talking of women with a handcart, carrying a little child and some clothes, loosing everything they had. If they made it at all instead of being gunned down by aircraft with machine guns. A fate that still was nicer compared to be group raped by Russian soldiers heading for revenging their beloved ones.<br><br>Well, the Germans who had been more fond of giving lead to women and children alike, if not gas. Luckily enough, the Russians were permenantly low on ammo. So low actually that Russian style "first aid" was carried out with a spade in order not to waste a cartridge.<br><br><br><a href=#c7448405279211964291 title="comment permalink">1/18/15, 3:04 PM</a><br><br>

Many men swam (!) through the Elbe river in winter 1945, just to avoid being taken captive by the Russians and heading for the English instead - who were, as I can tell, nice occupators. Sometimes, they even gave chocolate to the children instead of shooting them down.<br><br>In the big cities, especially the one where I live now, people lay on the water side of the dikes during the bomb raids. Unlike what the Nazi propaganda told, there were not enough bunkers for the civilians. They watched the phosphorous bombs hitting the roofs of their houses. Phosphorous bombs were especially nasty because they could not be extinguished with water. Not that water would have been available since the water piping was already destroyed. They didn't hope so much that their house would be missed, just that the bombs would not come down on their side of the dike, i.e. on their heads.<br><br>After the war, things didn't become that better, apart from that the bombs and the Nazis stopped being around. The refugees were not welcome to the locals. Not to mention the food scarcity. In the British sector, e.g. in Hamburg, the scheduled calory amount for an adult was 1200kcal per day. In winter, and 1946 had an exceptionally severe winter. In reality, the amount was rather 800kcal.<br><br>The women of my grandparents' generation had really cool jobs then. With many men fallen, they had to fumble through the ruins, searching for intact bricks and hammering the mortar away so that they could be re-used. It was even more fun in case they were widow mothers. Let alone that they got pregnant before marriage and the man fell. The child was regarded as a bastard child, and the women got a damn bad standing. And a child to feed. Anyway, they were never thanked for that work; when they grew old, they just got a tiny rent too small to live on and just a little too much to die.<br><br>I remember a nice story here, I think it was last year. A leftist demonstration spun out of control, fireworks flying around, massive police forces trying to get the situation under control. Normal state of affairs here on May 1st, at least in certain quarters. A young 17 years old girl hid in a house entrance, completely frightened and crying. A calm old woman hid in the same entrance, looked at the crying girl and just smiled at her, saying "now you got an impression of how it was in war."<br><br><a href=#c8975378178418847770 title="comment permalink">1/18/15, 3:05 PM</a><br><br>

Germany has seen its currency collapse two times in the 20th century. Actually, two times within 26 years (1923 and 1949). OK, with the dollar gone, the US will not be able to "pay" their trade deficit with worthless green paper. So what, maybe it would be an idea to actually work for the goods. Just like other countries have always been forced to do. Big deal, or what?!<br><br>Compared to what my country has seen (and that's still fun compared to Russia!), anything that might hit the US right now is just kindergarden stuff. Just calm down a bit. Be lucky that your country has never seen really hard times, but please don't freak out even at the thought of just cutting down consumption to what just is normal in Europe. I admit, that to quite some US Americans, completely normal things like public transportation seem to destroy America because public transportation is evil satanistic communism, and driving cars for Jesus is mandatory for God's Own Country. Or so. Come on..!<br><br>Seriously, what I've told didn't just happen to some distant families, it happened also to mine. All of it. And I'm around nevertheless. Granted, it is but memories by now, but you can bet that it did influence my education because my parents still had lived through the times of poverty and misery. So I must admit that I don't understand what that short-term "US collapse" actually is about. What you fastidious US Americans may call "collapse" would have been heaven on earth to my family!<br><br>It feels to me like if you were inhabitating a completely different universe?! That all leaves me just thinking "what the frack are you talking about". But maybe giving up car, TV, smartphone, microwave and coffee machine doesn't feel like collapse to me because I don't have them anyway. The whole sewing I'm doing is just handwork with needle and thread - no sewing machine. Even my computer is greying. So what, I'm still lucky. Compared to quite some US Americans, the end time has been real for me for many years now, but voluntarily. What would I need a fancy car when I wake up every morning, seeing my beloved wife..

The plans only tell you so much - a lot of the most important information is in people’s heads or in ancillary processes that were never documented. The same thing happened with the Saturn V rocket. They had to reengineer it from one of the spares for the Mars rocket competition.<br><br>In counterpoint, there are several projects that are working on building the real thing; at least one of them is expected to be online this year. We shall soon see how reality matches the hype.<br><br>And no, it’s quite capable of building bomb material.

In a lot of ways the “hackstable” future it mentions is very similar to the future we’re discussing. People “hacking” together a life that’s familiar even during decline is the reason collapse is never complete or sudden, people adapt on the way down and find a way to keep as much of their old life as they can. That’s how even at the darkest points of the European Middle Ages, people retained an agrarian lifestyle and a functioning but simplified government based on the Roman Civitas. That’s also why some old cities have survived multiple cycles of civilization as stable urban centers. As JMG speculates in the Ecotechnic Future, it’s even quite possible that humans could one day achieve and maintain a technologically sophisticated civilization on a sustainable level on renewable resources almost indefinitely until some sort of other non-anthropomorphic environmental catastrophe changes the system. The problem with that being the future of this specific civilization is that we’ve gone a bit too far above the dotted line in the author’s graph to be able to plateau where we are. That dotted line represents about a tenth of the per capita resource use of the average American. A sustainable plateau would require a reduction in the standard of living even if we were still at a point where would be possible to act to avert disaster. That means that most of our “hacking” is going to be in the name of jerry rigging enough life necessities together to just get by, but until that population reaches a K value in alignment with available renewable resources per capita, that hacking is going to be carrying people through decline rather than progress or plateau. By all means, hacking together a sustainable life for yourself with what you have on hand is exactly what Green Wizardry is all about and actions mean a lot more than viewpoints. But at the same time I wonder how much staying power such a narrative will have as a spur to action when it fails to deliver on its promises?<br><br><a href=#c5480785719817033188 title="comment permalink">1/19/15, 12:00 PM</a><br><br>

Most people probably don't think too seriously about the alternative. But, like I said before, there are no guarantees. You may assume that your child is safe, but he isn't really. Car accidents, cancer, stupidity, violence, drugs. Yeah, pedestrian stuff, but it still happens and not necessarily to someone else. War happens and boys are sent off to die. Tsunamis happen and whole families are wiped out.

Heck, I'm "poor" for the time being and am baffled how anyone could need more than what we have. Some of us do appreciate it, at least.<br><br>But there's a bit of an apples-to-oranges comparison. A lot of the infrastructure that would provide for less consumption doesn't exist in many cases. I'm lucky enough to live close to a store, a hospital, etc., but many people live miles away from even basic access to necessities, while in an area with little or no public transportation. So it's not as though we could flip a switch and go to "Western European" mode. :)<br><br>Beyond that, the real risk is the degree of specialization that we have. Your grandparents were probably pretty resourceful and provided for many of their necessities. They had a pool of experience and a community of low-tech specialists to depend upon. But Debbie in Human Resources and Bob the waiter and Chuck in Accounts Receivable? If the grocery store doesn't have food to swap for green scraps of paper, they starve to death.<br><br>Basically, we don't have any freaking clue what we're doing, collectively speaking. Collapse doesn't mean that we have to go back to working the job my grandpa did. It means I have to figure out how to properly skin a deer, or my children die. We don't worry about the luxuries (which we have in abundance), but the necessities, because we're almost completely disconnected from the basic stuff humans did to get by for thousands of years.<br><br>Imagine dumping a bunch of 6 year olds in a ghost town and leaving them to fend for themselves, and you're not far off. The people on this blog (et al) are the big kids, who have a few years and skills. And even many of us would be pretty screwed without weekly deliveries on the Wal-Mart truck.<br><br>So cut us some slack. :) I'm perfectly happy walking to the store or not playing video games, as long as I don't watch my kids starve or freeze to death. We just know that, right now, if we cross a certain line, nearly all of us are in the dark.

It was obvious, even to a clueless Americasn 'teen, that the generation before mine were still seeing the rubble and the phosphorus fires from time to time. When I returned home, I happened upon the short story, "Nachts schlaffen die Ratten doch," and I understood just a little better what haunted the adults who had lived through the War. <br><br>After 53 years that story still haunts me. Therefore I recommend it to American readers who are overly worried about the coming collapse. It will give some perspective. <br><br>There are English translations on the web. The title translates roughly as "Rats do too sleep at night!"<br><br><a href=#c5963813824443921873 title="comment permalink">1/19/15, 6:36 PM</a><br><br>

As you say, health, safety and hope. And right NOW, living in the industrial west, we have a reasonable chance of being able to do that."<br><br>That's your analysis. Pray god that you are right. That isn't my conclusion, and I'm not thinking just about five generations in the future, but about children born in this decade.<br><br>Maybe living outside the US, you can see a different future than here. But I have watched lives come apart here - a job lost, a severe and costly medical problem, a series of arrogantly made choices that result in losing everything (except student loan debt and unpaid income taxes, of course) - and I have a feeling for how quickly everything can go wrong. Basically I agree with Derv: "Basically, we don't have any freaking clue what we're doing, collectively speaking. Collapse doesn't mean that we have to go back to working the job my grandpa did. It means I have to figure out how to properly skin a deer, or my children die. We don't worry about the luxuries (which we have in abundance), but the necessities, because we're almost completely disconnected from the basic stuff humans did to get by for thousands of years."<br><br>So, no, Morganfrue, I wouldn't reach the same conclusion as you. Maybe if I were 22 again I would agree with you and be willing to take that leap of faith. I don't know. Let's be clear that I'm not judging you, even we don't see the future in the same way. I am definitely not judging whether it's right or wrong for anyone to have or not have children. The only truly "wrong" course of action, in my opinion, would be to refuse to think about the future and consequently to be unprepared to protect and defend one's children.<br><br>But AFAIK my starting point differs from most commenters here: in the long run, I'm not particularly interested in or excited about prolonging this human experiment. We've had our chance; we fracked it up. Maybe new human civilizations will arise; maybe not. I do not have high hopes or high expectations for them, because I have no hope or expectation that humans will behave differently in the future than they have in the past or than they do now. They will IMO, keep screwing up every opportunity.<br><br>BUT I can't do anything about that. Since the one thing I'm sure of is that humanity will go on - people will keep making babies! - and since I do have some skin in this game (kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews), as far as I can figure out the only sane approach to the future for me is that proposed by the Archdruid: to preserve knowledge and information that will help those future generations cope with the mess they find themselves in. To help those I love cope with the immediate future. And to try to contribute to the mess as little as I can.<br><br><a href=#c7883405438277948894 title="comment permalink">1/19/15, 8:02 PM</a><br><br>

The lack of coal would already be having large knock-on effects on European civilization before North American colonization; coal was already becoming an important fuel for industry, heating and cooking in the 14th century and earlier. Increased pressure on northern European forests will change history long before the narrative you set up has time to happen. <br><br>For example, without coal to offset wood-burning, Britannia would have never had the timber to build enough ships to rule the waves; North America would have likely then stayed French, and the French pattern of settlement was much lighter than the English one, which would prolong the life of North American forests. England herself would have likely stayed an underdeveloped nation, exporting raw wool to the continent and importing (hand) manufactured goods.

(: Yes, if the time scale is in decades, it can go that much downhill. Especially in a country with many paranoid people armed to the teeth. Even air raids are possible if the government fights for control - what the US armed forces will do in that case gets clear from the wars outside. Bombing everything down, only then sending ground forces (if at all).<br><br><br>@ Derv: Community? What community? Germany turned from "well-ordered" to "in ruins" only in the last two years of WW2 since during the first four years, Germany instead wreaked havoc on other countries. Then you could not just relocate from the east: First, cars were not wide-spread, fuel was not available to civilians either, and the railroad was used for military transports. Second, the Nazis didn't want millions of refugees from the east because that would have spoiled their "final victory" propaganda. You couldn't even put up a white flag of surrender on your house as long as die-hard Nazis still were around because they would have executed you on the spot. The time window for leaving was narrow: after the die-hard Nazis either fled or came to terms with reality and before the Red Army arrived.<br><br>Those who were bombed out out of the western cities were put to smaller cities and had to work in ammo production, just to make the lost war last a bit longer. No time for building up something useful. In fact, even saying something like "building up a community for after the war" would have got you executed since that would have implied doubting the "final victory". Plus that the Nazis became even more paranoid after the assassination attempt on Hitler in 1944.<br><br>We were in no way resourceful. Knowledge like running an inn or so is quite useless when you have to abandon the building. Parts of my family came from those eastern territories that were already lost after WW1. They built up a modest life, but only to loose everything <i>again</i> 20 years later in the bomb raids of WW2. There were other, more lucky families who stayed prosperous or even rich after WW2..<br><br>But as you may have guessed by now, fortune never befriended my family that much. The very best card any of mine could hope for was labeled "alive", and quite some didn't get even that card, especially men. Somehow muddling through was the motto of the day after the war. Even for the children who had tasks like stealing some coal from the coal trucks.<br><br><a href=#c670746066676603321 title="comment permalink">1/20/15, 9:05 AM</a><br><br>

It has been built up that way for decades. A short-term solution would be to give up the trucks and get cars. Next to nobody here in Germany drives V8 pickups. The rich don't because these trucks don't fit in parking lots or parking decks, and the average people don't because they cannot fill them up. E.g. in 2013, petrol cost around 1.60 Euro per litre, that was $7.86 per gallon! If a US citizen complains about the fuel price, I can only laugh. The consequence is that average cars here are much smaller and therefore need much less fuel.<br><br>Didn't the Archdruid say something about "LESS"? Maybe "less of a car" would be a starter. (;<br><br>The good thing, however, is that "peakoil" doesn't mean "empty". When transportation got cheaper and cheaper, the old, decentralised structures went away in favour of WalMart &amp; co. That will also work the other way round because local structures will beat the current ones as soon as the big transportaion overhead will stop to be economically viable.<br><br>In the same way, public transport may re-appear. I mean, the car is what kills public transport in the first place. If everyone drives in his car beside the bus, the bus is empty and will get canceled. If fuel stops to be dirt-cheap, then the fact that a bus with enough passengers takes much less fuel than the cars will make a bus line viable. Of course not every ten minutes if the urban sprawl doesn't allow for a high density of population. Maybe only one bus per hour. So what, that was what I had when I commuted to the university where it was one train per hour. A car would not have been in my budget. I neither could have afforded renting a room near the university and thus lived at home, plus that I was needed there.<br><br>Or you can use the bicycle or even the feet for a short distance. When I was 10 years old, my school was 2 miles away, and I used the bicycle. Even in rain where I put on a plastic poncho. It was worse in winter, and the 1980s still had real winters. My parents didn't drive me by car because they had to work. So when it was 10 inches of snow and -15°C (5°F), my ma woke me up half an hour earlier than usually so that I had the time to walk, of course with the satchel on my back. That wasn't exceptionally hard in those years, that was just normal, even for a 10 year old child. Well, helicopter parents were not yet around back then. On the other hand, we had the fun of snowball fights even before school, when the snow was best.<br><br>Maybe you see now why I have a somewhat different standard for what "LESS" means..

The original discussion was more about the eventual development and paths of technology (the "tech tree" to use a simulation gaming term), so e.g. "New England circa 1800" represents a resource situation and suite of commonly used technologies for which one can ask what would have happened next, rather than a claim that that exact situation would have come about at that time and place without e.g. coal in England for several centuries prior.<br><br>I do think it's likely that without fossil fuels, someone, most likely Europeans, would still have spread lethal epidemics to the New World and then later established colonies, making use of the wood and water-power resources of the east coast. Who and when could have been different, though. Of course that entire scenario could also be wrong, but I didn't discover any specific reasons (e.g. lack of ocean-worthy ships or lack of firearms) that would have prevented it from happening or made it very unlikely without coal.<br><br>A good historical study of pre-industrial artisanal uses of fossil fuels, and especially of the use of coal in the ship-fitting and firearms industries would probably clarify things.

It is because of the level of our consciousness. Now, I am often appalled at the low opinion people have of animals. I think they are intelligent, aware, problem solving beings with an intriguing inner experience. Nonetheless, I do not think another consciousness compares with out own, and to cut off humanity is to cut off the highest possibility that life has yet brought forth. The only thing that keeps me from total despair at the thought that we may wipe ourselves or this whole planet out is that I am pretty sure there are myriad life filled planets in the universe.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c2329920334400001981 title="comment permalink">1/20/15, 6:17 PM</a><br><br>

Steps are as follows:<br> <br>1) Set up a factory on Earth's Moon to build and launch several large robotic factories into the Asteroid Belt. <br>2) These robot factories would use the plentiful materials found in the Asteroid Belt and the low-G environment there to churn out solar-sail-powered robot tankers that would slowly make their way to Saturn's moon Titan.<br>3) The robot tankers would descend to the surface of Titan and slurp up some liquid goodness<br>4) The tankers would distill enough of their cargo into oxygen and high-grade petrofuel to be able to blast off from Titan and make their way back to low-Earth orbit<br>5) From orbit, the tankers would finish refining the rest of their cargo into combustible material and burn it, converting it into high-frequency radiation beamed at receiving towers on Earth.<br>6) At the receiving towers, the microwaves would be converted into usable electricity.<br>7) The tankers would retain enough fuel and oxygen to return to Titan and start the cycle over again.<br>8) The robotic factories would also continue to churn out robot tankers.<br><br>Having little graphic skill, I did a very nice cheesy Microsoft Paint drawing (not to scale) of the whole process).

My parents were born in 1916 and 1920. They married in 1942. In 1944/5 my mother had to flee with a 1943 December infant, my sister, who seems never to have recovered from the mess of years of insecurity. yes, there were kind people along the way; yes, our father was resourceful, a good artist( he was able to sell pen and ink drawings as he went. I have one left; it looks a lot like a print) as well as someone who could shingle your roof. In subsequent decades, as I tried to deal with his depression, I hit on an idea ( supplied by work I was doing in historical societies and archives) that family/oral histories might be very important. So, I got my dad a beautiful, gold-rimmed totally blank bound book, still available in 1980s Bonn, Germany. <br>Over the years of insomnia, my dad filled those pages ( to which I had added some photographs) with fountain pen script.<br>The older sister, 1943 vintage, totally rejected his account. The next sister, the historian of the "family" ( she taught history within the German secondary school system and married a history buff who retired as appellate court judge in Cologne) . It remains to be seen whether the next generations ( my nieces and nephews, now in their thirtees and forties) will value the hard lessons of my mom and dad.<br><br><a href=#c3063731923944837169 title="comment permalink">1/21/15, 3:01 PM</a><br><br>
