<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the things my readers ask me most often, in response to this blog’s exploration of the ongoing decline and impending fall of modern industrial civilization, is what I suggest people ought to do about it all. It’s a valid question, and it deserves a serious answer. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course not everyone who asks the question is interested in the answers I have to offer. A great many people, for example, are only interested in answers that will allow them to keep on enjoying the absurd extravagance that passed, not too long ago, for an ordinary lifestyle among the industrial world’s privileged classes, and is becoming just a little bit less ordinary with every year that slips by.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To such people I have nothing to say. Those lifestyles were only possible because the world’s industrial nations burnt through half a billion years of stored sunlight in a few short centuries, and gave most of the benefits of that orgy of consumption to a relatively small fraction of their population; now that easily accessible reserves of fossil fuels are running short, the party’s over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yes, I’m quite aware that that’s a controversial statement. I field heated denunciations on a regular basis insisting that it just ain’t so, that solar energy or fission or perpetual motion or
<i>something</i> will allow the industrial world’s privileged classes to have their planet and eat it too. Printer’s ink being unfashionable these days, a great many electrons have been inconvenienced on the internet to proclaim that this or that technology must surely allow the comfortable to remain comfortable, no matter what the laws of physics, geology, or economics have to say.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now of course the only alternative energy sources that have been able to stay in business even in a time of sky-high oil prices are those that can count on gargantuan government subsidies to pay their operating expenses; equally, the alternatives receive an even more gigantic “energy subsidy” from fossil fuels, which make them look much more economical than they otherwise would.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Such reflections carry no weight with those whose sense of entitlement makes living with less unthinkable. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m glad to say that there are<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>fair number of people who’ve gotten past that unproductive attitude, who have grasped the severity of the crisis of our time and are ready to accept unwelcome change in order to secure a livable future for our descendants. They want to know how we can pull modern civilization out of its current power dive and perpetuate it into the centuries ahead. I have no answers for them, either, because that’s not an option at this stage of the game; we’re long past the point at which decline and fall can be avoided, or even ameliorated on any large scale. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A decade ago, a team headed by Robert Hirsch and funded by the Department of Energy released a study outlining what would have to be done in order to transition away from fossil fuels before they transitioned away from us. What they found, to sketch out too briefly the findings of a long and carefully worded study, is that in order to avoid massive disruption, the transition would have to begin twenty years before conventional petroleum production reached its peak and began to decline. There’s a certain irony in the fact that 2005, the year this study was published, was also the year when conventional petroleum production peaked; the transition would thus have had to begin in 1985—right about the time, that is, that the Reagan administration in the US and its clones overseas were scrapping the promising steps toward just such a transition. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A transition that got under way in 2005, in other words, would have been too late, and given the political climate, it probably would have been too little as well. Even so, it would have been a much better outcome than the one we got, in which most of us have spent the last ten years insisting that we don’t have to worry about depleting oilfields because fracking was going to save us all. At this point, thirty years after the point at which we would have had to get started, it’s all very well to talk about some sort of grand transition to sustainability, but the time when such a thing would have been possible came and went decades ago. We could have chosen that path, but we didn’t, and insisting thirty years after the fact that we’ve changed our minds and want a different future than the one we chose isn’t likely to make any kind of difference that matters. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So what options does that leave? In the minds of a great many people, at least in the United States, the choice that apparently comes first to mind involves buying farmland in some isolated rural area and setting up a homestead in the traditional style. Many of the people who talk enthusiastically about this option, to be sure, have never grown anything more demanding than a potted petunia, know nothing about the complex and demanding arts of farming and livestock raising, and aren’t in anything like the sort of robust physical condition needed to handle the unremitting hard work of raising food without benefit of fossil fuels; thus it’s a safe guess that in most of these cases, heading out to the country is simply a comforting daydream that serves to distract attention from the increasingly bleak prospects so many people are facing in the age of unraveling upon us. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a long history behind such daydreams. Since colonial times, the lure of the frontier has played a huge role in the American imagination, providing any number of colorful inkblots onto which fantasies of a better life could be projected. Those of my readers who are old enough to remember the aftermath of the Sixties counterculture, when a great many young people followed that dream to an assortment of hastily created rural communes, will also recall the head-on collision between middle-class fantasies of entitlement and the hard realities of rural subsistence farming that generally resulted. Some of the communes survived, though many more did not; that I know of, none of the surviving ones made it without a long and difficult period of readjustment in which romantic notions of easy living in the lap of nature got chucked in favor of a more realistic awareness of just how little in the way of goods and services a bunch of untrained ex-suburbanites can actually produce by their own labor. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In theory, that process of reassessment is still open. In practice, just at the moment, I’m far from sure it’s an option for anyone who’s not already traveled far along that road. The decline and fall of modern industrial civilization, it bears repeating, is not poised somewhere off in the indefinite future, waiting patiently for us to get ready for it before it puts in an appearance; it’s already happening at the usual pace, and the points I’ve raised in posts here over the last few weeks suggest that the downward slope is probably going to get a lot steeper in the near future. As the collapse of the fracking bubble ripples out through the financial sphere, most of us are going to be scrambling to adapt, and the chances of getting everything lined up in time to move to rural property, get the necessary equipment and supplies to start farming, and get past the worst of the learning curve before crunch time arrives are not good. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If you’re already on a rural farm, in other words, by all means pursue the strategy that put you there. If your plans to get the necessary property, equipment, and skills are well advanced at this point, you may still be able to make it, but you’d probably better get a move on. On the other hand, dear reader, if your rural retreat is still off there in the realm of daydreams and good intentions, it’s almost certainly too late to do much about it, and where you are right now is probably where you’ll be when the onrushing waves of crisis come surging up and break over your head. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That being the case, are there any options left other than hiding under the bed and hoping that the end will be relatively painless? As it happens, there are. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The point that has to be understood to make sense of those options is that in the real world, as distinct from Hollywood-style disaster fantasies, the end of a civilization follows the famous rule attributed to William Gibson: “The future is already here, it’s just not evenly distributed yet.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Put another way, the impacts of decline and fall aren’t uniform; they vary in intensity over space and time, and they impact particular systems of a falling civilization at different times and in different ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you’re in the wrong place at the wrong time, and depend on the wrong systems to support you, your chances aren’t good, but the places, times, and systems that take the brunt of the collapse aren’t random. To some extent, those can be anticipated, and some of them can also be avoided. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here’s an obvious example. Right now, if your livelihood depends on the fracking industry, the tar sands industry, or any of the subsidiary industries that feed into those, your chances of getting through 2015 with your income intact are pretty minimal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>People in those industries who got to witness earlier booms and busts know this, and a good many of them are paying off their debts, settling any unfinished business they might have, and making sure they can cover a tank of gas or a plane ticket to get back home when the bottom falls out. People in those industries who don’t have that experience to guide them, and are convinced that nothing bad can actually happen to them, are not doing these things, and are likely to end up in a world of hurt when their turn comes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They’re not the only ones who would benefit right now from taking such steps. A very large part of the US banking and finance industry has been flying high on bloated profits from an assortment of fracking-related scams, ranging from junk bonds through derivatives to exotic financial fauna such as volumetric production payments. Now that the goose that laid the golden eggs is bobbing feet upwards in a pond of used fracking fluid, the good times are coming to a sudden stop, and that means sharply reduced income for those junior bankers, brokers, and salespeople who can keep their jobs, and even more sharply reduced prospects for those who don’t. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They’ve got plenty of company on the chopping block.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The entire retail sector in the US is already in trouble, with big-box stores struggling for survival and shopping malls being abandoned, and the sharp economic downturn we can expect as the fracking bust unfolds will likely turn that decline into freefall, varying in intensity by region and a galaxy of other factors. Those who brace themselves for a hard landing now are a good deal more likely to make it than those who don’t, and those who have the chance to jump to something more stable now would be well advised to make the leap. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s one example; here’s another. I’ve written here in some detail about how anthropogenic climate change <a href=../../2014/07/dark-age-america-climate.html>will wallop North America</a> in the centuries ahead of us. One thing that’s been learned from the last few years of climate vagaries is that North America, at least, is shifting in exactly the way paleoclimatic data would suggest—more or less the same way it did during warm periods over the last ten or twenty million years. The short form is that the Southwest and mountain West are getting baked to a crackly crunch under savage droughts; the eastern Great Plains, Midwest, and most of the South are being hit by a wildly unstable climate, with bone-dry dry years alternating with exceptionally soggy wet ones; while the Appalachians and points eastward have been getting unsteady temperatures but reliable rainfall. Line up your choice of subsistence strategies next to those climate shifts, and if you still have the time and resources to relocate, you have some idea where to go. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All this presumes, of course, that what we’re facing has much more in common with the crises faced by other civilizations on their way to history’s compost heap than it does with the apocalyptic fantasies so often retailed these days as visions of the immediate future. I expect to field a flurry of claims that it just ain’t so, that everything I’ve just said is wasted breath because some vast and terrible whatsit will shortly descend on the whole world and squash us like bugs. I can utter that prediction with perfect confidence, because I’ve been fielding such claims over and over again since long before this blog got started. All the dates by which the world was surely going to end have rolled past without incident, and the inevitable cataclysms have pulled one no-show after another, but the shrill insistence that something of the sort really will happen this time around has shown no sign of letting up. Nor will it, since the unacceptable alternative consists of taking responsibility for doing something about the future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course I’ve already pointed out that there’s not much that can be done about the future on the largest scale. As the fracking bubble implodes, the global economy shudders, the climate destabilizes, and a dozen other measures of imminent crisis head toward the red zone on the gauge, it’s far too late in the day for much more than crisis management on a local and individual level. Even so, crisis management is a considerably more useful response than sitting on the sofa daydreaming about the grandiose project that’s certain to save us or the grandiose cataclysm that’s certain to annihilate us—though these latter options are admittedly much more comfortable in the short term. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s more, there’s no shortage of examples in relatively recent history to guide the sort of crisis management I have in mind. The tsunami of discontinuities that’s rolling toward us out of the deep waters of the future may be larger than the waves that hit the Western world with the coming of the First World War in 1914, the Great Depression in 1929, or the Second World War in 1939, but from the perspective of the individual, the difference isn’t as vast as it might seem. In fact, I’d encourage my readers to visit their local public libraries and pick up books about the lived experience of those earlier traumas. I’d also encourage those with elderly relatives who still remember the Second World War to sit down with them over a couple of cups of whatever beverage seems appropriate, and ask about what it was like on a day-by-day basis to watch their ordinary peacetime world unravel into chaos. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve had the advantage of taking part in such conversations, and I’ve also done a great deal of reading about historical crises that have passed below the horizon of living memory. There are plenty of lessons to be gained from such sources, and one of the most important also used to be standard aboard sailing ships in the days before steam power. Sailors in those days had to go scrambling up the rigging at all hours and in all weathers to set, reef, or furl sails; it was not an easy job—imagine yourself up in the rigging of a tall ship in the middle of a howling storm at night, clinging to tarred ropes and slick wood and trying to get a mass of wet, heavy, wind-whipped canvas to behave, while below you the ship rolls from side to side and swings you out over a raging ocean and back again. If you slip and you’re lucky, you land on deck with a pretty good chance of breaking bones or worse; if you slip and you’re not lucky, you plunge straight down into churning black water and are never seen again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The rule that sailors learned and followed in those days was simple: “One hand for yourself, one hand for the ship.” Every chore that had to be done up there in the rigging could be done by a gang of sailors who each lent one hand to the effort, so the other could cling for dear life to the nearest rope or ratline. Those tasks that couldn’t be done that way, such as hauling on ropes, took place down on the deck—the rigging was designed with that in mind. There were emergencies where that rule didn’t apply, and even with the rule in place there were sailors who fell from the rigging to their deaths, but as a general principle it worked tolerably well. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d like to propose that the same rule might be worth pursuing in the crisis of our age. In the years to come, a great many of us will face the same kind of scramble for survival that so many others faced in the catastrophes of the early 20th century. Some of us won’t make it, and some will have to face the ghastly choice between sheer survival and everything else they value in life. Not everyone, though, will land in one or the other of those categories, and many those who manage to stay out of them will have the chance to direct time and energy toward the broader picture. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Exactly what projects might fall into that latter category will differ from one person to another, for reasons that are irreducibly personal. I’m sure there are plenty of things that would motivate you to action in desperate times, dear reader, that would leave me cold, and of course the reverse is also true—and in times of crisis, of the kind we’re discussing, it’s personal factors of that sort that make the difference, not abstract considerations of the sort we might debate here. I’ll be discussing a few of the options in upcoming posts, but I’d also encourage readers of this blog to reflect on the question themselves: in the wreck of industrial civilization, what are you willing to make an effort to accomplish, to defend, or to preserve? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In thinking about that, I’d encourage my readers to consider the traumatic years of the early 20th century as a model for what’s approaching us. Those who were alive when the first great wave of dissolution hit in 1914 weren’t facing forty years of continuous cataclysm; as noted here repeatedly, collapse is a fractal process, and unfolds in real time as a sequence of crises of various kinds separated by intervals of relative calm in which some level of recovery is possible. It’s pretty clear that the first round of trouble here in the United States, at least, will be a major economic crisis; at some point not too far down the road, the yawning gap between our senile political class and the impoverished and disaffected masses promises the collapse of politics as usual and a descent into domestic insurgency or one of the other standard patterns by which former democracies destroy themselves; as already noted, there are plenty of other things bearing down on us—but after an interval, things will stabilize again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then it’ll be time to sort through the wreckage, see what’s been saved and what can be recovered, and go on from there. First, though, we have a troubled time to get through. </div>

If anyone's got any reliable figures/ assessments of the Australian Banking system (or economy in general) that might be helpful (our banking system is mostly Australian owned). All I know is we were certainly adversely affected by the great depression of the 30s the wars, the oil crisis of the 70s and the recession of more recent times.

Each can be utilized in the dead of winter for at least some of their uses. I won't say what the uses are. If you're interested there are ample on-line and book resources.

It will be a change in diet, in exercise, in leisure, and in just about every other category as well. But I often wonder whether it will really be <i>harder</i>. <br><br>After all, while we live in a world of convenience, we also live in a world of unhappiness, boredom, depression, and stress. Yes we have the world of knowledge in our pockets, but we have no ease of mind. So while I sit here on my computer, heated by a gas furnace, and stressing over the future downfall - I am also wondering if I was sitting in a small shelter with a book rather than a computer, cutting firewood for heat instead of commenting on blogs while heated by natural gas, and spending my leisure time thinking about what needs to be accomplished tomorrow to ensure my food supply stays continuous... And it makes me think that maybe this future will be a blessing to those ready for it. An end to the mental and spiritual emptiness of modern life, in exchange for a more physically taxing lifestyle. <br><br>Am I too optimistic?<br><br><a href=#c2549373364487530585 title="comment permalink">1/21/15, 6:31 PM</a><br><br>

I just picked up a copy of Twilight's last gleaming and am looking forward to enjoying it. Respect for writing it too - fiction is a hard beast. <br><br>I was looking over the squirrel entries last night and they're good. Jason's has been my favourite so far because the little pratt that the story revolved around - physically repulsed me and that makes good art! Is smarmy perhaps the correct word? Maybe? My story took a different tact by simply making fun of people that talk rubbish and expect it to be taken seriously.<br><br>Apologies, I'm digressing...<br><br>The thing that really annoys me about my conversations with people about solar is that they fixate on the payback period or worry about what the local feed in tariff is. Why couldn't they install the stuff because it is simply the right thing to do? Oh, that's right because it is uneconomic - not that nature ever factors that into such considerations. All those pesky externalities... It's 33'C (91.4'F) outside today - maybe I'm a bit cranky... Or maybe not! ;-)!<br><br>Hear, hear! Very nicely put indeed. The funny thing about farming too, is that most people that consider themselves as farmers - on broad acres - have massive fossil fuel inputs as well as reliance on machinery that are mind bogglingly complex, chemical and mineral inputs, mate it just goes on and on. And the really big thing that no one wants to even talk about is that one day: you may just have to rely on rainfall alone. Imagine that!<br><br>Exactly, it is the learning curve - which takes literally years to a decade - which is not possible to accelerate or wheedle your way around.<br><br>Diverse collections of plants is also a good strategy that is worth mentioning because in the highly variable and unstable climate here, having a raft of different plants means that despite the conditions, something is generally producing. This however, requires a person to jettison dogmatic beliefs about what grows where and that is not an easy task for some. There are some people who for ideological reasons have a mild freak out when I mention some of the hardier (some people refer to these as weedy) species here and in some cases they are unable to get past that sticking point.<br><br>Yes, the 1920's post WWI were for much of the Western world a time of recovery and stability.<br><br>An excellent post.<br><br>PS: Part of the reason that I started the blog about the farm here is that I felt there was a need to dispell (sic) much of the romanticism about living in a place like this. If the infrastructure is not set up well, in a crisis time that would be a very hard outcome to achieve - the place then becomes essentially a lot of hard repetitive work because a person has to then make up for system deficiencies in the infrastructure. <br><br>There is no fat of the land now.<br><br>There is however a new blog post talking about steel and concrete stairs, tropical monsoons, seed saving and tomato updates!

I did want to update that, after many delays and false starts, my old-style morgan mare arrived last week. Her story is one of the ongoing collapse. The horse shipper I'd moved here with in 2003 went out of business in 2011. Another shipper who was still in it just a year ago -- and has made his living at it for 25 years -- no longer answers his phone. I'm not sure if he's out of business or dead. A facebook search unearthed a trainer who was trailering a horse from Ohio to Nova Scotia, who bailed on us after 3 false dates. Finally, in desperation, the seller made the 14 hour round trip herself, charging me only gas and tolls. I expect horse transport to get tougher in the future. The low gas prices won't bring the bankrupt back into business...<br><br>Maizie herself is a victim of the 2008 collapse. Many breeders rely on outside trainers and in recent decades often sold their babies as babies. 2008 left them unable to afford to send out to trainers, a dearth of buyers for untrained horses, and semi-pros who once took in a couple horses on the side could no longer afford insurance. And so there a a lot of horses that have been standing around, unbroke and unsellable, since 2008. She is one of them. <br><br>In other news, I have been burdened (and frightened) by student loans that I took out based on a string of lies, and trapped in the income-based repayment program as a result. And then I got a flyer a couple weeks ago. The holder of my small pension is offering us a one-time cashout. The estimated amount may be enough to pay off the student loans once and for all, so I'm investigating that and figuring out how I can do it. If it works, I will again be debt-free. Talk about just-in-time for battening down the hatches!<br><br>Anyway, I'm looking well forward to the current direction of your posts, JMG. While I've enjoyed the education of the more philosophy-oriented posts, your more urgent tone of late is spurring me to want to take action NOW!<br><br>Mary<br><br><a href=#c6497004111633734102 title="comment permalink">1/21/15, 6:49 PM</a><br><br>

Anyone who doesn't recognize me or my previous username is forgiven.)<br><br>I've spent most of the past year working on developing traditional skills like farming, baking bread, and preserving food. I have to admit my garden was a pretty spectacular failure, but has been a great learning experience and that counts for something! I'll admit I sometimes lose sleep knowing that if I don't get my act together it could mean hunger in the future. But I'm trying to do what I can do and I trust continued practice will bring better results.<br><br>Are you familiar with the book Wisconsin Death Trip by Michael Lesy? I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks an old-fashioned rural lifestyle is sunshine &amp; happiness. The book collects photographs and newspaper articles from a rural area in Wisconsin around the 1890s and each page is <i>dripping</i> with suffering, madness, delusions, disease, and similar horrors. I found it to be both fascinating and overwhelming.<br><br><a href=#c970232314473669099 title="comment permalink">1/21/15, 7:51 PM</a><br><br>

Yeah, I could quibble about a few points, but considering the big picture the quibbles don't much matter.<br><br>I've got that house in the country with a good well, access to flowing surface water, and solar electric power. There are some maturing nut trees planted and a small garden. However, there's a big difference between gardening and farming. My great grandparents moved to the US to avoid slowly starving and working themselves to death on a farm. Factory work looked good in comparison. Farming interests me not at all.<br><br>For years the house was a refuge. Family and even friends have moved in with us when experiencing hard times. A good hard look at my current situation shows that right now in a crunch situation we are more likely to move in with one of the kids than the other way around. I'm glad they are doing well. <br><br>So we had a house that may or may not be worth much to us in the future. My wife and I live on disability income, mine from a state plan and her's is federal. We rolled all our remaining debt into the house, leaving our other stuff free and clear. If our incomes keep coming in, the house payments are easy. If they go away, so will the house -but nothing else. <br><br>I've very tempted to live on a sailboat, having tried it and like it. Most boats are too expensive and tech heavy to be good options in the long run. There are good used modest sized boats that can be easily maintained and sailed by one or two people. We do have some skills that could be taken from port to port.<br><br>. . . or we could spend the rest of our days in our house in the mountains. The thing is, we accept at a gut level that things can change suddenly and for the worse. Good to have some backup plans.<br><br><a href=#c1853195142572065904 title="comment permalink">1/21/15, 7:57 PM</a><br><br>

I would be scrambling to feed myself on my 1/2 acre if basics went away (OTOH, if basics went way, along with my medicine,I'd be toast anyway) - but in the short run, I can afford the basics because I produce some good extras (including meat). But I want to tell anyone who hasn't tried it - manual chores take much more energy and time than machines (I know - duh...) and your priorities have to shift. I know that many people have commented here over the years that it's hard to have a foot in each world, and I suspect may get trickier soon. But whenever I grouse about how hard it is, I remind myself that "easy" belongs to the old expectations, which I left behind when I took up this life. This is hard, but this is still only practice. I'm hoping it'll help me tolerate future reversals or declines without the kind of shock many of my friends and family will experience if the bottom drops out. <br><br>On a cheerier note, I've posted the 15 entries on the Green Wizard sites (blog and forum) - even if you aren't a member or plan to vote, please check it out and let me know if I've left anyone out (JMG- do you have 15 also?).

I'm hoping that, in this next stretch of posts, at some point you give us a "top ten" (or so) list of occupations/skills you think we ought to pursue for the short to medium term. I've wondered about that for a while now. I'm interested to know what to do with my free hand, to be sure, but I'd also like to know how to hold on to the ship!<br><br>I know personal tastes and abilities comes into it, as well as local conditions, and so on, but I think a few general trends could be noted. <br><br>For instance, I suspect that in the long run, blacksmiths of some form will come back into favor, but in the short term they probably won't be in high demand. The same goes for large-scale construction; we have a whole mess of buildings that will cover our needs for decades, with maintenance. One day, we'll have to get back to that, but not in my lifetime.<br><br>This is something that concerns me a fair deal, and I've brought it up a few times before on here. I can see and understand what kind of jobs we have in business as usual, and a century or two from now. But what about now, during the transition? You say we can't go get a farm, and I agree. That was never an option for me anyway, given that I'm disabled. So what should I learn to do instead that will put food on my table? I'm not asking you to decide my future for me. Just give me a list of jobs or skills that I can specialize in which you think might earn me a paycheck (or food, etc.) in ten years, twenty years, and so on. I hoped we would have more time than this. I pretty much screwed up in my planning. We've taken many steps to prepare, but not enough.<br><br>Seriously. I'm absolutely willing to commit to some skill and do my part. But I need some direction. And I'm sure a fair few others do as well. A short list of options would at least make my choices a bit clearer.<br><br>I appreciate any help you can give.<br><br><a href=#c931837710637127628 title="comment permalink">1/21/15, 8:30 PM</a><br><br>

I figure that by voluntarily panicking about learning new skills right now, I can avoid panicking later when it becomes a necessity, and I need all those skills at once. Also, this course of action is introducing me to many accomplished and knowledgeable people who will be in great demand in a down turn. It is like networking for survival:)<br>And, oh my goodness, learning all this new stuff? More fun than I have ever had. If the decline and fall of civilization never happens, I will still have had the time of my life, and get to be a wise old granny who knows everything about gardening and herbs and preserving and a dozen other things I haven't thought of yet, and will have some great friends.

Somewhere around the time that I bought my first car that changed; I no longer went anywhere that didn't have parking. Your point about dead malls is not lost on me:<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?x-yt-cl=84359240&amp;v=4yazTi7K5F8&amp;feature=player_detailpage&amp;x-yt-ts=1421782837#t=24<br><br>Sometimes I miss the past, but there is no way to get it back. I think Billy Joel wrote a lyric in one of his songs that 'The good old days weren't always good, and the future is not as bad as it seems.' He has a point.<br><br>I'd also had the hobby farm for my retirement years fantasy. It remained a fantasy until one day I actually looked at what farm land costs. A small area of farm land, far from towns and services is about $300,000. The closer farms are to small towns, the higher the prices go from there. That 300 K figure woke me up to the reality that I'll never have a hobby farm to retire on. Also the thought of living out somewhere, after 1/2 a lifetime of urban living, where I would be in the middle of nowhere, with no services, no 9/11 ambulances available at a moments notice, no movie theaters or anything else to do other than work with your spare time, its not a pretty picture. Especially if you don't know anyone living out there. Will the locals even accept you? You may have a different religion, sexual orientation, or belief system than the people who grew up in the area. Exceptional risk irregardless.<br><br>I've resigned myself to helping get my kids to get launched and then I'm personally gone with the collapse. Acceptance of the end can be challenging, but I won't be among the survivors after a collapse.<br><br>I was briefly homeless in the early 90's and I had a taste of what it means to hit rock bottom. I sincerely don't believe most people have a remote clue as the the hardships we are heading into. With even the most pessimistic mainstream media only being concerned with wealth preservation by buying gold, et al. When there is no place to live, not enough to eat, and no way to accumulate and protect your possessions, these changes could spell mass suicide for those unprepared. I have no inkling to get back to rock bottom, but even if I end up back there, it a 'been there, done that' scenario.

Given the magnitude of what we're facing, and how it is already playing out in so many ways and speeds, whatever happens to any of us is going to be highly unpredictable and impossible to really plan for. A flexible response is going to be much more important than a solidly built defense, whether that be a farm or a new career or whatever. <br><br>So don't put too much stock in any one set of material preparations. Instead, focus on building strong relationships with family and in your immediate community. Let go of as much stuff and really simplify your life as soon as you can. Learn to be happy with less - it gets much easier once you start, and keeps getting easier. Get your finances as tidy as you can. Build some practical skills (of the butcher, baker, candlestick maker variety). And most importantly get your attitude right - get comfortable with letting go, and be kind to yourself. It's not like there's a successful playbook for what we're facing, and most of us are likely to fall down hard in the early running.

I had never heard of a "transition town." We weren't preparing for the collapse of civilization. Indeed, I was motivated more by the presumption that suburban civilization's cancerous sprawl across North America would continue unabated for the rest of my lifetime, and I just wanted to get farther out from the leading edge of it. Connection to a place, roots in the land, all that mumbo jumbo. Plus the possibility to take more control over our food chain, water supply, etc., and the opportunity to bring a neglected and endangered historic house back to life. Preparing for collapse? Not on the radar, other than as the occasional joke. <br><br>So more than a decade later, the house still has a lot more to do on it, the grid electricity flows into it, my wife still works full-time at a salaried job with a long commute, and most of our calories still come from the store. But we are connected and rooted. And we have been learning more and more. I can raise chickens in my sleep now. I've proven to myself that I can manage a coppice wood for fuel with hand tools -- and having proven that, I now mostly use power tools, since the power is still cheap. I've grown field corn by hand, no ox, no plow, no engines. But we still buy our cornmeal. We've discovered all sorts of edibles that just fall from the trees, spring from the ground, and swim in the pond, so much so that even if the grocery shelves emptied tomorrow, forever, we think we'd probably not starve before we got the first harvest in. And just this week I have finally been learning how to get sugar from the maples. Somehow it is comforting to know than even in a world without fossil fuels, there can still be some occasional luscious indulgences for the sweet tooth. <br><br>I'm not saying "bring it on!" No, not by a long shot. It won't be fun. It'll be toil and sweat and dirt. No hurry here. But, at least it looks more survivable.<br><br><a href=#c443067248740323989 title="comment permalink">1/21/15, 11:12 PM</a><br><br>

This is especially important for people living in cities, like myself. <br><br>Any thoughts from anyone about renting? My partner and I rent a flat, which I feel is one of our biggest weaknesses. At least we live in Germany, in a (relatively) poorer city where people in general are used to using less, and where people are more used to cooperation. But if our income goes, then making rent payments is going to be a problem once our savings run out.<br><br><a href=#c757392837851704447 title="comment permalink">1/21/15, 11:13 PM</a><br><br>

From where I'm standing while writing this, I can see dozens of farms on the opposite side of the valley. Most of these are run with tractors, combines and other heavy machinery.<br>My closest neighbors have chosen another lifestyle. They came here 21 years ago, bought a farm similar to mine, and got to work running it in a sustainable, fossil fuels free way.<br>They're self-sufficient, with one horse and eight cows/calves. But it's hard work - so hard that the other farmers in the valley laugh, and say "Isn't it time to join the 21st Century?"<br>The couple running that farm don't mind. They're happy and content, and bone tired. They also look at least ten years younger than their actual age, which is what happens when you combine today's knowledge of proper nutrition with good, physical activity.<br><br>The road leading to the mountain pastures goes by my place. Often, in mid-winter, I can see that my neighbor has gone up to his crofts in the mountains, where he has stored firewood and hay during the summer and fall. His horse pulls an old but sturdy sled up to eleven kilometers into the mountain, often in deep snow, and sometimes in temperatures down to -16C degrees. My neighbor fills up the sled, and returns to his farm. A trek he carries out at least once a week in winter, trudging alongside his horse.<br><br>They sow, plant, cultivate and gather; they make cheeses and butter, sausages and other things that they sell to customers far and near.<br>And they really are self-sufficient, if and when needed, and possess skills lost to most here, after the diesel fueled motorized agriculture became ubiquitous.<br><br>They were way ahead of the curve, but are now being joined by others. There is greater interest in these skills and serious efforts are being made to record them, and to pass them on. <br><br>As to what it takes to carry out the physical work my neighbors take for granted ...<br>About 4000 calories per person, per day, unless you're doing really strenuous work, such as chopping down trees for lumber or other uses - then you need about 7000 calories per day.<br>My neighbors are lean and stringy, but they eat all day. Most of it food they've gathered, made and preserved, to last them all year.<br><br>It's possible, but it's also a lifestyle where you've consciously chosen "not to join the 21st Century," because you don't find it sustainable, in the long run.<br><br><a href=#c984286974551313304 title="comment permalink">1/22/15, 1:10 AM</a><br><br>

Here in Europe we are now going to be getting a trillion Euros of QE - supposedly to combat deflation. This was already priced into the markets so won't make an iota of difference, it just seems to be an empty gesture. Central bankers will no doubt soon have their Wizard of Oz moment when Dorothy lifts the curtain on them.<br><br>Here's a data point. In the UK our hospitals are in crisis due to, amongst other things, 'bed blockers'. These are patients who have recovered from whatever it is that brought them in there but are unable to return home again because the social services are unable to look after them due to budget cuts. So, for example, in Birmingham there is a 'state of the art' new hospital where robots dispense pharmaceuticals, but the wards are filled with relatively healthy people who have no other place to go. <br><br>To add to that, a new term has been coined ... 'granny dumping'. Apparently the elderly are being dumped in hospital by their children as a means of getting 'free care'. The lesson is: build a nice new hospital and it will soon be turned into a kind of hotel for the semi-sick. It's a social nightmare.<br><br>All the main political parties seem to agree that the only cure for this crisis is 'more technology', although the mind boggles to think what that might entail.<br><br>@ Paul <i>"So when you've built your agrarian lifeboat, what do you do when the empty shelves in the supermarkets force the starving hordes to seek survival elsewhere?</i><br><br>This is one of the benefits of designing and living in a food forest. The starving hordes had better be patient as it can take months for things like mushrooms to appear, birch wine to be fermented and young lime leaves to be ready for a salad. They'll have to figure out how to catch the rabbits and squirrels, where to trap trout in the stream and which berries are edible and which will kill you. Of course, I know all of these things, which is why I'd be much more useful alive than dead, from their point of view. I'll keep a few tins of beans handy for those who can't wait.<br><br>Will it work? I've no idea — I have never tried living through a civilisational collapse before.

She was nearly 80 years old in my first memories, and still worked from sunrise to sunset. She gave birth to nine children, lost two when babies, and another when he was 20 with some rheumatic infection. All children attended school 4 years and got their diplomas.

Once I asked her what has been more difficult, while raising children with no fixed income, combustion engines, complex synthetized molecules, doctors or low cost imported products. "The shoes were very, very expensive, and each summer we had to find the money to pay for the shoes."

That is so that linesmen in your area don't get killed by your solar.<br><br>However, a small 12V solar power system is a no brainer. I run a small system here for my shed which comprises a 12V 200W solar panel, a 200Ah sealed AGM battery (it stores 2.4kW of energy) and a small charge controller. With that you can run, 12V lights, 12V pumps, 12V car refrigerator etc... All of that 12V stuff is so efficient nowadays it is staggering how little energy it requires. Even the new 12V refrigerators are hideously efficient.<br><br>And, the solar panel produces energy even on the cloudiest of days - it may not be much but it is sure better than nothing at all.<br><br>There is a video up of my bushfire sprinklers in action and two of them are powered by the small 12V solar system.

Luckily the days of sail were far behind and I only had to go aloft on rare occasions to service the satellite dish atop the mast. I don't have much of a head for heights and was duly grateful for a modern climbing harness. I can only admire the sheer guts of the rigging monkeys who had to go up in all sorts. At least I have a cast-iron stomach and was in the one-third of the crew that could keep their breakfasts in a force 12 ;-) <br><br>But there is a point to this reminiscing: there was a second wise old saw, handed out by an avuncular skipper (during the said force 12): 'No matter how bad things look, the ship is still the safest place to be around here'. Immersion suits and lifeboats are all well and good, but don't over-estimate your chances - which I think a lot of people seeking those metaphorical lifeboats are prone to do.<br><br>In other news, BP are laying off North Sea oil workers, yet on land the UK government is getting set to over-ride local planning authorities to force through approvals for fracking, as though they're quite unaware of the subtle popping sound coming from that sector across the Pond. If oil stays below $50 (which BP boss Bob Dudley expects may last 5 years or more), the economics of fracking will become increasingly quixotic. The political classes here are missing the point in a big way, clamouring to look tougher than each other on the energy suppliers by demanding gas and electricity price cuts, whilst ingnoring the obvious facts of the deflation which is driving the process. Politicians are clambouring over each other to give loudest vent to the entitlement tantrums which increasingly mark the 'popular will'. They're competing to make the most grandiose promises about maintaining extravagent privileges by punishing various scapegoats. Some ugly things are coming to the surface all around Europe.<br><br>I'll conclude with one final piece of mariners' advice: we were told to keep some important personal memento with our survival gear - be it a family photo, lucky charm, pocket Bible, or whatever else holds meaning. All else being equal, that simple element can make all the difference to your chances of survival.

These days, I don’t waste my limited time and energy throwing pearls before swine; I prefer preaching to the converted.<br><br>The marine metaphor resonates with me because I’ve spent 47 of my 70 years as a yacht sailor; 17 cruising full time around the Pacific on my 40 foot steel ketch. By pure chance, I’m currently re-reading Richard Henry Dana’s classic “Two Years Before The Mast” and just finished the chapter describing an epic 6 day storm off Point Conception (California’s Cape Horn).<br><br>More than once I’ve been in the kind of storms you and he describe, literally practicing the mariner’s rule, in full survival mode with no hope of outside assistence. “Beam me up Scotty“ was not an option (but was at times a lively fantasy). In the end, it was my own and my shipmates‘ skills, wits, luck, and a good solid boat that brought us through.<br><br>In my younger days as a UC Berkeley undergrad during the Cuban missle crisis, I was very tempted by the “Lone Ranger” fantasy. I had a boat at the local marina picked out to steal and use as a getaway/hideaway; even had a stash bag of gear and food packed and ready should the shit really hit the fan...<br><br>These days, older and maybe a bit wiser, living by choice in small town/rural New Zealand, in my own house with large garden, etc, I’m counting on the local community of like-minded folks to help each other during the storms to come and to enjoy whatever calm sailing there is in between. <br><br>Over the years I’ve acquired many practical skills which I freely share with friends and neighbors those who see their usefulness and genuinely want to learn. I lend my tools only to those who value things like a premium quality handsaw I bought 45 years ago and still use and know how to sharpen.

The problem, I fear, is that you are most likely preaching to the choir, and anyone who isn't listening, for whatever reason, is unlikely to start until it's too late.<br><br>Still, like you say, there are all sorts of ways for people to start doing something, wherever they might find themselves at the moment along the spectrum of collapse. I'm sure you'll have more suggestions as time goes on, and the great thing about this community is that, as more people become aware of it, the more we can learn from each other, and help each other work on our proverbial farms.<br><br><a href=#c4570742761582364495 title="comment permalink">1/22/15, 5:40 AM</a><br><br>

Yet folks get snarly when they talk about subsidizing alternative energy!<br><br>I currently am looking at alternatives, but am somewhat tied down with aging parents who need physical and emotional support for a few more years. Since my lottery tickets keep letting me down, that sort of limits my options of getting a home in the country in addition to my home in the city near the folks, etc. I have read most of the survivalist and preppie literature, and noted the cult followings of most of the authors with amusement. If, for whatever reason, there is a fairly rapid collapse scenario, I suspect only sociopaths will survive. After people have missed 20 meals straight in a row, they will cease to obey their socializing training and anything will go. If you look at a map, where in the US can you go that is more than a gas tank from a major metropolitan area? Nowhere! So you are forced to rely on community and sufficient stored resources for survival--the one hand for yourself and one for the ship metaphor worked out on land. And that will get you through a slow speed collapse scenario as well.<br><br>As an aside, I laugh at the folks who plan to do the Jeremiah Johnson thing and take to the hills. I live in Colorado, and knowing that the Plains Indians ate 2-1/2 to 4 pounds of meat a day, depending on activity levels, the entire game population of Colorado would last a month! There are real advantages to ranching and farming to sustain yourself! I predict cannibalism would ensue any rapid collapse among those who take to the hills......<br><br>Anyway, JMG, the one hand for yourself one for the ship metaphor has a pretty wide range of applicability.<br><br><a href=#c4927387744986391939 title="comment permalink">1/22/15, 6:02 AM</a><br><br>

If your plans to get the necessary property, equipment, and skills are well advanced at this point, you may still be able to make it, but you’d probably better get a move on. On the other hand, dear reader, if your rural retreat is still off there in the realm of daydreams and good intentions, it’s almost certainly too late to do much about it, and where you are right now is probably where you’ll be when the onrushing waves of crisis come surging up and break over your head."<br><br>That sounds about right to me. I'm 29 years old, and have been doing intensive organic vegetable farming and permaculture work for several years now. My dream has been to start a permaculture operation growing perennial medicinal and edible plants. <br><br>Unfortunately, I was bamboozled like many people of my generation into taking out a significant chunk of student loan debt many years ago to pay for an education that hasn't served my longterm interests. <br><br>I have learned a lot from my work on various farms and permaculture operations, but have obviously made very little money doing so. My skillset has grown significantly, but my debt has grown right along with it. <br><br>At this point it feels an impossibility that I should ever obtain land, even a modest parcel, let alone finance the beginning of an operation like the one I've envisioned all these years. <br><br>I've moved from rental home to rental home, trying to make ends meet while pursuing this self-directed education, but now feel completely stuck. And if what you are saying is true, then it is highly unlikely I will ever be unstuck. <br><br>Meanwhile, many of my peers in the young organic farming movement are in a similar situation: lots of skill and knowledge, lots of passion and commitment, but lots of debt and zero access to land or other resources as well. Our elders in the farming community tell us to work off our debts and build our credit with the intention of taking out loans for land someday. But we all know that with things the way they are that this is a futile road leading nowhere. That may have been an option for their generation, but it isn't an option for ours. Sometimes we joke among ourselves that we are likely to end up an entire generation of serfs. Now that the tremors of our time are growing in severity, the laughter is wearing thin.<br><br>I know there are far too many specific factors at play to make this a truly answerable question for you, but I can't help but ask you, admittedly with a degree of despair and desperation: is there anything to be done by people in our circumstances? We live at the mercy of landlords. Weatherstripping and installing solar water heaters don't feel like meaningful actions when we can be tossed out at any moment. And working on the land of other farmers feels just as unstable. Meanwhile, we know that there will be a higher demand for local produce in the times ahead. But how to meet that demand if we can't start new operations of our own? <br><br>Any and all insights or advice from you or other readers would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>With much respect, a landless farmer in Texas<br><br><a href=#c4887264590815774879 title="comment permalink">1/22/15, 7:01 AM</a><br><br>

That's one of many reasons why the agrarian lifeboat notion is a non-starter."</i><br><br>Pardon me if this seems a little absolutist. There are rare communities where people are already cooperating in growing things, trading things, assisting each other, watching each other's backs, etc.. I'm not talking about the "intentional communities", communes or somesuch (although they may be out there), but places that have typically been 'underserved' by the modern growth era, where informal economics have been practised for decades if not centuries, alongside whatever benefits the formal economy offers. <br><br>The ideas of making sure everyone gets fed; that many needs can be met without the complex, top-down, intermediary-populated systems; where a sense of entitlement is generally frowned upon, but where it simply isn't acceptable to de-humanise your neighbor whatever your differences; these aren't new ideas. In my area, the many small churches, along with family/inter-family ties provide a very real parallel structure underlying officialdom; a sort of redundancy many so-called communities have dispensed with.<br><br>Regarding <i>“One hand for yourself, one hand for the ship”</i>,, many families or partnerships in my area have this sort of arrangement; one person working in the formal economy while the other partner runs the homestead; bypassing the costs, liabilities, complexities, and intermediation of being fully immersed in our failing economy; having it both ways, in a sense. I think this is a sensible arrangement these days if it can be worked out. In my family's case, this situation was forced upon us (the 2008 crash did us a favour, it seems), and it's been working; no sense in changing that at this point.<br><br>I fully agree that if you haven't already been heating with wood for a while; if you haven't already been growing at least some of your food; if you haven't been practising food preservation; if you haven't been living with the water sources you plan to be living with permanently; if you haven't established cooperative relationships with others living a similar lifestyle; if you haven't been testing these things by living them, it's probably too late to begin. I fear this is most of you. Hopefully this community can suggest some strategies for those of you fully committed to things as they are. Remember that most folks who find themselves immersed in such changes manage to muddle through. In my way of thinking, muddling through successfully beats a long commute and spending a chunk of your life sitting in a cubicle somewhere. Ultimately, it's all in your mindset.<br><br><a href=#c8590733952676430763 title="comment permalink">1/22/15, 7:15 AM</a><br><br>

Huge swaths of the young population area currently out of work, and too many spend most of their time on the phone or computer. For many young people, if they have any money at all, a one-foot-in, one-foot-out approach might be the best: assist their local community with collapse and transition while/in addition to learning the essentials of food production. If farms are going to decrease in size from 1500 acres to &lt;100 acres, what we now think of as "intensive gardening" will be one of the most important skillsets in future agriculture.<br><br>I am attempting this path, apprenticing under an organic farmer during the summer and building connections around town the rest of the year. Organic agriculture ought not to be romanticized, as it can be quite horrific. Have your hands ever been orange-colored from squishing a row of potato bugs? For that matter, do you know the tiny prick of a potato bug on your fingers as its head bursts from its body? Imagine doing that every other day for the next 40 years of your life. It makes my feeble suburbanite stomach turn, but it is real life for real people.<br><br>There are still some good things about farming. I got to watch the farmer's son ride a small goat - a kid riding a kid! That made all the work that day worthwhile, and it made me push harder for that "rural retreat" even though time is short and biceps are weak.<br><br>Suburban people who are collapsing where-you-are: learn about the essentials of medicine and food while you can.

I wasn’t insinuating my friends/family don’t have a hard life – but it’s hard in the wrong ways; ways that won’t help them with what’s coming. My hard life will be a good practice, I think. But you have to change your attitude sharply, if you start resenting the daily grind (which seems to be a human habit; we all love novelty) then you cut corners and procrastinate and things don’t go well. To bring different attitude – one that is fully engaged in buttering bread and brewing tea, for example – is one way to smooth the bumps of practicing a new life.<br><br>JMG, to respond to your question – my other hand will be out teaching skills; I have a wide range of manual skills that I know, plus books of details that I’d be willing to share, hopefully in return for a little garden spading or help lifting bee hive boxes, etc. I’ve always been a jack of all trades, but that has the advantage of being able to creatively blend some of those skills when something odd goes wrong on the “homesteadette”. I also should be able to share veggie seeds of many kinds.<br><br>One thing to note is that usually you can’t pick your neighbors, so – especially in rural areas where getting to “like minds” is a drive – it’s good to learn to tolerate and work with them. I’d mentioned back a few posts that one crazy neighbor had slapped a lawsuit on me in order to take back an easement across her land; I held my ground legally but didn’t attack verbally – and last week she just out of the blue dropped the lawsuit before we had to go to court! She still won’t open the easement, but the county will take care of that fairly soon (long story). Now the 1-acre property on my other side is going into foreclosure and I have a pipe dream about grabbing it cheap and finding some young couple/group who are into organic gardening to work it for a low lease – there’s been 3 sets of druggie couples in that place since I got here, and I’m ready for a change! And also, since another neighbor wants to buy it and cut down the magnificent evergreens that I look out on every day! It’s probably not do-able, but I said that about my last property acquisition and that is going well… so who knows!<br><br>@Andy: I just started some mead this weekend! And it’s “muddling through mead” – two of my three beehives died (I’m amazed and proud that my self-built topbar hive still has a live colony of bees that wandered in, while the bought’n ones died) and I found about 10# of honey in frames. Not wanting to feed back to bees (just in case – dunno why they died) I harvested the sticky mess (I don’t have machines or gadgets) and in order to clean the tubs, poured hot water in to melt the honey, and also boiled up the bits of sticky comb in water. That, of course, suggested mead, so then I moved to filtering/bottling and adding yeast, and I have two gallons bubbling in the kitchen. Completely “scrap mead” except for some wine yeast, so this again is practice for when the far-away supplies dry up or are too spendy. I’ll let you know how it turns out. :-)<br><br>@MagicalThyme: Good luck with the horse and the loans! Sounds like a wonderful adventure!<br><br>@Rita: <i>The clean chicken coops all painted and low energy lighted is a nice experience but is it real????</i> <br>I agree. I often feel bad because my place already looks “post collapse” in that appearances take back seat to function – and I’m waiting for when the pressure pushes other so-called “earthies” to get real… OTOH, some people are just more energetic and have lots of extra time/money to invest in pretty… it may continue to be so.<br><br>PS – My copy of After Oil 2 came in, and the stories I’ve read so far are excellent!

I’d never thought about it this way, but the focus on learning, not letting yourself be ruled by passion and material attachment, and placing your value on the truths and experiences that can be found within yourself, and even that sense of being slightly apart from the rest of society are all adaptive strategies that have evolved alongside humans. Every culture has some group of sages or philosophers or monks or magicians or some combination of the above that stands slightly outside of the rest of society. Sometimes they’re feared and hated, sometimes they’re revered and honored, but they’re never completely accepted or seen as normal. Adopting the strategies you’re outlining here is something that pursued to its end looks very similar. And those people, as marginal as their lives may be, also hold the heart and soul of a civilization. If they lose everything, they’re not broken or bitter or incapable of action because the only things they had of consequence were in their minds and bodies. Attitude is an important part of survival… and someone who can lose everything and still smile, and most importantly still find ways to live a worthwhile productive life is also someone who is going to weather a crisis a lot better and carry more of value through.<br><br><a href=#c6845120074850496140 title="comment permalink">1/22/15, 9:12 AM</a><br><br>

Rather I feel a bit burned by this post. I hope you will try and address my points.<br><br>For starters I fall into the middle class agrarian dreamer category, which I freely admit. I'm not sure how other people have found this blog, but I came to it by continuing to explore ideas related to climate change, leading to peak oil, PCI, and finally here (if memory serves). So within the last four or five years. I imagine some large proportion of the thousands of readers you have are also in the middle class daydreamer camp.<br><br>If as you suggest it is too late to try and adapt to the future you see before us, then of what use is this blog and the various publications you have produced other than to provide comfort to your version of the righteous remnant who, long before reading your material, started the transition for themselves? I commented on your Dark Age America posts that it felt to me like a series meant to inspire your readers to take relish in the oncoming doom of the sinners of the world and take heart that "we told you so", like a bad horror movie allows its viewers to take joy in the violent deaths of the sexy cool kids. Is that what this is all about at the end of the day? <br><br>If there is no hope for me and those like me who haven't started in 2005 or 1985 for that matter, why publish a book like Green Wizardry which purports to be a handy guide to various tactics for living with LESS?

I have been thinking about the same thing. What if you have to bug out of your bug out? It's a damned uncomfortable thought. I have recently been practicing being comfortable with uncertainty, it's so tricky but, I think, one the ultimate adaptability tools. If or when things fall apart, can any of of know where we will ultimately land. In permaculture they say that the map is not the territory. Since buying our little farm, I have been learning this in spades. Things rarely pan out how you think they will and sometimes we end up with crazy abundances in strange places-like apples on the trees from July through December, really. Can we count on that next year? Who knows? And, if and when things go to hell, would it make more sense to pack my dogs and my husband and my chickens off to my againg parents' home to care for them and try to eke out a living there?<br><br><a href=#c8830349031306298988 title="comment permalink">1/22/15, 9:45 AM</a><br><br>

São Paulo, our biggest city, one of the biggest in the world with more than 10 million people, is slowly drying up all of it's stored water and will be without it in the near future (probably until the end of the year, but it's hard to predict. They are literally scrapping the bottom of the storage system for water, and that bad and poluted water in the bottom of reservoirs is what currently feeds the city).<br><br>A combination of factors lead to it, but the central issue is that the same political party governed (and still does) the state for the last 20 years. The policies responsible for water management followed neoliberal doctrine, which means privatization. That eventually lead to lack of investment and maintenance to pay off stock holders, and today 30% to 40% of the water is lost en route in the pipe network. There was a warning by specialists in 2003 that by 2010 the demand would not be met, but there was no effective response to it. No investments to increase storage, no efforts to curb consumption, no rationing took place, no campaings for rational use of water, no provisions, nothing. In 2014 the governor was reelected with 57% of the votes.<br><br>The weather did make the situation worse with a severe drought last year. There is not enough studies to link this particular case to climate change directly, but the hottest year on world record surely had something to do with it. In any case, we have one century of reliable climate data that could be used to statistically predict cyclic droughts, and nothing was done.<br><br>Add to the mix a media with a political project, protecting this same party from deserved criticism and open debate, and you have the current situation, in which massive layoffs, relocation of industries and exodus from the city is predicted and some of it already, and slowly, happening.<br><br>Bad political decisions will bite us back sooner rather than later.<br><br>I'm not sure if these news are current outside of Brazil, but don't be surprised when it comes.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Atilio<br><br><a href=#c6602479388523181419 title="comment permalink">1/22/15, 9:56 AM</a><br><br>

If you or any of the other readers have insights to share, they would be very much welcome.<br><br>As I contemplate the decline, collapse and my participation in the unfolding drama, I find myself pulled in two directions, not necessarily incompatible, but not necessarily aligned either. On the one hand, I am continuing to simplify and reduce my technological footprint, but I do live in a (small) town and not in the countryside. I have my community garden plot, my homebrew, and I am working on developing more skills along those lines.<br><br>On the other hand, I work at a municipal utility, and not just a regular city-owned utility, but one with a rather unique legacy. For the first fifty years of its existence, the city of Manitowoc had its own electric grid, completely separate from the national transmission network and has retained its generation capability. That legacy included some hefty manufacturing (e.g. submarine construction during WWII), no small feat. While we are now part of the larger network, we still have substantial energy producing resources and could, in part at least, power the city even if the rest of the country went dark. This is not a "solution" to decline, but it does provide a buffer.<br><br>In the 12 to 15 years remaining in my projected career here, I have the potential of moving into a role with some leadership authority. Do I invest this time and energy into the system, working to increase our robustness and independence (against the grain of the finances and economics, generally), in order to serve the public good and provide that public with a stronger resource than it might otherwise have?<br><br>I'd appreciate anyone's thoughts.

I don't disagree with the overall theme of your message, because I think you have been on taqrget with both my readings and experience. A point I would like to make is that there seems to be a greater awareness of our predicament than what existed with the Romans, Greeks, Mayans, etc., when these societies reached the stage we are at now. For example: .William Catton: Bottleneck 1980, Joseph Tainter: The collapse of Complex Societies 1988, Jared Diamond: Collapse - How societies choose to fail or succeed 2003, Richard Heinberg: The Party's Over 2004 (re: your instant comment in today's blog), William Simmons: Twilight in the Desert 2005 (predicting peak oil in 2005), Ted Trainor: Renewable Energy cannot sustain a renewable society 2007, Richard Heinberg: The End of Growth 2011. All of these authors and bloggers and many others, including your recent books, have predicted or commented on our current situation. What bothers me is that we are supposed to be homo sapiens not homo stupidus. If we are waiting for an almighty being to save us from our own stupidity we out of luck. I can't recall any historical "awful" event<br>that might have been altered or changed for the better by any divine (insert applicable religious deity) intervention. In fact, it would seem that we humans learn everything the hard way. <br><br>A secondary point would be that our interperson communication skills have improved markedly. We currently have the ability to publish written, internet and video materials that the .other collapsed civilizations did not have. If we ever get the courage to change our habits these skills should be able to bring people together for a common purpose. Whether or not these skills will last until the time they are needed is another matter. <br> <br>My experience consists of a home that faces south with 16kw of solar voltaic and 80 sq. ft. of hot water solar panels. We have a geothermal heating/cooling system and insulation galore. The home is all-electric but in the winter there isn't enough solar power to run the house in the manner of the so-called modern society. We have a backyard full of trees we planted 35 years ago that we use to help heat the home in the winter. We (wife and I) know that these preparations will not last beyond out lifetimes. If we were younger we would have started a garden, but at this point we both have brown thumbs.

In my case I just inherited (or, more accurately if less charitably, was the slowest among my tribe of cousins to say “Not it!” and make tracks for town).<br><br>I don't see how anyone can buy land and pay it off by farming it. In fact, one of the abiding puzzles of my life has been how my grandparents managed not only to do that, but also to put all their kids through college. I've gradually come to conclude that they were the exception; the rule being that most landholders through history must have been squatters and/or speculators or the descendants thereof. (John Opie makes a good argument for this in the case of the U.S. Frontier, both pre- and post-Homestead Act, in his book The Law of the Land.)<br><br>Our fretting about collapsing in place in the country tends to center around lack of numbers. We're scratching our heads a good deal lately over how we might contrive to share some of our abundant but none-too-fertile land birthright with others who are looking for soil to work. One idea is an open-term lease on 5-10 acres, paid in labor (say 10 hours a week) rather than cash or kind. The rest of the time you'd be establishing your dwelling and building up your garden soil, and holding down the job in town you'd likely need (at least for the first while). We'd be helping with tools, food, seeds/stock, and transportation. Anyone in (or willing to be in) the southern Plains whose ears perk up at the thought of hammering out details of such arrangement with us, please feel free to sing out to that effect.<br><br><a href=#c6432395932711100222 title="comment permalink">1/22/15, 12:30 PM</a><br><br>

Cities often have surprising amounts of vacant and abandoned land that could be guerilla permacultured. There are also residents' associations with land but no skills. There are (or could be, with some political pressure) urban allotment systems. In other words, it is more than possible to find a way to use your skills without buying the land yourself... Fact is, folk in cities need to eat, and are often stupidly looking at acres of useful land they don't know how to use. You do.

Some random ideas...<br><br>--Young people developing skills in farming and gardening: your work will be needed. You won't need to buy your own place, there will be thousands of farms that need strong hands to work the land once the tractors and combines are idled.<br><br>--Middle-aged middle-class professionals hoping to start that rural homestead: you are probably in for a rough shock, as your ability to build a homestead from scratch and feed yourselves simultaneously might be a nearly impossible task. You'll struggle with trying to maintain a certain level of comfort that you think is necessary, and you'll expend too much energy doing so. Better to downsize in place: learn to cook food from scratch, repair and sew your own clothes, live in a smaller space, get used to less heat and light, etc. By adapting to a lower energy lifestyle now you will be more adaptable to whatever living situation you find yourselves in once your current lifestyle becomes unsustainable. <br><br>--Anyone with chronic health problems probably won't be able to live in an isolated rural community. "Shelter in place" is going to be the order of the day, see above.<br><br>--For everyone: the "one hand for yourself" is going to need to reach out to many other hands. In other words, I think the best strategy has to include building alliances and community with other folks... Young folks, find older folks and vice versa. If you're estranged from your parents/siblings/children maybe it's time to figure out how to reconcile. If you don't have a family then find one to adopt. Too many post-apocalyptic and prepper fantasies focus on the lone individual or nuclear family, and that just doesn't work when crisis hits. You need help and protection, and that means learning how to get along with people whose politics/religion/worldview may be very different from yours. (The reality of moving to a rural community means learning to play nicely with rednecks.)<br><br>One scenario really gives me cold sweats: the very real possibility that millions of people, including myself, could find ourselves refugees-- and all that planning and prepping and homesteading will come to naught. I pray that doesn't happen to myself or my loved ones, but it's a possibility I keep in the back of my mind. In more paranoid moments I think about packing a small backpack just for that eventuality. <br><br>But then, at some point, I have to remind myself that no one knows the future and that I need to live as if my life will continue to be rich and rewarding, and that I will be able to adapt and even thrive in whatever circumstances present in the coming years. So I hope everyone else here can do the same, and we can all get a good night's sleep. Blessings!<br><br><a href=#c5473994705167291139 title="comment permalink">1/22/15, 1:37 PM</a><br><br>

And that’s the point, really – stop daydreaming and start taking steps, right now, today, to learn skills that will be helpful if things get 1) too expensive, 2) unavailable and you can’t just buy something off the shelf. Learn a skill and find out where you can trade it. There is a lively community happening in Portland, OR, for example, and that is a fairly large city. And I’ve seen marvelous articles online about mini-gardens in high-rise windows, using recycled jugs and piping – a totally cool hydroponic veggie garden!

My mom recently reminisced about how her family survived through the worst of the Depression, when her father lost his job and was out of work for some time. Her mother did laundry for a local dentist, for his dental business and his household as well, to keep a little money coming in. Meanwhile, her father raised much of the family's food in the backyards of their lot and the one next door, a typical city lot that for some reason had never had a house built on it. Her mother canned and fermented some of the food. They and their five children managed to survive in this way until her father got another job. I didn't ask my aunts and uncle about how it was when they were alive but I'll ask my mom what she remembers their saying to her about it the next time I see her (she may not have been born yet when this was happening).<br><br>To reinforce the point about collapse being uneven, during this same period of time and in the same city my paternal grandparents were running a successful regional chain of short-order eateries that they had begun in the 20s. They made enough money to buy a long strip of acreage on one of Michigan's glacial lakes, on which they built a vacation cabin. I and two siblings spent many summer weekends in the 1960s at that cabin with them and my parents. My paternal grandparents also bought property in Florida on which they built a house and a guest house where my family spent some winter vacations in the 1960s. But on the other hand, my mother's only brother made it through WWII intact, while both of my dad's brothers were killed late in the war. In fact my father was waiting for his orders to ship overseas when his second brother died, cancelling my dad's orders due to a recently-adopted policy that kept surviving sons stateside for the remainder of the war. That policy is why I'm here to write this.<br><br>It may have been that the harshness of the times made my parents and grandparents reluctant to talk about it. I know little beyond this of their lives during the Depression. Looks like a visit to the library is in order as well as finding out whatever I can from my mom, the only one who is still living. <br><br>Between us my husband and I will adapt as well as we can to the ongoing decline. We have already collapsed voluntarily to a degree and for quite a few years.

At times, Banished comes across like a lesson in fragility – that even a simple economy is a sum of interdependent parts, the failure of any one of which could spell catastrophe. More than once, it wasn’t really starvation or hypothermia that killed my village, it was a shortage of good tools: as the blacksmith struggles to keep up with demand for equipment, the workers’ tools wear out, the supply of timber and iron drops, and the blacksmith keeps running out of raw materials; meanwhile, his tools are wearing out too, and without much delay the production of food and firewood collapses and everyone dies.<br><br>Or it is demographics that slits your throat: a combination of epidemic and hunger manages to kill a disproportionate number of younger workers, and suddenly your population is unbalanced and failing to replace itself.

"Why insulate and weatherstrip someone else's house?" someone asked (maybe not in so many words). Many reasons: 1. it's your house while you're in it, even if not forever, and maybe you'll be there longer than you expect. Cut your operating expenses as soon as possible 2. the house will continue to demand less energy (from the finite planet we all share) after you've moved out. 3. you'll learn how to do the job, and maybe need to do it again. 4. you'll be leaving a gift for whomever comes after you. 5. you'll strengthen the supply chain for the materials (and tools, if you need to buy them) 6. a tenant who improves property may develop a valuable relationship with the landlord. <br><br>When I was an underemployed college student on summer break, I busied myself cleaning as much of the multi-unit rental property as I could reach (personal and common areas, landscaping). When the landlord noticed, he was so impressed that he hired me as the "resident manager", his on-site representative in all things, in exchange for RENT-FREE living as long as I wanted to stay. So I graduated flat broke, but not in debt.<br> <br>Similar arguments could be made for working a garden on rented land.

Take the idea of "home economics" seriously. Do the research, while the information is available, to work out adequate nutrition with minimum inputs. For example, you can culture your own bean sprouts at home. I assume that there's some nutritional benefit to eating sprouted beans rather than simply soaked and cooked, but haven't done THAT research. (More vitamins, perhaps, though fewer calories?) Learn to cook good meals with cheap ingredients, and you may find yourself cooking for more than just yourself (including folks who can pay you for it). <br> <br>I've read of prisoners on starvation rations, who claimed to have survived due to extensive chewing of their meals. "I chewed until there was nothing to swallow," was something like the way one put it. That would be a good thing to know in a crisis.<br> <br>If you could do nothing more than stay awake through the night, you might support your community by keeping the night-watch alert.<br><br>Drifting farther into a declining "post-mass-media" world, maybe someone would feed you in exchange for news of the wider world, exchanged overnight via low-power shortwave radio. Listen and take notes. In the early 20th century, people could make a living transcribing telegraphy for newspapers.<br><br>Personally, I've been buying at estate sales, potentially productive items (e.g., sewing machinery) for pennies on the dollar.

Learn the feeling of being a horse so they recognise you as one of their own . Rub him all over so he doesnt react to your touch .. They are mirrors ..they will reflect back to you everything that you are ...fearful , nervous , angry , crazy , calm , afflicted ..

We dont have three hundred million heavily armed crazies half of whom are holy rollers deeply divided along three main racial lines , no civil war wounds here ...

Learn a second language, if you live in the US, by all means, learn Spanish.

The vast majority of what's in <i>Green Wizardry</i> is still applicable, even if you've spent the five years you've been reading this blog daydreaming instead of getting off the sofa and into motion.

They have really gotten us thinking hard about our situation.<br><br>This last post really struck a chord with us. Like many others, my husband and I are in the midst of getting our collapse plan together. We believe we're OK job-wise, but we're not as certain about where we've ended up. We live in northern lower Michigan, which is an area mostly fueled by resorters, but it's where my husband grew up, so it's familiar. Unfortunately, though, you pretty accurately described us in this post when you mentioned people who are drawn to the homesteading, self-sufficient life in the country. That's us! <br><br>Three years ago we bought 16 acres about twelve miles outside of a small town (that is quite wealthy and geared toward those with money), and another 10 miles further from the larger, more humble town where we do all of our shopping. We've put three-and-a-half years into this place and done some hard work planting trees, getting gardens going, putting in a wood stove, raising chickens, etc., but it has become obvious recently that we're never going to grow much out here--the soils are too sandy (we're not far from Lake Michigan) and, as you mentioned, we just don't have the know-how or strength to do it. Plus, there's the obvious problem of being a long drive away from any amenities on roads that are already covered in filled-in potholes. <br><br>We've been hesitant to leave the place since we put so much into it and love the property. And it will set us back quite a bit if we have to sell this house, buy another, and possibly rent in between, not to mention tightening up the new one. <br><br>But we're seriously thinking of moving to the larger town and buying something within walking distance of everything. Luckily the real estate market here isn't too bad right now, though that may change sooner than we might like. My husband and I have discussed this many times but always seem to talk in circles. So we wondered if you or anyone else might have any thoughts. <br><br>Many thanks and kind regards, Kelly<br><br><a href=#c7079549566315403383 title="comment permalink">1/22/15, 6:16 PM</a><br><br>

I have been so surprised, first back in 2008, when they began resuscitating and then levitating the stock market and then as the years rolled by, how persistent they are in this course, even though it does almost nothing for most people. They seem intent on blowing the stock market bubble until the Dow is at 100,000 (only slightly kidding), and who is to stop them. If the want, the could print 10 trillion tomorrow and bid every dow stock up to infinity. <br><br>I might be making an extreme or even a silly case, but really, the fed pretty much is in charge. We really don't live in a democracy anymore - congress and the supreme court are just a minor sideshow. We "elect" (or the money primary "elects") a president, and he sort of appoints a fed board- but really the Wall Street Titans make there preference known, and the fed is the end all and be all. They are everything. This is a very sad state that our body politic has arrived at.<br><br><a href=#c9206223977658956973 title="comment permalink">1/22/15, 6:33 PM</a><br><br>

So when someone (anyone) throws out frustrated comments and questions, with little context, unfortunately others will try to guess and answers could get testy or off the mark.

But my reasoning is different enough that I guess I'm going to do it anyway.<br><br>I'm not completely convinced on the near-term crisis that our teacher seems more and more sure of. I'm not going to go into why, but it's just been claimed too many times, and I don't see enough evidence that this time is really different.<br><br>At 61, I think I'm likely to live to see some very bad times as the descent accelerates, but this year? Not willing to make major decisions based on it.<br><br>That being said, buying farmland and trying to scratch out a subsistence existence upon same is a bad idea. Not because it's too late, in my opinion. If anything, because it's too early, but mainly because it's just a really bad idea.<br><br>In times of severe economic and social hardship, farmers always suffer worse than anyone. My reasoning is mostly that through crisis, and sometimes because of it, there will always be government of some sort. And that government will do everything in it's power to keep things bearable for the constituencies that it fears. For the most part, those constituencies are in the cities, where they can mass together and make trouble.<br><br>Another reason, all of the good farmland is very expensive, and it is being farmed by big industrial operations to grow commodity crops. For better or worse, the stuff most of the population, and a big chunk of the world, eats. Got a million dollars? Then you could afford about 250 acres here in the Mississippi Delta if you could find a parcel that small. Maybe 100 acres in the Midwest.<br><br>Sure, you can find smaller parcels of thin, rocky soil on steep slopes. Might even have an acre or two of good bottom land where you could put a kitchen garden. Somewhere in the $100K range.<br><br>If you are dead set on a rural lifestyle, I would recommend moving to a small town and getting a job at least peripherally related to agriculture. Anything. If you are young, you will probably see some pretty big dislocations while you can still act on them. There will be opportunities to pick up land at good prices, but you won't know about them unless you are in the "field" so to speak. Get yourself in a good cash position (save every penny that comes your way) and keep your eyes open. In the long run, it is one of the best things you can have.<br><br>I have to laugh when I see people thinking big agribiz is going to go away soon. Every ounce of government policy will be aimed at keeping the big operators going.

The result, as in 2008, is that the big banks and the financial industry will stay afloat, and another big chunk of people in the middle class will drop into permanent poverty -- the working class is already there. My take, though, is that that's going to be enough to push the ongoing economic contraction into higher gear, sending the non-financial economy into a tailspin of contraction, and gutting the capacity of the US to maintain infrastructure above Third World levels.

Let me share some of what I know about canalling. I know in the past you've mentioned canals.<br><br>I'll include years so you know what era I am referring to. I'll name first names so I can keep the story making sense. All of this takes place in New York State and Quebec, unless otherwise noted. One of my 2nd great-grandfathers, Jacob (1810-1890) was a farmer in Clinton County, New York. Four of his six sons [including my great-grandfather Rufus (1850-1940)] and the one daughter (with husband) made canalling on Lake Champlain and Champlain Canal (shortened to Lake Champlain) their livelihoods, between New York City and Montreal, one way or another. My grandfather Isaiah (1890-1970), sixth of seven kids, grew up on a canal boat. By the age of twenty, he knew everything about the canal boat; he was a jack-of-all-trades. When Isaiah returned from World War One, canalling was defunct. He became an electrician, working for a large industrial corporation in upstate New York, and of course, got caught in the Great Depression of the 1930s.<br><br>Canallers on Lake Champlain transported goods from the northern hinterlands from Montreal to New York City, but there was also a lot of activity coming and going from ports along the Hudson River. The captains had long, thin, shallow boats. I think most rented boats; you had it made if you owned your own boat.<br><br>As a family historian, I tried to understand what life was like for canallers. Except for my family, I had never heard of it. One excellent book is "Life on a Canal Boat: The Journals of Theodore D. Bartley, 1861-1889" ed. By Russell P. Bellico, 2004, Purple Mountain Press, Fleishmanns, New York; Lake Champlain Maritime Museum, Vergennes, Vermont.<br><br>Tidbits: A man had to know a lot of general mechanical stuff. There was a lot of manual labor involved—lifting goods, repairing the boat, and the like—, but less labor than farming. Whole families lived on the boats. Childrens' education was mainly from November to April, when ice grounded the boats. The captains had to know how to deal with insurance because collisions were frequent. A captain had to know the terrain of the banks of the canal/river/lake he was on—where to get supplies; physical hazards. He had to know weather. He had to know how to sail a sailboat. He had to know how to treat laborers kindly, because much of the hard labor, he hired day laborers to do. I assume the boat had a heat-source—a stove? There had to have been a kitchen on board. I think horses were used on towpaths. As with any business, you had to do bookkeeping, be basically honest, and pay your bills. A man's word was his bond.<br><br>If you find a map of the U.S.'s canals, hundreds of canals crisscross the entire U.S.—I never knew. The Erie Canal was merely the most famous. Canals predated railroads by roughly fifty years. As far as I know, New York State has kept many canals operational.<br><br>As for temperature, Lake Champlain is far enough north to be, overall, quite cold—at least it used to be when I lived near there in the 1960s. (I wonder if boats have the option of having some sort of cooling.)<br><br>I can't remember details but think John Michael wrote that canalling may come back in a downturn, not necessarily as a canaller oneself but as part of canallers' ecosystem on shore. Or combine part-time canal stuff with part-time farming.<br><br><a href=#c1306195679087895457 title="comment permalink">1/23/15, 2:38 AM</a><br><br>

As a kid I heard his best known work <i>Rural Rides</i> read aloud on the radio, and anyway was cycling round the same English countryside – not dramatically changed then from when William made his rides on horseback in 1829. He was a colourful opinionated political radical but importantly an expert commentator on the farming of his day. (We now know there had been a revolution in organic farming methods in Britain over the preceding 80 or so years before his time that was able to accelerate the renewing of soil N. )<br><br>His essay describing his ride in the <i>Valley of the Avon</i> has lived with me my adult life. First to say that the wider area has been farmed for several thousand years and is covered with monuments and burial mounds of previous civilisations further back beyond the Romans as we are this side of that Empire. As Cobbett recounts meticulously, the Vale itself is dotted with mediaeval churches and manor houses. This is a most favourable farming area. One of the reasons the Romans annexed Britain as a new province was that this part of England had been trading surplus grain into the Empire via Gaul for a good while.<br><br>Cobbett ranted against the exploitation in 1829 of those working this beautiful land. This was crunch time for the British rural economy and its relationship with our extending trading empire and with Britain’s growing foundation of industry and urban population. Cobbett calculates that 100 families of labourers grow enough to feed fifteen times that number; “yet those who do the work are half-starved”. Given better food, what he calculates as sufficient for nutrition, the labourers of the Vale would still be feeding five times their own number.<br><br>These could be reasonable ‘bench marks’ for favoured areas (check out your Liebig Minima). However, I note that the present money value of primary agricultural production (calories &amp; protein) is only a small part of the retail cost of food - both in energy and money - in the form most of us eat – true for USA as well as Britain. I guess that means that families producing food and even raiment, even ‘organically’ and self-renewably, must, in the here-and-now and in foreseeable decades, live half-in and half-out of the modern economy, as GHung points out in his comment above.<br><br>best<br>Phil<br><br><br><a href=#c6293297942709828551 title="comment permalink">1/23/15, 4:56 AM</a><br><br>

The news "The Beverly Hillbillies" scene came up, a farmer had hit sweet crude. The state government the next day capped it and prevented the farmer from claiming it under what ever act, it was on local news which was odd. Now that was back in the 1980's some time I was a child. I have memories from 18 months even younger, from about 4 I remember most things I see and hear, I know, I'm weird. <br><br>Anyway, the same thing happened all over, I know from farmers the reserves in NSW have been tapped for a few years now. <br><br>I also have a mate who's in the petroleum industry and just retired, another Vietnam vet,the amount of diesel oil still available is pretty large, enough to bring diesel down to $AUS1.00. I have coal miner mates, If Australia cut our exports we'd have 1000's of years worth alone, some boast 600 to 700 years globally. This is not disclosed for profit margins... Gotta know how the big mines work to play them. Kalgoolie will be the next big one when the mega mine closes, and a larger deposit is suddenly found. Ahh local knowledge you can't beat that with a silver tongue. <br><br>Where I live alone within 100km there's 3 gold mines old ones small operations, if they could they'd strip mine this whole area down to the granite water table. It's that rich. Untapped 2km by 20km coking coal seam. largest untapped Zn Sl Pb deposit known in the world. <br><br>Thing is we're the most conservative region, so if the frackers come the "close the gate alliance" would be hell water here and it makes me smile. :-)<br><br>Oh I also enjoy a Japser field on my property, so I have thunder eggs, Geodes the size of a Bull head, plus lots of hand size and smaller. Literally that's what I find around the dam, and in the paddock when the stones arise. :-) The very rare diamond and sapphires happen in this area too. I live in the cheapest, lowest socio demographic in QLD. <br><br>Funny story how it came to be the cheapest land to, all thanks to feral Prickley Pear cactus pest. It's a kicker. <br><br>Any way another tangent. My country has always been a swing country, geo politically that is.

That's kinda absurd. That is what elite athletes consume during their intense training phases (and some of them still get fat off of it despite the intense effort). And what makes you think that there is anything unusual about farming, in this regard. In a truly post-petroleum world (which nobody reading this blog will live to see), almost EVERYONE is going to have to work just as hard as the farmers. You are going to have to be doing something useful, or why would anyone share the fruits of their own hard work with you? And with the exception of a small number of people who will be involved in more intellectual activities, that will mean manual labor, and a lot of it. Hauling wood to heat the house is hardly going to be a uniquely agrarian activity -- houses in the cities ain't gonna be heated by fairy dust, ya know. <br><br>I suggest taking another read through "Star's Reach," and then tell me how many people are not employed in physically demanding trades. Scholars, politicians, wizards, other clergy, and the like. Not a big segment of the population. True the readers here might be more likely than average to wind up in one of those trades, except we'll all have long since died before the oil wells and coal seams are truly tapped out. <br><br>The wilderness/rural/small town/city choice is a matter of your own inclinations, and what sorts of stresses and satisfactions you personally prefer. None of these options is inherently easier than the others, they're all gonna leave you tired and dirty. And vulnerable to crime, depending on the nature of your community.

This is probably obvious to most readers of this blog, although most people in the USA do not make the connection between fitness and survival. I hope that in a viable future there will be a place for elderly and for those with a condition that limits their physical ability, maybe teaching the young or doing the more sedentary work. This would be a return to the way of our ancestors before we segregated ourselves by generation and kept the old people out of sight.<br>For most of us, being out of shape is not an option. Being able to walk a few miles on hilly terrain to run errands, for example, should be easy. Doing moderately physical work for days on end, without wearing down, will be necessary. This will be more demanding than being a "weekend warrior," because most of us will not be going back to our sedentary jobs during the week to recover. <br>As JMG and others have made clear, one result of the LESS life is that our bodies will be supplying more of the energy. This will be true whether we live in a city or a farm or in the wild.<br>I hope I am not being too didactic in saying the obvious because I do think most readers of ADR are well aware of this, but fitness is a crucial part of our preparations along with skills and community. <br>The time to be in shape is now.<br><br><a href=#c635983323786013506 title="comment permalink">1/23/15, 8:12 AM</a><br><br>

Learn as much about food as you can. Learn to cook, learn to can, learn to ferment, learn to preserve, learn to store food without refrigeration, learn what's edible that grows locally. We are accustomed to getting our food out of the rear end of an industrial supply chain, making us ignorant of where it came from and what went into it. <br>Most of the food advice we now get has to do with avoiding excess calories because of an inactive lifestyle. A post-industrial lifestyle will most likely involve a lot more physical exertion, mostly a lot more walking which burns a surprising amount of calories. Fat will again be a desirable food, not something you pour down the drain. With food being scarce and more of it being locally sourced, and little of it having an expiration date stamped on it, we will learn that a lot of food stays edible a lot longer than we thought. Milk left overnight will turn solid but still be edible in a new form called yogurt. Why do Mediterranean diets have so much yogurt in them? Because they have to do something with all the sour milk.<br>One of the biggest lessons for me personally about food is how much work it is to prepare from scratch. Though I've always cooked and gardened, most recently, my wife and I have had the good fortune of being able to do most of our work from home. This puts us into the position of being able to raise some of our own food and also to take the time to go to the farmers market every week. On Fridays, during peak season, we typically come home with forty pounds of produce, a mix of fruits and vegetables. Some of it we can, some of it we pickle, some of it we cook and eat that week. Making a dinner from scratch can easily take three hours. There's the washing of greens, trimming, then cooking, then cleaning up the kitchen. Preparing food from our garden takes even more time because even if we ignore the time put into raising the food, picking and cleaning takes more time than buying already picked and cleaned food from the farmer's market. <br>All of this may seem obvious to most people intellectually, but until you do it, it's hard to appreciate it fully. I continually come to the point where I say to myself, where did the afternoon go? Did I really just spend three hours fixing up a pot of beans and a bowl of boiled greens?<br><br><br><br><a href=#c7959347250246907200 title="comment permalink">1/23/15, 8:17 AM</a><br><br>

I grew up on a farm (not far from where JMG lives now) and have lived a rural lifestyle for most of my life. I can tell you from personal experience that the survival homestead route is not for everyone. Farming is a tough way to go, even with modern machinery. Assuming that subsistence farmers will have to notch down in equipment at some point, be prepared to work -- hard.<br><br>I think the most important things are forming strong relationships with your neighbors, developing skills that will be useful over the long haul, and making some basic preparations (having a wood stove if appropriate, or a home that takes advantage of passive solar heating comes to mind). <br><br>Right now we can live a gloriously free-from-our-neighbors lifestyle because plentiful energy is equivalent to having many servants (slaves?). As energy becomes more expensive -- and it will at some point -- we will not be able to afford to "keep so many slaves". We will once again have to fall back on our communities to obtain life's necessities. Having good relations with that community and skills useful to it will go a long way toward a more secure community and a happier, more productive life.<br><br><a href=#c7238881615916401531 title="comment permalink">1/23/15, 9:52 AM</a><br><br>

I found that, with a few expenses up front and some skull sweat, it could. <br><br>The first order of business is a car or other suitable vehicle. Not an RV, and not an obvious rustbucket. You don't want the kind of vehicle that looks like it's got a sleeping vagarant inside, even though you will be sleeping in it.<br><br>Next is a sleeping bag rated to a temperature slightly lower than the lowest on record for your area. There are sleeping bags that keep mountaineers alive on Everest. You don't need heat while you're in one of them. <br><br>Next, a membership in a health club that is open very early and very late. This is where you keep clean and well groomed. (Not necessary if your employer has a shower you can use.) Weather permitting, one of those solar shower bags you hang from a tree can also be useful.<br><br>A mail drop. Private ones (not at the post office) sometimes call their boxes "suites" or "units", which allows you to maintain the illusion of a street address.<br><br>Storage for those of your possessions you don't need to have with you daily. Ideally it will offer 24-hour access.<br><br>Regarding food, I'm sure you already know whether you are the type who can live on sandwiches made from supermarket ingredients with no need to heat anything or whether you absolutely must have something hot every day. There are a wide range of nomadic-appropriate kitchen tools, from solar cookers to 12-volt blenders that plug into a car's cigarette lighter. <br><br>Once you've bought all that, you will need to develop some knowledge of your local area; overnight parking rules that tell you where you can sleep (Don't use the same spot more than a few nights running); locations of free power, wifi and phone connectivity; the public library (An indispensable resource). <br><br>Yes, I have lived this way at various times in my life, which allowed me to do more traveling than I would otherwise have been able to afford. It did get old after a while, but for a few months at a time, it was entirely workable, and the money saved was just enormous.<br><br><a href=#c8650042430934996624 title="comment permalink">1/23/15, 10:39 AM</a><br><br>

Previously we had interned and made mistakes on other people's land for 5 years. Our goal is to make a living farming. My wife works full-time on the farm and I work 'off-farm' telecommuting. I am well down the road of agrarian living.<br><br>Here's some of what I've learned:<br><br>In many rural areas collapse has been happening openly for decades. Our non-cash-crop real-estate market is stagnant and collapsed. Our employment is dropping, our school enrollments are dropping, our municipal funds are dropping and all have been following this trajectory for years and years. I hope it is these conditions that may provide the mental and emotional resiliency of rural people to live through difficult times with their dignity and humanity intact. There is still a passible community spirit in even the smallest of towns with fall fairs, seasonal parades and service clubs events.<br><br>I have been building an incredible array of skills over the years. Having grown up in the wonderland of perfect suburbs my toolbox - both metaphorically and physically - was nearly bare. At some point though the need for physical skills (building, animal husbandry, food production, forestry, etc.) were surpassed by the need for emotional and spiritual skills.<br><br>Maybe this perspective is a product of how far down the road I've gone but my advice to people is to work on your emotional resilience with at least equal attention that you give to you physical resilience. Who you are at the level of identity, deep, deep down is going to unravel. This will lead you to take actions that are unrecognizable to yourself right now. Just like there is a useful 'collapse early' strategy for our physical beings we need to also apply this to our psychophysical beings as well. <br><br>Let me tell you that self-sufficiency is an oxymoron. It is not possible to be self-sufficient without incredible compromise. Self-sufficiency is a fantasy who have never worked hard for years. The pain and difficulty of navigating human relationships is far more palatable and rewarding than 'going it alone.' You will always rely on someone for something, embrace it. <br><br>Community is my best hedge against uncertainty and I actively build, foster and participate in my community not only for the pleasure it brings right now but also for the resilience and pleasure I believe it will provide in the future. The bonds of friendship, trust and care may not weather the storms ahead, the inclination to 'save ourselves' is incredibly strong in our culture. But having community gives you options. If we lose our farm to the bank I know it's a possibility that we can share a home and farm with community members to spread the pain out.<br><br>Communication skills will continue to be among the most important skills you can have. That means listening, speaking AND not-speaking. Collapse is not simply about transporting yourself and family into a new place you must be willing to be transformed by that place. Start where you are at. <br><br>We will all be humbled by the road ahead.<br><br><a href=#c1216357859756141576 title="comment permalink">1/23/15, 2:21 PM</a><br><br>

The following description, in light of your ongoing discussion of the future, looks like it may repeat. My shock was that I have never seen the described condition, and desperately hope to never see it. The page number references are to the paperback book.<br><br>Page 162 “Compared to New Orleans, most of the inland town of the new Deep South [where cotton was planted after the tidewater soils were depleted] were sordid villages. Apologists would say that men were in too much of a hurry on or near the frontier, wherever it might be, to have time for good manners, but both Yankee Americans and European visitors made scathing comments about the behavior of the inhabitants of the South. Compared to the fiction of some novels, the truth is unrecognizable. The white men were generally unclean, the women of any age worn by circumstance and childbearing. The untidiness, the ragged clothes, the assault upon the senses of unwashed poor whites and slaves alike made any antebellum assembly an experience which would disgust the people of an age accustomed to soap, detergents, running water, and deodorants.<br><br>“Even in the 1930s, the region provided an adventure for the Northerner, but before the Civil War malarial mosquitoes were prevalent, yellow fever and typhoid were visiting familiars. Salmonella, worms, and dysentery were common, particularly among the slaves. For all, black and white, enteric disorder was a constant companion. Heat unrelieved by the benefits of electricity was endured in the summer, along with storms and rain. Ice was only available in New Orleans and then usually only until mid-April, unless shipped at vast expense from the icehouses of the North. Pure water was at a premium in every built-up area. Sanitation was sketchy and added to the stink and discomfort in an age which was innocent of any knowledge of germs, painkillers, or infection. Disinfectants were unknown. Manufactured soap was in short supply. Food, cooked by slaves sometimes disaffected and not always skilled, was variable, often disgusting. Deficiency diseases were endemic in a land of plenty. If this was civilization, it was very raw. On the other hand, survivors of this society were toughened by their experience.”<br><br>Page 163: “There were habits which failed to commend themselves to the stranger, such as regional addiction to tobacco and corn whiskey, of which the first was the less pleasing. Other people smoked or sniffed the weed—Southerners chewed, they not only chewed, they spat. . . .<br><br><a href=#c1676923518121345604 title="comment permalink">1/23/15, 2:34 PM</a><br><br>

It's called de 5x5 rule:<br><br><b>Grow 5% of what you eat within 5 meters of where you sleep.</b><br><br>The main benefit in my opinion is that you can get moving *now* and get past the worst of the learning curve without falling into despair about not being able to feed yourself (many of us who enjoy privileged Western lives can certainly do with just 95% of the food we could theoretically afford). The second best benefit is that by constraining yourself to a 5 meter sphere (you thought I was going to waste prime solar roof-state??!), you learn to get really creative with what you can or cannot get away with.<br><br>I am well aware that if push comes to shove and we face a fast collapse scenario, this will just ensure that my family will starve a little more slowly than everyone else. That risk I can assume.<br><br>On the other hand, it will do lots of good if we continue to experience the fractal collapse of food supplies I have been observing for the last 5 years: Lost crops of fruit due to nasty Asian larvae in Colima (fruit keeps coming from Veracruz price doubles), avocado supply gets cut by Templar Knights war band (price spikes for a couple of weeks, then supply is mysteriously restored at +50% markup), poultry gets hit by new flue strain government -&gt; ordering preemptive sacrifice and destruction (old frozen stocks of imported chicken hit the market at triple price, then new generation of local poultry gets raised, but prices fail to go back all the way to the original), etc, etc.<br><br>I could keep going about this, but the central idea is that we do not wake up one day and find there's no food anymore. While I am open to think that this could happen, a more immediate risk is being priced out of the high quality foodstuffs and pushed more and more into eating cheap junk. For many years, a standard blue collar breakfast has been dubbed canard a l'orange: a twinky like cake named "gansito" (lit. little goose) and a can of orange soda. It is crap, but is relatively cheap and available in every mom and pop store. It also gives you the calories you need to go through a morning of moderate physical labor.<br><br>Or maybe I am just in the bargaining stage of grief, but I suspect it will be much easier for me to go from 5x5 -&gt; 10x10 than from zero -&gt; anything.<br><br><a href=#c3604316027509877195 title="comment permalink">1/23/15, 4:43 PM</a><br><br>

Because you are incorrect. <br><br>(1) agriculture and civilization developed over ~10,000 years of fairly temperate and consistent climates. The increased temperatures anticipated now, based on the CO2 already in the atmosphere and the continued use of fossil fuels, are more than agriculture and civilization have had to deal with, and are more likely than not to cause massive disruptions in climate and our world. Pay attention to droughts, floods, and forest fires. <br><br>(2) plants and animals have adapted to changing temperatures in the past, but over millennia, not a couple of centuries, which is what's happening now. Read up on the five major extinction events in earth's history to find out what happens when the climate changes too quickly. Wikipedia's a good place to start: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event but there's lots of information available. Elizabeth Kolbert's book, The Sixth Extinction, should IMO be required reading. BTW the sixth extinction event is happening now.<br><br>Here's the place to start on SkepticalScience: http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-positives-negatives-basic.htm<br><br>And then if you still think warmer is better, well, just be careful what you ask for: you may get it.<br><br><a href=#c7836075800311295577 title="comment permalink">1/23/15, 7:52 PM</a><br><br>

Perhaps some of your perennial crops will supply this, but if this type of lifestyle becomes common, there are going to be a heckuva lot of apples and blackberries around.<br><br>The solution in former times was to grow food that stored well and could be transported to cities where there was a hefty market for them. Cereal grains, dairy products, and livestock fit the bill quite well, depending on one's proximity to markets. <br><br>But this is where the serious work begins. Right now, it's doable because we have our energy slaves. I'm guessing that 40 or 50 years down the line, though -- and perhaps much sooner -- we're going to be living on a much tighter energy budget than we are now. I don't necessarily expect us to have to revert to a 19th century lifestyle -- I do believe that substantial gains in energy efficiency are possible.

Yes, we'll be talking about canals at some length in a bit; it so happens that Cumberland was a big canal town back in the day -- the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal got this far up from Washington DC before it ran out of money, and so canal boats used to go down the C&amp;O from here to DC with cargoes of coal, lumber, steel, and agricultural products, and bring back manufactured goods and imports from the coast. If the railroads hadn't come along, the C&amp;O would have snaked through the mountains to the Youghiogheny River, then followed that down to Pittsburgh, linking the Chesapeake to the Ohio valley. It may do so yet someday. <br><br>Berserker, thank you and welcome to the apparently huge Aussie contingent here! <br><br>Phil, thanks for the reminder. I'll check Cobbett out. <br><br>Craig, once the US starts going down visibly, I expect to see all its putative allies bailing out in short order, and for good reason. For some reason US culture is blind to the really rather obvious point that you earn loyalty from subordinates by showing loyalty to them; we demand a lot and offer very, very little, and make up the difference by holding our "allies" more or less at gunpoint. That's not a strategy with an indefinite shelf life. <br><br>Shane, I have no doubt that the South will rise again, in a sense. It's been treated as an internal colony by the rest of the country since 1865, and once that breaks down, after the dust settles, there may be significant improvements -- just as there will be in large parts of the Third World once most of their wealth isn't being extracted for the benefit of the global North. Of course that's not the kind of rise that comfortable Northerners like to think about...<br><br>Dave, that's been discussed in the scientific press for a while. Might it happen? Sure -- in which case we're in for an even nastier climatic whiplash when the minimum ends. <br><br>Other Tom, just remember that "good physical condition" doesn't necessarily mean "fashionable body shape," or "free from physical disability." <br><br>Wolfgang, good heavens -- you must have some very complicated recipes. We cook beans in a slow cooker or fireless cooker, and greens take maybe ten minutes of prep before they go into the steamer. My working rule is that a meal should take no more of my time to make -- leaving out the time it sits and cooks by itself, in which I can do other things -- than it does for me to eat it. I follow that rule religiously, and eat an almost entirely homecooked diet.<br><br>Dfr, well, you're not really the target audience of this post! I don't worry that much about those who already get it; it's those who still think of the Long Descent as a subject for daydreams about someday living in a lifeboat ecovillage who get one last hard shake, before I shake my head and walk on by. <br><br>Ellen, the sense of desperation is the one thing in the Hackstable scenario that I find appealing. They may just be starting to realize that they can't count on things holding together enough to keep the internet going; once they really grasp that, and start trying to hack the future using the resources they're actually likely to have handy, we'll be talking the same language.<br><br><a href=#c7556485474128610722 title="comment permalink">1/23/15, 10:19 PM</a><br><br>

Power out everywhere--esp. meaning no a/c in August and nothing to do. <br>After a day or so, bored I was looking at the window and realized, why I am sitting here like a moron when I could at least go outside and do the maintenance guys' jobs and remove the tree branches from the sidewalks, parking lot, etc. Within an hour--with not a word from me--at least 40 other people showed up, doing the same thing and even diving into the large pool and removing huge branches that required 10+ people to lift out.<br>The point: people will sit around and do nothing until someone gives them the idea of how to move forward. Later that night, people were pulling stuff out of their refrigerators and taking it down to the condo's barbeques so all could eat before the food went bad. A little forethought in a disaster can make things make easier. Helpfulness to neighbors--even if you don't know them now--is no question the more important quality.<br><br><a href=#c1486651629156467985 title="comment permalink">1/23/15, 11:44 PM</a><br><br>

And up north on this continent there have been big rainfalls over the past few days on both the west and east coast. Wow, it is really crazy wet up there!<br><br>One recurring meme that turns up here time and time again is that farming is somehow really hard back breaking work. I wonder if you have any thoughts on the history of that meme?<br><br>The reason that I ask, is because mostly the plants look after themselves and what I reckon people confuse as hard work, is actually not hard work at all. The thing is, farming tends to bind a person to the land and what people confuse as hard work is actually the difficulty of escaping life on a farm. For example, if you have chickens, you can't necessarily escape for a couple of weeks holiday down the coast as someone has to do all of the things chickens require to be kept in the artificial systems that we humans maintain those animals in. Most of the other systems are the same here, they require a little bit of maintenance from time to time, but it cannot be ignored.<br><br>I spend very little time maintaining the systems here as it is the infrastructure that takes most of my time. And people just don't seem to get that point because of the pervasive belief of the meme of hard work.<br><br>The other thing is that machines on farms often do a lot of work, but using the machines also increases the risk of injury for a farmer - just because those machines can do that much more stuff.<br><br>Dunno, but it has just got me feeling confused.<br><br>PS: I hope the book final edits, drafts and reviews are all going smoothly.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c5625296205285429474 title="comment permalink">1/24/15, 2:47 AM</a><br><br>

With practice the body goes on automatic. It is like meditation. <br><br>Reading spengler I believe he has no idea about deeper indian being. <br><br>He speaks of attitude of grecoromans, character of westerners. It sounds to me like he is comparing teenagers to adults. Westerners have a will, a singular drive, grecoromans were passive victims of circumstance whose only identity came in the group.<br><br>I think his comparison of india to the grecoromans, i.e. living in the moment, is wrong. I see Indian philosophy, culture, to take my analogy further, is like an old man. In the west we are active, determined, analytical, controlling. The middle ages was superstitious, magical. In my analogy this might be the young adult, in love. The middle aged, mature culture, action, drive, etc. is the West. India is only externally passive. When the internal and external space and analysis of the West is integrated to the childish body focus of the greeks and the magical internal life of early eastern religious life we get an all <br>enompassing indian view, where with yoga, one integrates the whole. One sees that character of Westerners causes life events, is however, as much a mask as attitude of greeks. That magical spiritual internal life will be analyzed by psychology, but not done away with, i.e. controlled, but expanded over time through 'scientific' spiritual practice. The body is an expression of spiritualbody, chakras, of whom the dormant person is aware of at rare moments of deep emotionality. The awakened person feels it constantly. To speak of western willpower, analysis, striving as maturity, while body-magic focus on here and now being immature may be true but the next step is the discovery of the reality in the internal space and its relation to space-time, will, karma.<br><br>Spengler helps me to clear up all sorts of preconceived notions collected over time and reorder my thoughts as he is learned. However I have a different experience which he does not account for. I cannot thank you enough for reccomending such books. <br><br>Of course once we learn survival we must pass on the most important things. I heard speculation that Jesus and wherever he was taught plus his followers were really like yogi initiates or buddhas, that gnosis direction was more his direction. We will never know as the Romans, body oriented, authoritarians, co-opted this mystical poverty religion from the east, defanging it of secret initiation rites which gave it power to individuals. This power, similar to proposed local currencies, cooperatives, decentralization, is what TPTB always fear. The priests preach a sermon of fairy tales without power, hence the protestant breakaway, founding of holyroller healer pentecostals in USA at turn ofcentury revival, renewed interest in eatern religions since 60s. Centralization of power, money,spiritual, etc. leads to empty mimicry. Freedom is individual, hard won, on farm every day or in spiritual practice. <br><br>Books, techniques important. First principles come from our self. Rediscovering, reinventig wheel is however stupid. Keep guruing us down the slippery slope.<br><br><a href=#c2562929309036730064 title="comment permalink">1/24/15, 2:56 AM</a><br><br>

Daily life in the farm for a peasant was probably not very different, at least not until the barbarians/robbers crashed through the front door of course.<br>We on the other hand have to reinvent the wheel. Industrialization was a pretty disruptive affair with no shortage of bottlenecks, crises and IIRC entire professional categories being made obsolete almost overnight. And that with expanding wealth providing some sort of cushion. Going through that in reverse gear? Nasty is too light of a word IMHO. <br><br>Nor I am sure if there are really any current models. North Korea was probably saved from implosion and even more massive mass death by foreign help and is currently propped up by Chinese supplies. And now that the venezuelan subsidy line is looking increasingly dodgy Cuba is going back to the US. Russia was probably saved from breakdown by oil prices rising just in time.<br><br>"What do they do after the "last ditch"?" <br><br>Good question. The EU is hanging on by bureaucratic inertia and some of the member states are in dire straits. For example Italy economy, save for a period of zero point something growth around 2010-2011 has been contracting almost non stop since the start of the crisis (and had been underperforming for much longer).Official youth unemployment rate at 43% and still climbing. Emigration has started again but how long places like Germany can act as safety valve? Not very long one suspects. Greece is even worse off. In fact I tend to doubt that the US is in such a bad position in relation to everybody else as many here make it out to be.<br><br>OT, there are actually accounts of inexperienced sailors refusing to go on top during battles. Experienced types refusing to do their jobs during storms seem a lot less likely to be an issue however and if a crew screwed up during a storm they would go to the bottom with little chance of it being preserved for posterity.<br>But I am not a naval historian just a dabbler.<br><br><a href=#c3388446028686823074 title="comment permalink">1/24/15, 5:22 AM</a><br><br>

If you are city or town bound, or have just a small lot (owned or rented), there's so much you can do if you come at it from the "urban homesteading" perspective. Lots of cool books and sites to take inspiration from. I personally found that angle more accessible, rather than thinking about becoming a real farmer, which just seemed too big a deal to me. I could probably pass myself off as a small-scale farmer now, but I got started one square foot at a time, slowly digging up my urban plot.

It described and indicted the full bore shift to industrial agriculture, and the government's role. The book is still very relevant and a good read. But in the mid to long term future, I believe there will be a "Resettling of America" ( less the areas that become desert) While I agree that the powers that be will keep industrial ag going at all cost ( panem et circenses after all) eventually it will transition back to low input methods. The young who want to become farmers as others upthread have mentioned, will have a tough time in the short term. Here are some links that might help in their search. <br><br>http://www.homesteadandgardens.com/young-farmer-needing-land-old-farmer-wanting-retire/#fromoldfarmerstonewfarmers<br><br>Let's just hope that many links are made in this way, instead of the potential alternative where they all become corporate serfs.<br><br>Second- My hand for the ship is helping transition farmland to permaculture at scale. We have so far planted almost 3000 nut trees on our small farm, which with wider replication, will in time replace annual grains as our staple crops. Chestnuts are primarily carbohydrate, while hazelnuts, walnuts provide oils and proteins. One cannot live by tomatoes and lettuce from the back yard alone.<br><br> Mark Shepard at Restoration Agriculture is a leading proponent, with many acres in transition. As also mentioned upthread, this form of agriculture has a lot of effort upfront, but is less effort and manageable with fossil free techniques. <br><br>I have also felt something is in the air, time to get off the sofa.<br><br><a href=#c5859193406205269903 title="comment permalink">1/24/15, 7:09 AM</a><br><br>

He's quite a character and amusing writer, photos are excellent, glossary in back. It is indeed true that many of the weeds I pulled out of my vegetable garden turned out to be edible. <br><br>We've been disappointed here with trying to plant fruit and nut trees. They just don't seem to do well. perhaps because the climate is somewhat wet, although no more so than further north. I don't really get it. you get a good crop of fruit every 3rd year, maybe. Grapes grow, but rather so-so. Nut trees also don't seem to do well, while there are many natives that do very well. A local hazelnut is almost impossible to crack. I like the idea very much of replacing grains with nuts, as I have recently decided to do the gluten-free thing, and I have made some wonderful recipes by using not only alternate flours, but ground nuts in stead of flour. Much more nutritious and tastes great.<br>Is farming really such back breaking work? Realize 100 years ago half the people were farming. I have a neighbor who works ridiculously hard at it, but he doesn't even need the money, he just loves to garden and vend at the farmers market.<br>What is really hard is breaking raw ground into a homestead. In the 5 years we've been here, my husband has dug by hand and mixed by hand the cement, and laid by hand the cinder block for a large water cistern, dug out a decorative pond, built a front porch/greenhouse, refurbished (not done) an old cabin to make it livable (including going under the cabin and digging about 20 two-foot holes to pour cement and cinder block foundation-it had been sitting on tree stumps), taken an electric cement mixer down our steep driveway and built two ramps with wire reinforcers so people can get up it, put in water drainage around the house and on the driveway, and built a very large storage shed, using trees for posts that he cut and stripped himself. Just farming seems like it might be easy. He'll be 60 soon. Oh, and we heat with wood.<br><br>But, you know, we love it here.<br><br>The thing is, the way it is supposed to work, is that you have the next generation coming up to take over the really heavy stuff as you start to slow down.<br><br><a href=#c258034659624608089 title="comment permalink">1/24/15, 3:40 PM</a><br><br>

It is vague at best, misleading nearly always, and occasionally downright delusional or antisocial. Most people are highly selective in what they count as an "external input" when they imagine themselves living "self-sufficiently." Are you a self-sufficient household if you grow all your own food, but using tools you could not fabricate or replace yourself? Like metal buckets and taps for maple sugaring? Or steel scythes for mowing? And even if you could feed yourself living in a log cabin using homemade stone tools, is this what you really want to do? "Collapse now" I don't think means "cut yourself off from all connections to society and economy." "Self-sufficient" is not a useful guideline for living in a contracting civilization.<br><br>Of course, for many millennia people did practice agriculture without fossil fuels or even metallurgy. There were a whole lot fewer of us then. And even with just stone tools, we still caused mass extinctions and probably even climate change. <br><br>I think you also need to be wary of committing yourself to one view of the future and its potentials and perils. If you prepare for marauding mobs but they never materialize, you might wish you had spent more time working in your water infrastructure and less on your armory. On the other hand, if you plan for peace and marauding mobs show up, you might regret not having invested in some crossbows and a good cache of arrows. Maybe keep a weather eye (and ear) out for the winds of change, and evolve your lifestyle on the fly, as the uncertain future becomes the present.<br><br><a href=#c8649714914495437509 title="comment permalink">1/24/15, 4:55 PM</a><br><br>

I'm going to try giving my established fruit trees very little water this summer. I already don't water my four grape vines, and I got a lot of grapes last year. I like to grow a lot of tomatoes and they're pretty thirsty though I know they can do fine with less water. I didn't water my front grass last summer and it all came back after the December rain (most people in Napa water their grass in Napa). <br>I picked up another used food grade water barrel today that I can put under a roof drain spout. As long as we get more rain in the next three months, I'll have four of them filled up for 200 gallons. It's a start, though won't get far into our dry season - May to November. <br>Also, thanks for your advise on a 12v solar system this week. I've wanted to do some solar but don't want to be grid tied. 12v sounds like the way to go.<br>Related - in 2014 California had its highest avg temp on record. <br>And some ski resorts in the Sierras are closing for the season because of lack of snow and warm temps - 58 F at Lake Tahoe last week (6,000 ft. In Winter at N. 40d latitude). <br>Carl<br><br><a href=#c3056196939278105492 title="comment permalink">1/24/15, 6:56 PM</a><br><br>

I'll have to dig them out, one a good scifi with a crazy radioactive intelligent mutant evolution, the other maybe a more realistic scifi the story based in Australia, both written in the 70's too. Just so hard to find good post apocalyptic scifi books these days at the second hand book shop. <br><br>The election, PUP signs every where, old Joh's son is putting himself up for election as a PUP.

I'm in the same general region as Carl, and we regularly go 5 or 6 months without rain in the summer, with heat comparable to yours. But it's supposed to be the wet season now, and my rain guage hasn't registered a trace all month. That's the scary part. Our regular yearly surface water is just not arriving, for at least the fourth year in a row. The groundwater is getting depleted as individuals, communities, and farmers pump it from below ground to try to make up for the lack of rain and snow. In some areas the ground has actually sunk by up to a foot or more as the underground aquifers, now empty, cave in. I fear greatly that this drought, which seems to be becoming the new normal, is not something that can be adapted to easily. I am currently poring over Gary Nabhan's excellent "Growing Food in a Hotter, Drier Land" for insight into how other less wasteful cultures manage. Looks like I am going to have to figure out what to do with prickly pear. :)<br>--Heather in CA<br><br><a href=#c854754408728959912 title="comment permalink">1/24/15, 9:16 PM</a><br><br>

Droughts we can handle, but floods not so much, the community took a hit in 2012, we came through unscathed, apart from having a flood baby, mum and bub even got a free helicopter ride home, over the flooding waters. <br><br> When we first moved here it was a red desert.

How the horse dominated the mind of the early races, especially of the Mediterranean! You were a lord if you had a horse. Far back, far back in our dark soul the horse prances. He is a dominant symbol: he gives us lordship: he links us, the first palpable and throbbing link with the ruddy-glowing Almighty of potence: he is the beginning even of our godhead in the flesh. And as a symbol he roams the dark underworld meadows of the soul. He stamps and threshes in the dark fields of your soul and of mine. The sons of God who came down and knew the daughters of men and begot the great Titans, they had ‘the members of horses’, says Enoch.<br>Within the last fifty years man has lost the horse. Now man is lost. Man is lost to life and power — an underling and a wastrel. While horses thrashed the streets of London, London lived.<br>The horse, the horse! the symbol of surging potency and power of movement, of action, in man. The horse, that heroes strode. Even Jesus rode an ass, a mount of “humble power. But the horse for true heroes. And different horses for the different powers, for the different heroic flames and impulses.<br>The rider on the white horse! Who is he then? The man who needs an explanation will never know. Yet explanations are our doom.<br>Take the old four natures of man: the sanguine, the choleric, the melancholic, the phlegmatic! There you have the four colours of the horses, white, red, black, and pale, or yellowish. But how should sanguine be white? — Ah, because the blood was the life itself, the very life: and the very power of life itself was white, dazzling. In our old days, the blood was the lite, and visioned as power it was like white light. The scarlet and the purple were only the clothing of the blood. Ah, the vivid blood clothed in bright red! itself it was like pure light”<br><br><br><br><a href=#c5120887333624011146 title="comment permalink">1/25/15, 2:51 AM</a><br><br>

I've done it. <br><br>I'm not as certain that a year's worth of calories for an adult can be grown on the same space. I am raising the question because it is by no means trivial (at least to me). It could be life threatening if someone really counted on it.<br><br>Before I read your comment, I just happened to be planning my garden for next year and thought it might be fun/useful to calculate the calories I hoped to grow. I have 3 vegetable plots of 2000 square feet each. One is devoted to potatoes, one to the three sisters, and one to other vegetables. This certainly gives me the bulk of the staple vegetables our family of 5 require in a year; but it doesn't give us anything close to the daily calories we need (3000 for me, 2000 for my wife, and 1000 for each child).<br><br>My maximum yields for specific cultivars are not much higher than 200 calories per square feet. The average yield is much lower at less than 100 calories per square foot; even with multilevel and succession planting. <br><br>If we use 2500 calories as the daily requirement and 3000 square feet as the area devoted to it, one gets about 300 calories per square foot as the annual yield. Clearly I'm not getting anywhere near that.<br><br>I'm a little worried the claims made in your sources are misleading. I'm not saying it hasn't been done; only that it is not at all typical and likely requires inputs (manure and other animal products) that assume much more land. It also probably assumes a lot fewer calories.<br><br>So I'd be curious if anyone out there reading this has actually got these yields as a matter of course. Maybe all I need do is read the book you referenced. I'm going to track it down.

I intend to redouble my efforts this year, or maybe just throw away some bad ideas. It's a discouraging learning curve, even if you seem to have the resources. Come war, depression, or famine, I don't think I'd starve, but I'd get really tired of scrubbing sunchokes from the growing patch I planted 10 years ago. Those extra-complex carbs take some, uh, training of the digestive biota. Maybe I should just stick a pig on them. I haven't tried eating cattails yet.<br><br>On the other hand, good idea or not, I couldn't imagine living in a city when the economy crashes and drought takes the midwest. They may starve out here in the sticks, but I'd guess someone who shows up on my doorstep and says, "show me what to do" would have a better chance than someone with similar lack of skills in an urban brick high-rise.<br><br>I had a conversation on facebook last night with someone who insisted that we have to do something for the cities. This was on a permaculture related group. I'm not sure what he thought was possible. <br><br>I have to agree that anyone thinking of being a traditional homesteader would be disappointed. But what if we see them as refugees? It seems like a good Green Wizard project to know enough to be able to direct refugees into building enough shelter and growing enough food to not freeze or starve, mostly. Kind of like what happened in Plymouth in 1620.

I live on a land trust in WV which has a leasehold available. It costs $1000 to join, after which you build your own house (no bother with building codes here). And we can't seem to find takers with realistic prospects...is it because no one wants to live in West Virginia, or that nobody can imagine building their own house?<br>The thing is, it isn't necessary to buy the land, build the house, add the chicken coop and root cellar and woodshed and greenhouse, put in the garden and cropfields and fence them, add the goat barn and pasture, and acquire animals, all in one year. Some of these things would be a lot harder to do if in the future one has no money or if there is enough of a crash locally that one can't buy fencing or lumber, for example; but our ancestors did all this without industrial materials, after all. And likely, those who make no reasonable preparations, but survive, will end up doing the same.<br><br><a href=#c8812034303765264913 title="comment permalink">1/25/15, 11:08 PM</a><br><br>

That's why I think, until that blows over, less populated is better. This may deal more with JMG'S other blog, but dealing with the collective insanity of our time is a skill, a very difficult skill. An acomplished mage would have the tools (spells) to deal with the insane consciousness of our time, but, for someone like me, who's just contemplating magic, I think I need a withdrawal period until I have the tools to deal with the insanity. So, someone like JMG, with years of experience and a whole toolkit at hand, could live a charmed life amidst the insanity when the crisis hits, yet someone less knowledgeable about consciousness might be facing the business end of a pitchfork. <br>Here in Kentucky, there are 120 counties, each with a county seat of at least a few thousand people or more. No one's more than 10 miles from a county seat, most people are much closer. Now while most eastern states don't have as many counties, their rural areas are just as densely populated, if not more. So, anywhere in the eastern U.S., you're not really that far from civilization.<br>It is true that cities are capable of producing way more food than they currently do, that a lot of arable urban land is devoted to ornamentals, particularly grass, rather than foodstuffs. Whether urban food production DOES ramp up sufficiently, especially with unrest, etc is another story. My guess is that the crisis/collective insanity will first have to blow over before any widespread efforts at urban food production get underway. I know apathy and disinterest are major issues with the community garden program I help.<br><br><a href=#c8180743471338356850 title="comment permalink">1/26/15, 7:50 AM</a><br><br>

Chickens, for example, forage for more than half of their food if you've got some room for them. I'm planning to try to grow as many sunflowers as possible as feed for chickens and corn as well, partly to get away from GMO feed. I'm thinking of getting a couple of geese.

What I envision there is turning the suburb into a self sufficient village unto itself, with some houses abandoned/torn down for salvage, more people living in each house, and yards, empty lots (after salvage) and other big,grassy spaces turned into garden and grain plots. Chickens and pigs and goats can also be raised there. Those who have a business can just use their garage or entire houses can be used for business and other things. By business, I'm talking about green wizard stuff. If there is a water source like a creek or river around, it can really work. Plumbing isn't all that necessary. I know some people who have an indoor nonflushing toilet system that involves building a box with an opening on one side, putting a big bucket in it, a toilet seat over the top, and using LOTS of sawdust with each use.

Tastes like watermelon to me, just avoid the fibre like prickles - yeah, they hurt.<br><br>As a suggestion, when it rains next (and it will) stand outside under an umbrella so that you are not distracted and watch just how much water rushes past your place. Then think about ways to get that water into your ground water table. We are culturally predisposed to getting water to drain away from the areas that we live, but this is the exact wrong response in a dryland or hot and arid area.<br><br>In the damp and cool UK, drainage away from your property is probably a good response. In California - like here - it is a disaster.<br><br>Hi Ruben,<br><br>I've written and blogged about that issue quite a lot.

Then mulch it some more. Then whilst you are at it, put some more mulch on top of that. And then finally plant really closely with very hardy plants so that no sunlight ever hits the soil directly. It should be 100% shaded.<br><br>California has some truly amazing and hardy plants which I grow here and like the eucalyptus trees which we donated to them, those plants are virtually indestructible.<br><br>Hi Steve,<br><br>Just sayin...<br><br>Hi Carl,<br><br>Top work! Yeah grass is a real waste of water. Traditionally grasslands were really tall over summer to provide shading for the soil and reduce evaporation. That concept goes against our cultural predispositions though.<br><br>The other thing is, in marginal areas grafted fruit trees are a disaster unless you do all of the suggestions above to get them established. The reason people prefer grafted fruit trees is that they grow smaller and so are easier to manage. They achieve this feat through specially selected smaller root systems. Seedling fruit trees have much bigger root systems and often quite large tap roots so they become much hardier once established.<br><br>Don't worry about the whole growing true to type business as the genetics in fruit trees these days is so limited that they are pretty close - if not the same as the parent tree. Incidentally if I were growing grafted fruit trees for sale, I'd tell the story about not growing true to type too.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c1896835092511390061 title="comment permalink">1/26/15, 1:24 PM</a><br><br>

From those years experience, and from my own pondering and experiments on feeding my family and myself, and also providing food for others in my community, I always say "stop growing so many annuals! Instead build you food systems around perennial food crops." First on that list would be trees. Depending on where you live, nut trees, and fruit trees can give you more calories than one family (done right) could possibly consume in a year. So right away you not only feed you, but have extra for bartering, or just being a good neighbor. <br>The next level would be food producing bushes around and under the trees, Blueberries, etc. On down to the ground level which would be wild strawberry, etc.<br>The best thing about perennials is the vastly smaller areas needed, and the very large amount of calories you can produce in that small area, plus a large reduction of labor, compared to annual crops.<br>Chickens would also be a suggestion. Then learn about a vermiculture (worms) system to grow worms for feeding chicken, and also consume (again if done right) chicken manure. Onward and so fourth.<br>Of course the main thing is to, at some point, stop talking about it and do it! <br>Cheers, and godspeed!<br><br><a href=#c5619792921478168098 title="comment permalink">1/26/15, 4:45 PM</a><br><br>

However, I will pipe up (in your area's favor) that rainfall is supposed to remain consistent (relatively). So the option to majorly jack up food production will be there as far as water supplies go (tools &amp; seeds.....well, that's another matter). <br><br>Here in the arid West, population has also been growing - and growing. EVERYTHING is irrigated. The aquifer my area pumps from is &gt;800 feet down (that's where it starts). Luckily for us, this particular aquifer does get some refill from the rivers in the area. To the north of us, though, that aquifer (which feeds most of the agricultural regions in eastern WA) does not recharge &amp; is dropping precipitously. Our dams are also aging &amp; nearly all in need of repair, if not replacement, with no funds in site (ditto for the bridges).<br><br>When the water goes, it is going to get ugly. Really ugly. From the Cascade Mountains to well east of the Rockies, most places receive - at most - 16" of rain a year (mountainous areas receive snow as well, although there will be less of that, too, with AGW).

Your animals should only eat things you can't, like grass, or all the tiny seeds and bugs and such that foraging chickens eat. For every 10 calories worth of feed you give a chicken, you will only get one calorie back in eggs or meat. Unless you have enough space that your chickens can feed themselves almost entirely on their own, they will be a net minus for your total food production, not a plus. Same for small grazers like goats and sheep. This is Ecology 101. Only plants make food calories. Animals just convert them from one form into another, with about a 90% loss on the way. <br><br>So in a small yard, animals will never be a plus for your calorie production. They will always be a minus. Grains, legumes, and vegetables. That's been the foundation of the agrarian diet for about 10,000 years. And it still is. Perennial polycultures are an interesting idea, but they have not often (ever?) been implemented on a large scale to support an entire community.<br><br><a href=#c4955212385850931479 title="comment permalink">1/26/15, 7:30 PM</a><br><br>

I don't think I could do it on a home scale again. I had coyotes take to of my chickens two days ago, out of the yard in daylight, and that's pretty light losses. Fences are expensive, and the ones that are easy to move don't work well without line power to a hot fence charger. The Maine tradition is to haul sheep out to islands in the spring and then bring them back in the fall. I'm not set up for that either.<br><br>Even chickens present a problem in terms of high nutrient feed. I know people love to talk up worms, weeds, etc, and chickens are traditionally garbage birds, but still, feed will take some energy.<br><br>Rabbits are bred to grow well on commercial feed, so the genetics needs working out to raise them on hay, kale, and root veggies. <br><br>Many of these same problems apply to pigs. But pigs are also harder to keep and breed than chickens or rabbits. <br><br>A long term solution to livestock containment would be traditional English style hedges, and I have an interest in that, but those would take a few years to grow.<br><br>Until then, I'd supplement my mostly vegan diet with venison, mackerel, and whatever else came along. I tried porcupine pie once at a pot-luck. I can't say it's the best I've ever had, but it's better than starving. And I'll have garlic to go with it.<br><br>I'd be angling to find the smallest, thriftiest dairy cow I could, and doing quick math to find out how much hay I'd need to cut (by hand) to get her through the winter. IIRC, a cow needs 50 pounds of dry hay a day. I love dairy, but that's a lot of work. And goats just aren't the same.<br><br>I have a history book about Dexter Maine that say in the late 1800s, 95% of households had between 1 and 5 dairy cows. Perhaps redefining the size of a household is key. I think increasing the size of the crew somewhat would improve survivability in a crunch, as long as it stayed within carrying capacity.<br><br>Assuming water is available and over half the neighbors have left, a suburban or light urban situation could actually work okay. I'm impressed by some of what I see looking at Google Maps in Detroit. The farm on the corner of Farnsworth and Elmwood is a case in point. I hope lots of people can manage things like that. But there are also going to have to be a lot of people fanning out across the landscape.<br><br><a href=#c1802648000805831925 title="comment permalink">1/26/15, 7:40 PM</a><br><br>

These are part of the rotation to provide almost a ton of manure a year (already spread on the plot) and enough meat and eggs for the year.<br><br>@Onething,<br><br>Yes I am getting quite few storable calories from squash, corn, and beans as well as with potatoes and other root crops. My question/point was that these and my other crops do not yield (for me at least) anywhere near the 300 calories per square foot that 3000 square feet per person implies.<br><br>Regarding your neighbour's yields: A ¼ acre is about 5 ½ of my 2000 square foot plots or 3 2/3 plots of 3000 square feet. Assuming his family needs 7000 calories a day, he must be getting about 230 calories per square foot. This is way higher than me but still well short of 300. My guess is he is really cultivating more than a ¼ acre or he is getting some calories from off farm. Chances are he also hasn't really done the math either. In part that is my point. Meaning not offense to you or him/her, but people make such claims, often in good faith, but without really breaking it down. <br><br>I have grown buckwheat in my chicken plot (for them to forage) and was planning on sunflowers as well. Nonetheless, I am also reliant on GMO feed as well despite letting the layers forage off plot. <br><br>I've had ducks but not geese. Ducks keep the pond clean of algae and its grass edges well trimmed. Some varieties require very little feed as they forage well. They are worth their feed in entertainment value alone!<br><br>@Travis<br><br>Thank you. I like the idea of less work.<br><br>I already have some filberts and a few (non-producing) fruit trees. Sadly I've killed more than my fair share of fruit trees by neglect. Now that I am in a position to take proper care of them, I intend expand our “orchard” with some hardy apples trees, local elderberries and wild raspberries. It all takes time though. I have a plot devoted to cultivated raspberries already as well. <br><br>Your main point is excellent: more perennials. I'm not sure I will grow less annuals though. I've spent a lot of time trying to find the right balance of work to yield and how much we really require of each cultivar. I think I am about where I want to be with each that I currently produce.<br> <br>I haven't looked into vermiculture for my chickens. I'm more of the school that they should find their own worms! Nonetheless, its an interesting thought if there is little work involved.<br><br>@Angus<br><br>Quite right. Hard work is fun. I try to limit my fun to about 4 hours a day. I can do more in a day but recovery time is the issue. Too much fun in one day makes it hard to have fun the next day. I'm in my mid 50's, by no means a big man, and only modestly fit. The key is to pace yourself. I'm in it for the long haul. No sprinting.<br><br>@To All<br><br>Just to drive my point home though, even if I include my ducks, chicken plot, raspberry plot, filbets, and asparagus bed with my 3 main vegetable plots (totaling 1 pond and 6 plots of 2000 square feet each) and include plans for some goats for milk and lambs for more meat on other plots; as far as I can tell from the math I've done, I will still only meet at best about ½ the calories my family and I “require”. <br><br>Basically I know I can grow/raise enough vegetables, eggs, meat, and even milk to meet our need for those things. I'm a good way there already. What I'm not at all certain about is not starving anyways if I relied on only those items I just listed. <br><br>I'm certain more grains and fruit/nut trees have to be part of the equation to meet the other ½ of our calorie needs. I don't yet really know how much space I need to devote to get this other half because I haven't done it yet. Nonetheless, its certain the total space I will require will be way more than 3000 square feet per person.<br><br>For those contemplating a move in this direction (despite it being fairly late in the game), I think these are useful figures.<br><br>Thanks for all your suggestions.<br><br><a href=#c3113419507847652050 title="comment permalink">1/26/15, 9:54 PM</a><br><br>

It stocks itself with bream and bass, we don't ask how other than that there are other stocked ponds and fish-filled creeks very nearby and fish seem to have a miraculous ability to make short portages. Anyway, the pond is essentially zero maintenance. And it is freekin' full of fish. We could easily pull a couple of bream out every day or two, providing us with about 2-3 ounces of tasty flaky white meat each, without ever depleting the population. I repeat, zero maintenance, and native local species (though probably not local genotypes). Bream are notoriously easy to catch, too. When the pond hasn't been fished in a while (which is most of he time now, we are mostly leaving it to the otters, ospreys, and herons in this era when we can still easily feed ourselves from grocery stores), you can literally drop your hook in, count to three, and pull out a fish.

I have raised some dozen or so breeds, and have done trials of growing out on forage, in a structure not unlike a chicken tractor. The heritage breed American Blue rabbits have done best, floppy ears down, on forage trials. It will take many rabbit generations (but not terribly many human years) to continue to select for best growth on forage, but I and some others are working on it. Dan Salatin (Joel's son) and his wife Sheri are also working on raising rabbits mainly on forage. I had the pleasure of speaking with Sheri about it a few years ago, and the best news, perhaps, is that the animals do best on the poorest pasturage. I haven't blogged much about this project in the past couple of years - homeschooling and adding dairy goats to my life has taken up what little discretionary time I once had - but if you click on my name you should find yourself at my blog, where there are a few articles about my rabbit trials.<br><br><a href=#c7978631787992373827 title="comment permalink">1/27/15, 7:20 PM</a><br><br>

They concentrate them from the plants they eat. I am not anti-chicken. I always have them. And after they are mostly mature, I do not feed them, except to tempt them into their house at bedtime, if needed, or when the snow is too deep (quite rare here in TN). A flock of a dozen stay almost entirely within about an acre surrounding our house. Of course that acre is full of "weeds," tall grass, blackberry brambles, unraked leaves, and forest understory. It's gotta be an acre of good habitat, and chickens are really forest and brushland creatures, not grassland creatures. Ours don't produce eggs in the winter, because we don't mess up their photoperiod with artificial light. But they do it the rest of the year, and the yolks are thick and orange and laden with carotenoids.

Thank you.<br><br>Yesterday we got something like a foot of snow, blown around as it fell. Apparently, global warming will mean stronger winter storms for us, due to the moisture from increased ocean heat. And that drives home that winter storage will always be a big thing here. <br><br>Amaranth for chickens sounds great in the summer. I should be sure to experiment with how much grain I can get from amaranth as winter feed. I'd never considered it for livestock. Amaranth has a tall habit and blocks sun to the surface, so once established, it competes well with weeds. My dominant weed is a rhizome grass that's very aggressive.<br><br>There's a low morphine white breadseed poppy I've grown. The variety is Elka. It's beautiful. I should try it again, shooting for more grain production from it.<br><br>My history with sunflowers includes a lot of mold while trying to dry them. This points to the need for a better drying system, as much as anything. <br><br>For oil crops, I saw a simple press for pumpkin seed oil, made from a piece of 1" steel pipe and 15/16" auger bit, mostly. I saw this at the Common Ground Country Fair, and was pointed to it by Will Bonsall, a veganic farmer who gets almost all his oils with one like it.<br><br>Bonsall also does talks about home scale grains, and tends somewhat away from the traditional wheat/corn/barley/rye grasses. I think for me he has a point. If I want to out-compete grass, I shouldn't plant grass.<br><br>Reading back over what I've just written, I see a need for more research and information on home and village scale homebuilt threshers, hullers, dryers, and other types of mills for local food production.

Just cooking, washing, firewood, livestock/pets, family care alone eats into long sleep-ins.<br><br>Harvest sharing from the trades and crafts would depend on a constructed society, but farming, trades, and crafts are destict separations of labor that have more or less been maintained through history. In true agrarian societies without slavery like 18th century America most people lived in a household/farm economy where shops of various trades and skills produced needed goods for home and community.

I live in Ontario so most of what you listed would not apply to me. Still the basic idea is valid. Apples are probably the best bet for me. In the 1800s people here would eat apple pie for breakfast. <br><br>@Onething<br><br>Re. your “Agent, you are saying 1/4 acre is not enough to feed 4 people? Despite you saying you could provide all the meat and milk, vegetables and eggs? You eat squash, corn and beans? What is missing?”<br><br>What's missing is enough calories. There is only so much of each of the things I listed that my family will or can eat each day. So what's missing is high energy density foods like cereals (other than our modest amount of corn), fruit, and nuts. Most people in the world (or at least industrial nations) get the bulk of their calories from cereals. <br><br>Google “rabbit starvation” to understand how people can still starve with lots to eat but not enough calories. Lean meat is used in that particular example but the principle still holds for crops low in calories. <br><br>Another extreme example is to ask how many potatoes would you need to eat to meet your daily requirement of 2500 calories (or a woman). Potatoes are at the high end for calories per mass (350 calories per pound). At 163 calories per medium sized potato, that is 15 potatoes. Now substitute any portion of that volume with an equivalent calorie amount of squash, or other vegetable or a more varied diet. Whatever you come up with will be a lot of vegetables in one day; more than most of us would eat. If you also substitute some portion of those potatoes with the calorie equivalent of meat, milk, and eggs, the pictures does not get better. Its an enormous volume and mass of food. <br><br>So the point is you can easily grow all the meat, milk, vegetables, and eggs you will need in a year but still fall well short in the calories required i.e. a family will starve nonetheless on these alone.<br><br><br><a href=#c7043711722590489147 title="comment permalink">1/28/15, 7:03 PM</a><br><br>

Here is how to determine how many calories you can/will produce per area. A spreadsheet program (free from OpenOffice) helps but it is not essential. Follow the steps below:<br><br>1) Assuming you have kept records: you know your yields from years past and you know the area devoted to each crop as well. List the crops, yields, and area used for each crop on the spreadsheet. Now go to the internet and obtain the calories per unit of each of these crops and list these as well.<br>2) Use the spreadsheet to multiply your yield per crop (converted to the units for calories for that item) by the calories that crop gives. Bingo: you have the annual calories for that crop. <br><br>3) To determine the total calories from all you crops, just sum the annual calories from each crop.<br>4) To determine your overall calories per square foot, just divided the total calories from all your crops by the area you used to grow all of them.<br>5) To see which crops give the best and worst yields in calories per area used to grow each crop, just divide the annual calories for each crop by the area devoted to that crop.<br><br>I admit it takes a bit of effort to obtain these results, but I am certain they will be instructive. I think clarity on this issue is extremely important if anyone really plans to depend on their own garden produce. <br><br>Re. growing your own grain for chickens. I've looked into this for myself. Its not attractive to me right now. Our dozen layers go through about one 40kg bag of feed a month despite ample opportunity for forage during the warm months. Our 50 broilers go through about the same (12 x 40 kgs) in 10 weeks. That is a full ton of cereal feed in a year. At this point, for me, this is too much to do all by hand. Help from either horses or a tractor would introduce complications that I suspect I would not welcome at this point.<br><br>Assuming your sister's chickens are not much different than mine, does your sister really get 1/4 of a ton (500 lbs) of grain off her three plots? Does she really know? Has she kept records and weighted her product or is she guessing? This is the problem often. My point again is “guessing isn't good enough”. A person needs to do the math and then stare the beast in the face. <br><br>This brings up the issue of return on your time, effort, money, and opportunity costs etc. All these can be calculated as well, and is very worth doing for every major effort e.g. wood heat versus furnace fuel. The failure to face reality on these restraints is what I believe often leads to failure. One guiding principle for me is not to try to beat the system's machines with my own physical labour. I think this is a sure way to end up broke and broken. For this reason I do not have a market garden. I'm not going to compete with someone's tractor and pay myself pennies an hour unless I have to.<br><br>Of course time and money are not the only values, but working these out is still important. Good fresh food and good exercise are also important. Resilient (not self sufficiency as such)should also be a major consideration (i.e. when the local mill goes so do my chickens unless I grow my own feed). This is why I think knowing what segments of society will fail first is so important. I suspect industrial farming has some legs. I see no reason not to advantage from it while it lasts.<br><br><br><a href=#c8919073994418246302 title="comment permalink">1/28/15, 7:13 PM</a><br><br>

Apples consist almost entirely of carbohydrates and fiber. There might be a trace amount of fat in an apple seed. The fat in an apple pie is in the crust (though some people put a little butter in the filling). The calories in apple pie are mostly in the crust, too, because fat has twice the calories per gram as carbohydrates and protein do. You can make a pie crust with any old fat, animal, dairy or vegetable oil, but you can't get fat from an apple tree. <br><br>I think you have misunderstood what rabbit starvation is. The reason rabbit starvation is a thing is not because rabbit meat provides insufficient calories. It's because wild rabbit is a very lean meat and a diet based on it lacks fat. If all you are eating is lean meat, even if you have plenty of it, you will starve. <br><br>Calories can come from anything you are able to digest, but you need some complete protein in your diet or you will not thrive; you need a little fat or you'll die; some fiber helps your digestive tract operate; and there are a number of vitamins and minerals you need small amounts of.

I understand how Michael Sweet felt in his first post; I too had gotten overwhelmed by despair that it's too late for me to move to a sustainable lifestyle and "do it right". I wonder if it comes from speeding through the past years worth of the Report postings: I've been reading at least one per day in order to catch up. I think I overloaded my brain and my emotions.<br>But what wonderful support the people commenting have shown! So many alternative ideas presented, about how to adapt to one's present situation. I feel very encouraged now. I see that I have many options, so I will keep my preparation plans flexible, and I'll try to be ready for change and adaptability.<br>Thank you all so much.<br><br><a href=#c5837056002219821655 title="comment permalink">2/5/15, 7:49 PM</a><br><br>
