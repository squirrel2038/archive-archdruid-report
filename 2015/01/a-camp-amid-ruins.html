<![endif]-->Well, the Fates were apparently listening last week. As I write this, stock markets around the world are lurching through what might just be the opening moves of the Crash of 2015, whipsawed by further plunges in the price of oil and a range of other bad economic news; amid a flurry of layoffs and dropping rig counts, the first <a href=http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-01-07/first-shale-casualty-wbh-energy-files-bankruptcy-many-more-coming>bankruptcy in the fracking industry</a> has been announced, with more on their way; gunfire in Paris serves up a brutal reminder that the rising spiral of political violence I traced in last week’s post is by no means limited to North American soil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The cheerleaders of business as usual in the media are still insisting at the top of their lungs that America’s new era of energy independence is still on its way; those of my readers who recall the final days of the housing bubble that burst in 2008, or the tech-stock bubble that popped in 2000, will recognize a familiar tone in the bluster. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s entirely possible, to be sure, that central banks and governments will be able to jerry-rig another round of temporary supports for the fraying architecture of the global economy, and postpone a crash—or at least drag out the agony a bit longer. It’s equally possible that other dimensions of the crisis of our age can be forestalled or postponed by drastic actions here and now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That said, whether the process is fast or slow, whether the crunch hits now or a bit further down the road, the form of technic society I’ve termed <a href=../../2011/06/how-not-to-play-game_500.html>abundance industrialism</a> is on its way out through history’s exit turnstile, and an entire world of institutions and activities familiar to all of us is going with it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It doesn’t require any particular genius or prescience to grasp this, merely the willingness to recognize that if something is unsustainable, sooner or later it won’t be sustained. Of course that’s the sticking point, because what can’t be sustained at this point is the collection of wildly extravagant energy- and resource-intensive habits that used to pass for a normal lifestyle in the world’s industrial nations, and has recently become just a little less normal than it used to be. Those lifestyles, and most of what goes with them, only existed in the first place because a handful of the world’s nations burned through half a billion years of fossil sunlight in a few short centuries, and stripped the planet of most of its other concentrated resource stocks into the bargain. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the unpalatable reality of the industrial era. Despite the rhetoric of universal betterment that was brandished about so enthusiastically by the propagandists of the industrial order, there were never enough of any of the necessary resources to make that possible for more than a small fraction of the world’s population, or for more than a handful of generations. Nearly all the members of our species who lived outside the industrial nations, and a tolerably large number who resided within them, were expected to carry most of the costs of reckless resource extraction and ecosystem disruption while receiving few if any of the benefits. They’ll have plenty of company shortly: abundance industrialism is winding down, but its consequences are not, and people around the world for centuries and millennia to come will have to deal with the depleted and damaged planet our actions have left them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s a bitter pill to swallow, and the likely aftermath of the industrial age won’t do anything to improve the taste. Over the last six months or so, I’ve drawn on the downside trajectories of other failed civilizations to sketch out how that aftermath will probably play out here in North America: the disintegration of familiar political and economic structures, the rise of warband culture, the collapse of public order, and the failure of cultural continuity, all against a backdrop of rapid and unpredictable climate change, rising seas, and the appearance of chemical and radiological dead zones created by some of industrial civilization’s more clueless habits. It’s an ugly picture, and the only excuse I have for that unwelcome fact is that falling civilizations look like that. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The question that remains, though, is what we’re going to do about it all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I should say up front that by “we” I don’t mean some suitably photogenic collection of Hollywood heroes and heroines who just happen to have limitless resources and a bag of improbable inventions at their disposal. I don’t mean a US government that has somehow shaken off the senility that affects all great powers in their last days and is prepared to fling everything it has into the quest for a sustainable future. Nor do I mean a coterie of gray-skinned aliens from Zeta Reticuli, square-jawed rapists out of Ayn Rand novels, or some other source of allegedly superior beings who can be counted upon to come swaggering onto the scene to bail us out of the consequences of our own stupidity. They aren’t part of this conversation; the only people who are, just now, are the writer and the readers of this blog. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Within those limits, the question I’ve posed may seem preposterous. I grant that for a phenomenon that practically defines the far edges of the internet—a venue for lengthy and ornately written essays about wildly unpopular subjects by a clergyman from a small and distinctly eccentric fringe religion—<i>The Archdruid Report</i> has a preposterously large readership, and one that somehow manages to find room for a remarkably diverse and talented range of people, bridging some of the ideological and social barriers that divide<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>industrial society into so many armed and uncommunicative camps. Even so, the regular readership of this blog could probably all sit down at once in a football stadium and still leave room for the hot dog vendors. Am I seriously suggesting that this modest and disorganized a group can somehow rise up and take meaningful action in the face of so vast a process as the fall of a civilization? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the things that gives that question an ironic flavor is that quite a few people are making what amounts to the same claim in even more grandiose terms than mine. I’m thinking here of the various proposals for a Great Transition of one kind or another being hawked at various points along the social and political spectrum these days. I suspect we’re going to be hearing a lot more from those in the months and years immediately ahead, as the collapse of the fracking bubble forces people to find some other excuse for insisting that they can have their planet and eat it too. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Part of the motivation behind the grand plans just mentioned is straightforwardly financial. One part of what drove the fracking bubble along the classic trajectory—up with the rocket, down with the stick—was a panicked conviction on the part of a great many people that some way had to be found to keep industrial society’s fuel tanks somewhere on the near side of that unwelcome letter E. Another part of it, though, was the recognition on the part of a somewhat smaller but more pragmatic group of people tht the panicked conviction in question could be turned into a sales pitch. Fracking wasn’t the only thing that got put to work in the time-honored process of proving Ben Franklin’s proverb about a fool and his money; fuel ethanol, biodiesel, and large-scale wind power also had their promoters, and sucked up their share of government subsidies and private investment. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now that fracking is falling by the wayside, there’ll likely be a wild scramble to replace it in the public eye as the wave of the energy future. The nuclear industry will doubtless be in there—nuclear power is one of the most durable <a href=../../2014/03/the-crocodiles-of-reality.html>subsidy dumpsters</a> in modern economic life, and the nuclear industry has had to become highly skilled at slurping from the government teat, since nuclear power isn’t economically viable otherwise—it’s worth recalling that no nation on earth has been able to create or maintain a nuclear power program without massive ongoing government subsidies. No doubt we’ll get plenty of cheerleading for fusion, satellite-based solar power, and other bits of high-end vaporware, too. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, I suspect the next big energy bubble is probably going to come from the green end of things. Over the last few years, there’s been no shortage of claims that renewable resources can pick right up where fossil fuels leave off and keep the lifestyles of today’s privileged middle classes intact. Those claims tend to be long on enthusiasm and cooked numbers and short on meaningful assessment, but then that same habit didn’t slow the fracking boom any; we can expect to see a renewed flurry of claims that solar power must be sustainable because the sticker price has gone down, and similar logical non sequiturs. (By the same logic, the internet must be sustainable if you can pay your monthly ISP bill by selling cute kitten photos on eBay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In both cases, the sprawling and almost entirely fossil-fueled infrastructure of mines, factories, supply chains, power grids, and the like, has been left out of the equation, as though those don’t have to be accounted for: typical of the blindness to whole systems that pervades so much of contemporary culture.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s not enough for an energy technology to be green, in other words; it also has to work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s probably safe to assume that that point is going to be finessed over and over again, in a galaxy of inventive ways,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>as the fracking bubble goes whereved popped financial bubbles go when they die. The point that next to nobody wants to confront is the one made toward the beginning of this week’s post: if something is unsustainable, sooner or later it won’t be sustained—and what’s unsustainable in this case isn’t simply fossil fuel production and consumption, it’s the lifestyles that were made possible by the immensely abundant and highly concentrated energy supply we got from fossil fuels. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You can’t be part of the solution if your lifestyle is part of the problem. I know that those words are guaranteed to make the environmental equivalent of limousine liberals gasp and clutch their pearls or their Gucci ties, take your pick, but there it is; it really is as simple as that. There are at least two reasons why that maxim needs to be taken seriously. On the one hand, if you’re clinging to an unsustainable lifestyle in the teeth of increasingly strong economic and environmental headwinds, you’re not likely to be able to spare the money, the free time, or any of the other resources you would need to contribute to a solution; on the other, if you’re emotionally and financially invested in keeping an unsustainable lifestyle, you’re likely to put preserving that lifestyle ahead of things that arguably matter more, like leaving a livable planet for future generations. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Is the act of letting go of unsustainable lifestyles the only thing that needs to be done? Of course not, and in the posts immediately ahead I plan on talking at length about some of the other options. I’d like to suggest, though, that it’s the touchstone or, if you will, the boundary that divides those choices that might actually do some good from those that are pretty much guaranteed to do no good at all. That’s useful when considering the choices before us as individuals; it’s at least as useful, if not more so, when considering the collective options we’ll be facing in the months and years ahead, among them the flurry of campaigns, movements, and organizations that are already gearing up to exploit the crisis of our time in one way or another—and with one agenda or another. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
An acronym I introduced a while back in these posts might well be worth revisiting here: LESS, which stands for “Less Energy, Stuff, and Stimulation.” That’s a convenient summary of the changes that have to be made to move from today’s unsustainable lifestyles to ways of living that will be viable when today’s habits of absurd extravagance are fading memories. It’s worth taking a moment to unpack the acronym a little further, and see what it implies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Less energy” might seem self-evident, but there’s more involved here than just turning off unneeded lights and weatherstripping your windows and doors—though those are admittedly good places to start. A huge fraction of the energy consumed by a modern industrial society gets used indirectly to produce, supply, and transport goods and services; an allegedly “green” technological device that’s made from petroleum-based plastics and exotic metals taken from an open-pit mine in a Third World country, then shipped halfway around the planet to the air-conditioned shopping mall where you bought it, can easily have a carbon footprint substantially bigger than some simpler item that does the same thing in a less immediately efficient way. The blindness to whole systems mentioned earlier has to be overcome in order to make any kind of meaningful sense of energy issues: a point I’ll be discussing further in an upcoming post here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Less stuff” is equally straightforward on the surface, equally subtle in its ramifications. Now of course it’s hardly irrelevant that ours is the first civilization in the history of the planet to have to create an entire industry of storage facilities to store the personal possessions that won’t fit into history’s biggest homes. That said, “stuff” includes a great deal more than the contents of your closets and storage lockers. It also includes infrastructure—the almost unimaginably vast assortment of technological systems on which the privileged classes of the industrial world rely for most of the activities of their daily lives. That infrastructure was only made possible by the deluge of cheap abundant energy our species briefly accessed from fossil fuels; as what’s left of the world’s fossil fuel supply moves deeper into depletion, the infrastructure that it created has been caught in an accelerating spiral of deferred maintenance and malign neglect; the less dependent you are on what remains, the less vulnerable you are to further systems degradation, and the more of what’s left can go to those who actually need it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Less stimulation” may seem like the least important part of the acronym, but in many ways it’s the most crucial point of all. These days most people in the industrial world flood their nervous systems with a torrent of electronic noise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Much of this is quite openly intended to manipulate their thoughts and feelings by economic and political interests; a great deal more has that effect, if only by drowning out any channel of communication that doesn’t conform to the increasingly narrow intellectual tunnel vision of late industrial society. If you’ve ever noticed how much of what passes for thinking these days amounts to the mindless regurgitation of sound bites from the media, dear reader, that’s why. What comes through the media—any media—is inevitably prechewed and predigested according to someone else’s agenda; those who are interested in thinking their own thoughts and making their own decisions, rather than bleating in perfect unison with the rest of the herd, might want to keep this in mind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It probably needs to be said that very few of us are in a position to go whole hog with LESS—though it’s also relevant that some of us, and quite possibly a great many of us, will end up doing so willy-nilly if the economic contraction at the end of the fracking bubble turns out to be as serious as some current figures suggest. Outside of that grim possibility, “less” doesn’t have to mean “none at all”—certainly not at first; for those who aren’t caught in the crash, at least, there may yet be time to make a gradual transition toward a future of scarce energy and scarce resources. Still, I’d like to suggest that any proposed response to the crisis of our time that doesn’t start with LESS simply isn’t serious. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As already noted, I expect to see a great many nonserious proposals in the months and years ahead. Those who put maintaining their comfortable lifestyles ahead of other goals will doubtless have no trouble coming up with enthusiastic rhetoric and canned numbers to support their case; certainly the promoters and cheerleaders of the soon-to-be-late fracking bubble had no difficulty at all on that score. Not too far in the future, something or other will have been anointed as the shiny new technological wonder that will save us all, or more precisely, that will give the privileged classes of the industrial world a new set of excuses for clinging to some semblance of their current lifestyles for a little while longer. Mention the growing list of things that have previously occupied that hallowed but inevitably temporary status, and you can count on either busy silence or a flustered explanation why it really is different this time.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There may not be that many of us who get past the nonserious proposals, ask the necessary but unwelcome questions about the technosavior du jour, and embrace LESS while there’s still time to do so a step at a time. I’m convinced, though, that those who manage these things are going to be the ones who make a difference in the shape the future will have on the far side of the crisis years ahead. Let go of the futile struggle to sustain the unsustainable, take the time and money and other resources that might be wasted in that cause and do something less foredoomed with them, and there’s a lot that can still be done, even in the confused and calamitous time that’s breaking over us right now. In the posts immediately ahead, as already mentioned, I’ll discuss some of the options; no doubt many of my readers will be able to think of options of their own, for that matter. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
I’ve noted before more than once that the collapse of industrial society isn’t something located off in the nearer or further future; it’s something that got under way a good many years ago, has been accelerating around us for decades, and is simply hitting one of the rougher patches of the normal process of decline and fall just now. Most of the nonserious proposals just referred to start from the insistence that that can’t happen. Comforting in the short term, that insistence is a rich source of disaster and misery from any longer perspective, and the sooner each of us gets over it and starts to survey the wreckage around us, the better. Then we can make camp in the ruins, light a fire, get some soup heating in a salvaged iron pot, and begin to talk about where we can go from here. </div>

That sounds grandiose; I'd like to minimize my personal indentured status. Working as an elder care provider, I can often work nights, which is usually like having a difficult baby - I can sleep a good enough amount to leave days free. With that rent-paying foundation, I will be going into my neighborhood and asking people if they want to have gardens in their yard, if so we can split the produce, you pay the up front costs (I can find manures for free around town, just the cost of hauling, and of course I want to stop the flow of useful humus going from people's trees in their yards directly to a toxin-infested dump. That is, I "gleaned" about 60 bags of leaves this fall, and I think it'll go a long way); and I supply the labor and expertise. (I'm no master gardener here, but I'm competent enough to make it a trade, and keep pursuing it.) I can take on between 5 and 8 gardens, I expect totaling roughly 600 to 1000 sq ft. I can probably sell some of the produce at the local farmer's market, or simply around the neighborhood.<br><br>The advantages are the small scale, the use of currently unused, almost-free resources (leaves and manure) in a pretty sustainable way, and use of "transitional technologies"(car to haul around soil, the municipal irrigation system, the wealth of information from online and library sources).<br><br>I dream about how this approach so usefully dodges needing any bureaucratic support (mostly), how it's very fractal - how it can grow without much outside support, how it deals with employment problems, indebtedness problems, pollution, waste, and reliance on unsustainable fuels.<br><br>I'm pretty much adapted to LESS - although I will say I think there are better stimulations than what industrial society has on offer, so I think untangling from its mind-forged manacles need only be re-interpreted as Less of this stuffy, narrow stimulation, and more stimulation by personal creativity. I do believe ... perhaps even a majority of people desire the disentanglement from industrial lifestyle ... but don't know where to start. But the beginning can be as simple as not wanting all those chemicals in your baby's food. And starting with a garden to be free of that, a lot of other minor, almost invisible insurrections can be deployed.<br><br><a href=#c6145140822440250411 title="comment permalink">1/7/15, 7:33 PM</a><br><br>

In my area there are plenty of people who upon realising industrial civilisation is in decline and in trouble have fled to the bush , bought a few acres and are loudly extolling the virtues of thus newly discovered mythical beast " the community " of which they of course must be at the centre . These people dont seem to realise that there is already a community long established and in place , one with its own set of values and unique internal logic and hierarchy . Having grown up in the bush myself , i understand that community is not about standing around the local footy oval holding hands singing kumbayaya , extolling the virtues of "intentional community " and / or denouncing or denigrating anyone who still remains connected in some way to the faltering industrial apparatus , which will inevitably fail regardless of wether you choose to impoverish yourself or not .<br><br>In Australia , at least , living in a bush community is all about "unintentional community " , that is , you interact spontaneously , go about your business quietly , dont make too much noise or upset the locals with grandiose communal schemes that they were obviously too dopey or uneducated to organise themselves . Help out if you see a need , ask what you can do to help .Accept that if you were not born in the area you will probably never be viewed as a local but a perennial outsider , though your kids will be eventually seen as locals , particularly if they play sport and go to school there . Dont shove green or leftist memes down anyones throat , the two being somewhat indistuinguishable in Australia at least ..if you are very skilled at something , this will be quietly recognised by word of mouth in due course . <br><br>Be careful aligning yourself to any particular meme or viewpoint , i get the sense that many of the people who are in the bush now living in gentrified eco homesteads that are being heavily subsidised by passive income / large quantities of fossil fuel or government handout in healthcare or direct payment will in many cases not be able to sustain their presence for ling when things start to get really tough . There will be a massive change of the guard . Many of the ideologically driven intentional communitarians and collapsitarians may well be rissoled and the old guard locals will come to the fore with their network of intergenerational contacts and mutual support networks . Go quietly and humbly in the meantime and have a bet each way would be my advice dear punters ; watch the Old Conservative spirit of Burke quietly rise , which is what the Archdruid is suggesting may well happen , i gather .<br><br><a href=#c7510657944532347623 title="comment permalink">1/7/15, 8:35 PM</a><br><br>

We do not have any expectation or desire to live the lifestyles of our parents. In fact I think we are at our happiest camping and hiking with minimal material things. I think many people in their 20's like myself have found it pointless to acquire material wealth and are instead searching for inner wealth of a more abstract kind.<br><br><br> In my area have seen many people try communal living with urban garden projects. I can't help but be skeptical of the hippy lifestyle and I find many things about it completely naive and their vision of the future. Other communities in the area are Mennonite and not so friendly to outsiders. With such a wide array of people and belief systems and the way people have "atomized" across the country over the past 100 years it has occurred to me there is likely no community of similar thinking people "to be found."<br><br>On Cars:<br><br>I have thought long and hard about the car-less lifestyle and have deemed it impractical for myself for the time being. I think there may be a sedentary strategy for approaching this future of "catabolic collapse", but there is also a nomadic strategy. I think automobiles will remain and important part of the latter in the decades ahead, but the way they are used may change drastically. Trips will not be taken lightly and I think people may find their hybrid electric cars very cramped to try and live out of if it were necessary. I try to drive as little as possible and stock up as much as permitting when it comes to groceries and other consumables.<br><br>Many people of my generation and demograph have given up the idea of owning land, a house, or having children. With so much speculative imaginary wealth thrown into assets its really impossible to do so, and then there is of course the debt issue. We have replaced houses with apartments and children with cats and dogs. At some point in the future I think a new equilibrium will be reached and assets will deflate massively. I don't see any sense of a nation full of foreclosed houses and commercial space and a nation full of homeless people. <br><br>You have made it clear how disastrous acting on a vision of the future can be with progress. I hope to make my best decisions by listening to the present and the world around me this very day. Another wonderful post, looking forward to staying tuned! ;)<br><br>Crews<br><br><br><br><a href=#c7941307361594011690 title="comment permalink">1/7/15, 10:24 PM</a><br><br>

Thinking out loud, JMG; I do not want to imagine what is in store for most people in a situation similar to mine. I fear things will get extremely horrific and ugly for urban homeless in the years to come, and am lucky to be one of the few who can get out of here, if only for a short time, to a supportive relationship situation. It will give me some time to think, which is mostly what I've been up to: reading these blogs silently and any other material I can grasp. It's time for action, though. Too much stalling on my part.<br>One of the unsung skills on this blog, imo, is wilderness survival. Of course, this gets bandied about by the "prepper" community so much, as though everyone will be rushing out into the boondocks to their bunker...no. The word "survival" itself has come to sound ridiculous, thanks to the paranoid chicken littles, but it's going to be important to regain and circulate that knowledge in a world where easy medical care may not be handy much longer.<br>However, it is a lost art and something at least a few people will need to brave if there's much hope of an integration toward the rhythms of nature and the Earth. Perhaps houses themselves require too much strain on the environment, and are getting in the way. Hell, a few centuries ago, they certainly caused a problem for Europe once all the trees were gone! <br>I wouldn't recommend braving the wild alone as a good idea during crisis moments, but it's probably going to happen and who's in a better position than someone without a home to begin with hah.<br><br>What is puzzling and depressing to me about the 'preppers', is their lack of action. I believe you mentioned once, their main move seems to be just buying more things. But, how many of them are actually testing themselves, right now, to deal with those crises? <br>It's not the most optimistic approach, but lately my mind has wandered in the direction of great expanses of forest (the few left), deserts and tundras. I'm more than likely to put it off for a while longer, not wanting to damn myself with ignorance like that poor guy "Into the Wild" but I'd like to get started before it feels necessary..<br><br><a href=#c481574049376035308 title="comment permalink">1/7/15, 10:24 PM</a><br><br>

I many readers of this blog fall in an uncomfortable grey area. Like myself.<br><br>On one hand, I run a small business that does low-tech, low cost home energy upgrades, and each year we produce net energy savings on the order of that used by half a dozen households. My kids are adopted and walk to school. We grow some of our own food. Our house is small, old, and efficient. <br><br>On the other, I also fly occasionally with the family. And sometimes drink wine and eat foods from continents away. And often drive. And use the internet. And participate in myriad other social and financial activities that directly and indirectly support the current status quo. Some of these I might forgo, but only if I were willing to lose my wife and perhaps my children.<br><br>The difficulty is not just living with LESS. I welcome that.

The big publishing corporations are on their way out, no question, but publishing on a smaller scale was a successful gig in the 16th century; I've built my career as a writer with smaller presses of the kind that can manage the transition. I make very little money from the internet; when it starts becoming unstable, this blog will morph into a print newsletter, or possibly a column in a magazine -- another thing that was a successful concern before the industrial revolution. Meanwhile, I've got two plan-B professions already lined up, in fields that historically do well in depressions, and am getting the necessary training and experience right now. And you? <br><br>9andalf, the creme de la vaporware! Since nobody's got a working fusion reactor and the US hasn't put an astronaut further out than low earth orbit since 1972, that one's laughable -- but you're right, it'll doubtless get its share of heavy marketing. <br><br>Pyrrhus, under most circumstances, your best bet is to adapt in place. Mind you, that's difficult without water! If you can arrange for a stable water source, even if it's scant, that's one thing; if not, heading for wetter country might we wise. <br><br>Tripp, yes, it's hard work -- and yes, the line between what's appropriate at your level and what's pushing things too hard is a fairly common discovery, and one to pay attention to. Glad to hear you've hit it, though -- that usually happens with the more serious students. Other than "take it a step at a time," the best advice is what you learn from your own experiences...<br><br>Lilith, you've already landed amid the ruins; now it's a matter of figuring out how to navigate the rubble. I've never been in your position, so don't have a lot of first-hand advice to offer, but I hear from (and about) more and more people every year who have dropped out of the mainstream economy and are managing to get by; you might see who you can find who's already there, and see what they can teach you. <br><br>Onething, the interesting thing is that at this point I've heard from a number of people who've made the transition to a low-energy lifestyle with children -- and after a fairly brief bout of withdrawal, the kids are much happier. That gives me a lot of hope. <br><br>Andrew, glad to hear that you've collapsed ahead of the rush! If a car is useful or necessary for you right now, by all means -- each of us has to make his or her own choices. <br><br>Vesta, pretty much everyone in the industrial world lives in the gray area. As I noted in response to Andrew, we each have to make our own choices, some of which will work and some of which won't.

For if those examples in other circumstances led economically profitable existences, then there'd be a surplus, and at that point indebtedness would decline - or even shock, horror - stagnate. That thought alone is enough to send the average economist running for cover! ;-)!<br><br>I've often explained to people that the larger economy is not really much different to that of a household. Sure the printing presses can be spun and military pressure can be exerted, but eventually someone, somewhere has to cough up for the inevitable bills for day to day expenditure and additional infrastructure.<br><br>Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that whether we as a society invest in additional infrastructure, or not, entropy ensures that if it is not maintained properly then it slowly degrades year by year. Entropy gets all of us in the end.<br><br>I think about these sorts of things because the farm here is not connected to very much in the way of the sorts of infrastructure that people are familiar with. It is an eye opening experience.<br><br>What a score too with the prediction of forthcoming bankruptcies with the fracking companies. I'd say congratulations but perhaps I know a bit too much about the human side of such things. Incidentally as a small side note of interest, in the past few months, I've spotted many of the top end of town sort of people here selling their expensive houses and moving into the rental market. Very interesting indeed! I guess most games have an end game?<br><br>One of the things that I worry about is that the industrial agriculture system requires such huge inputs to maintain existing yields in ever poorer soils. It has been my observation that every time an agricultural system increases yields over that provided by nature through energy intensive methods, then there are unintended consequences which require further applications of more stuff. There is a complete failure to think about the entirety of the system. A good example here is: Strawberries. They produce very strongly in November and early to mid December, then they swap from producing fruit to producing more runners (i.e. new strawberry plants on long tendrils). If I was to extend the fruiting season for strawberries, I'd have to start replicating the earlier conditions of Nov and Dec. This means more shelter for the plants and much more water, which means much more stuff. And stuff will eventually get harder to obtain in a declining system – even water.<br><br>Renewables... They're really great, but honestly I get tired of explaining to people that here at this location you get a reliable average of 1 peak sun hour per day for three weeks either side of the winter solstice. That means my 4.2kW solar array will provide 4.2kWh per day and the system itself uses up 0.5kWh per day of that amount. There is no more to be had for love or money out of the system. They always look at me and say, “surely this can’t be true” as if I had a reason to lie about it.<br><br>A couple of months ago, local people were harassing me to attend a local meeting about renewable energy (I suspect it might have had something to do with the transition movement). I declined because their basis of belief was so very wrong. They kept repeating a mantra at me about how battery prices would come down and the technology would just get better. Batteries however are such a mature technology, I just fail to believe that mantra.<br><br>cont...<br><br><a href=#c3186552809231642160 title="comment permalink">1/7/15, 11:45 PM</a><br><br>

I myself have been trying to live by the concept of LESS - it's what I wrote my <a href=http://22billionenergyslaves.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/the-kayak-of-sanity.html rel=nofollow>blog post</a>about this week. Frankly I didn't need much of a push to ditch the mind-numbing and soul-crushing office job, but it is still rewarding on many levels to know that what I am doing fits into a broader picture. You might be amused to hear that posters have appeared all over the London Underground telling commuters that their <a href=http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/david-graeber-pointless-jobs-tube-poster-interview-912 rel=nofollow>jobs are pointless</a>. It certainly tickled me.<br><br>One thing I have noticed more of recently is anger. Cherokee pointed out that anger is a mask for fear, so that makes sense. This is especially obvious today in the wake of yesterday's attacks in Paris. There is a lot of vitriol spewing from formerly calm people - I fear that we may just have crossed a rubicon in Europe. On the one or two occasions I have tried to point out that if we stopped invading and bombing predominantly Islamic countries, raining down remote-control death by drone and propping up corrupt leaders - then maybe 'they' wouldn't want to exact revenge on us. Heavily-armed 'freedom-hating' maniacs don't just magically emerge from a vacuum.<br><br>But many people are in no such mood for such wooly thinking - they demand blood. Unless something miraculous happens in the meantime I can see France putting the Front National into power. This would soon be followed by similar parties in Scandinavia and elsewhere.<br><br>Time to hunker down, pick your fights wisely and live with LESS, methinks.<br><br><a href=#c1007678453850043401 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 1:46 AM</a><br><br>

What comes first in mind is shortwave ham radio and a few good friends around the world - which you can easily get a hold of once you will start using your ham radio setup on a regular basis. You will perhaps realize that the people you get to know and meet via radio alone become, in time, a sort of second life that you have in parallel with your first "real" one. Which happens today as it is on the internet - albeit with one rather significant difference: the people that are able or willing to build or even maintain in good working order a hf radio setup are rather different from the screen swiper variety you will find around on the blogs. So when need will arise I am sure you could find a way to broadcast your column to some youf your more distant readers - or listeners as it well may be.<br><br>On another hand I appreciate your take on the civilization around us from a country that has only recently seen the benefits of the capitalist industrial world as we have been under a rather strict dictatorial ruling until 1989. I still remember the garden plots - established through mutual, tribal-like agreements among neighbours being maintained around the high rise condominiums, that used to feed the people as food was sometimes in short supply. Right now those patches of land are occupied by car parking spots, for while yesterday people used to have no other personal transportation device than a bicycle - save for the luckiest that eventually got a car, once the common folk were able to get their hands on western produced vehicles everything changed and car ownership skyrocketed. I can still remember the stories of my uncle recounting how he and his family stood watch at the potato crop by night so they would not be stolen just before harvest time - this happened a bit longer ago, in the 60's or so. Given all of this I am dumbfounded by the fact that it only took one generation (aka 25 years) for people to forget all of this and take for granted a type of industrial capitalism that brings you everything you are programmed to want on a silver platter, if you would only follow the rules of the system and become the nice, obedient cog that you are destined to be.<br><br>My only gripe is that when I tell people that all of this happening around us is only a short ride on the expanding economy rollercoaster that is bound to also go down now that it went up, they look at me with incredulous expressions on their faces and state that "it can't be that bad" and "they'll figure something out" - no matter what their social or cultural background is, worker class, clerks, academia, you name it.<br><br>Somehow I can understand that after just having gotten to this lavish lifestyle, as you call it, they would want for it to continue, but from want to reality there is a long way and they seem not to understand all that's involved.<br><br>Still, I have managed to find a few folks that somehow have a clearer view of the events and I am trying to expand this circle of friends in the hope that someday we will be able to help each other in a new kind of economic environment.<br><br>Best wishes for you and your folks and hope to hear your words on shortwave radio when the time shall come.<br><br>Dan<br><br><a href=#c598727115062730850 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 2:15 AM</a><br><br>

A request, though. It is the collective that I really long to hear about and debate now, not just the individual. My vocation is public service - helping public health systems to fall apart in the most controlled and slowest way possible, in our context here. In the long descent, while things will get worse and harder and poorer, I am sure you would agree that - in the lifetimes of most of your readers - there will probably still be governments, and probably still be people like me trying to serve the common good. How we do that, and how we revive the real traditions of democracy and good government for the people that have been slowly starved of legitimacy these many years - that's what I'm hungry to learn and to develop. Like you, I tend to chuckle at the grandiose schemes to save the world. But there is nothing wrong with managing decline as wisely as possible, and that needs more than our individual family and personal responses.<br><br>I should declare that I am an economist by training.

And then it's no big deal to us.<br>So what if we are fighting the wrong battle, or asking the wrong questions to ourselves ? Is it truly, as I hope it is, a moment where we can stand for freedom of speech, or is it not the standoff of the bourgeois intellectual / upper middle class ? Terrorism does not pop out of nowhere. Maybe we have been locked in a social conflict which is cristallyzing only now, but has had ample time to ferment...<br>I now believe that these questions are central to this blog's project : pursuing Green Wizardry and appropriate skills may be the easiest part of the journey, what will be considerably more difficult is dealing with the overall social context especially when the latter comes under increasing stress.<br>You were mentionning police brutality in the US, and loss of allegiance on the part of said forces of order.

Both of your blogs have become vital to my sense of community. It is an advantage to get a wider context on ideas I've been trying to experiment on for years.

I had already wondered what you were going to do post-internet and am glad you plan to keep writing. You never know, the grid may collapse sooner than we think.<br>@Lilith Aurora, I have been in a similar place, I think, although anyone scraping by is in a unique position. For me, the most difficult aspect was being alone and invisible in strange places. Being in a survival mode is more practical in a familiar forest. My life feels more secure in my native northeast than it did in other parts of North America. When I worked in other areas I found that working in smaller towns was better because I could walk short distances to a campsite. Also, since all the options seem to be low paying jobs now we may as well do the jobs that develop skills that may still be viable after the crash. Trades, cooking, handyman work, caretaking, etc. should still be useful after most professions are irrelevant.<br><br><a href=#c111335385265184815 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 7:48 AM</a><br><br>

One thing I remember about being without a steady place to live was that everyone always congregated together in the city and my own experience was that the fewer people I ran into the better. Of course I needed the things that other people had so I ended up looking for friends family or random supporters myself. Then I joined the Army and was brought into the world socialism where almost everything was provided for you. Later I took the skills I learned on the streets and the outdoor skills I learned poorly in the Army and combined them and with some minor hiccups I was able to live quite happily outdoors with very little material support in ostensibly public lands. But I was on the West Coast and that really made a difference. In the winter you can head South and West toward the coast and when things warm up and the snow begins to melt you can head higher and deeper into the national forests that run North-South across almost the entire length of the West coast. <br><br>The law is never on your side even when it is and I’m an attorney now so trust me on this: you have no practical rights whatsoever even if the regulation or laws say otherwise. As a consequence you will want to avoid contact with agents of the state, ranchers and most people really so it ends up being a pretty lonely experience. Food was never a problem as long as you have keen eye for it and are willing to keep moving. Sickness like sudden flu which I got once, from a hiker I met, can really be a set back as could serious injuries (although I was lucky enough never to have one). With the exception of a sleeping bag camping gear was useless it all just fell apart within a few weeks but then again you don’t really need much just a way to carry some things like a sleeping bag, pot, spoon and whatever you use to catch small game (squirrel, grouse, and fish figured heavily) and keep warm. Avoid firearms they add too much weight and trouble because law enforcement will stop you from time to time on roads and resupply and they are noisy. I could never shake my addiction to caffeine and I frequently found myself in a sort of paranoid fascination with the prospect that I wouldn’t be able to resupply with instant coffee or that I might run out of flour another item I always carried. Bizarre scenarios would then fill my head with the terrible consequences of what could result and then I’d forget about it for a while and a few hours later the odd paranoia would begin again. As I said loneliness was a major issue. I’ve often wondered whether there could be some way to engage in that lifestyle more collectively perhaps with seasonal gatherings but I’m not sure what happens when you age or become disabled.<br><br><a href=#c4029993543255135708 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 8:16 AM</a><br><br>

While I do want to save energy for environmental reasons, first and foremost I’m trying to save money because I live on an extremely small SS check. I have no central heating system and mostly heat with wood with some electrical for backup. My bedroom regularly dips into the 40s by morning (the secret to being comfortable is to use fleece throws as your sheets). The first rule for coping with this is ACCLIMATE. I didn’t start heating this winter until 2nd week in December and then only because it dipped below 0 outside. Over a few weeks your body gets accustomed to the lower temps (I understand you also burn more calories that way). My first objective is to keep the pipes from freezing and then I think about myself. I don’t heat the room – I just heat me.<br><br>One of my biggest expenses was the gas bill to run the hot water tank. Four years ago I turned off the tank May 1st and used a black hose in the sun – works great. I built an outdoor shower that I can use thru about Sept 15th. This is the first winter that I haven’t turned the hot water tank back on and I’m just fine. I bought a 6 gallon restaurant-style aluminum stock pot that I heat in the morning and it stays hot without additional heating for 6 hours or more. The second rule is to stop taking a shower or bath everyday – what a waste! I average about 2 baths a week – but then I live by myself – so who’s to complain?<br> <br>The washing machine is outside, so it doesn’t get used in the winter. I never use laundry soap; I use the waste water to irrigate during the summer. During the winter I hand wash most things and it’s not as difficult as some might think. I have been amazed at how clean things get using a washboard.<br><br>All my north facing windows have styrofoam boards cut to fit that I use year-after-year. My south facing windows either have heavy-lined curtains or styrofoam boards that I pop in overnight. Also on the south side of the house I have built a greenhouse that regularly supplies heat while the suns out.<br><br>I understand most people can't imagine sleeping in such a cold bedroom or heating on a stove. However, I suspect we ought to get use to it; someday it may be the only way we can live.<br><br><a href=#c6508267874748598625 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 8:25 AM</a><br><br>

I'm frankly sick of talking about what is happening, why it's happening, who to blame for it happening (all of us), and so on. It's a bit late to be agonizing over the details and a bit exhausting trying to convince people about the subjects at hand. <br><br>My wife and I (and baby girl) keep house hunting for a nice rural property for which I have high aspirations on the Green Wizardry side of things. I lack many of the skills needed to implement those things, but a lack of expertise is no excuse (as I have to keep reminding myself). There were plenty enough people who immigrated to North America in the colonial days who went from city slums in industrial Europe to wide open plains over here who had less of a clue and fewer resources / sources of information (internets) than I do, so what's my excuse again? <br><br>Meanwhile, I just keep my fingers crossed that the crash doesn't result in the elimination of my knowledge-economy intermediation-laden government job before I can make a few mortgage payments, stow away some savings, plant the vegetable garden and buy the chickens for the hand-made coop.<br><br><a href=#c5305644523925841470 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 8:31 AM</a><br><br>

I see it all the time with friends and family who give lip service even to the small things like recycling, let alone buying secondhand, let alone living without!! When it comes to looking at processes around my little ‘stead, I try to imagine the line of energy that is required; what will I be committing myself to needing if I sign on with this tool or process? I need to balance processes that I can physically do with things I can afford. But thinking about it systemically ahead of time saves a few dead ends. <br><br>As to less stuff – that confronts me more and more, as I see the crazy actions and costs that are built in to our plastic-and-chip devices! I am old enough to remember no devices, one phone/tv in the house, no internet, etc – and it’s eerie (as I think someone else mentioned) to see how hooked folks are on their devices, even in public! And I just read a news piece about how smartphones are replacing other stand-alone tools like cameras, pedometers, etc. I do worry that some useful tools will become too obsolete (ie: unrevive-able). I still have film cameras, even one that took a single sheet of film in the back – but film is becoming unavailable – I’ll have to keep an eye on the chemicals needed to make photo-sensitive paper and see if it can print direct…<br><br>And as to less stim – a friend of mine is seeking retirement, and she is conscious enough to realize that she will have some emotional baggage around not having “work status” – she says she is torn emotionally. I haven’t yet broached to her that everyone is torn emotionally – often, but the fast pace of our lives mean we aren’t conscious of the inner conflicts – so that is one barrier most people have to slowing down! Dealing with our ambivalence to life is an important growth step; one the Americans in general seem to not be taking… but that’s generalizing, and I know some (of all ages) are… <br><br>Part of the theme of my new novel (chapter/week available at <a href=www.cathymcguire.blogspot.com rel=nofollow> www.cathymcguire.blogspot.com</a> ) is learning to adapt to situation – and what it feels like.

Just wanted to say for now that my wife and I like to live by the phrase “one big step at a time.” I'm lucky to have grown up in a household run on a shoestring budget, and under a mother who truly had skills at householding, and insisted that we kids take part in the work. Still, for nearly two decades, after leaving that home, I lived the easy comfortable option, and only in the past few years have returned to those rooted skills: cooking, baking, washing clothes by hand, growing our own food, preserving it. (This next season—the next big step for me—is learning to grow medicinal herbs). Again, we like to say, “one big step at a time.” Be ambitious. Avoid, as you say, the tokenism. But also expect it to take awhile. You can't get the whole way there at once, and you can't let a little bit of failure, or even a lot of it! make you lower your sights. Have faith too, that after getting through the necessary pain involved in learning—you'll find yourself in a happier place. For myself, I've been astonished at how much better I feel about my life, now that I've recovered these skills and added to them. How much more competent. How much more creaturely. How much more human. I should add that your blog has been a huge source of inspiration in my work.

No Internet, no phone line, we do most of our own cooking, I regularly run out of minutes on my phone, I don't have a car -- it's hard to imagine what I could do without that would appreciably improve my readiness for collapse. It's not about LESS for me -- it's about more. How will I get access to the things I need (food, shelter, heat) if I can't buy them? It seems to me that it's less about lifestyle than it is about the support system for the lifestyle -- global transportation of things that could be locally produced, industrial agriculture when local organic feeds people too, throwing electricity at mechanical tasks, and a massive waste of human labor at jobs like mine that serve no social function; hence my presence on this forum in the middle of the workday.

So I get the bulk of my income building fancy architectural metal work, and helping my industrial clients fix their cnc machine tools, though I know these things will not survive the next big step down the collapse staircase.

It is humorous and a bit nerve wracking when a city dweller decides to relocate here, which happens from time to time. They come in with big ideas about this community that typically revolve around themselves. If they are smart they soon realize that their worth in the community is directly related to how helpful they are to others in daily life. Nobody cares if they were once a hotshot somewhere else. My best advice - and I know this well because I was once a newcomer here - is to put all your ideas on the shelf when you come to a rural community and just be as cheerful and helpful as possible. Find out what things the locals say they need and do that. After a while you might be able to quietly integrate one of your shelved ideas but most likely you'll discover that they were rather silly and will be too busy getting actual work done to bother with them. Moving to a rural community is a humbling experience and if you let it be, a deeply rewarding one. I could write a whole bunch on this topic - it really fascinates me!<br><br><a href=#c3045182987172650972 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 9:52 AM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_b6373a" id=c2432972297342973230></div><b><a href=http://daelach.livejournal.com/ rel=nofollow>daelach</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>@ Myosotis: applying any anti-mold stuff is useless unless you fix the cause - except if you just want the mold to get away for long enough so that you can sell the house. The cause is that the relative humidity is too high near the walls (like in a tent overnight), especially if they are the coldest point. That happens often when you put new thermo windows into an existing building. Before, the windows were the coldest point, and water used to condense there. After, it goes to the walls and yields mold. Even worse if the old windows were leaky and the new ones are not. All in all, it is really bad to just put in new windows, but that's done fairly often since it saves a lot of energy with little investment - at the price of ruining the whole house afterwards.<br><br>Another bad idea is heating across rooms. The warm, moist air goes into a cold room, cools off, and while the absolute humidity remains the same, the relative one goes up, and when 70-80% are reached, the mold says "hi". That's especially a problem if you have a point-like heating (e.g. an oven) in a big room. Even worse when that heat point is far away from the outer walls because the chimney is in the center of the house. If there is no heating in a room, it is better to leave it cold because that will also stop mold.<br><br>Construction faults like cold bridges are also an issue, like concrete balcony stays. Buying a hygrometer for checking the humidity close to the outer walls generally is a good idea. <br><br>Solutions: First insulate the outer walls, then do the windows. You could add some styrofoam plates outside, but that can give problems with algae, especially when the toxic finish washes down (and then contaminates the soil). Plus that they are expected to last about 20 years, which is not overly useful for the future.<br><br>Adding a thick layer of glass wool onto the existing outer wall and then laying bricks over it, thus building a second outer wall around the house, is more expensive, but should last. Obviusly, that costs less for a smaller home, plus that a smaller home has less outer area over which it can loose heat. Maybe the LESS thing should be considered here. Or maybe selling the house and building a new, small one with good walls could be another option.<br><br>Anyway, with cheap, thin outer walls, you will always have problems. That type of house featuring a big housing area at a low initial price is a product of cheap heating and cooling energy and just will not do well under scarcity conditions. In that case, it could make sense to get a real house either built of stone or even of massive wood (if built correctly). Preferably from before the big oil boom, i.e. from times when people still knew how to build. You can fix a good old house that has some issues, but you can hardly fix a newer house that <i>is</i> an issue.<br><br>Provide airflow, and for saving energy, you can use a heat exchanger (encapsulated tubes or so) so that the outgoing warm air heats up the ingoing cold air without mixing. Or in summer, the other way round. You can use thermosolar heating. That's especially useful if the seasons where you need to heat up the house have quite some cold, but sunny days. Even if that isn't enough, it is still helpful to cut down the amount of gas, oil, wood or whatever.<br><br><a href=#c2432972297342973230 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 10:27 AM</a><br><br>

I would caution that any camp fire gatherings in the outskirts of cities or in towns should have a few sentries posted; not for people for but wild dogs. Russian friends have told me lots of stories of problems with wild dogs – you don’t want to use a loud weapon either, since that just attracts more of them…<br><br>One suggestion, which I hope gets some traction, that I have mad to local folk is to group together in the near-term. Many people, particularly the younger set, are barely able to get by with the under (or non) employment currently available and are somewhat ‘trapped’ in many urban areas trying to move ahead as much as possible. I certainly don’t feel that these areas are very good choices. I have suggested that groups get together and then look at purchasing property in more rural areas – somewhat like the old ‘communes’. Then they can continue to work in the city but gradually build up the rural property as a group.<br><br>I think that this would also help with the common personality of those that seem most aware. Many of these folk are somewhat ‘misfits’ for the general herd so grouping together does not seem to come naturally. A common goal of getting a rural place set up might be a great path forward.<br><br>I am very much looking forward to seeing your ideas and suggestions.<br><br>I feel it is very unfortunate that many are saying they are “too old” for any living standard less than what they currently have. My mother is 72 and lives completely off grid in an 18x26 cabin. She is quite far north in Ontario and, for example, recently went through a week of -20℃ (-32 with wind chill). Water often freezes near the front door during the night but her wood stove keeps the sleeping loft very comfortable. Her wood fired sauna is great this time of year. Her lifestyle is tough but then again, as she often states, it is also the main reason that she is as healthy and capable as she is.<br><br>I recommend people take a look at the movie “Happy People” for a few ideas on cold weather low-tech living…<br><br><a href=#c1748685962477700863 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 12:21 PM</a><br><br>

Last night, with the mercury set to hit -8F, we turned our furnace on (to a balmy 60F) for the first time all winter. It was great. But what’s really great is that since I first turned that thermostat down at your request, we’ve come to find 55F (with our woodstove) completely acceptable (though most days we can get it quite a bit higher than that if we want to). Hard to know how low we can go, but I suspect it’s a good deal lower than 55, if needs be. As temps will rise into the 20s tomorrow, the furnace will go off again. Our goal is to make a tank of fuel last 2 years. When we first moved in 8 years ago, we used 3 tanks a year. Heading in the right direction, anyway. Thanks for the nudge.<br><br>This year’s resolution is to stop producing garbage. The usual kind, plus recycling and fossil fuel-based emissions too. Seems straightforward on the surface, but I am finding it profoundly difficult, in large part because of the time commitment and planning involved. From eliminating car trips to producing every food item from bulk/whole ingredients to keeping up with the goat milking/egg collecting to finding a home for outgrown clothes/unused household items I spend hours of every day in support of this resolution. It’s Day 8 of the new year, and I am already exhausted by the effort. And I actually know what I am doing, more or less. <br><br>For me, the furnace example and the challenges of achieving my resolution are powerful reminders of the importance of making these changes right now instead of waiting until we are forced by circumstances to do so. I can’t imagine just beginning down this path in the teeth of crisis.<br><br>It is also a reminder that for millennia, humans didn’t need to worry about what to do with their garbage—I suspect my grandparents, as children living in poverty, produced next to none (though what they did produce I bet was burned on site, like on most farms back in the day). And I bet the tasks I find most challenging in my pursuit of the “no garbage” lifestyle—sweating over the canner in summer for example-- were done side by side with others—making tedious tasks more endurable, if not downright enjoyable. That’s the part I want to work on this year, because at the moment, to quote Yupped “it is a lonely business in practice.” <br>Though perhaps we won't be lonely much longer...<br><br><a href=#c2273104093151149954 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 12:28 PM</a><br><br>

Where will the raw materials be from? Who will repair their robots, with what parts, where shall they come from? Who will guard the whole supply and manufacturing chain? Given that electronics need raw materials from all across the earth and thus a globalised transport economy, which is precisely what will cease to exist? Or, to begin with, who will work and guard the acres with their food? And if they put up enough mercenaries to force some slaves, then these will find out rather sooner than later that they'd be better off disposing of the rich and putting themselves in their place. That's what happened e.g. in Ancient Rome. That's how the warlord society will come, see earlier TADR articles.<br><br>If they even make it to that stage, which can be doubted given the senility of the current elites. It's possible that the people dispose of them earlier because they figure out that they can't afford the rich any longer.<br><br>You see, the skills required for being a ruler in a dark age have little to nothing in common with those required for tapping a complex financial system in a parasitic way. That's why we will see a near 100% change of the elites.<br><br><br>@ Pinku: You'd be astonished how many (though by far not all, of course) quite average, healthy and well-emancipated women actually like "soft games" with the right partner, with being tied (but not including pain, that's much less common). Not because of "Shades of Grey", that selling success just made it obvious. However, the basis is not "his" strength, but "her" trust to "him". While "he" may have the dominant position within the game, "she" decides whether there is a game at all - an interesting dominance inversion. Actually, "he" may lead, but only because "he" serves, which is why "she" allows "him" to lead. So the big difference to rape is that "he" knows perfectly well that in order to repeatedly have such a game with "her", "he" has to take care that "she" enjoys it as to be inclined for another round. And "she" knows that "he" knows that, that's trust. I used quote marks because the whole story works the same way if the roles are exchanged.<br><br>No wonder Rand never understood this delicate twofold matter; the narcisstic, selfish psychos she adored were never trustworthy to begin with. That's an important point because our whole current elite (of the very Rand type) doesn't get what being an alpha is all about, namely making the best decisions for the whole and therefore enjoying the trust of the people and thereby earning a somewhat bigger share. As in the small scale example above, leading and serving must go hand in hand. As soon as an elite looses track of that, their decadence begins, preparing their fall.<br><br><br>For the LESS thing.. given how much basically useless waste of resources our culture is endulding in, there is also a positive aspect: how really much we can drop before things get really ugly. However, it's hard to make some car-addicts understand that their heads will not explode if they don't turn the ignition key every day. Or to tell the always-on smartphone addicts that their lives will not end if they cannot see what their "friends" are doing any moments.<br><br>Strange, isn't it - e.g. cocaine is outlawed although it ultimately destroys just the consumer himself. Oilaine destroys whole regions as seen with fracking. Cheap consumoine gratification shots as co-addiction destabilise the whole global ecosystem.

There are people who were responding to the future in useful, productive ways then got distracted or burnt out. There are people who have cast a casual glance at an essay but don’t read it too deeply. Even among readers have chosen to try to do something there’s a wide spectrum from the person who is committed but hasn’t acted to the person who has mastered a trade, collapsed ahead of the rush found a niche with all the awkward grey spaces in between. That leaves the question: how little is too little? How late is too late? Does the line get drawn when someone falls through the cracks? When the next wave of crisis gets underway in their neighborhood? Or is there meaningful work to do for anyone alive in a still extant civilization? What would be your advice to a reader who is collapsing but didn’t get to avoid the rush? Or who may be getting exposed to these ideas for the first time through a book decades from now when the next wave of crisis has already turned into a chapter in a history book? There’s also the “we” that is our friends, family and community members who may be skilled craftsmen, gardeners, healers, and tinkers but don’t think in the least about personal responsibility or lifestyle change.

(Which were a calming influence while I coped with a future redefined.)<br><br>I like to think I've made some progress. We moved from two cars to one, which we only use on the weekend. We moved from the 'burbs to D.C., allowing me to walk or bike to work. I've been cultivating a practical and detached perspective on physical possessions. We're cooking more, buying our food locally, and trying to minimize consumption. The changes are largely cosmetic, but they’re something.<br><br>But my problem moving forward is essentially twofold:<br><br>First, I work in journalism, a profession that lately requires being inundated in all things frivolous and digital in order to stay on top of the pile. By disengaging from the beast, I’d be undermining my livelihood. I've always been very technologically oriented, and I just don't think I have the practical skills at the moment to move to a lower-energy job that can put bread on the table in the long term. On the plus side, I work in public radio, so my conscience is largely clear. (Feel free to contact me if you’ve got any story ideas from western Maryland, by the way, I think that’s technically within our coverage area.)<br><br>Second, trying to be part of the solution quickly runs up against the problem of family. Even if I was eventually able to get my spouse to see what the future has in store for us, there is no conceivable way I could convince my parents or in-laws — who are more firmly entrenched in unsustainable lifestyles than almost anybody I know — that doing with LESS isn’t willful self-destruction. It’s less a problem at the moment, but if we have a kid or two in the years to come, I can only imagine the hysteria it would cause.<br><br>I just don't think most in the upper middle class circles I was born into are capable of viewing the world differently until fate actually smacks them in the face.

When your grand children are adults, what will you have left them? The skills and tools for more primitive dentistry than what you currently can practice, but better than existed 200 years ago? A home that, while in town (which is no bad thing) is sturdy, efficient with the fuel procured from the local forester, and provides ample garden space to grow both vegetables and the herbal aids to the dentist? You are in the best situation to obtain such a home, with an eye to a dentist fifty years from now and what he will need to sustain his practice.<br><br>40 acres and a mule are an answer, but there are many other possible answers, and unless you find yourself yearning desperately for the acreage and mule, keep to your current trade and plan to pass it down to the generation after your children.

Revolutions aren't part of the plan; it's a source of wry amusement to me that so few people realize that the word "revolution" literally means "going around in a circle..."<br><br>Scott, excellent. What you call "security" has a different name in dark ages, but heaven knows it's a job with a very long tradition behind it. <br><br>Cherokee, it's been my experience over and over again that the people who insist that it's possible to maintain a middle class level of energy use on renewables are all people who've never actually had to rely on renewables for any but a cosmetic portion of their energy use, if that. I've considered sometime putting together an anthology of essays by people who actually live on renewable energy, talking about the realities -- though I'm far from sure it would sell worth beans, since so many people are so heavily invested in the fantasy. <br><br>Toro Loki, a piano's very hard to keep tuned if you've got temperature variations; the guitar might be more sensible -- or you could get radical and try a folk instrument such as a dulcimer, which is (a) less expensive and (b) easy to care for, and still produces beautiful music. <br><br>Marc, one of the things that makes LESS such a powerful strategy is that the bar is set very low. I also have an internet connection, light bulbs, and central heating, but people give me the dropped-jaw look when they find out that I don't have a cell phone, say, or a microwave, or what have you. Without completely remaking your life, I bet you could easily find ways to use LESS, and that will give you more credibility in teaching others. <br><br>Jason, I loved the posters! As for the potential Rubicon, I'm worried that you're quite right. It may get very ugly in Europe in the years immediately ahead. <br><br>Dan, funny you should mention shortwave; I've recently read that a lot of the old shortwave stations have gone off the air -- which might leave room for new stations, as a venue for alternative media and the like. I've got enough on my plate that launching a shortwave station is a bit more than I can take on just now, but I could certainly see that as an option for some aspiring green wizard...<br><br>Martin, the problem I see over and over again with discussions of the collective is that they become excuses to ignore the individual. That said, I'll have some suggestions to make as we go, but be warned that top-down change on a political level is not going to play a large role in those, for reasons I'll discuss at length. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, thank you for asking some of the questions that have gone unasked! Yes, we'll be talking about that as well. <br><br>Scyther, the awkward detail that's becoming increasingly clear as the fracking bubble winds down is that not all energy resources are economically viable. The sheer inefficiency of a system based on the extraction of personal profit may turn out to be the saving grace of the system. More on this soon!<br><br>Thomas, not if it was never actually profitable in the first place, but merely managed to look that way due to an influx of investment money.<br><br><a href=#c205683771734063209 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 2:11 PM</a><br><br>

A different outlook--in the industrial system ending now, social services and other resources are concentrated in the urban areas, but those resources are not sustainable as decline accelerates. Rural areas are going to have the basic resources needed, as well as demand for labor as industrial ag winds down. Besides, the cost of living is much cheaper. Depending on the community, the ability to know your neighbors and form bonds is easier, simply because there are fewer people to get to know.

I think that protests and other forms of public pressure have made a positive difference in encouraging a number of state and local governments to ban the practice within their jurisdiction. And now we hear that Obama is saying he will veto the Keystone XL pipeline if Congress sends him the bill.<br><br>Protests certainly aren’t a cure-all, but along with other pressure tactics they can be useful. Here in the Pacific Northwest, we have had many proposals for coal export terminals to supply coal from the Powder River Basin to China. There have also been proposals in many communities to build natural gas export terminals as well. A few have been built but most are going nowhere, even though local governments and chambers of commerce have been overwhelmingly in favor. Why is this? Because these proposed terminals have spawned grass roots protest campaigns, lawsuits and delaying tactics like demands for more environmental impact studies. In many cases, the companies have simply given up after years of delays and wasted expenditures. In the town I live in, when Millennium proposed turning an abandoned aluminum plant into a coal export terminal, local government officials though it was a done deal. They want the tax revenue pretty badly and have been pushing hard for the project.<br><br>Five years later, it still hasn’t been built, the citizenry is up in arms over concerns about pollution and traffic jams (16 1 mile long trains crossing some of the busiest roads every day would create a LOT of problems and make it very difficult for emergency response vehicles to reach certain areas while the trains are passing through) and there is no end in sight for the delays. Just recently, the State of Washington announced it would be requiring yet another environmental impact study for the project. I suspect that Millennium will eventually have to pull the plug after pouring too much money down this particular rathole and getting nothing out it but a bunch of bad publicity. A proposal for a natural gas export terminal in a nearby town was defeated a few years ago as well after angry citizens made their voices heard and the company faced one procedural delay after another until they finally gave up.<br><br>Yes, we cannot stop the feeding frenzy outright, but we can slow it down and delay the heck out of it until economic forces and other factors make it untenable. As Fabius Cunctator, George Washington, Mikhail Kutusov and Vo Nyugen Giap all realized, you can often win by delaying your enemy even if you can’t beat him outright by spinning things out and imposing unacceptable costs until he finally gives up because he can’t afford to continue the fight.<br><br>Here are a couple of relevant links:<br><br>http://www.resilience.org/stories/2015-01-07/2015-the-year-we-turn-away-from-tar-sands<br><br>http://www.resilience.org/stories/2015-01-07/white-house-confirms-obama-will-veto-transcanada-s-keystone-xl-pipeline<br><br><a href=#c929481877295159131 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 4:05 PM</a><br><br>

Since we both had very secure jobs, good benefits, made plenty of money and had no kids and no plans for them, we decided to build a big custom house. That happened in 2004. The house was 4400 square feet...the three plus car garage was 800 square feet. We had a new BMW and a new VW Passat, I had plans to add a sports car or an SUV.<br><br>In early 2006 we both realized that we were not being fulfilled by our well compensated jobs, our mostly neo-con upper midwest city, or even by our big new custom house. We decided Cascadia was the place for us. We put the house up for sale and left everything behind in July of 2006, including an incredible amount of stuff. We rented a 1500 square foot house sight unseen for the fist year fairly near my wife's job, I became self-employed. Our big custom house did not sell, the real estate bubble was popping. We finally sold our house in January of 2007. Although we took a big financial hit and owed a lot of money, it still felt like we made the right decision by leaving it all behind.<br><br>in July of 2007, while paying off our debt on our "dream house", we moved to a different (1400 square feet) rental house closer to a community we liked, and still felt like we made the right decision. I sold the BMW and bought a used, compact, four cylinder truck that I use for work. That rental situation didn't work out, so in July of 2008 we moved to yet another rental house (1290 square feet) in the center of the same town, which we still really liked. We had to get rid of a lot more stuff...and didn't miss any of it. We were then within walking distance of groceries, banking &amp; most other services, including the train station...but not my wife's job. We got rid of the VW Passat and bought a Toyota Prius. Other than commuting, we started to do a lot of walking instead of driving.<br><br>In 2010 we finally paid off our debt related to the "sale" of our house. the next year, in 2011, my wife became self employed. She found an office space one block from our rental house and she started walking to work. The Prius was now a grocery getter and vacation car.

We looked at the smallest, oldest and least expensive houses that were still within walking distance of my wife's office. We were outbid many times by much wealthier parties, often paying all cash and then demolishing the small, old house and building a mansion...or two. Finally in April of 2014 we bid on another little old house. This one was a 1942, 800 square foot summer cabin with no garage and was on a very soggy but sunny lot. The house was exactly the same size as our garage back in the midwest. After a long convoluted process we ended up getting the house. There was less competition since the lot was so wet, which posed difficulties for building mansions. After getting rid of even more stuff we moved into our "new" old house on April 22, 2014. My wife's walk to work is now seven blocks. In November we sold the Prius and became a one truck family (anyone interested in my "Prius Story" just let me know).<br><br>After a long summer of pulling this old decaying house from Gaia's grip, tree removals, dirt moving and garden building, on December 12 we installed a modern, efficient but used woodstove that I acquired through barter and turned off the furnace, hopefully for good. We've been heating our "appropriately sized for two people" house completely with wood since then...it's not difficult with only 800 square feet. All of the firewood is salvaged and split by me.<br><br>Some other things that we're doing, that if you told me ten years ago I would be doing, I would not have believed: saving my own urine as garden fertilizer, making my own deodorant, not using (hair) conditioner, no showering every single morning, cooking in cast iron most days, letting the house temp drop to 52 most nights and 58 most days in the winter, saving rain water above ground in tanks and below ground in swale &amp; pond, giving excess garden produce and baked goods to neighbors and receiving eggs, honey, preserved food in return, making my own tomato sauce from my own tomatoes, grinding my own garden herbs &amp; spices in a mortar &amp; pestle, driving no more than three days each week and sometimes not at all, and on and on. Each step along the path has been more and more rewarding...the road definitely gets easier.<br><br>Cheers from Cascadia<br><br><a href=#c1921399869686085300 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 4:28 PM</a><br><br>

If you can already do research there is not much about library work you can learn at school that you can't learn from a textbook.

But I fear that, after Matt Savinar went out of the Champion's League, and Mike Ruppert went through a personal crisis which took his life, we are only left with James Howard Kunstler as Bersek Sprinter of Realistic Doom. And Gerald Celente carrying the towel.<br>Compared to Jim's prose, this blog reads like My Little Pony.<br><br><br>To utter the last words I do have on the topic of terrorism, and how we choose to react to it. There were already horrid attacks on our soil, three years ago. A fanatic went riding a scooter and shooting people. But it came as the Presidential Campaign was running in high gear, and all we were thinking at the time was whether Nicolas S., former President, would be able to instrumentalize the deed to bid for reelection and tighten the powers of the State over personal freedoms.<br>At least for me, the fact that he chose to act the bigger person and not to use those attacks to his political benefit was a relief, with little regards for the victims. This is a very horrible and cynical admission to make, I know... I would react differently now, most certainly.<br>I guess the perception of terrorist attacks draws a lot upon symbolism and social context, which may be a subject for the Galabes' blog. And I understand a little better now, in terms of feelings, how a certain Head of the United States could get away with leading his Nation into war based upon make-believe stories in the wake of 9/11.<br><br>Regarding the Front National : unlike Homeopathy, the more you delute its ideology, the less its influence. But if you reject it openly, it grows. That party has been skipped from the preparation of the national gathering to commemorate the recent attacks.<br>That is the best strategy to award your average populist party a good winning : in a context that allows it to adcquire a certain dignity and public respect, the other parties's refusal to talk to it (for understandable reasons) gives it back some of the strength it has lost by trying to look dignified. At the end of the day, the party gets a wider fanbase due to its increased respectability, and at the same time adcquires legitimate weapons in the form of the other parties' tangible and un-democratic rejection.<br>The only way to thwart such parties is to let them speak openly and prove their (in)ability to practically manage circumstances. Ridiculous CAN kill politics, after all. Right now, they probably lack the skills to govern, which is why the other politicians do not mind keeping them strong but on a leash, since it preserves the status quo as well.<br><br><a href=#c1119664768954249832 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 5:02 PM</a><br><br>

I've been a peak oil-aware journalist for about 8 years and even wrote a three-part series on the topic for the newspaper I work for in North Carolina. I can relate to the dilemma he faces working in the media while trying to use LESS (stimulation). I actually work on the digital side at my company and promote social media use among my colleagues. TV is not my problem (the only reason I have one now is that my husband wants it), but I'm pretty much online all. day. long. But I do have a strategy, and that is as long as I'm in the biz, to choose the least stressful position possible. I moved from reporting (with its demanding work hours) to more of an editing position so that I could work a fixed schedule with little night and weekend work. Just that change freed up enough time and energy to work on other LESS/sustainability goals like gardening. Yes, I'm vulnerable to layoffs long term, but no more than I was as a regular reporter. <br><br>I have other strikes against me -- a daughter with a genetic condition that requires some medical management and a spendthrift partner.<br><br>I used to argue, but now I just focus on my goals and hope he will follow. Through persistence I eliminated all of my personal consumer debt in 4 years (I just have a modest amount of student loan and a mortgage left), and I bought a house in a working class neighborhood that is well-suited for downshifting and living poor. I'm prepared to leave the industry if I need to as I'm not interested in chasing jobs all over the country. <br><br>JMG's advice has worked well for me and it is because he's done a good job preparing folks for the suck. It's so easy to play the victim, to waste time on shoulda-coulda-wouldas (and I still do that sometimes). The key is to stick with the path long enough to start seeing results.<br><br><a href=#c6940260295411837956 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 6:35 PM</a><br><br>

The auto mechanic estimated it as $1,750 + taxes for the repairs. So I felt an immediate dilemma, fix the 8 year old beater or buy something else. (I also considered being without a car)<br><br>In evaluating my options I stopped at a car dealership to see if I would qualify for a car loan for an advertised $9,000 used car. The resulting conversation with the finance manager left me (and him) reeling in shock.<br><br>I asked for a 1 year loan for the car, about $900 per month assuming some interest on the loan. He told me the minimum terms on all car loans start at 3 year terms. Also, with my poor credit history the loan would be financed above 18.9% interest for the 3 year term, and that the payments on a new car would actually be lower than buying the used vehicle. In essence, to finance a $9,000 car I would have to pay $450.00 per month for three years, so the real cost of the car with interest is $16,200.<br><br>This made no sense to me at all. He went on and on about getting into a new car to reestablish my credit score, to which I told him that I had no desire whatsoever to reestablish a credit score. I buy everything I need in cash, except for cars and houses which require a loan. With this HE was flabbergasted, questioning me saying things like 'buying things with cash is part of the reason you don't have a good credit score' and so forth.<br><br>In the end I turned the car down, deciding to fix the old car as the cheaper option to avoid the interest expense. Again, he didn't know what to make of this exclaiming that 'Everyone wants a brand new car, with the loan at the minimum payment possible!' <br><br>I told him that I don't buy anything that I don't need. in fact I'm simplifying my lifestyle and giving stuff away; what would I need a good credit score for? He then (quite frankly) told me that the auto business has changed since 2009. The focus was changed so that they charge up to 1000% markup on replacement parts for cars that fall apart with normal wear and tear, this forces people to either drive new cars or they make their margin on the car repairs instead. <br><br>I left feeling stunned. How can such an outrageous car financing scheme be regarded as normal? Surely this won't persist into the far future?<br><br><br><br><a href=#c3097322260827424523 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 7:00 PM</a><br><br>

I got off the weary-go-round in 1991 and moved to Bangkok, with only $1000 savings. I had discovered since graduating from college in 1969 that working hard in a corporate environment would not secure the American Dream unless you were good at office politics as well. I purchased 3 homes, and had to sell all at cost after 3-4 yrs due to layoffs and having to move for a new job. So after being sent on trouble-shooting trips to Thailand several times, i decided to give up my $5000 per month job and move, planning on teaching English for $500 per month to survive. Heh. This did not go as planned; the first 3 yrs i had to beg for help from friends in America when the monthly gig got cut short, or didnt come in. This happened about 3 times per year, then i got better at financial planning, and rejected some contract offers.<br> I was very lucky to have such friends. Also, i learned to keep quiet when watching locals solve a problem and not say, 'Thats not how we did it in America.' This is kinda like moving to any new community, especial rural. The pace of life is gonna be different, usually slower; dont try to speed it up. Often there is a good reason; the first being you will get dehydrated and suffer heat stroke. The customs are different as well; another opportunity for learning. The cost of living here is less; i have always lived on the 5th floor of a cold water walk-up 15 meter sq apartment. I keeps your legs and lungs strong, and only costs about $80 per month, utilities another $70. Food from the market for my wife and i costs $250. Good luck in your Mission Impossible.......rabblebabble<br><br><a href=#c3079499016706641554 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 7:24 PM</a><br><br>

It is true that broadcasting, as opposed to a back-and-forth conversation between two parties, is forbidden in ham radio by FCC rules. However, JMG might be able to cultivate a relationship with social-fringe, political-activist shortwave broadcasting station (as opposed to ham-radio station) WBCQ in Maine. WBCQ is duly licensed by FCC.<br><br>Further information on this broadcaster can be had from <a href=http://www.wbcq.com/ rel=nofollow>http://www.wbcq.com/</a> and from the (easily-Google-locatable) Wikipedia article "WBCQ_(SW)". <br><br>Up to 2012 or so, when the demons of decline were less active in Canada than they now have become, there was a radio shack on the University of Toronto downtown campus. I would sit in this shack on many Sunday afternoons, listening among other things to WBCQ. WBCQ had a nice programme on ham radio in the late Sunday afternoon - as well as other, perhaps more eccentric, more political offerings at other times of the day and week. <br><br>I would listen to WBCQ in late Sunday afternoons on 7490 kHz in the 41 metre band. The rig in the shack was a good ICOM 756-II Pro, duly grounded, and fed by a longish run of coax to a roof-mounted dipole. With that setup, WBCQ was positively blasting in - as clear as any local broadcast-band station, I think attaining S9 or S9-plus on the meter. <br><br>The favourable S-meter reading makes me think that WBCQ could be picked up even with poor equipment. Admittedly, trying just now, with my own poor 1980-vintage DX-300 general comms receiver in my basement apartment, with my long indoor random-wire antenna, I get nothing. But it may be that WBCQ is not on the air just now, or alternatively that at this time in the evening Toronto is sitting in the WBCQ trasmitter's skip zone; the skip zone is bound to move around as afternoon gives way to dusk and as the dusk gives way to deepening night. <br><br>It might make some sense for JMG to explore the possibility of a minor working relationship with WBCQ. If the WBCQ managers have sense, they will air JMG pro bono, say for twenty minutes a week, in the knowledge that airing JMG will increase their listener base. Many of us in this pleasant football stadium of a crowd will try to hear JMG on the air, even if the Internet (and with it the ADR pageset) stays up.<br><br><br>Hastily, cheerfully,<br><br><br>Tom = Toomas Karmo<br><br>20 or 25 km north of Toronto downtown<br><br>www dot metascientia dot com<br><br>Toomas dot Karmo at gmail dot com<br><br>Canadian ham callsign = VA3KMZ <br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c3444382458973565639 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 7:24 PM</a><br><br>

We now search essentially in vain even for the BBC. Last time I checked, perhaps a year ago, there was still activity from China and Russia. I think I heard little or nothing from Voice of America. Shortwave in the 1960s, when I had access to Dad's low-quality Hallicrafters S-100, was a different proposition - BBC World Service, BBC North American Service, Radio Prague (wonderful, and deeply tragic from August 1968 onward), Radio Mock-ba (this I listened to rather often, without telling Mum and Dad, wooden though the impeccably American-accented Muscovites actually were), Radio Nederland, the Voice of America in Estonian for people back home, etc etc. Around 2010, I found out that a close, dear relative back home had been listening surreptitiously to the very same Voice of America Estonian programming that I had been listening to in safety, as a 1960s resident of Canada. - Oh, and the BBC North American Service, with e.g. the radio skit featuring two girls, approx as follows: "Priscilla, you really MUST meet Gregory, - Well, what's he look like, Elspeth? - Oh he is about 6 foot 3, and rather craggy. - Oooooh. - And he plays the oboe. - Oh MY. - He drives a red Jaguar. - Oh, oh. - He works at something rather elaborate in the City, commodity futures, I THINK. - Heavens. - I think his cottage is in Provence, or maybe in Tuscany. - Elspeth, this is incredible. - He is, ah, American ...[several seconds of radio silence, technically called 'dead air']...now, really, Priscilla, he is very NICE. [more dead air]" - And the BBC letters-to-broadcaster, read out on the air, often deliciously rude, from real-life retired colonels-living-in-India and the like, read out if necessary with rude sound-effect. There is a good American saying for all this, "Puhleeze, DON'T get me STARTED."<br><br><br>Tom = Toomas Karmo = VA3KMZ<br><br><a href=#c1807414159041341542 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 7:28 PM</a><br><br>

Now that I am started on shortwave, it is hard to stop. <br><br>The worst thing that even happened in broadcasting happened on the BBC (how could it be otherwise?), back in the 1930s. The programme may have been emitted from Daventry in the Midlands on the then "Empire Service", in which case it would have gone on a mix of frequencies, and perhaps on a mix of appropriately directed beams, to all culturally significant parts of the globe. At any rate I around 1980 met a person of South African extraction who said that a relative of his had heard this particular 1930s catastrophe in Durban or Capetown or some such. <br><br>I believe the programme went out at a time of diplomatic tension, when the listeners would have included defence analysts for the Reich. The analysts would have been keen to appraise the strengths and weaknesses of the UK, both in a technical and in a political-diplomatic sense. Their analyses would have been inputs to policy making at the highest levels. <br><br>The BBC was covering the Review of the Fleet, at Spithead. <br><br>The Review involved a big array of battleships being first picked out in electric lights, with the illumination then dramatically - temporarily - extinguished. <br><br>As bad luck would have it, the BBC announcer was drunk. <br><br>The Empire, plus the Reich (one imagines in London, within the walls of Mr Hitler's local Embassy; and, one additionally imagines, in Berlin), then heard approximately the following: <br><br>[announcer, slurred] The Fleet----itsh lit up, with LIGHTSH. <br><br>[a moment later, as the lighting is temporarily turned off] The Fleet----itsh ... **GONE**. <br><br>[long stretch of dead air, I imagine for something like 30 seconds] <br><br>[new voice, from London studio:] We regret that technical difficulties oblige us to discontinue our transmission from Spithead. <br> <br><br>Hastily,<br><br><br>Tom = VA3KMZ <br><br><br>PS: On checking my facts before posting this, I find that the actual broadcast, minus the London announcer's contribution, is on YouTube. One can <br>look for "Drunken commentary, Royal Navy - BBC radio 1937", or one can just go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYIGte7fBs" rel=nofollow>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hYIGte7fBs</a>. Presumably we have to thank the BBC for diligently keeping those shellac audio-recording platters in its vaults, undamaged even in the Blitz.

My best-case scenario is a huge PV buildout, with speculative solar farms sprouting like mushrooms on federal subsidy dollars; when they go broke, salvaging the PV panels for pennies on the $20 bill will be a good way to get a home system cheap. Of course there are plenty of less pleasant alternatives. <br><br>Adrian, yes, that's also something that needs to be factored into the process. I'll have something to say about it as we proceed. <br><br>Dave, living with less takes skill and practice. If you cling to absurd amounts of energy, stuff and stimulation until it's dragged from your grip, you've just given up any chance to develop the necessary skills and get the necessary practice, and that means your life is going to be a lot more miserable than it has to be. Since we're not talking all or nothing, why not take a few steps in the direction of LESS, so you get some of the learning curve out of the way before the floor drops away from beneath your feet? <br><br>Adrian, no argument there! "Pockets of LESS" is a nice metaphor. <br><br>Heather, good question! I suggest we try to find out...<br><br>Jerry, I talked about this extensively at two of the three Age of Limits events; I'm not sure it did much, to be honest. Still, we'll see. <br><br>Kerry, thank you! You're exactly correct, of course -- it's the beliefs you don't realize you have that clobber you. A good deal of the work of this blog focuses on showing people what they actually believe, and then talking about that. <br><br>Zentao, to my mind, even if all that comes of "grouping together" is a revival of viable cooperative living arrangements, in which people figure out that they have responsibilities as well as privileges, that would be a significant step in and of itself. <br><br>Maxine, thank you! It's a source of much encouragement to me to hear from those who get it...<br><br>Kathleen, you're welcome, and thank you for the good example! <br><br>Eric, I know, it's a very diverse crowd around the fire here in the ruins. That's another of the things I find very encouraging. I have no idea how little is too little and how late is too late; all any of us can do is try, and see what the results turn out to be. <br><br>Angelus, for that matter, once you get past the initial stages of practice -- which involve a certain amount of drudgery -- spiritual or magical practice is a source of experiences that make video games seem just as dull.<br><br><a href=#c53745166708781911 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 10:23 PM</a><br><br>

I would like to encourage everyone to check it out; it can be done! <br><br>I once mentioned to my mother (who doesn't agree with me on any LESS topic in the slightest) that humans have only been "home dwellers" for a small fraction of our species existence, and "heated home dwellers" for an even shorter time. I got the blank stare of incomprehension in return - or maybe she just didn't WANT to think about it! <br><br>An unheated home still keeps the wind, precipitation, bugs and sun out - and can provide some safety for you and yours to live and sleep behind locked doors - and some safety for your "stuff" when you are absent. More importantly, both now (under the current legal system) and in any imagined future (by me), it provides you with "a place that's yours" - commonly recognized. Heat (and a/c for that matter) is optional - and might be something we all might have to learn to live without - so why not think about preparing for this eventuality - or even doing it now ("freeze now and beat the rush" :-)<br><br>Scott<br><br><a href=#c5854720416493504391 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 10:28 PM</a><br><br>

There are proven ways to get the very modest amount of electricity needed to power a couple of light fixtures, and at a time when the grid is showing signs of instability, getting some such system up and running is a good idea. I'd encourage you to get working on it, if you're not doing so already!<br><br>Chris, understood. Each of us is in a different situation, with different options, opportunities, and limits. As a reporter, I wonder if you can quietly start finding stories about people who are using LESS and having a great time at it -- having those in the media now and then might be a good source of encouragement for those considering such steps. <br><br>Onething, that figure only covers part of the total system cost -- it's like saying you can afford a car because you can pay for the gas to drive it home from the lot. In order for you to have a solar panel, what else has to exist, and be fueled, supplied, paid for, etc.? That's the whole system cost, and for PV, it's huge. <br><br>Clark, a lot of us have friends or family members who believe devoutly in the Church of Progress, and there's usually not much you can do, other than try not to get into fights and keep on doing what works. <br><br>Jason, funny. I can definitely see Jim Kunstler going back to throw a pass to Dmitry, while I sprint to intercept...<br><br>Dio, of course it's hard to produce everything yourself -- that's why peasants who do that own so little. A little trade and labor specialization goes a long way. As for neighbors, well, remember they may be thinking the same thing about you!<br><br>Patricia, thank you! I have no idea what the conversion factor would be, though. <br><br>Artinnature, thank you. That's a very encouraging story!<br><br>Bill, not if the extraction was never economically viable in the first place -- not in terms of money, but in terms of the real wealth (energy, labor, resources) that had to be poured into it. If shale fracking was never more than the petrochemical equivalent of Pets.com, and I think that's likely the case, it doesn't matter how high the price of oil goes -- it'll still cost more to extract than the oil is worth. More on this in an upcoming post.<br><br>Mojoglo, good to hear. Do you have any influence on what stories get into the paper? If so, as I noted to Chris, making sure that there are stories about people using LESS and having a great time at it might make a real contribution. <br><br>Repent, your intuition and common sense are quite correct: that sort of thing is stark staring mad. It exists because, right now, the manufacture of debt is the only really profitable business in the US; even if you can't pay the loan, it can be packaged and sold to someone as an "investment," and used to keep the charade going a little longer. Eventually? Down it goes, but when that'll happen is a good question.<br><br><a href=#c826234247956129408 title="comment permalink">1/8/15, 10:46 PM</a><br><br>

It may be that I was responsible for a few new Russian readers!<br><br>Sandy - very interesting to hear your story, and hi from a fellow English teacher.

Can we expect to see dog packs growing, I wonder, as pet-owners decide they can't afford Fido any more and abandon their dogs? Quite possibly. I was attacked by a pack once in Bali, when I took a shortcut through an empty mall, not realising that was their lair. It was terrifying; luckily, I wasn't too far from the exit when they started to circle me, and I managed to get out unscathed. Wouldn't like to repeat that experience.<br><br>It's a problem that's common in many old Warsaw Pact countries not just Russia.

I’d be happy to contribute a charming anecdote or twenty if the project was a goer?<br><br>Still, for some amusing title suggestions for the anthology:<br><br>- Stuff you should probably know about renewable energy systems before you talk about them;<br><br>- Three things renewable energy can't do;<br><br>- Zen and the effectiveness of solar panels;<br><br>- War, peace and renewables; and<br><br>- A wombats guide to the effective use of solar energy.<br><br>You know, if I had to pick a title, I'd go with the wombat. It might just work - well maybe anyway?<br><br>Wombats are sensible creatures and so last evening, the biggest of them all was out having a good solid feed before the tropical monsoon worked its way south east to the farm here. Wombats most certainly know something about solar energy and the weather! Even the spiders hadn’t quite left their webs last night.<br><br>This morning though was a whole different environment as outside here is just grey and foggy and it has drizzled all day long and looks as though it will continue to do so for the next couple of days. Honestly, the dogs haven't done much more than sleep today and occasionally harass me for some food. <br><br>Back to the wombat though and its prediction for the weather today was indeed correct and the 4.2kW of solar panels have generated 2.8kWh of energy in the entire day.<br><br>On a serious note, you have inspired me to include daily details of what those solar panels generate during the depths of winter on my blog. It should be quite enlightening for the true believers out there.<br><br>I have to laugh sometimes because I spotted an article recently which touted Germany's renewable energy generators produced 25% of that countries annual power. It is a real achievement and kudos to them.<br><br>But then, I said to myself, yeah what happened at night or when the wind didn't blow or during the depths of winter? It defies my imagination completely to believe that any point on the map in Germany could receive more winter sun than here.<br><br>The whole failure to think in systems just astounds me.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c6952053354970395726 title="comment permalink">1/9/15, 12:46 AM</a><br><br>

By disengaging from the beast, I’d be undermining my livelihood.</i><br><br>That describes my situation five years ago. I had got into journalism on the mistaken assumption that I would be doing something useful. In short order it became clear that the role of the media at this point in time is to amplify the narrative of our times and parrot out unthinking propaganda. It's a big part of the problem.<br><br>Still, it doesn't have to be like that. I launched a couple of local newspapers and sites that featured local news, events and buy/sell/swap. This could be done in my spare time and - in the case of the online one - didn't cost anything. <br><br>I had three rules. 1. Make it readable and interesting 2. Make it useful 3. Make it ethical (i.e. no selling out to big advertisers). <br><br>People will instinctively appreciate it.<br><br>You can probably rope in a few other disaffected journos to help out - there's a ready supply of them. If and when your online newspaper/magazine gets firmly embedded in the local area you can explore print options. Otherwise you could go straight into print as a news sheet, if you have some cash. Find someone who's good at sales but hasn't yet sold their soul to the devil. <br><br>If you work at it you'll be performing a very useful local service, will have an interesting job and a means of making a living. <br><br>Just remember, keep it local - just how local is something you'll have to decide for yourself.

Yes, I've come to the same conclusion too that going to library school would be a bad idea, for the same reasons, plus these additional reasons:<br><br>1. I already have a job at a library, so I don't need it to get a job. My pay is decent enough, at least for the modest lifestyle that I'm living on. (Though I'm not under the illusion that my job will be around forever.) I find experience is what is important. Some study on one's own can be beneficial, but that does not need to be through an official degree program. <br><br>2. I find that not having a MSL degree, therefore not having an official title of "librarian" (I am called a "library associate"), actually gives me more freedom at my job. In the eyes of the public, no one knows that I'm not an official librarian. I am allowed to do most kinds of work that librarians do (programming, story times, book displays, reference help), but I have less responsibility expected by my manager. If there are a few programs I want to do during the year I can do them, but it's the official librarians that are responsible for making sure the regular programming gets done. If I was an official librarian, I'd get asked to do more things that would give me ethical quandaries, such as teen video game programs. As an associate, I am a little more able to avoid participating in those aspects of contemporary libraries I despise. Also, I prefer working part-time, since it gives me time to write, read, and do work in the informal economy. My workplace has part-time options only for associates, not librarians.<br><br>3. Ever since I graduated from college with a degree in anthropology in 2001, I have stayed out of school. I find I have developed more as an autodidact, reading hundreds of books, seeking learning experiences on my own, being free to learn what I want, being in charge of what "assignments" I give myself. I think I'd find being back in school frustrating and confining.<br><br>4. From what I understand, library and information science programs these days are heavily focused on electronic media and not what would be important for deindustrial libraries. When I look at the courses in a typical MLS or MLIS degree, most don't interest me. There are a few areas sometimes covered in degree programs that I would like to study and learn more about: the history of libraries, the history of the book, and storytelling (particularly cross-cultural perspectives, focused on the oral tradition). But I figure I can learn about those areas without paying lots of money to some graduate school.<br><br>About starting a post-industrial library group: A group of six Age of Limits attendees who were interested in discussion and collaboration about cultural preservation and libraries started an email group.

My suggestion is to do it well ahead of time, maybe right now.<br><br>We live in such an area and have done so for 10 years. As someone mentioned, we can live here for for another 20 and will never be 'locals'. You have to have been born here, attended the local school, worked in the woods or at least your Dad was a logger, and so on. Gradually, those folks are dying out or have moved on themselves, but integration for many is a slow process. Even though we moved here from just 40 miles away, and my background was in logging support, plus I worked as a local teacher, our place in the scheme of things is somewhat half and half. If you don't hunt and fish and drive a truck you won't really fit in unless you have an 'in'. It is just a fact of life. By all means, garden away as we do, but trying to set up permaculture groups, sharing networks, food banks, or a transition network, you might as well put a for sale sign up right now and get it over with. I do hunt, fish, drive the truck, and like to drink and have people over so it works for us. My wife also does volunteer work for various events so we know folks. It is a pretty simple recipe for getting along, smile and fit in.<br><br>As for showing up when times get tough, I really don't think you would be welcomed unless you live with a relative. We already have our poor folks that need the odd bit of help, and hurting that need some firewood dropped off, etc. Newcomers have to bring something to the table, pure and simple.<br><br>My son and I live on two of the few places with river access. We let our friends use the ramp, and docks etc., but long ago stopped giving access to strangers. A lady across the river calls the cops when people fish in front of her place or she kayaks out to them and suggests they need to move on. This winter a father and son team stopped in and asked if they could shoot an elk on our property. They were very nice, and while feeling bad about it I said, "no". They were from the city and obtained a limited entry draw, but we put up with the elk all year and feel locals should have first dibs. <br><br>It's just the way it is.<br><br>regards to all<br><br><a href=#c1177460615947571911 title="comment permalink">1/9/15, 7:27 AM</a><br><br>

I’ve really been appreciating your comments and responses on this week’s report. A lot of people I discuss these ideas with don’t disagree with me, they just feel helpless. I hear “I’m struggling to get by as it is right now, much less put away for organic food or solar panels. I certainly can’t afford to think about whatever the future holds right now” from many, many people. I have one very dear friend who gets extremely upset and begs that the subject be changed when I have conversations about the de-industrial future, or about strategies and concepts such as LESS with her husband who is my best friend and a regular reader of your books. She grew up in a situation of extreme poverty, never knowing where her next meal was going to come from or how much longer a roof would be over her head. Now that life has turned around some and she’s got some security, talk about LESS, or about the long descent just reminds her that one day she may be right back where she started, triggers those memories and throws her into a fight or flight mode. At the same time, she’s a gardening enthusiast and has taught me a lot about using seed catalogues and growing food in balcony containers as well as some tricks she used to get by when she was struggling to survive. That alone is a lot, but she still gets upset and defensive with talk about the future. I know a lot of other people who have just lost jobs or are having debts catch up to them who have decided that they can’t really think about lifestyle choices because life isn’t leaving them any. It was a roadblock for me too back when I first started reading and decided that changing had to wait I owned a house and had space for a 10x10 vegetable garden with a rabbit hutch, solar heaters and a workshop for tinkering. That really is the hardest thing to get over, letting go of the need to do it all and embracing is the idea that small, humble steps actually matter. That’s often where people stop. I’ve seen you emphasize that point often in comments, but I’m not sure if there’s been an essay on it. Could you link me to it if you have?<br><br><br><a href=#c6307065730028121549 title="comment permalink">1/9/15, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

Right now my partner and I are living in an abandoned house that's falling apart slowly. Still, we can't stay there for long because the neighborhood is gentrifying - two houses are going up in the vacant lot across the street and another two houses are going up in another vacant lot two blocks away. Problably, the future owner-occupants of the houses across the street will call the city to complain, or the city will finally take the house from it's owner and sell it at a sheriff's sale. Either way, we'll have to move out. Lving in the woods is no option for us, since we're older (mid 50s), not hardy and unskilled in wilderness survival. And men's shelters would be two dangerous, since both of us appear to be vulnerable; we're liable to be mugged!<br><br>Well at least I'll be getting a small income from an inheritance invested in a trust in a couple of full moons. Problem is, the people who will manage it, whom I call my "benefactors," want me to jump back into the typical American lifestyle with both feet.

A six-holed flute without flaps. The best bet is to get it in the key of D because that way, you can play tunes in D and G, which are the keys most of traditional Irish and Scottish are noted in.<br><br>In "Star Trek - Next Generation", Picard aqucires such a flute in one of the episodes. I'd advise to go for the traditional, oldschool Clarke with the wooden plug, $15 at Amazon (B001B9JZ78) - remember, keyed in D and not C. Avoid the ones with plastic tip. Besides, the Clarke is from before the oil era. In fact, I'd buy two of them as to have one spare. I can warmly recommend the "Tin Whistle" book by Bill Ochs together with the CD ($16 at Amazon, 0962345679).<br><br><br>@ Mysostris: Oh, renting, yes.. mmhh, what you can also do is keeping at least four inches of distance between any furniture and the walls. Best if you avoid putting furniture at outer walls at all. You might think of getting pressure pots for the kitchen. First, that saves energy, and second, it lowers the amount of damp. Before opening, cool it down in the sink by letting cool water run over it. That way, less damp gets out when opening the lid. Avoid drying clothes inside, and avoid plants inside.<br><br><br>@ Jean-Vivien: Mes condoléances aux concernés en cette affaire; que la France en fasse le mieux.<br>(My condolences to those concerned in that matter; may France make the best of it.)<br><br><a href=#c866208629447001967 title="comment permalink">1/9/15, 8:50 AM</a><br><br>

Having followed your blog for quite some time, I know that my own lifestyle is not sustainable. At the back of my mind, I know I am part of the problem for these main reasons:<br><br>1) Family expectation. For an Indonesian Chinese like me, the idea of perpetual progress seems to be ingrained into our culture. The idea of being poorer than your parents or living with LESS is definitely not very welcomed in the family. There is a high expectation that the next generation will be more successful and attain more wealth than the parents' generation. That is the definition of a successful and prosperous family. This drive might be why Chinese have keen business acumen.<br><br>2) Skill set that is incompatible with post-collapse period. I am trained as a software programmer with data-mining / analytical skills and majored in Economics. I am not sure for how much longer will the current Internet infrastructure be available at such low cost. Regardless, once the cost of maintaining the whole Internet infrastructure grows higher due to higher energy and component costs, my skills will most likely be made obsolete.<br><br>3) Living in a metropolitan city-state (Singapore). Given Singapore's role in facilitating global financial, trade, transport and oil system (Singapore refines approximately 1.3 mil barrel per days) and reliance on tourism, the citizens have benefited tremendously from the globalization and technology revolution. So much so that most people have taken this growth and economic climate as normal. Believing the system's foundation is strong and everlasting, they seek to enrich themselves with more wealth and comfort. I personally have never heard any of my friends (in mid 20s) express concern regarding the sustainability of the whole system. Instead of living with LESS, most people want MORE. <br><br>Regarding stimulation: Most people are also so absorbed with their smartphones, mainly playing games or watching videos; Parents are distracting their children with smartphones whenever possible to keep them quiet. I see a generation of overtly-stimulated children in the making, and I do fear for how this stimulation is re-wiring the children's brains.<br><br>For this year's resolution: I am thinking of learning how to do pot-gardening for this year and make do without air-conditioner at home.<br><br>Anyone has any suggestion on what other actions a person living in a metropolitan city like me can take to prepare for the collapse?<br><br><a href=#c8748123339405865824 title="comment permalink">1/9/15, 10:31 AM</a><br><br>

You mentioned how critics lambasted James Howard Kunstler for predicting the rise of piracy. "How could such a thing happen in the modern world?" Fast forward to Somalia. Everything old is new again. <br><br>Regarding robotics, I'm sure you know the word "robot" comes from a Czech word for "slave." In a declining world, full of violence, desperation and poverty, ruthless people would find a ready supply of biological "robots."<br><br>Some years ago, at the height of the "reality TV" craze, PBS did a series of re-enactments where modern people tried to live as their historical counterparts did. I remember in particular "Frontier House," where the participants had to build and maintain a Montana homestead, c.1889. Only one family was judged to have been unable to survive the winter.<br><br>The final episode shows one family at home again in a palatial Malibu mansion overlooking the ocean. Each person is in a separate room, doing their own separate activities. More than one of them laments their isolation, and misses the closeness that they had in their little cabin.<br><br>I don't know how to do a link, but Google "PBS Frontier House." The rest of the series, 1900 House, Colonial House, etc. may serve as examples of LESS in practice.

I’m usually pretty quiet about my personal choices regarding LESS (especially online), but given some of the great comments above, and a little free time this afternoon, I thought I’d share a thing or two I’ve learned.<br><br>From a superficial perspective my family is pretty conventional. My wife and I both work 40 hours a week, the kids go to public school, we commute in cars, and carry iPhones in our pockets. But we also apply ourselves to LESS with some real commitment. We garden and can extensively. I learned to timber frame and built our house and barn with traditional joinery, hand tools, and oak pegs. We run a small flock of chickens. We heat exclusively with our own wood (I installed a masonry heater in the center of the house, pricey up front, but I’ll never pay a heating bill again, and the pizza oven is awesome!). I’ve become a tolerable small engine mechanic and a competent logger, among a dozen other skills necessary to building a house by yourself: plumber, site work, electrician, carpentry, etc.<br><br>For me LESS isn’t necessary yet, but it is still choice worthy and deeply satisfying. As my wife likes to say, LESS is a great way of life regardless of any future necessity for doing so.

If you can afford $900 per month payments, why not just fix the trannie?<br>To be sure, in the past getting a one-year car loan would be easy enough, but I expect as things get worse, financial types will find more and more ways of extracting money through fees and interest. But you talked to the guy at the car lot. Why not go to a bank? I bet they would have given you a one-year loan. <br>That guy was probably right about a lot of people, but not everybody. I don't know that most people really add up the interest on a long term loan or compare the amount they will pay with differing loan conditions. The main thing, though, is that 18% interest is very high. It doesn't hurt to have a good credit score. It got me an interest-free car loan once, and I bought new even though I don't believe it is generally a good idea because a used car loan required interest.<br><br><a href=#c4217464777569518928 title="comment permalink">1/9/15, 12:58 PM</a><br><br>

In my day to day thinking about it I see what we haven't done and how far we have to go, but looking back I can see that we have accomplished a great deal and put even more into motion.<br><br>Our energy use concerns me, not because we use a ton but because we are tied to our vehicles to get to market where we sell our products. It's unrealistic right now to think of packing everything up on a bicycle with a wagon due to the nature of the driving and the roads in our area and I'm also not in good enough shape to make that 20 mile one way trek. The message for me in this realm, right now, is to take action in the area I have the most influence which is to get in better shape to have more options as things unfold. <br><br>While we've never been very materialistic, we still have accumulated lots of belongings and I spend a fair bit of time managing these belongings in a small space. We're fortunate to have lots of tools that make our lives easier and there are also places where I have been so pigheaded about not bringing in a new tool that actually would be a huge convenience and time saver. So I've been checking all of my assumptions lately in this area and have found some ways that I was tripping myself up unnecessarily. Some things can go, and some can come in. <br><br>Less stimulation is far and away the hardest area for me to work with, not because we are a modern gadget family but because I don't always filter well all the information, opinion, and expectation that comes in from those around me. I find it all too easy to see everyone else's points of view without a natural ability to keep it separate from myself.

I will not say to you that you do not need compost...only that there is no need to work hard making it.

He puts himself through all this grief because he thinks it is a "better way". I would rather see people just scattering straw or hulls or woodchips over their fields!"<br><br>Anyhow, I think it may not sink in, untill a few 'things' go away.<br>The article made me think we have to be more energy efficient in our labour.

I enjoyed my experience and met a lot of cool people. But it's also pretty fluffy as far as advanced degrees go; I sometimes feel I could have spent my money better doing something else. When you're looking at schools, my biggest tip would be to look for an affordable program because once you graduate, I don't think anybody will really care about which school you went to. I went to a state university in Buffalo and since it was an affordable school in an affordable city, I'm not crippled by massive debt. (I'll confess having financial help from my parents, but I also saved money from working before library school and got a job at one of the campus libraries while I was a student too.)<br><br>Be aware that there is a LOT of competition for librarian positions because there are a LOT of underemployed/unemployed MLS-grads out there! (I'm one of them; my job is part time even though I'm the head of the local history department.)<br><br>I feel like post-industrial librarians can serve a vastly important role, but it may not be a PROFITABLE role. Again, I'm head of the local history department and I'm doing my best to preserve various texts and items relating to the history of the city and things of genealogical relevance to its residents. The previous local history librarian didn't really know or care about preservation and so the collection was a decaying MESS and it's been a lot of work to get things in archival-quality storage. But my budget is tiny, my position is part-time, and I'm definitely low on the pecking order after people who have been working at the library for decades!<br>My goal is to have large portions of the collection stored in a way so that they can safely sit on the shelf for 100 years and still be intact. Even if I'm not making much money at my job, I feel like if I can do that, I'm dong something that matters!<br><br>But I feel like the days may be numbered for comfortable careers in the public sector. I've signed up for a glassblowing class in the spring in the hopes that learning a traditional craft may be a workable fallback-plan. Or at least a hobby that can be turned slightly profitable with practice.<br><br>(I hope this comment isn't too rambly. I started writing it not long after waking up in the morning...)<br><br><a href=#c3605575561723296952 title="comment permalink">1/10/15, 5:39 AM</a><br><br>

You can reach me at mhg7h-4822218925@sale.craigslist.org for the next month or so. The internal security apparatus here is probably as big as the police force, so take it as a given that all communications are being monitored or recorded.<br><br>Places like Hong Kong and Singapore will face unique challenges in the near future, mostly due to the extremely high population density. When SARS hit Hong Kong in 2003, one of the worst outbreaks was in a highrise apartment building where the water supply was interrupted. A SARS patient puked into a toilet bowl when most of the toilets went dry - and that became the transmission mechanism to infect folks on multiple floors in double quick time. The truly scary part is that the majority of the food, energy and water supplies have to be imported, with very little local storage slack. So in the event of likely supply chain breakdowns as times get much rougher, you can figure out the implications yourself. <br><br>The local elites are just as incompetent and self-serving as the ones state-side. They were strongly pushing nuclear power as a 'viable' option on this island despite multi-varied and sizeable local opposition - until Fukushima happened. Lots of talk about "affordable" energy, though the bigger driver was probably the billions dollars in contracts that would have been awarded. <br><br>A small group of friends have discussed our options at length - the heated part of the debate is always whether its better to stay put or 'run for the hills'. This group came together much later in life, rather randomly, but everyone tends to be well-read (e.g. encountering 'Limits to Growth' in late teens, the Foundation series in early teens etc). <br><br>Personally, I've found ADR to be extremely uplifting, both in terms of framing and explaining the issues with a strong historical context, and also to simply know that other folks around the world have come to a similar understanding and acceptance of what is and what will be, yet doing what they can to mitigate the effects. About a year ago, I gave serious thought to setting up a local blog to hopefully provide more guideposts and useful suggestions for other people here. But in such a controlled political climate, advocating thinking or actions which undermined the current 'growth at any cost' paradigm is to invite swift and serious retribution.

When I started, we had a director who wouldn't even say hello to anyone with less than an MLS. Even in the smallest rural branches (2 or 3 person operations) she always wanted an MLS on board. So, you had a lot of newly minted MLSs who commuted in from long distances and moved on very quickly. Back in those days, you couldn't even tell a patron where the rest room was. You had to refer them to a librarian. <br><br>Then we got a Library Director who knew everybody's name and wasn't so status oriented. The basic requirements for "branch head" changed to a BA in anything. That opened it up to more people from the local communities. I see some of the regional systems are moving to "BA in anything" model to run small rural branches. Fort Vancouver Regional, Snow-Isle Regional, etc.. Of course, some of it is economics.

That pretty much puts it out of reach for a post-Internet society, in my opinion. <br><br>I like the idea of offering free programming to WBCQ (which is available via Internet streaming as well as shortwave radio), but who am I to urge JMG to take on another non-profitable project?<br><br>Another option is to arrange a ham radio "net", which is a pre-arranged gathering of ham radio operators who chat about whatever's on their minds. On Sunday nights, you can listen to the TAPRN "prepper net", which is kind of like a radio call-in program. A net will usually have a "Net Control Operator" who directs the sequence of comments. Unfortunately, there's no good way to cut someone short when they're off-topic or long-winded, but a skillful net control operator might keep track of troublemakers and ignore their requests to "check in". Ham radio regulations forbid "broadcasting", but if there's a regularly scheduled conversation where one of the participants has a clear idea of the topics to be discussed, well, it's almost the same thing, right? <br><br>One of my HF transceivers has been modified to also transmit in the broadcast bands, and I suppose I could get away with low-power broadcasting (150W, instead of 50,000W) to much of the US East Coast. The frequencies having been abandoned by actual broadcasters, who's to complain? But I really, really don't want to test the waters and risk losing all of my amateur gear when the FCC responds.<br> <br>If the day comes when the FCC no longer has enforcement powers, we may reconsider this option.<br><br><a href=#c8431627521287366843 title="comment permalink">1/10/15, 11:51 AM</a><br><br>

Not so much because I thought it was a dramatically world changing event, but because I feel relatively close to the specific target group. Also, I was a little afraid that it might push the FN (or equivalent in other European nations) situation further in a direction I don't want it to go. So I was hoping for a large turn out that would include many of the visibly Muslim people that populate the streets most of the time. Almost none of them were there. The march could have come straight out of the church at Christmas (+ a few leftish looking people). In my book that does not bode well.<br>However, when I got home I heard a convincing explanation from a friend of mine who had overheard an old lady with Algerian background talking for quite a while phone. After discussing various things they touched this topic as well and said she found it rather silly to make such a fuss about a hand full of dead people. Especially in the light of what is going on in the world at the moment. This of course ties directly back to my second sentence. She has a point. She's been feeling that feeling a whole lot longer, a whole lot more intense I believe. FN may be seen as a minor inconvenience from that perspective. It still does not make it more enjoyable to slowly slip in that direction.

If it does not work pattern based, then you can maybe do it based on semantic links. Do a dump on JMGs articles and comments pages (with their admittedly relatively useless patterns) and look at the word corpus. Do that for 3-5 related pages (such as "Do the math", Orlov, Kunstler, Heinberg, etc) and start mapping and comparing these a little. See if you can latch this on to other corners in the web.

One way to look at is that the network bandwidth needed to share these few pages of text is entirely trivial relative to the bits being sent as (mostly ignored) animated advertising on the margins of other sites.

This was fortunate because New Orleans harvest its drinking water from the Mississippi river, which is polluted. They also put obscene amounts of bleach into the water. Many people refuse to drink the water in New Orleans and instead buy bottled water, juice, soda or beer. By harvesting rainwater my friends were able to get good, clean water that was simply better than any they could buy. <br><br>In the same house they had a beehive inside a wall - siding on one side, plexiglass on the other.

Cooking, carpentry, tanning leather, making candles, herbalism, sewing and other practical skills will serve you well regardless of circumstances. Furthermore if you, say, learn to sew now it will be much easier than if you wait until your quality of life depends on it. Learning any practical skill now means you will already know it later when it is likely that learning the same skill will be at much, much higher stakes.<br><br>In a similar vein making sure that you have people in your life that you can really trust is always important. This is especially so if you're trying to prepare for any sort of upheaval.

I was going to say we think a lot about how to get people interested, but actually we've backed way up the road to wondering what the heck people are thinking now, if anything. On of the people who does good research on this is a lady named Susanne Shelton. I get the newsletter, so recently this landed in my inbox: <br>http://tinyurl.com/p2ee7au<br>Words fail me...<br><br>With regard to living without central heat or AC, that's a lengthy disquisition, and probably off topic, but tons of houses were built to hemorrhage cheap energy at an uncontrollable rate. The reason is, it's cheaper for the home builder and home buyers expect to pay for natural gas, heating oil, propane, electricity every month forever. There's no solid reason a house needs to be that way, but it's a different house if it's not- there's no great retrofit for bad solar orientation, for example. <br><br>I've seen articles in the trade press that say things like "Why don't we just bulldoze the 5 million worst houses?" I've been in more than one myself where it's apparent that the best step 1 is an insurance fire and step 2 is a yurt. I'm not sure how to help those people, I don't sell yurts, and Earthships don't meet building codes here. <br><br>@Chris regarding propaganda, I once purchased a bargain bin book that was German press coverage of WWII, and recall reading an account of German armor reducing a house in a Polish village which a few Polish army regulars had been returning fire from to rubble described as "finally ending the criminal insanity of the Poles." The spooky part is realizing that good propaganda is cunningly calculated to match the crazy story the audience is already telling themselves in their heads.<br><br><br><a href=#c6953514647082477393 title="comment permalink">1/10/15, 8:45 PM</a><br><br>

I know Singapore very well: I have a Master's degree from NTU, and lived there for a number of years as a PR. Heh, as I sit here in Russia, listening to the Sunday morning bells of the Orthodox cathedral around the corner, those days seem very far away!<br><br>I actually considered becoming a citizen, but two things changed my mind. The first was that Singapore is completely unsustainable: it requires too much imported water, food and labour, and vast amounts of electricity. The second was the 'my' Singapore visibly diminished over the years I was there - the South-East Asian culture which remembered Malay as the lingua franca, where dialects are widely spoken, and traditional practices are observed. One by one, my favourite coffeeshops shut down, to be replaced by expensive tourist cafes; the population became increasingly PRC-dominated, with an English-speaking Evangelical Chinese elite running things. As DH Poser Chwee noted, the internal security is very tight, and I can see it getting tighter in future.<br><br>So, to answer your question... There are some grassroots groups involved in urban gardening/farming and that kind of thing - perhaps you can track them down. It may also be worth tracking down the remnants of the old culture while they're still there, and learning from them. For example, I remember watching a shophouse burn on Sultan's Gate street; I read afterwards that it was a blacksmith's forge. If there was one then (this was only a few years ago), there may be others. If you can find one, perhaps you can train as a smith (or, for the benefit of your family, an 'artisan metalworker')... Perhaps train in TCM: there are people teaching it in Singapore, not always officially....<br><br><a href=#c4617139556109542407 title="comment permalink">1/10/15, 11:16 PM</a><br><br>

And, I am planning to open up a new plot this spring for small-scale grain raising.

Not sure how that works as weeds leave seeds if let alone. Whereas the method I am using, call it extreme mulching (no tilling) at least tries not to let the weeds go to seed, thus reducing them year by year. Fukuoma also indicates weeds will decrease year by year, I guess because he does things to give the crops an advantage. What is not clear is if he avoids letting the weeds develop seed.<br>I was assuming that my climate (Appalachia) might be similar to Japan, but our weeds get to be 4-5 feet tall or more by summer's end. They DO crowd out vegetables.<br><br>2) He says to sew the spring crop 2 weeks before the harvest of the fall crop and vice versa, so that the new shoots come up and have a growth start before weeds, but he also says that right after harvest you put straw all over the field to stop weeds. But won't that stop the new crop as well?<br><br>In my method, as in his, I take nothing but the actual vegetables (or gain) and return or leave in the soil everything else. For example, I cut a cabbage off at the soil line, and leave the roots intact.<br><br><a href=#c7174757717087431267 title="comment permalink">1/11/15, 2:47 PM</a><br><br>

Those of us inside the controlled climate of the machine though have very great difficulty in seeing out.<br><br>Back in the early days of steam railway there was discussion of what happened to the human frame (biology) when the iron horses travelled faster than previous experience (knowledge). We laughed later at this superstition. We could outrun fear, our psyche, and the mystery of time. We normalised the train wrecks (death), regulated timetables (and other magic) and picnicked (celebrated) on conquered mountains, all courtesy of a few shovels of best coal in a medium-size furnace. <br><br>I remember at the age of 17 travelling long distance train for the first time on my own: <i>The Flying Scot </i> going north to Newcastle; (a traditional joke in Britain talked of ‘taking coals to Newcastle’ where the coal came from). I had rarely been in a motor car and even more rarely over 60 mph. In those days they still served tea and coffee (and I had rarely drunk coffee) in good quality china brought to the table. I was going to interview for University entrance – a journey paid for by the University. So there I was to my new wonder, being ceremoniously served (“Coffee Sir?”) travelling at over 100 mph courtesy of some very fast shovelling, and heading into my future.<br><br>We travelled into the North Country belonging to my mother’s stories –grand parents, other lives. I saw then briefly one of the defining images of my life and education. This was something I had no real pre-knowledge of and had not been touched on in Mum’s stories. A Durham pit-village (coal); one-street of brick cottages sloped down to the mainline. This was a continuing 19th C reality in one glimpse. It is difficult to convey how much information can be provided by one swift real image. <br><br>There have been other such glimpses before and since – perhaps an equivalent in North America for those who have seen the film, might be one recreated in <i> Paper Moon</i>; the con-man (future) in his smart motor passing the ‘Okie’ outfit (financial and environmental collapse) travelling West – different planets two sides of the same road.<br><br>I have known wild regret at lost work and love, the meaning of the lives of others, and other such beautiful country. <br><br>I take off my hat to those who go before and to those who follow after. Years later, my boy led me on a climb in a remote mountain glen (pilgrimage): “as surely as the long light of midsummer / will return to these hills. / The here and now of antiquity / walks our present days, / by steep paths returning / to the same secluded ground, /Salmon running beside us / Unseen; memory into the pool.<br><br>best <br>Phil Harris<br><br><a href=#c1270614024784871318 title="comment permalink">1/12/15, 5:39 AM</a><br><br>

When you divest yourself of your wealth, you're not just throwing it into a void, after all. This seems to be a difficult concept for 1%ers, but if they can't think of anything useful to use their money for, maybe they shouldn't have control of it and keeping it at all is what's the "waste." Try sponsoring other people's skills. Perhaps the person down the road who's learning to sew could use a new sewing machine, or the aspiring gardener some cold frames. You can't learn everything, but when you recognize the existence of others as more than people who may potentially rob you, you don't have to. Knowing there are other people out there with the skills you don't have but who will use them to help support you is what builds a community. As a 1%er, your portfolio of investments in the goodwill of your brethren might be looking a little low, about now.<br><br><a href=#c750783448319726116 title="comment permalink">1/12/15, 7:25 AM</a><br><br>

It sounds good in principle, but when you get into the details, there are the small issues of living in a military dictatorship and practicing occasional infanticide to control the population density. There are certainly lessons to be taken from the book, and as I said, I'm not done yet.<br><br>This makes me consider some ecological principles: In a given ecosystem niche, there is usually a limiting resource or ability (or maybe a few) that controls population. In Edo Japan, that resource seems to have been food/fiber/fuel supply. Looking at the "Happy People" videos of life in Siberian Russia, it seems that food is plentiful, but you have to have the cold resistance to live there. In some places, there is food and gentle climate, but the state of warfare, or of disease, or some other factor, controls the population density.

I got a treadle base off the metal recycling pile a few months ago, and hope to mate it to a machine eventually. They are fairly durable, if taken care of. Many that I see are seized up because of being oiled wrong. WD40 eventually turns to gum. These things need very light machine oil. I use the same oil that I lubricate my electric hair trimmers with. With the right lubrication, protection from rust, and somewhat regular use, they can last a long time.<br><br>I'm somewhat picky about my clothes (although you wouldn't think it to look at me). There was a time in the late 80s and early 90s when I made my own pants regularly, because the styles were tight and I need more thigh room. (I had biker thighs) I made a pattern from a pair of Battle Dress Utility camo pants I'd been given. The hard part is the fly.<br><br>Years later, I had a conversation about simple clothing with someone who suggested that drop-front pants with buttons on each side would likely be easier. Overalls might be easier yet. <br><br>I've also made pants loosely modeled on the "Japanese Farmer Pants" once sold by Smith &amp; Hawken, and those are almost the same as martial arts uniform pants.<br><br>My work shirts are starting to look a bit worn. These are the ones I wear to my paying job, which is crawling through basements and attics, looking for energy leaks, so they need to be tough but look decent for the clients. These are typically a solid twill button front shirt with a button down collar and front pockets. Very workmanlike. But a few friends of mine have been seen wearing French Sailor's Smocks, and these look practical and straightforward to sew. http://assets-s3.mensjournal.com/img/essential/serious-sailors-wear-smocks/298_398_serious-sailors-wear-smocks.jpg <br><br>Then there's footwear.

Looks like an excellent guide to making violins - totally beyond my skills but it was 25 cents and I had to rescue it. So if anyone thinks they can use it, I'll mail it to them.

First, when my son was at a very green K-6 Quaker school, I donated a 4x4 foot cold-frame of 2x6 lumber with a slab of Polygal (r) insulated polycarbonate sheet to the school gardening project. Polygal's great stuff: lightweight, rugged, insulating, stiff... and I found 5 half-sheets in the "remnants" bin at an industrial plastics shop for $10 ea.) I delivered it to the gardening/science teacher. A month or so later, I looked in to see how things were going, and he admitted that he'd tried to transport it on the roof of his car, it had fallen off and gotten destroyed, and could I possibly replace it? "Sure!" I said. "But we'd have to order a 4x8' sheet. Catalog price for is about $100/sheet, plus $100 packaging, and $200 shipping. For $400, you can have one TWICE as big as the one I gave you. For $500, you can have two." He wasn't interested.<br><br>I tried again, at the 7/8th grade school. But they waited until Spring to set it up, instead of using it to grow greens through the winter, and it was too late to be useful. Come summer vacation, it went into storage. A few months later, when it could be put into action... it had been "tidied up" out of existence. Just some old boards and a sheet of plastic, in someone's eyes. <br> <br>So much for charity! People see value in what THEY pay for, not what you find valuable. If money's not going to work in a speculative future, let them crank your lathe/grain mill/sewing machine/whatever, and RENT your "capital equipment" to them. If they lose interest, you can take it back and look for a more faithful disciple.<br><br>I picked lettuce from one of my cold frames to make green salads for three last night. Dawn temperature was 11F (-11C), but the sun was strong and we got above freezing during the day.

There is a thinking quagmire that often occurs when folks take up a hobby and then try to sell there skills or craft at a rate they feel they 'deserve.' Almost all the real value in my experience is not about the tokens, but embodied in the fact that something is made or mended by a person you know. I started quilt-making about a decade ago and now have a small inconsistent income from selling quilts but also doing mending and other sewing for people. When I began considering what other kinds of skills I could adopt to carry forward I finally decided it would be a good idea to expand my range of sewing abilities to garments.

I can think of several off the top of my head from Galileo to VanGogh, Picasso to Bob Dylan. I’m guessing however that the narrative usually only holds water if you maintain a certain distance from the facts, which I suppose is how mythology works when based on real people.<br>If I’m not completely off the mark, your line of reasoning states that this particular narrative encapsulates the struggle and victory of progress, and serves as an integral part of that religion; that implicit in this is an ideological aspect that props up the predominant world view, and a particular set of values, as well as a political agenda of the ruling centres of power. At the same time I have to admit that there is a compelling aspect to many of these stories – dare I say – as an artist, they are inspiring!<br><br>Anyway, I wanted to raise two points. The first being that just maybe (quite possibly?) an archruid/writer/gardener (brewer – I’m guessing) who has made a stand and staked his reputation on a thoroughly researched alternative way of looking at the world; who leads by example, and teaches counter to the prevailing conventional wisdom (read: folly) of the times might fit that same narrative otherwise belonging to progress. I don’t mean to point this out as a criticism, but simply as a rather interesting irony (?)… I know I feel oftentimes as though most of all the world is marching to a different rhythm than me, but remain convinced that I have a particular insight and knowledge of certain truths (i.e. peak oil, limits to growth, ecology, etc.) that keep me going despite the pervasive collective denial all around. Could not progress be defined around these terms as we move forward, reframing it as “that which allows us to weather the storm?”<br><br>“The second point that came to mind was that, as powerful and as present as the archetype and mythology cited above is, most people follow a different path: that of conformity. I know many people who have abandoned a more simple, artistic lifestyle in order to earn more money doing something more corporate (or bureaucratic, or what have you), in order to provide more of this and that for a growing family. It’s the narrative of consumption and growth that people dutifully follow, and it is decidedly not one of heroically standing against anything or, for that matter, for anything except the main flow that everyone else seems to be following. Herein lies the deception of “progress”: We may worship the heroes of one narrative, and yet follow a completely different path instead. We have believed in one ideal while experiencing, for the most part the complete opposite: the investment in a way of life without a future…”<br>(more to come)<br><br><a href=#c6804431066735467858 title="comment permalink">1/12/15, 6:56 PM</a><br><br>

Myself, I’ve gravitated toward gainful employment and the participation in the culture of conformity insofar as “dressing the part” is concerned – a simple matter of practical necessity; this despite a track record of being a subversively-minded artist for as long as I can remember. As a “practicing artist” I have more trouble with participation in the contemporary art world, where I believe the law of diminishing returns is manifesting itself in full force. But I still believe in creativity and expression as important spiritual aspects to a society that has largely turned its back on faith and religion. Which is to say, I don’t look at art-making as an economic pursuit but rather as a cultural “force”; I do wonder though just how justifiable it is to maintain said practice, when the cost of doing so is barely above the break-even point. I suppose I am constantly questioning my own way forward, given the insights on the probable future that I feel I’ve gained over the years. Sometimes I think inspiring others to be simply creative and critical in their thinking could go a long way. Other times I wonder if I shouldn’t just walk away from so much personal investment in what may just be a function of abundance industrialism…<br>And do what? <br> <br><br><br><a href=#c5099855349485646345 title="comment permalink">1/12/15, 6:57 PM</a><br><br>

I've been living on an island in the Salish Sea since 1986, a small rural community of old rednecks, back-to-the-landers from the 70's, and, more recently, a lovely bunch of young folks bent on living the simple wholesome life. Up until a year and a half ago I had only enjoyed indoor plumbing for around three years out of more than twenty. For twelve years, home was a small hand-wrought cabin with an outhouse, outdoor shower, and only basic electric features. I learned how to grow a garden and feed myself and my husband for a good part of the year. Divorce brought changes, and I found a young couple who had land and needed extra help. I lived in a craftsman-converted school bus for a year and a half while I improved a small cabin, adding real windows, basic insulation, and wiring. <br><br>(The bus was a treat to live in. I recommend it to everyone for some part of their lives!)<br><br>The cabin also lacked indoor bathing and toilet, and it took 5 years to get hot water for the sink. It was only warm when the wood stove was fired up, and about 5 degrees above ambient otherwise. The outdoor shower was shared between ourselves and the landowner couple living in their yurt.<br><br>I remarried after a few years, and my new husband and I stayed on the land until we parted amicably with the young couple. We landed in a new home on the same island, where we've been for two summers now. It is a newly built, right and well crafted modern house. Two toilets, even, and an indoor shower! We own three computers, three iDevices, and as of last month, three motor vehicles. <br><br>Our trajectory has been steadily moving towards greater comfort and energy consumption. I know it won't last. And I'm grateful for every blessed moment of it.<br><br>I've had a fair bit of living with LESS. I can deal with going out and thawing the shower, using an outhouse, having no internet, heating water on the stovetop, growing my own food, and the like. I know I can do that all again in a heartbeat. But right now we are enjoying this fading glory of industrial civilization, and giving thanks for these modern miracles.

One of the very best aspects of our high-tech lifestyles is finding voices like yours from all over the world that I would otherwise never have heard. Perhaps equally appreciated is the format to actually comment and answer back, to interchange ideas and read comments from other readers. THIS I would really miss from a low-tech life. Thank You!<br><br>For my own 2-cents 'back-talk', I would add 1 more 'S' to that acronym - (LESSS) in the idea of 'Security' or safety net. <br><br>I've been poor and struggling, (by Western standards) and have had the opportunity to be rich and very comfortable, now back to struggling. I suppose one could say the difference between a lavish, wasteful lifestyle and a much more economical one. The biggest difference and IMHO the one that I and most people have the hardest time adjusting to is the lack of financial safety net. If one has a safety net there a just a lot fewer sleepless nights. If the car breaks down - it's a minor inconvenience, not a threat to your job and lifeline, if your kid has a bad cough it's just a trip to the doctors, not a major worry that you might lose them. If you make a mistake and get a speeding or parking ticket for $200. it's a bummer, not a collapse of your budget and food off of your table for the next months, or late rent and therefore a threat to your very security. You have to live a lot more carefully and anticipate those slippery parts of the tight-rope when you have no safety-net and even then you can never be completely sure. You simply LIVE with insecurity.<br><br>THAT I think is the hard part of relinquishing the lavish lifestyle. As I said above, I've lived with that insecurity most of my life, it's not impossible, life can certainly still be fun and have moments of carefree bliss, but having the security of a safety net SURE is a heckuvalot easier. That would be worth addressing, no?<br><br><a href=#c1742104064508058237 title="comment permalink">2/14/15, 7:39 PM</a><br><br>
