All things considered, 2015 just isn’t shaping up to be a good year for believers in business as usual. Since last week’s post here on
<i>The Archdruid Report</i>, the anti-austerity party Syriza has swept the Greek elections, to the enthusiastic cheers of similar parties all over Europe and the discomfiture of the Brussels hierarchy. The latter have no one to blame for this turn of events but themselves; for more than a decade now, EU policies have effectively put sheltering banks and bondholders from the healthy discipline of the market ahead of all other considerations, including the economic survival of entire nations. It should be no surprise to anyone that this wasn’t an approach with a long shelf life. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, the fracking bust continues unabated. The number of drilling rigs at work in American oilfields continues to drop vertically from week to week, layoffs in the nation’s various oil patches are picking up speed, and the price of oil remains down at levels that make further fracking a welcome mat for the local bankruptcy judge. Those media pundits who are still talking the fracking industry’s book keep insisting that the dropping price of oil proves that they were right and those dratted heretics who talk of peak oil must be wrong, but somehow those pundits never get around to explaining why iron ore, copper, and most other major commodities are dropping in price even faster than crude oil, nor why demand for petroleum products here in the US has been declining steadily as well. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The fact of the matter is that an industrial economy built to run on cheap conventional oil can’t run on expensive oil for long without running itself into the ground. Since 2008, the world’s industrial nations have tried to make up the difference by flooding their economies with cheap credit, in the hope that this would somehow make up for the sharply increased amounts of real wealth that have had to be diverted from other purposes into the struggle to keep liquid fuels flowing at their peak levels. Now, though, the laws of economics have called their bluff; the wheels are coming off one national economy after another, and the price of oil (and all those other commodities) has dropped to levels that won’t cover the costs of fracked oil, tar sands, and the like, because all those frantic attempts to externalize the costs of energy production just meant that the whole global economy took the hit. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course this isn’t how governments and the media are spinning the emerging crisis. For that matter, there’s no shortage of people outside the corridors of power, or for that matter of punditry, who ignore the general collapse of commodity prices, fixate on oil outside of the broader context of resource depletion in general, and insist that the change in the price of oil must be an act of economic warfare, or what have you. It’s a logic that readers of this blog will have seen deployed many times in the past: whatever happens, it must have been decided and carried out by human beings. An astonishing number of people these days seem unable to imagine the possibility that such wholly impersonal factors as the laws of economics, geology, and thermodynamics could make things happen all by themselves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The problem we face now is precisely that the unimaginable is now our reality. For just that little bit too long, too many people have insisted that we didn’t need to worry about the absurdity of pursuing limitless growth on a finite and fragile planet, that “they’ll think of something,” or that chattering on internet forums about this or that or the other piece of technological vaporware was doing something concrete about our species’ imminent collision with the limits to growth. For just that little bit too long, not enough people were willing to do anything that mattered, and now impersonal factors have climbed into the driver’s seat, having mugged all seven billion of us and shoved us into the trunk. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As I noted <a href=../../2015/01/the-mariners-rule.html>in last week’s post</a>, that puts hard limits on what can be done in the short term. In all probability, at this stage of the game, each of us will be meeting the oncoming wave of crisis with whatever preparations we’ve made, however substantial or insubstantial those happen to be. I’m aware that a certain subset of my readers are unhappy with that suggestion, but that can’t be helped; the future is under no obligation to wait patiently while we get ready for it. A few years back, when I posted an essay here whose title <a href=../../2012/06/collapse-now-and-avoid-rush.html>sums up the strategy I’ve been proposing</a>, I probably should have put more stress on the most important word in that slogan: <i><b>now</b></i>. Still, that’s gone wherever might-have-beens spend their time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That doesn’t mean the world is about to end. It means that in all probability, beginning at some point this year and continuing for several years after that, most of my readers will be busy coping with the multiple impacts of a thumping economic crisis on their own lives and those of their families, friends, communities, and employers, at a time when political systems over much of the industrial world have frozen up into gridlock, the simmering wars in the Middle East and much of the Third World seem more than usually likely to boil over, and the twilight of the Pax Americana is pushing both the US government and its enemies into an ever greater degree of brinksmanship. Exactly how that’s going to play out is anyone’s guess, but no matter what happens, it’s unlikely to be pretty. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
While we get ready for the first shocks to hit, though, it’s worth talking a little bit about what comes afterwards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No matter how long a train of financial dominoes the collapse of the fracking bubble sets toppling, the last one fill fall eventually, and within a few years things will have found a “new normal,” however far down the slope of contraction that turns out to be. No matter how many proxy wars, coups d’etat, covert actions, and manufactured insurgencies get launched by the United States or its global rivals in their struggle for supremacy, most of the places touched by that conflict will see a few years at most of actual warfare or the equivalent, with periods of relative peace before and after. The other driving forces of collapse act in much the same way; collapse is a fractal process, not a linear one. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus there’s something on the far side of crisis besides more of the same. The discussion I’d like to start at this point centers on what might be worth doing once the various masses of economic, political, and military rubble stops bouncing. It’s not too early to begin planning for that. If nothing else, it will give readers of this blog something to think about while standing in bread lines or hiding in the basement while riot police and insurgents duke it out in the streets. That benefit aside, the sooner we start thinking about the options that will be available once relative stability returns, the better chance we’ll have of being ready to implement it, in our own lives or on a broader scale, once stability returns. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the interesting consequences of crisis, for that matter, is that what was unthinkable before a really substantial crisis may not be unthinkable afterwards. Read Barbara Tuchman’s brilliant <i>The Proud Tower</i> and you’ll see how many of the unquestioned certainties of 1914 were rotting in history’s compost bucket by the time 1945 rolled around, and how many ideas that had been on the outermost fringes before the First World War that had become plain common sense after the Second. It’s a common phenomenon, and I propose to get ahead of the curve here by proposing, as raw material for reflection if nothing else, something that’s utterly unthinkable today but may well be a matter of necessity ten or twenty or forty years from now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What do I have in mind? Intentional technological regression as a matter of public policy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Imagine, for a moment, that an industrial nation were to downshift its technological infrastructure to roughly what it was in 1950. That would involve a drastic decrease in energy consumption per capita, both directly—people used a lot less energy of all kinds in 1950—and indirectly—goods and services took much less energy to produce then, too. It would involve equally sharp decreases in the per capita consumption of most resources. It would also involve a sharp <i>increase</i> in jobs for the working classes—a great many things currently done by robots were done by human beings in those days, and so there were a great many more paychecks going out of a Friday to pay for the goods and services that ordinary consumers buy. Since a steady flow of paychecks to the working classes is one of the major things that keep an economy stable and thriving, this has certain obvious advantages, but we can leave those alone for now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course the change just proposed would involve certain changes from the way we do things. Air travel in the 1950s was extremely expensive—the well-to-do in those days were called “the jet set,” because that’s who could afford tickets—and so everyone else had to put up with fast, reliable, energy-efficient railroads when they needed to get from place to place. Computers were rare and expensive, which meant once again that more people got hired to do jobs, and also meant that when you called a utility or a business, your chance of getting a human being who could help you with whatever problem you might have was considerably higher than it is today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Lacking the internet, people had to make do instead with their choice of scores of AM and shortwave radio stations, thousands of general and specialized print periodicals, and full-service bookstores and local libraries bursting at the seams with books—in America, at least, the 1950s were the golden age of the public library, and most small towns had collections you can’t always find in big cities these days. Oh, and the folks who like looking at pictures of people with their clothes off, and who play a large and usually unmentioned role in paying for the internet today, had to settle for naughty magazines, mail-order houses that shipped their products in plain brown wrappers, and tacky stores in the wrong end of town. (For what it’s worth, this didn’t seem to inconvenience them any.)</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As previously noted, I’m quite aware that such a project is utterly unthinkable today, and we’ll get to the superstitious horror that lies behind that reaction in a bit. First, though, let’s talk about the obvious objections. Would it be possible? Of course. Much of it could be done by simple changes in the tax code. Right now, in the United States, a galaxy of perverse regulatory incentives penalize employers for hiring people and reward them for replacing employees with machines. Change those so that spending money on wages, salaries and benefits up to a certain comfortable threshold makes more financial sense for employers than using the money to automate, and you’re halfway there already.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A revision in trade policy would do most of the rest of what’s needed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What’s jokingly called “free trade,” despite the faith-based claims of economists, benefits the rich at everyone else’s expense, and would best be replaced by sensible tariffs to support domestic production against the sort of predatory export-driven mercantilism that dominates the global economy these days. Add to that high tariffs on technology imports, and strip any technology beyond the 1950 level of the lavish subsidies that fatten the profit margins of the welfare-queen corporations in the Fortune 500, and you’re basically there. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What makes the concept of technological regression so intriguing, and so workable, is that it doesn’t require anything new to be developed. We already know how 1950 technology worked, what its energy and resource needs are, and what the upsides and downsides of adopting it would be; abundant records and a certain fraction of the population who still remember how it worked make that easy. Thus it would be an easy thing to pencil out exactly what would be needed, what the costs and benefits would be, and how to minimize the former and maximize the latter; the sort of blind guesses and arbitrary assumptions that have to go into deploying a brand new technology need not apply. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So much for the first objection. Would there be downsides to deliberate technological regression? Of course. Every technology and every set of policy options has its downsides.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A common delusion these days claims, in effect, that it’s unfair to take the downsides of new technologies or the corresponding upsides of old ones into consideration when deciding whether to replace an older technology with a newer one. An even more common delusion claims that you’re not supposed to decide at all; once a new technology shows up, you’re supposed to run bleating after it like everyone else, without asking any questions at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Current technology has immense downsides. Future technologies are going to have them, too—it’s only in sales brochures and science fiction stories, remember, that any technology is without them. Thus the mere fact that 1950 technology has problematic features, too, is not a valid reason to dismiss technological retrogression. The question that needs to be asked, however unthinkable it might be, is whether, all things considered, it’s wiser to accept the downsides of 1950 technology in order to have a working technological suite that can function on much smaller per capita inputs of energy and resources, and thus a much better chance to get through the age of limits ahead than today’s far more extravagant and brittle technological infrastructure. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably also necessary to talk about a particular piece of paralogic that comes up reliably any time somebody suggests technological regression: the notion that if you return to an older technology, you have to take the social practices and cultural mores of its heyday as well. I fielded a good many such comments last year when <a href=../../2014/02/the-steampunk-future.html>I suggested steam-powered Victorian technology</a> powered by solar energy as a form the ecotechnics of the future might take. An astonishing number of people seemed unable to imagine that it was possible to have such a technology without also reintroducing Victorian habits such as child labor and sexual prudery. Silly as that claim is, it has deep roots in the modern imagination. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No doubt, as a result of those deep roots, there will be plenty of people who respond to the proposal just made by insisting that the social practices and cultural mores of 1950 were awful, and claiming that those habits can’t be separated from the technologies I’m discussing. I could point out in response that 1950 didn’t have a single set of social practices and cultural mores; even in the United States, a drive from Greenwich Village to rural Pennsylvania in 1950 would have met with remarkable cultural diversity among people using the same technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The point could be made even more strongly by noting that the same technology was in use that year in Paris, Djakarta, Buenos Aires, Tokyo, Tangiers, Novosibirsk, Guadalajara, and Lagos, and the social practices and cultural mores of 1950s middle America didn’t follow the technology around to these distinctly diverse settings, you know. Pointing that out, though, will likely be wasted breath. To true believers in the religion of progress, the past is the bubbling pit of eternal damnation from which the surrogate messiah of progress is perpetually saving us, and the future is the radiant heaven into whose portals the faithful hope to enter in good time. Most people these days are no more willing to question those dubious classifications than a medieval peasant would be to question the miraculous powers that supposely emanated from the bones of St. Ethelfrith. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nothing, but nothing, stirs up shuddering superstitious horror in the minds of the cultural mainstream these days as effectively as the thought of, heaven help us, “going back.” Even if the technology of an earlier day is better suited to a future of energy and resource scarcity than the infrastructure we’ve got now, even if the technology of an earlier day actually does a better job of many things than what we’ve got today, “we can’t go back!” is the anguished cry of the masses. They’ve been so thoroughly bamboozled by the propagandists of progress that they never stop to think that, why, yes, they can, and there are valid reasons why they might even decide that it’s the best option open to them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a very rich irony in the fact that alternative and avant-garde circles tend to be even more obsessively fixated on the dogma of linear progress than the supposedly more conformist masses. That’s one of the sneakiest features of the myth of progress; when people get dissatisfied with the status quo, the myth convinces them that the only option they’ve got is to do exactly what everyone else is doing, and just take it a little further than anyone else has gotten yet. What starts off as rebellion thus gets coopted into perfect conformity, and society continues to march mindlessly along its current trajectory, like lemmings in a Disney nature film, without ever asking the obvious questions about what might be waiting at the far end. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the thing about progress; all the word means is “continued movement in the same direction.” If the direction was a bad idea to start with, or if it’s passed the point at which it still made sense, continuing to trudge blindly onward into the gathering dark may not be the best idea in the world. Break out of that mental straitjacket, and the range of possible futures broadens out immeasurably. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It may be, for example, that technological regression to the level of 1950 turns out to be impossible to maintain over the long term. If the technologies of 1920<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>can be supported on the modest energy supply we can count on getting from renewable sources, for example, something like a 1920 technological suite might be maintained over the long term, without further regression. It might turn out instead that something like the solar steampower I mentioned earlier, an ecotechnic equivalent of 1880 technology, might be the most complex technology that can be supported on a renewable basis. It might be the case, for that matter, that something like the technological infrastructure the United States had in 1820, with windmills and water wheels as the prime movers of industry, canalboats as the core domestic transport technology, and most of the population working on small family farms to support very modest towns and cities, is the fallback level that can be sustained indefinitely. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Does that last option seem unbearably depressing? Compare it to another very likely scenario—what will happen if the world’s industrial societies gamble their survival on a great leap forward to some unproven energy source, which doesn’t live up to its billing, and leaves billions of people twisting in the wind without any working technological infrastructure at all—and you may find that it has its good points. If you’ve driven down a dead end alley and are sitting there with the front grill hard against a brick wall, it bears remembering, shouting “We can’t go back!” isn’t exactly a useful habit. In such a situation—and I’d like to suggest that that’s a fair metaphor for the situation we’re in right now—going back, retracing the route as far back as necessary, is the one way forward. </div>

Well done. I would like to point out one perhaps silly issue that distresses me, which is that a prepositional phrase cannot modify the number of a verb. From this current essay: "An astonishing number of people these days seem unable", "a certain subset of my readers are", "a galaxy of perverse regulatory incentives penalize". If you delete the preposition, I think you will see my point. It is just that it makes my teeth grate.

Currently of course part of the appeal of ipods, computers, cellphones et all is that when we pick them up or see them we think 'wow its just like out 'XX' sci fi movie! wow I feel so... cool with this! i feel like I'm stepping into 'the future' Man! or perhaps to put it another way, its all about how 'thneeds' are marketed (if you've read Dr Seus you'll remember the manufacture of 'thineeds' that everyone 'needs' in the Lorax story). I reckon the same could be done (and in fact has been done) with older technology. Many people, even diehard petrol-heads still have a romantic affiliation with trains/ steam-engines etc. Exploit that and you might have an excuse to build or restore more railways. trams are another example in a similar vein. I would make a similar case for books too. Books, in my opinion anyway, are always much aesthetically nicer and more fulfilling than staring at an electronic screen. Or I recall the other day i was watching the film 'Cuban Fury' about Salsa dancing. Despite the film being very recent (released last year) and being about music, there were no ipods or even CDs in sight. Only turn tables and cassette tapes. Cassette tapes and turn tables are sexier I guess. Anyway you get the point I'm sure. Exploit the romantic dimensions of simpler/older technologies and you might be on to a winner! (the same could be said older social conventions too)<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c9210279562477957337 title="comment permalink">1/28/15, 5:30 PM</a><br><br>

I would modify it in two key respects. I would like to see the knowledge we have gained through this point in time preserved, while opting to go in an lower energy direction. We have some better designs for instance for boats (new keel shapes), better bridge designs (such as cable stayed bridges that require less material), and so on. We can use those while reviving rail transit, which is the most energy efficient mode available. We have a world of 7 billion people, we must not poison ourselves with our pollution. I suspect that the economic system we we have will need to be modified to move away from a disposable, planned obsolescence economy because of diminishing resources. <br><br>I agree that at some point, we will have to do what we can with the technologies we have available. while operating under tight resource constraints. This will be a huge change from our current consumer driven society, based on extracting nonrenewable resources.<br><br>I studied engineering and recognize its limitations. In addition, I am well acquainted with history and what kinds of decisions societies have made in these situations in the past. I suspect that the initial political response will be to attempt to procure access to these resources by military means. Which will have the effect of accelerating the decline of these resources, thus giving less time to adapt.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c6434070302818908662 title="comment permalink">1/28/15, 5:40 PM</a><br><br>

Much of it was specifically postwar application of German wartime advances in creating "ersatz" (substitute) materials from -- as surely you're aware -- petrochemicals and coal tars, to replace the organic foods, fibers, and construction materials that they had sourced from overseas before Depression and WWII closed down imports. The foundations for most of our Superfund sites were established in the 50's, along with the first worldwide spread of deadly environmental toxins like DDT. So while the human and economic benefits you describe are appealing, I'm wondering if 1920 or even 1820 might not be a better idea.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c8522764533331628386 title="comment permalink">1/28/15, 5:43 PM</a><br><br>

As an interesting correlating side note, I picked up this week a mid-80's second hand radio tuner for a bargain. Mate, this thing is the crème de la crème and still rates very highly even today. I live in a weak signal area - due to the surrounding mountains - so such things are important. My activities will drift into the ham side of things later this year - all being well with the environment here.<br><br>Interestingly too, being on the side of a hill I've been wondering about pumps. Hand pumps just seem like a lot of work and water has this pesky habit of always wanting to go downhill. So, anyway, I've been thinking about maybe a small wind driven pump. I tried the wind turbine for electric and found out that it wasn't windy enough for that here, but it probably is for pumping water. Dunno, I'll have a think about that for later in the year.<br><br>You know back when I was a young lad, if you wanted to purchase contraceptives you had to travel to the - what they used to delicately call here - R Rated Bookshops. A truly fascinating beast and it would have made an interesting research project - and most unlike the rather large and flashy brightly lit big box store equivalents of the modern era. Back in the day they did a roaring trade and it had a very naughty vibe which made it quite the experience. Personally though pornography bores the living daylights out of me and certainly the sheer availability of it undermines its naughty factor.<br><br>I'm very interested to see how Greece goes. If they had any cojones they'd withdraw from the Euro and do an Iceland in relation to their unpayable debt. Things would improve markedly for the average punter on the street and it may just halt the rise of extremism. Just sayin...<br><br>I'm a bit old school in my thoughts on debt as I consider that the lender has a responsibility to ensure that the borrower can repay those funds prior to lending them. The lender therefore has a measure of responsibility - and those guys are trying so desperately to ignore that these days and off load their risk onto the public.

Here's one: I think that the lower energy and resource use of the 1950's was not as much due to the technology of the day as DESPITE the technology of the day. Many things - in the US - were done then in ways that were rather wasteful, or costly in resources. But the overall material wealth was lower, along with sparser population - and there was far worse poverty across most of the globe.<br><br>E.g., take a household radio. Back then it was a major investment, was large and held a lot of material resources, and used a lot of power to run relative to, e.g., the smallish but decent quality "transistor radio" I have these days that emits pretty good sound too. Even a computer these days uses less power to run, but there we're getting into a lot of "embedded energy". (And I am not pretending that the power running a smartphone equals the power running the internet. *)<br><br>But, in the 1950's, an American family would share one radio. Now it's several electronic devices per person (of all ages).

To take it in stages does make some sense. The 1950's as I dimly recall was a time of oil still. I think we have to go earlier. If we look back things went from human muscle power to animal power, to wood, then charcoal, then coal, then petroleum, then nuclear, then solar panels then wind generated electricity. I have a feeling we will have to go all the way back to wood and charcoal. That would also include significant animal power like draft horses and oxen. It would also include moving air and water power but not for electricity unfortunately. They would have to be used directly to power grain mills, hammer mills, and sawing operations. The problem as I see it is the decline will be uneven. Those still old enough to remember the 1950s will be gone and never pass on what they know. Personally, I can assure myself of a modest supply of electricity for the rest of my life. I don't have any personal need to drop my lifestyle down much more. Now my kids will be a different story. So I will take the lifestyle hit for them. Drop down to wood and charcoal just to show them how it is done. <br>The difficult part for me will be slaughtering my own animals. My daughter wants me to raise them all as pets. How do you go about teaching that this is a necessary survival evil. They are not vegans but dislike the idea of their father beheading chickens and gutting them. Bleeding out a pig is ritualistic barbarism but if you like sausage what are you going to do? How do you get a supermarket culture to accept how you actually get tasty things like bacon and steak. I have been ankle deep in animal blood and entrails but my kids have not. I didn't necessarily like it but it is how one gets meat. I understand this but I haven't the foggiest idea how to teach that lesson. Do you let them eat only fruits and vegetables until they are sick of their blandness?<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c6197384871506332897 title="comment permalink">1/28/15, 7:45 PM</a><br><br>

That is, actively choosing to revert to a set of less complex technologies will shifht the balance of control we have over our tools back towards the individual.<br>In other words, if we get the opportunity to do things right, as we regress collectively on the technologies we use, we will progress individually to a far greater mastery of our tools...<br> That is one bright side of the medal we will have to carry forward.<br><br>And for those who don't necessarily have a horse stable or a waterway in their backyards, there are are so many more skills that make sense to learn inside a urban setting. Making basic wearables like gloves and socks is going to be essential, items that will be in high demand as human physical labour comes back to the center of work power.<br>Making cheese, soap and candles... All of which does not necessarily require even a backyard. A home forgery workshop might be practicable for those living in houses with a backyard. There may be an intermediary step in the way of homemade lighting devices, between the electrofluorescent lightbulbs we have now and the old-fashioned wax candles.

My street is not plowed so everybody collaborated on digging paths so we could all help dig each other out. Anyone who had snowblowers was not using them because the drifts were way too deep. It was all slow work with shovels, so we had all day to hear everyone's stories and get caught up. Every so often some of us would go into our apartments and bring out a thermos of coffee or sandwiches. We collapsed back to 1950 for a day. It may all sound like cliche, but people enjoy feeling useful and appreciated. I think most of us had a good time.

They still often have one foot in modern technology if they can afford it, by installing enough solar panels to run lights and the washing machine.

The idea is to minimize their 'carbon footprint'. Their part in saving the world, they think.<br><br>Let's face it. Most don't want to go back because it feels like failure and the past was perceived as riddled with hardships. What! No or limited Television? Surely, you jest! Never mind the mass texting withdrawal millions would go through. Personally, I couldn't take the TV dinners and margarine of the mid-century modern era. And don't forget, the folks of the 1950's were very forward thinking - dump the old ways because we have technology! Just look at the soulless, stark architecture that came out of that time. Suburban sprawl and car oriented landscapes. 1950ish was the demon spawn of what we have today. There's no utopia period because each era has its downside. Polio, TB, urban slums, tyrannical monarchies, plastic food, pollution, world wars, resource depletion and the plague if you hit the middle ages. <br><br>No, I think this whole modern, crazy system needs to play itself out as cycles do.

I actually enjoy the fact that the phone never breaks as opposed to my shattered iPhone, and the battery lasts for weeks. It does only one thing and that is to make and receive phone calls, but it does that thing splendidly.

But seriously, it's already happening:<br><br><i>To the rallying cry, “Old is Gold”, millions are re-embracing technologies that seemed doomed to a cobwebby obsolescence. Clam-shell and “flip” phones are the new height of chic, with the likes of Anna Wintour, editor of US Vogue, singer Rihanna and actress Scarlett Johansson all flaunting the venerable devices. Good-quality examples of these old phones can fetch over £800 – far more than the latest Apple iPhone 6 – and so big is the demand that Samsung, the Korean manufacturer, is bringing out a new version.<br><br> The appeal is only partly faddishness. For the old phones actually do what phones used to do, which is to make and receive phone calls, without depositing your whole life in cyberspace where it can be stolen and used to embarrass you before the entire world. According to the New York Times, one of the main attractions of the retro-phone for celebrities is that it helps keep their secrets safe. And, as rocker Iggy Pop says, “You can drop it and it doesn’t break.”<br><br>The same sound reasoning may explain the extraordinary comeback of the Polaroid “instant photo” camera, once the instrument of choice for aficionados of amateur erotic snaps. Last year’s Hollywood nude photo scandal in which hackers accessed Apple’s iCloud storage system and put naked pictures of more than 100 actresses, including Jennifer Lawrence and Kirsten Dunst, on the internet, had a chilling effect in celebrity circles... <br><br>Even typewriters are bouncing back. Spooked by the WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden affairs, intelligence agencies and political groups are reportedly returning to Cold War technology to keep their secrets safe. The glamour is back, too. Movie star Tom Hanks recently published a “love letter” to the typewriter, declaring: “The tactile pleasure of typing is incomparable... there is a sheer physical pleasure to typing.”</i><br><br><a href=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/11351682/Why-low-tech-living-is-back.html rel=nofollow>Why low tech living is back</a><br><br>The thing that might bring it about, though, might just as likely be a major cyberattack that takes down the banking system or electric grid, or a Carrington event: <a href=http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/is-technology-making-us-vulnerable/ rel=nofollow>Technological progress makes us more vulnerable to catastrophe</a> (Aeon)<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c8132326519065751495 title="comment permalink">1/28/15, 9:02 PM</a><br><br>

So first, let me say thank you, for many good, thought provoking reads. I do have a small bone to pick with this week's missive: <br><br>It isn't (or really should not be) phrased as a rolling back to a technology of 20 or 50 or any number of years ago. That makes it seem as though the decision is picking the right point in history to regress to. <br><br>Rather, this change will give us the opportunity (read need) to apply some long missing engineering logic to how we do things and make things. <br><br>Due to the constraints of loosing much of the latest technology, we will be forced to actually look and evaluate how we do things, picking the most practical solution available, with far fewer resources to throw at problems.<br><br>Let's face it, does a toaster with digital readouts and a microprocessor really give you better toast than its 1940 counterpart, with a mechanical timer and no processing power at all? No not really, but the fancy dials/buttons and flashing lights lured many. <br><br>Marketing hype and unnecessary technological doodads won't be an option for most things. Products will be judged/sold/traded on practicality: how well they work, how long they last. Not on fancy ad campaigns and bells and whistles.<br><br>The level of technology used will differ, depending on the task at hand. Some tasks will warrant the use of whatever level of technology we can still scrape up and use (ham radio, communications). Other tasks may regress much further back, not because we don't have "newer" technology for them, but because they don't really need it. <br><br>I expect to see toasters again like the pre-electric ones that were meant to sit over a fire and would flip your bread with a quick turn of a wire bail. No heat source of their own.<br><br>A subtle point perhaps, but we should be thinking in terms of what level of technology do I really need to solve this task, instead of leafing through the history book and choosing a good year in technology to move back to. Innovation will be how little in the way of limited resources can go into a solution that still will solve the problem.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c7919734310447103433 title="comment permalink">1/28/15, 9:09 PM</a><br><br>

On the rare occasions I set foot in one, I find airports surreal in the extreme. <br><br>Moshe, the embedded energy is one of the keys to the whole issue. It's the same sort of whole-system effect that's bringing the global economy down -- costs that are pushed off a company's or an industry's books by loading them onto the rest of society, or the biosphere, don't go away, and if they pile up high enough they can break the system. Sure, your transistor (or more likely integrated-circult) radio is very efficient compared to a tube-based radio. Factor in the energy cost of the infrastructure, the raw materials, and everything else, and you may be facing a very different reality. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, yes, it's much the same idea, but the different focus is crucial. The thought of becoming a third world country doesn't shake most Americans as forcefully as the thought of going back to the past. <br><br>Tomuru, what do you do? You wallow in ritualistic barbarism, of course. (What other answer did you expect from a Druid, for heaven's sake?) Do the thing, and after the first few times, it'll become routine. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, excellent; that gets you tonight's gold star, for pointing out what should be obvious and generally isn't.<br><br>Jay, good. You've grasped that we can pick and choose among technologies, rather than simply buying into the cant that insists that we have to take whatever progress (that is to say, the corporate marketers masquerading as progress) wants to give us. <br><br>Other Tom, true enough! I suspect we'll see quite a bit of that as things continue. <br><br>Debra, I've already granted that each period has its downside, and I defy you to show me where I claimed that the 1950s, or any other period, was utopia. If a period in the past had a technological suite better suited to our future than the one we've got now, why not adopt it -- instead of sitting passively on the sofa and "letting the cycle play out," reaching a destination I think you can identify just as well as I can...<br><br>Jemand, in your place I'd assemble a private company of physicists and engineers, and see what you can get in terms of contracts. My guess is that if you can get a foot in the door, you're on your way to a steady job, if a somewhat dangerous one. <br><br>Erica, good. Next, you can try a land line with an answering machine, which is what I use -- it does the job perfectly well, and doesn't allow people to harass me when I'm not interested in taking calls. As for posting comments, it's remarkable how often you can get an "obsolete" computer for free from those who can't handle not being able to waste their lives on the latest video game -- and that also means you only field emails and post comments when you deliberately choose to sit down at the desk and do that, and thus have plenty of spare time for other activities. <br><br>Knutty, by all means -- they had washing machines in 1950, you know, and indeed in 1920 as well. As for an art degree, it's worth a shot -- just don't let them talk you into abandoning your instinctive personal aesthetic and copying the latest dreary avant-garde dreck.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c9175599911693908073 title="comment permalink">1/28/15, 9:19 PM</a><br><br>

I've been up to my eyeballs in other work, so haven't been able to get on the air, but I haven't abandoned the project by any means. Getting people interested in doing anything -- well, other than a little light gardening -- is never easy, and especially so if it's something that doesn't fit the stereotypes we all carry in our heads. Still, I'd encourage you to keep at it -- I think of how many years it took to get <i>The Archdruid Report</i> past fifteen or twenty readers a week, and one or two comments.<br><br>Curt, good. Now explore how many things like that you can do in your own life. <br><br>Oilman, okay, you've got the central point, which is that we have the capacity to pick and choose -- you don't have to accept everything that's labeled "new" on faith. Still, whether or not a mesh net can be cobbled together for the short term doesn't answer the question of whether the internet as a whole is viable. I've talked to people who work in data centers; over and above the colossal power usage, they have to bring in whole semi loads of hard drives and other components every single day, to keep up with maintenance and equipment breakdown. That's probably not sustainable, and without the big data centers, how much more useful is your mesh net than an old BBS system? <br><br>Unknown, that is to say, you've found some downsides. I already addressed that in my post, and it's a bit rude, don't you think, to respond to a post and act as though the post didn't address the issue you're raising? As for St. Ethelfrith -- I don't happen to know if there's a saint of that name, btw -- as I noted above, I don't object at all to people putting their faith in saints, deities, or what have you.

I get so much from it and your books. I have to vote with one of your other guests that until the heavy burden of parasites, crooks, and grifters running the current paradigm are winnowed out, we are all at great risk. As such, a 1950's world will still mean they are in charge.<br><br>My partner and I are working very hard on a homestead and paying off the debt. We're so close. However, the tax burden is large. My worry is that the tax burden will grow to maintain the edifice of this paradigm until it has ruined way to many people.

Aside from technology, two major aspects of the U.S. culture stand out for me:<br>- This was the early post-WWII period, characterized by a confidence and exuberance that naturally followed the successful conclusion of a multi-year crisis. This, of course, led to the baby boom that was a major force for economic growth over the next several decades.<br>- This was the time of the growing competition between Capitalistic Democracy and Godless Communism (as seen from the US, of course). The Soviet Union, which was a valuable ally during The War, was becoming a serious threat.<br>Of course, these are two examples of things we wouldn't want to adopt.<br><br>As the article points out, however, we don't have to adopt the cultural features of the time to take advantage of the technological aspects. In fact, our imaginary technological downshift will need to be accompanied by a cultural one as well, both informed by applicable current knowledge. Some aspects that come to mind:<br>- As mentioned in the article, the move to 1950 technologies may well be taken as just a first step. It might well intentionally include planning for further steps down.<br>- In addition to technology, a population downshift will be appropriate (and maybe critical). Reproduction below the replacement rate might need to be a feature, to stay within the carrying capacities of our often crippled environments.<br>- "Ecological literacy" must be a standard feature of education, for adults as well as children, to inform going from a mindset of "we're separate from and above nature, and can bend her to our will", to one of a respect for Gaia and designing of all our practices to conform to her limitations and leveraging of the support she can give. For this reason, we'd want to adapt rather than adopt 1950s technologies.<br>- We might well study the experience of Cuba during the "special period" after the Soviet Union collapsed, and the massive economic and energy subsidies ended. Among other things, they developed a set of medical technologies and practices appropriate to third world environments and resources, that have achieved close to first world outcomes.<br>- There'd likely be a place for "culture conserver" efforts along the lines you (we) have explored.<br><br>Maybe creating the vision and outlining a "project plan" could be turned into a joint task of the "collapse aware" communities. (Note that by "project plan" I'm not talking about the typical industrial top-down project, but a loosely coordinated, combined effort of a variety of participants, somewhat like open-source software projects.

Sounds a good plan, and it’s always good to have a good plan.<br><br>A swing back to simpler times will probably be accompanied by a significant unravelling of established regulatory authority such as national and local government laws and enforcement.

Outside the reaper classes (political, business elite, bankers) most people will easily admit that they are ‘fed up’ with the downsides of modern technology. A case in point; the area in which I live is getting super fast broadband installed at a cost of many millions doled out by central government. It’s an overwhelmingly rural area with lots of small villages inhabited by farmers, unemployed fishermen and little old ladies whose only use for the internet is to look up jam recipes - probably not the kind of people who need a 300Mbps connection. Nevertheless the project continues, roads are dug up, men in fluorescent jackets and hardhats are everywhere and large billboards announce its imminent arrival. Certainly among the people I know there’s a sense that this is all just ‘going through the motions’ — that it’s all about someone somewhere making some money. In the meantime the services and technology that they really want — local buses, local shops and decent public services such as open libraries, clean public toilets and functioning police stations — are being mercilessly clobbered because the relatively small sums of money needed to keep them going are vanishing into thin air. If a local politician were to come along and proposes scrapping the super fast broadband scheme, instead investing the savings in local services of the type outlined above, I believe they would be elected.<br><br><br>@William Philipson. Not wanting to delve too deep into the realms of pedantry, I believe JMG is right to to use the plural in these instances. This whole issue was a matter of some debate when I was a newspaper editor with a team of journalists from both Britain and the US. The house style was British English so I found myself constantly having to correct instances of ‘The staff is …’ or ‘A selection of voters was …’. Researching the issue it appears that — like many things in the English language — there are no hard and fast rules, only conventions. In this case the convention appears to be that if you are referring to a countable group of people then they are referred to in the respectful plural rather than the somewhat dehumanising singular. Given JMG’s huge breadth of reading I can only assume he has read a lot of books written by British or Commonwealth authors who abide by this format, and that this particular grammatical convention has found a willing home. In the case of the staff at the newspaper, they weren’t too happy, but that’s why I always kept a copy of Fowler’s Modern English Usage on my desk.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c5607063883913389706 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 1:16 AM</a><br><br>

Some of these people actually <i>live</i> in the era they have adopted as their own, trying to make everything in their homes &amp; lives authentic, even doing their washing by hand, although some just adopt a 1950s or 1940s persona for the events that we trade at. <br><br>Like the re-enactors who "live" in an earlier alternative reality at weekends, re-fighting the battle of Waterloo, fletching medieval arrows or weaving homespun cloaks for Celtic chieftains, these people are actually keeping important skills alive &amp; there are useful everyday ideas to be gleaned from their events. How to make a cake or a good loaf without a packet mix or stand-mixer, for example! Or how to turn a collar, how to make a good chutney, how to make a wooden button from a sturdy twig or a lucet from a forked one. They may seem laughable, or even pitiable, from the viewpoint of mainstream society, but such events are always a pleasure and an inspiration to be invited to trade at. Our customers are lovely people.<br><br>The best bits are the evening dances - live music, people having a LOT of fun, with minimal technological assistance; even if you're just sitting on the edge of the dance floor &amp; watching in awe, your feet will be tapping. We also trade at our local big music festival, and watching people's bored faces at the headline acts, &amp; total lack of any kind of involvement except taking selfies to prove they were there, I know which events I'd prefer to attend for myself!

I'm not sure about 1950, but my mom remembers having a coal furnace in the 1940's and shoveling coal into it to reheat the house in the morning. And apparently they didn't have thermostats, so you just let your house heat up to 90 degrees if you put to much coal in, and let it slowly sink back to 60s, or maybe open the windows if its really too hot.<br><br>And they had an "icebox" during the summer and an iceman came around with blocks of ice every week, and so your food would stay between 40-60 degrees. And her dad was a Milkman for a while and he'd deliver glass bottles of milk to people's steps every morning.<br><br>And although there was more food waste, there were pig farms within the city limits, and all the spoiled food and scrapes would be collected for free and dumped into the pens. I actually got to do some childhood archeology when they built a park in the 1970's on top of a local pig farm, and found ceramic dishes, and bones as they excavated.<br><br>Well, just thinking a bit of that past. But the key focus I see is we should measure security in "needing less money" in the future, and getting rid of debt is the first step, and sharing space, like making spare bedrooms available for cheap rent for trusted people who need a place to stay.<br><br>And interestingly for the moment, ObamaCare seems a boon for anyone who knows how to live cheaply, since it is subsidized based on income so that gives extract advantage to single-income families who are debt free, and can live on a fraction of the income of other families.<br><br>And for those of us who are debt free, knowing our 401ks are living on borrowed time, we might give it all away to charity, to a local institution meeting local needs, so they are not servicing debt.<br><br>Anyway, I guess the stage I see we're in is "wealth destruction", imaginary paper wealth is going to disappear, so anyone who has it, should take some extra time to see where it can be "spent" in the local community to make it stronger.<br><br>I almost think there will be a time when there will be widescale government paydowns of personal debt - student loans or mortgages, since the defaults and bankruptcies are going to force something dramatic.<br><br>Whatever else Paul Krugman is wrong about, sovereign debt allows wide choices of a central government, so we may become a dictatorship before the end, but money will keep flowing until it can be used to heat our homes.<br><br>Oh, that shows a MAJOR question - 1950's is pre-virtual money. Will we return to a cash-only system? At least an FDIC-insured account can instantly be raided in a crisis, or digital banking frozen, so between cash and local currencies, we have some experimenting to do.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c3699654508297227013 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 1:38 AM</a><br><br>

Our farm ute is a 1975 Land Rover, with which I am continually tinkering in order to keep running.<br><br>Similarly, our off grid system is equipped with Edison batteries, first patented in 1901. Lovely long lived things that I am hoping to get 50 years or more out of. Just yesterday I topped them up with a bit over 20L of distilled water. I’ll need to do it again in three months or so. And again three months after that. And once more three months after… …you get the picture. My still gets a huge workout, constantly. Luckily I can also use it to make vodka, gin and rum, so it’s not a complete waste <br><br>Our water pumps were built in the thirties and need leather moving parts replaced annually or more frequently (the last service took me three days of grunting on the end of huge spanners to achieve). The forties vintage engines I use to drive them are similarly cranky at times. The cheapie fire pumps our neighbours use to move water kark it after three to five years, but probably haven’t even had their oil changed in that time.<br><br>From what I can see, kit that is considered “modern” is not merely disposable, but “maintenance free.” And it seems that, for most people in the richer part of the west, the maintenance free angle is the second most important component of a machine’s features (after its colour).<br><br>Somehow an enjoyment of tinkering needs to be rekindled in those that have lost it, or that horror of going backwards may never be overcome.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Les<br><br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c8686394385673549851 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 2:06 AM</a><br><br>

Your passage about "cultural mores" during the 1950s got me thinking about another one of the effects of "progress" in the modern age that isn't often discussed -- the homogenization of culture.<br><br>During those times, you still had an adult population that grew up in a world with very distinct regional cultures (like my grandfather, who has lived all of his 96 years in Western PA). Some of them in the more rural areas without access to electricity (like my grandfather, again) grew up without even access to radio. This meant that the regional cultures that had grown up over generations there (his family settled there in the 1790s, when it was still "frontier") was still largely intact, with all of its peculiarities and uniqueness.<br><br>Contrast that with the manner in which first radio, then television, and finally the internet have served to effectively overwhelm all regional cultures and replace them with a single consumer culture. In the old cultures, making things yourself was prized because it was necessary. In the modern consumer culture it is denigrated as the realm of poor people unable to afford the latest and greatest. Likewise, even entertainment in those regional cultures was the responsibility of people to provide for themselves -- today all people have to do is sit back and be entertained.<br><br>I think that part of the horror with which people recoil from the idea of resetting at a lower technological level is the fear of abandoning all of the trappings of a homogenized, consumer culture and having to actually create their own culture once again. Additionally, we've been conditioned to believe that there are no differences between people or groups in the modern world, when the historical record (and experience of only 3-4 generations ago) tells us that there are vast differences.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c8650202594295920388 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 5:29 AM</a><br><br>

Her father was rather old (born in 1895) and conservative as well as very thrifty, so they were somewhat late to amenities already common with most other folks. They had no inhouse toilet (but running water in the kitchen and electricity), no central heating, no car or motorbike.

They were almost self-sufficient wrt food, raising and butchering two pigs every year (and maybe selling another one or two), selling milk, eggs and grain. Of course this was a huge amount of work, almost no spare time, but people apparently were used to it.<br><br>Even in my childhood in the 70s/80s, flying was an absolute luxury, not a common way to go for holidays (this changed rapidly in the 1990s I think). And we got most of our vegetables and fruit (including most jams and preserves) from grandmas garden.<br>Unfortunately I did not get to know this older grandpa and while my other grandfather lived until 2000 I neglected to pick up some of his considerably skills in gardening. Although I helpes with harvesting and other tasks it never occurred to me to ask about the important things like planting, which manure to use etc. I just was not interested as a teenager.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c6858990813198881861 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 5:37 AM</a><br><br>

I like simple systems, physical engagement in the world, nature, focusing on the basics. Those things have always held more excitement for me than the latest and greatest stuff.

In part it will depend on what philosophical "isms" come to the fore (in the same way capitalism, socialism, consumerism and liberalism shaped policy on the way up). I assume for a while we'll have a few philosophical tantrums of denial, probably a bout of something looking like fascism, as part of the bouncing rubble phase. <br><br>But what philosophies and stories will the age of obvious decline give rise to, to help inspire people and to shape it? Can we get beyond fear and pessimism and just managing chaos? I bope we can.

Interesting.<br><br>I'd personally benefit quite a bit from a regression to 1950's level of technology. My skills at building, repairing, and salvaging electronics were relegated to a quaint hobby by miniaturization (and the corresponding unavailability of component parts smaller than e.g. "the motherboard") somewhere around 1994. They would become economically valuable again.<br><br>(I suspect that will happen anyhow. In a collapse, salvage and repair become critical economic activities for a while, and what <i>can</i> be salvaged and repaired determines your new effective technology level. Which suggests that for consumer technology, we'll be revisiting the eighties, at least temporarily. I'm surprised there hasn't been more discussion of salvage and repair when the topic of useful skills to prepare oneself with has come up. I'd put them near the top of the list, and accordingly, that's where I've made many of my own preparations.)<br><br>That said, pick-a-year as a way of envisioning a future regressed technology suite might be a good starting point for illustrative purposes, but it can only be a starting point. As I've mentioned before, I believe that a scenario in which canal barges carry cargoes of wooden barrels of LED emitters is completely plausible, if it turns out that barge, barrels, and emitters are each the most resource-effective way of getting their respective jobs done. Note that in terms of how long ago they were invented, the barrels (~300 BC) are closer to the emitters (~AD 2000) than to the barge (~3000 BC).<br><br>The reason departing from a straightforward pick-a-year is necessary and useful is that every past time was, like the present, a hodgepodge of momentary expedients. Nothing was ever thought out completely or designed for sustainability.<br><br>Incandescent light bulbs, for instance. Were they really the icons of ingenuity, simplicity, and perfection we think of them as, or were they more like the printer ink cartridges of the early 20th century? When the filament goes, you have to throw away the whole thing!<br><br>If incandescents do turn out to be more resource-effective overall than LEDs, then let's at least redesign them so that when they burn out, you take them to a local shop to be opened up, have a new filament clipped in, the glass cleaned, and the bulb pumped back down and re-sealed. Why weren't they designed that way in the first place? Momentary expediency. If we're doing things right, nothing should be "thrown away" ever.<br><br>So, my version of the Butlerian Jihad, instead of banning specific technologies, would dictate general principles. "Every assembled part must be individually replaceable, and if broken, recyclable" would be a good start. The idea is to prevent less-resource-effective methods from exploiting the externalities of disposability to out-compete more-resource-effective alternatives. That seems a necessary step on any path to ecotechnicity.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c3707054159413645675 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 7:09 AM</a><br><br>

The urban library I worked in had outsourced, centralized, or automated so many library tasks that there was little actual work to do, unless you count the busy work that supervisors always seem able to find. These are all things that reduce the number of librarians needed. In addition to this, most people go to the internet instead of a mentat...er librarian.<br><br>At the same time, I do find the internet useful. Though I would argue that a large percentage of what we use it for is not. I think we might be able to preserve some EXTREMELY scaled down version of it, but I think by scaling it down and using it for only "useful" functions it might lose one of its greatest strengths. I find that someone or something's greatest strength is also their greatest weakness. With the internet this is the fact that anyone can put anything on it and potentially distribute it to everyone. So voices that don't get heard through older mediums have a better shot and people have a greater opportunity to hear diverse ideas, especially if they live somewhere that has limited access to different forms of media. On the downside, this means that a lot of the internet's resources get used to traffic in junk. <br><br>Of course this begs the question who decides what is junk and what is not. I'm would argue that it is librarians, but I'm biased. In any case, when applied this means regulation which is something that is anathema to most people who love the internet. Video would almost certainly be out of the question, but it might be possible to share audio if done properly.<br><br>A highly distributed network might be able to sustain a very simplified internet. A method of storing and sharing files closer to the way they are shared with Bit torrent, as opposed to using big data centers would greatly reduce the amount of infrastructure. But of course, the computers themselves require lots of resources, as does all the infrastructure that keeps data flowing. So it might not be possible to sustain any internet except perhaps for the government, libraries, and academic institutions. That is if it can be sustained at all.<br><br>I'm very doubtful it can be sustained. So finding ways to do some of what the internet does with more simplified technology (radio and packet radio, possibly assisted by librarians accessing paper archives instead of servers for the purpose of things like interlibrary loans and system wide electronic catalogs) seems like a worthy goal for the tech savy and those familiar with cybernetics. As does finding more resilient ways of recording audio and building computers simpler, so they require less resources and last longer. Even if this means they are not as fast or powerful.

One thought I had was that the mobility of Americans works against your idea: because people leave an area within a couple years (avg), they don’t care about infrastructure, nor do they have the patience to wait. I’ve noticed in my rural community, where generations live, folks are much more easily riled up about negative changes and more interested in helping do something with lasting impact – because they believe <i>their</i> children will be there.<br><br>Ironically, there have been some high-tech gadgets that have helped the artisan and crafter majorly – for example the swiper on the smartphone that turns it into a credit card processor!

Too many people are caught in survival or semi-survival mode these days, from what I can tell of my middle-class friends. They look for what works and/or what catches their eye in a shiny-bauble type way. That said, I believe there is a solid market for refurbished older computers running the old software that the boomers learned on, that allows wordprocessing and spreadsheets and is easier and less error prone than the new bells-and-whistles. If I wasn’t disabled, that would be the field I’d try to go into… as a side biz at first, then see how far it could go. Nostalgia is great, but it has to be practical, too.

Energy efficiency was not exactly a watchword at the time, and many homes built during the time had to be retrofitted in the 1970s (though in their defense they were MUCH smaller than McMansions, and by that token, may use less energy) Cars, heaters, fridges, ovens, and a whole host of other things from that time used a lot of energy and were not well insulated, although they were built to last and be repaired when they did break. I'm guessing that in returning to older tech, resource depletion will be taken into consideration? <br>Because resource scarcity was not an issue, products used a lot more raw materials and were more resilient. In an age of scarcity, I'm thinking the cost of making things to 1950s standards is going to be much higher, and therefore the goods themselves will be reserved to only the wealthiest who can afford them--that 1950s goods would not be as widely available or affordable in a future age of scarcity as opposed to the 1950s age of abundance/expansion.<br>Regarding 1950s social mores, people forget just how LIBERAL the 50s actually were, compared to today. Unionization reached its peak in 1955, wages and benefits were sufficient to ensure a comfortable lifestyle for the working class, the top income bracket(s) paid 90% in income tax, schools, roads, public services, and infrastructure were well funded by sufficient taxes. Brown v. board was decided in 1954, and Truman desegregated the Armed Forces and the Federal Govt.

Another of my favorite ecologists, E.O. Wilson made a bizarre leap of logic and, despite his usually astute observations of the challenges facing our age decided that religion is to blame for all the problems facing the environment right now. (http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/e-o-wilson-im-not-atheist-religion-should-be-eliminated-1485543). You really are starting to turn into one of the only sane voices out there these days. I just hope that when you suggest that “where we are is where we have to face what’s coming” there’s still room for some of those learning curves. I started a lot of projects this year, and it’ll be a long time before I’m anywhere near mastery on any of them. I hope you’re right about the prospect of voluntary technological remediation entering into the public mindset. It rather reminds me of the “sustainability initiatives” the government kept passing in your Christmas 2050 story, so it’s not the first time you’ve suggested something of the sort could happen. <br><br>But the nature of the political unrest I’m seeing right now, makes me worry a lot about what the social aspects of the “new normal” on the other side of crisis. I’m noticing the way that hatred and vitriol towards specific religious and ethnic groups has, over the course of this last year, gravitated toward the center to become a unifying viewpoint across the political spectrum, and it’s become controversial to express the slightest concern about the trend. Europe in particular is beginning to look more and more like the Europe of the 1930s, which is, of course one of the points you made in the first paragraphs of this month’s post.<br><br>For a reminder of the ways people thought about the storms looming on the horizon back before the wars, I reread Howards End last week. I know you’re a fan of Forster because you’ve referenced the Machine Stops so many times, but in a way, Howards end is a novel even more relevant to our times right now. The book is sitting on a precipice, written in 1910, but looking at the factors looming on the horizon and the overwhelming sense that sometime soon there’s going to be an explosion. It touches on the influx of industrialism and urbanization, the decline of old, stable, traditional lifestyles, and even chillingly on the rising tide of nationalism and ethnic tension across Europe that would eventually spark the crises of that century.<br><br>Near the end of the novel, as the characters are looking at the smoke and rust of a creeping, expanding industrial London and reflecting on the fact that whatever the next era brings “life’s going to be melted down all over the world.” The response to the thought is something particularly relevant to this blog:<br><br>“Because a thing is going strong now, it need not go strong forever. This craze for motion has only set in during the last hundred years. It may be followed by a civilization that won’t be at movement, because it will rest on the earth. All the signs are against it now, but I can’t help hoping, and very early in the morning in the garden I feel that our house is the future as well as the past.”<br><br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c8636619780190557074 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 9:07 AM</a><br><br>

Yes, but it went far slower. Since resistance goes up by the cube of wind speed, going slower is an instant mileage gain. So we have simple cars that get 25mpg today: they're called "golf carts" and if you don't have to go fast or far, get exceptional mileage. No need for new inventions, but you can buy a Model T if you wish--they're just a large, tall golf cart. <br><br>Leads to the 2nd observation: when a 1949 Imperial got such terrible mileage, how was energy usage overall so much less? Simple: as above, they didn't drive that far or fast. 35mpg x 35 miles is no competition for 8mpg x 2 miles. This could be made easily true today. If everyone drove half as far to work, the US would be an oil exporter. The answer is: "We waste too much." And on dumb, unnecessary things.<br><br>In addition, calculate the all-in infrastructure. Roads: not paved. Helps reduce your speed. Roads: not plowed. Reduces unnecessary trips and encourages a home pantry. Number of parts in car: 1/20th as many. Lifespan of object: still running today. Most repairs done with hammer and screwdriver: check. <br><br>Liability? Not really. What's the real hardship of having a nice car that lasts a generation, is simple to drive, has cheap repairs, and gets you to a store and hospital which are now within 5-10 miles and not 50 miles? Actually, sounds pretty nice. <br><br>So that's part of your all-in calculation from 1950.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c3561426406409361298 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 9:09 AM</a><br><br>

If chips were optimized for power consumption rather than speed, it wouldn't take much more than a trickle to support as much calculus as you could need for almost any engineering application.

Sure I can get out of the weather when I like, and am wealthy is social connections, but it is much more difficult to broker pantry and kitchen space.<br><br>Collapsing in 2012 did little to help me be prepared for the more general collapse around, contraction on my entire social ecosystem hit hard a little over a month ago and is accelerating. Nearly half the people I am close to are with in a couple bad rolls of full on crisis, or already in crisis. The most valuable part of collapsing has been the failure, living in a collapsing system means that failure in one form or another happens very often, and if ones ego is invested in a project it is quite humiliating and repetitive. That's ok though, because the vast majority of failures are not lethal, even in a crisis! And nothing is better than failure at teaching about oneself and kith. I hope these very non material lessons will be helpful.<br><br>Well, enough of this. Stay safe everybody! I have to hurry to get to my biodynamics class at the farm in am apprenticing at. At the moment that apprenticeship is the best card in my hand.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c5663525865890350313 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 9:48 AM</a><br><br>

Somehow it was enough. <br><br>I decided to take a small step backwards. This is my mini-rebellion against evil cable providers that go out of their way to annoy me. <br><br>I made an TV antenna from coat hangers, cardboard, a length of cable and a small device from an electrical supply shop called a "balun" that costs around five dollars. It took about two hours to cut up the parts and glue and screw them together. <br><br>Predicting how many channels you'll get over the air is pretty hard. It depends on a lot of variables. <br><br>From where we live we get 20 channels (that number includes sub-channels) using this simple contraption. The antenna sits on a bookshelf near the window. It's an ugly as sin conversation piece. But it works. <br><br>I was amazed that over the air broadcast channels also have sub-channels. For example, the PBS station - channel 17 - in Buffalo has sub-channels 17-1 and 17-2 each of which shows different programming. <br><br>And we gave the cable provider the heave-ho. Saved 60 bucks a month. <br><br>We can no longer watch the Kardashians (not that we ever did, no, not us, no way) or watch Adam Richman bust a gut. Boo-hoo. <br><br>I can feel my IQ re-bounding. <br><br>Oh yeah, we only use a telephone land-line and have no internet access from home. We use computers at the public library.

I don't happen to know the answer, but that's the sort of question that needs to be asked."<br><br>JMG: yes it needs to be asked, but there are ways to estimate a rough answer. Without subsidies, a good LED bulb costs about $30 these days. It supposedly will last a long time (several decades in normal use - and I've had CFLs last 20 years!). Over that time the LED bulb, relative to incandscent bulbs, will save about $150 in electricity cost - at today's power prices (subsidized by cheaply-sold fracked gas and allowed externalities). If the prices (after correcting best as we can for distortions) are like that, the embedded energy picture is probably similar.<br><br>And I am still asking the question: why do you claim that 1950 tech was more resource efficient, in general? For example, you wrote:<br><br>"everyone else had to put up with fast, reliable, energy-efficient railroads when they needed to get from place to place"<br><br>- but steam locomotives are horribly energy inefficient, requiring far more fuel than diesel locomotives. And for passengers (rather than freight) heavy rail is still inefficient, even if diesel powered. The lightweight self-propelled passenger rail cars may be more efficient than cars - but only if full. (Electric trams, now THAT's something I'd like to see come back.) For heavy rail to make sense for passengers you'd need to cram as many people into (and onto) the rail cars as they do in India, for example.<br><br>Yes I know, there is embedded energy in the highways. But we're not talking about rail to and from every door.<br><br>"If the technologies of 1920 can be supported on the modest energy supply we can count on getting from renewable sources, for example, something like a 1920 technological suite might be maintained over the long term"<br><br>- As already mentioned in some comments, it's not a complete technological "suite" from the past that will be needed, but rather a selection of old and new. For one thing, in 1920 the industrial countries were running on coal, not renewable energy. And why not use, e.g., solar thermal ideas from the 1970's (plus some PV tech from the 2010's) along with the rail, canals, and trams of 1920?<br><br>As for "mesh radio", yes it would be quite useful without the "data centers". I think you're confusing the current centralized, addictive, bandwidth-hogging time-wasters, such as YouTube and Facebook, with the "internet" as a whole. When the internet was invented, in the 1980's, it was specifically designed to be a method of running a decentralized communications mesh, making it reliable even in the face of random breaks in the mesh. Although invented by the DOD to provide communications in a world hit by nuclear war (necessitating the resilient-mesh structure), it immediately gave rise to freewheeling discussion groups on hundreds of separate topics, that functioned well on a peer-to-peer basis, without any central "data servers". That can work with any sort of mesh communications network, even via ham radio, albeit on a scale commensurate with the bandwidth available.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c7498035245351069980 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 10:11 AM</a><br><br>

I’d like to elaborate on this, but I’m going to start with some background and an anecdote.<br><br>Background: <br>As is the case with other commenters, I’m an early-collapsenik. Three years ago I had a well-paying career in software interaction design, was living in a three-bedroom high-rise apartment in San Francisco, and doing lots of air travel both for work and to plan my new life. I am currently unemployed, living in a one-bedroom remodeled fieldworkers shed on five hilly acres in rural SE Brazil. I’m in the process of planting a permaculture orchard / <i>agrofloresta</i> and expanding my organic garden (already over 300 sq meters, 3000 sf). My dream, if my retirement savings don’t run out or simply evaporate first, is to set up an ecolodge and research center for the near term future of energy decline. Things move slowly here in Brazil, but they are moving.<br><br>Anecdote: <br>Where I live, power outages are common. During the rainy summer season, it may fail a couple of times a week, sometimes for a few minutes, sometimes for a few days. Many of my neighbors here have big generators, some of which kick on automatically – and noisily – even when they are not here. I’ve chosen to treat these as opportunities to practice for using less electricity and using it intermittently. From my first week here in the mountains, if I needed light, I would light candles.<br>So I posted a picture of my desk to Facebook, with the laptop still going (batteries!) but the paperwork illuminated with candles. A friend immediately gave me a present: one of those rechargeable LED arrays that are ubiquitous here in Brazil. At the time, it felt wrong. Candles felt right.<br>But here’s the catch: I almost never light candles now, and do so only for effect. Every time I need light in the evening and the power has failed, I use one of the LED arrays. (I picked up a couple that use rechargeable AA batteries to augment the original one.) They’re not as pretty as candles, but they are radically more convenient.<br><br>My conception of what is coming next is based on the sequence you laid out years ago: <br>Abundance industrialism, Scarcity industrialism, Salvage society, Ecotechnic future. <br>My <i>design target</i> is the Ecotechnic future. That’s what the ecolodge and research center are all about. In less than three years, I’ve planted over 800 fruit and nut trees, almost all of which are still growing well, and many of which have started giving small yields. (The Earth path called for one a year, but I upped the ante to one a day.) I’ve carved a number of swales into the hillside, and built terraced organic garden beds. I haven’t been able to find/afford photovoltaics around here (as you point out, absent the artificial support they’re uneconomical), but all my hot water comes from the sun (1880 technology). On long cloudy weeks, I use a washcloth and cold water (1820 practice). I’m building a wood-fired stove (local design, “fogão mineiro”) for backup cooking and heating hot water (pre-1820 technology and practice, though still <i>very</i> common in the region, particularly among poorer folk). In broad terms, it fits into the descriptions you give in your post.<br><br>(continued below)<br><br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c6085463791790393475 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 10:15 AM</a><br><br>

My target focus is certainly the Ecotechnic future, but my everyday coping strategies have been organized around Scarcity industrialism. <br><br>In my mind, that’s where the LED arrays come in. They are hardly an appropriate Ecotechnic technology, so I would not be interested in building any. (Setting up a candle-making workshop is more of what I have in mind.) They won’t last long enough to be useful during the Salvage society phase. On the positive side, they’re amazingly inexpensive, far cheaper to buy and operate than the equivalent in candles, and very safe to use, without open flames. <br><br>To be sure, I use illumination sparingly in any event. I walk into friends’ homes at night and everything is lit up like daylight. In my home, the dimmers and LED nightlights create a barely-lit environment, where task lighting is used only as needed. The example of LED lamps utilized as spot and emergency lighting, using rechargeable batteries as needed, provide a way to downsize from Abundance to Scarcity, while reserving my attention and focus for things which matter more (like planting trees, building rich soil in the organic garden beds, and building with passive solar – all for the future).<br><br>Moving from the personal to the global, I have a nephew who is working on a super-efficient motor design, using quantum math to rethink the precise angle of the windings and the switching of the electromagnets. Totally new, in some ways the very definition of high-tech. But in other ways, an adaptation to scarcity. The same motor power output requires less copper in the windings and loses less in the conversion from electrical to mechanical energy. This example is even better than that of LEDs, because it remains available during the Salvage society, and perhaps all the way into the Ecotechnic phase. <br><br>So that’s the conception I had built up of what’s coming next in the Scarcity industrialism phase. <br><br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c5719590697357389225 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 10:17 AM</a><br><br>

Ours is suicidal. Not only does it encourage labor arbitrage, but even more importantly allows multinational corporations sidestep the environmental laws, workplace safety standards, and acceptable living conditions of any particular country. <br><br>I think it's safe to say that most people think the main driver of offshoring is lower wages in places like China, Malaysia, Vietnam, etc. But this is only a part of the story, and perhaps not even the major part. At least as important are the almost non-existent environmental protections and abysmal prospects for workers in these countries. Japan was at the top of the list for offshoring until Minamata disease resulting from mercury dumping in rivers and Yokkaichi asthma resulting from sulfur dioxide belching in the atmosphere led Japan to rethink its environmental policies.<br><br>In the nick of time, China opened its doors, dooming Japan's role as the multinational corporations' favorite manufacturing swamp. Within ten years of China's shift in its economic policy (in 1980), Japan's economy was in shambles and pollution levels in China's industrial centers were going off-scale.<br><br>In the meantime, matters in the US were becoming grim. New plants in the US required a lengthy study of environmental impacts, and existing factories had to start cleaning up after themselves. In other words, they could no longer "externalize" the costs of cleaning up the crud they produced as byproducts of their activities.<br><br>At the same time, they were given no protection from competition from overseas factories who had no such economic burdens to bear. Suggestions that such protections were in order were met with shrill denunciations of the "restraint of free trade" sort, which served as a substitute for critical analysis. Evidently, the "free-trade" advocates will not be satisfied until pollution is ubiquitous and labor has been reduced to a level of bare survival.<br><br>I'm certainly not an advocate of over-regulation. But I think prudent oversight is mandatory, and a tariff schedule that offsets the competitive advantage "enjoyed" by corporations who can pollute and exploit with impunity in foreign countries is long overdue.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c4079698609469808701 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 10:23 AM</a><br><br>

I found my own nascent thoughts on the subject stated in a much more thorough and eloquent manner in the book "Nation of Rebels: Why Counterculture became Consumer Culture". I can thank that book for helping me, as a younger man, put to rest those nagging feelings of wanting to be 'cool'. It has a great analysis of coolhunting, putting it in its proper context, which has plenty to do with baboons snarling their teeth and which piglet gets which teat. I find it occasionally interesting to witness the paradox of just how much more rigid the conformity is in hipster or 'alternative' groups. These folks don't seem to catch the irony of implying that they are horribly stifled by the wider culture, all the while they are immersed in ceaseless evaluation for the 'correct' views and opinions, as well as material belongings by their peers. I write it all off to the increasingly narcissistic tendencies of this culture at large. Everyone wants to be special, but don't want to actually have to *do* something special to earn that recognition.

That's no more or less a statement of faith as saying that we can only enjoy information technology and space travel on our current reckless energy diet. It's a matter of politics. If peaceful discussion carried any political weight folks could (and likely would) arrive at tech c. 1950, 1920 or 1777 as we like – scaling back until we find the limits of practice and resources that allows everyone to contribute and live well. <br>All scientific and technological research can continue as long as it’s confined in scale. (Neal Stephenson’s Anathem presents a plausible culture where more tech can be acquired for less juice when there’s a tight gate between the lab and the market.) Channeling research toward cultures that privilege efficiency, compassion and balance over power and consumption is one way to confine technology’s scale. <br>I’m a city guy, so I too will have to make do in clusters of like-mindedness that make up for a lack of self-sufficiency with cooperative effort. Nothing suggests that EROEI values aren’t susceptible to technological and political pressure, and won’t be operating at different local levels due to differing political conditions. Maybe the global general strike of 2xxx will herald an era of loosely aligned Anarcho-Syndicalist city states – all with good relations to their pastoral surrounds, cooperatively making best use of resources. More likely, the cities that persist will operate at vastly different tolerances for injustice and efficiency, and different ways for directing energy will be localized. <br>So, assuming mobility, planning ahead means voting with our feet in advance. I’m considering our current digs: the American SW. Magic 8-ball likes a future of retro-grade fascism struggling to hold onto scarce food and water against multiple rural warlords.

Thus my use of the terms Utility and Cost were not the same as yours were.<br><br>I think this chart, and the technology function curves one could construct on it, are a useful model for thinking about this week's post. I'm certain this way of thinking is not for everyone, but it helped me and so it might be helpful to others.<br><br>Let me give the example of technologies for transportation for trade. Trade by boat, rail, truck, and airplane would plot out on a concave curve. Each of these technologies is a point on the chart that forms a curve with its slope decreases to the right. The curve is concave because each marginal increment in utility generally costs marginally much more. Each technology currently in popular use for a given function (e.g. transportation, communication, agriculture etc.) must fit on its function curve more or less; otherwise a less expensive or more useful technology would eliminate it from common use. One could plot wind powered ships on the chart but it wouldn't fit on the current trade transportation curve. Such (currently) obsolete technologies would always plot to the right of the curve i.e. too expensive for a given utility.<br><br>Excessive costs due to resource depletion will drive us to rely on more basic technologies for any given function. Thus each such curve is pulled to the right until the top end technology hits a wall i.e. the point where it is too expensive to maintain. As the curve is pulled to the right, some old technologies like sail might find themselves on the curve again. <br><br>Generally we will be moving from high cost tech to low cost tech. Granted some (formerly) intermediate cost technologies currently in use may fall off the curve before a currently higher cost tech on the same curve, as the cost increases may not be proportional across the curve. Nonetheless, generally we can expect the high cost tech to drop off first because they are already the most expensive. <br><br>The point of collapsing now is to make an easier transition down these curves to ensure there is no discontinuity in the fulfillment of the basic function each represents. We are looking for the system to degrade gracefully not fail catastrophically. However progressive loss of Utility is certain as the top end technologies are removed from common use one by one. Basically you get what you pay for, and you can increasing only pay for less.<br><br>Changing technology subsidy policy will certainly affect the process I just described because it changes the costs of the affected technology. What is most certain is that as governments find their tax base diminishing, they will just stop providing certain services. These services include providing subsidies to current technologies, principally their infrastructure. I agree that loss of the affected technologies will not intentionally happen as a matter of conscious choice right now. Governments will simply find that they can no longer subsidize the technology in question and so they won't.<br><br>Nonetheless, in theory, just as individuals can make the conscious decision to collapse now and beat the rush, so can governments. Perhaps once it becomes unavoidably clear collapse is underway and will not be reversed, conscious collapse may be politically possible. However, the first step down, sadly, is not going to be by conscious choice for societies as a whole and so this step is certain to be catastrophic (but not completely apocalyptic) for many people.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c2925902797222282085 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 12:33 PM</a><br><br>

I guess those will go down the drain. Seems a pity since they are of good use, I would have no wife or children if it were not for antibiotics.<br><br>Knowledge, or lack of. Will we have time to learn, or use for, the level of knowledge about natural sciences that we have now or had during e.g. the 1950's? I'm afraid of superstition and its impact on society.<br><br>The journey to get there is the part I really dread... I hope it will not be too horrendous. Brought up in the 60's and 70's in europe I still wince when I hear the "emergency" signal being tested - a wailing siren warning us of disaster. Memories of the cold war and the bomb still freaks me out. Not to mention what crashing economies will do to the people of the world.<br><br>I wonder what we will become? How will we fare psychologically from the collapse? A big difference compared to the post WW II times is that while they were marching in to a bright future with lots of energy, for us there will be no relief.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c5392877033708608230 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 12:39 PM</a><br><br>

The next century will no doubt see technological collapse happening at different rates in different sectors of our life.<br><br>Some things may still retain a more modern tech level, while others devolve quite radically.<br><br>We may well have a scavenged solar panel on the roof and battery backup to keep a small freezer going to preserve food and at the same time light the house in the evening with candles made with a solar cooker not bulbs.<br><br>We could have old tube radios back, and nightly news on the hour, and no broadcast during the day. Mail and print magazines, and the ADR via bi-monthly newsletter, and still some sort of community Saturday night with DVDs played on a projection TV on the side of someone's house.<br><br>And popcorn over the local bonfire lol, 25 cents a bag.

Regional areas with some access to rail lines, for resources and hydro power to sustain their manufacturing should do well.<br><br>I suspect that first adopters, those who collapse now to avoid the rush will try to use the best of past tech, and not the bad sides.<br><br>For me, when we see the reintroduction of pay phones into communities then I'll know that retro tech collapse is here, lol.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c6189446035721320301 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 12:54 PM</a><br><br>

I had worked with her and knew her pretty well, so in a quiet moment, asked why she was REALLY retiring. Because so little of her time was spent on books and programs for the kids. Most of her time was spent training people on the computers, retraining (due to the fact that computer literacy is a constantly shifting moving target ... you can't acquire the skills and let it go at that), dealing with computer glitches, printer glitches, etc. etc.. Due to print abuse, the library now has a "simple" 7 step process to get a page printed off the Internet.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c6753669859728639976 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 12:58 PM</a><br><br>

It existed in far different circumstances in terms of natural resources, population etc. etc. Details like the others major industrial states being on their knees, when not outright piles of rubble for example.<br><br>We might see is slices of 1950, dressed in rags. Widespread rail passenger service might indeed make a comeback as air becomes untenable for the unwashed masses, but likely on existing cheapo freight track.

For this sort of stuff I would expect existing items and legacy production lines being repaired and run as long as possible. By the time vacuum tube radio is the most viable option it would likely be a limited production item for the wealthy/military/specialists. <br><br>Automation offers a range of benefits beyond cutting labor costs and in the event a well paid workforce is a very substantial financial incentive towards automating. <br>I would expect it being abandoned due to a combination of dirt cheap labor, low economies of scale, breakdown of the related supply chains and/or similar factors.<br><br>Top-down mandatory technology downgrade seem unappealing for military reasons as well.

Thus waiting for them to go away is a good argument for doing nothing, and that seems like a waste of time to me. <br><br>RepubAnon, er, did you miss the part of my post discussing the massive crisis that's approaching? In case you did, why, yes, that's included. We're talking now about what comes afterwards. <br><br>Dwig, all good points. There are many ways to regress to a 1950-style technology -- a point we'll discuss further down the road. <br><br>Stewart, when you say "solutions will always be found," you do realize that you're uttering a faith-based mantra, don't you? <i><b>No law of nature mandates the existence of solutions to our problems</b></i>. I know that's a blasphemous concept to true believers in the Great God Progress, but you'll just have to deal with that, you know. <br><br>Avery, many thanks.

You'll find that discussed in detail in most good histories of solar energy -- and yes, it's worth remembering. <br><br>AR80, now go back over my post and find a single place where I said or implied that there's anything idyllic about the 1950s. No, what's happened is that you've bought into the standard mythological rhetoric of the religion of progress -- which insists that any resistance to whatever's defined as progress must be based on nostalgic longing for an imaginary past -- and slapped it onto the pragmatic strategy I'm presenting. <br><br>Jo, it's absolutely okay to reject consumerism and technology for any reason that makes sense to you, all the way down to sheer bloodymindedness. You are under no obligation to buy into the cult of progress, or to cooperate with other people's insistence on doing so.

This is for a calculation for a wireless cell-base station. Figure 3 on page 6 could serve as a conservative estimation of general consumer grade electronics as well:<br>http://mmlab.snu.ac.kr/publications/docs/Min-0-JNLb-2-8-IEEE-Networks2011.pdf<br>They get 75 GJ (44% in semiconductor part) baked into hardware. So approximately 21 MWh = 21000 kWh = energy to make 26000 loaves of bread in Chris' oven. They expect the thing to be up for 10 years (12% maintenance). In another measure that energy could bake 7 breads a day for you for the next 10 years. If one assumes a 10% fossil-&gt;food calorie efficiency a bread comes in at just under 19 kWh + 1 for the baking, equals a bit more than 1000 breads in total. If you chose to forgo cell service you could share these 1000 breads over 10 years with the other people in your neighborhood (approx 1 mile = 1.6 km radius in a city, according to link). <br>That does not sound too bad if you assume 1000 people covered by the base station. It means every 10 years it is your turn to buy the telephone guy a bread. Or you supply your 20 kWh with 200 x 1h installments of 0.1 kWh each on the bike-generator. Sounds less attractive? <br>Oh, and they assume approximately twice the energy for actually running the base station. So it is 6 days out of 10 on the bike for indefinite service. Regarding paying for the phone I can only suggest you don't change it every 2 years... or again, sharing it with 1000 people.<br><br>@Myriad re maintenance and momentary expediency:<br>Spot on from my perspective. Resource efficiency and expectations are crucial. If we double or tripe maintenance (12%) on a device that is designed for long life - I would expect the optimum to shift way, way past 10 years. One would have to get started with doing it though, you can only model these things in a limited way. <br><br>@Oilman2 re mesh nets<br>I am afraid you'll run into (and past) an optimum on small mesh nets. The smaller the cells the more units you need to cover an area. Larger cells need mostly broadcasting power but relatively few additional integrated circuits. Doesn't make them impossible, and yeah, BBS was nowhere near its potential when youtube rolled along.<br><br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c8120954210929182315 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 2:34 PM</a><br><br>

I think in terms of mass and energy flow of stuff that gets bought &amp; discarded there is very little in the 50s US home compared to now.

However I think in terms of global impact of the West the ship has pretty much sailed. Actual value generation has largely moved to Asian countries. Population wise we won't make a dent.

I just graduated from high school and started college in 1950. A few people had small gardens but not many. The stores were full of food and other necessities but nothing like a typical Walmart full of 'wants'. <br><br>Life was different but much the same as now. I had my grandson over today to work in the wood shop (he is building a guitar and learning to use a fret saw) and he is concerned with studies, grades, friends and girls like I was. He is on his phone a lot more than I ever was but he also uses it like and encyclopedia which I used a lot and not near so convenient as his (and my) phone.<br><br>Metallurgy was not so great then and an automobile engine would not last very many miles like today but we knew how to overhaul an engine with new bearings, rings and reground valves. I did it a few times. <br><br>The population then in the US was about 150 million and now it is over 300 million. What to do with more than half the people? I don't know but twice the people require twice the resources and we had enough to get along fine with '50s technology but we didn't have a lot of surplus. <br><br>We hunted a lot and a mess of rabbits did for our family and neighbors that did not hunt. My dad used to say that our relatives put their food money in the gas tank and came to our house.<br><br>The 'pill' was a major change in the social environment. Good or bad, I do not know but it certainly changed dating, sex and marriage though even now a few young girls get pregnant out of wedlock. I am not a bastard as many think because about age 14 I figured out my parents were married three months before I was born.<br><br>I am long time reader, peak oil nut from the '70s, kind of a Prepper, my solar golf cart can power our place for a while. I enjoy the sun oven. At our age we look at things a lot different than you as what happens 30 years from now is not much of a worry. I do spend quite a bit of time teaching woodworking with hand tools. Not the large heavy projects I used to tackle but mostly furniture. I told my daughter I probably have one more set of cabinets in me to go with their kitchen remodel and that's what I am building now.<br><br>73's<br><br>Oh yes, I mess with radios too.

That belief acts like a monster under adult's beds. Best to drag this monster out into the cold light of day so we can confront it, as you've done. It won't go away on its own and until we chop it down to size, we'll make things harder than they already are for ourselves and others. <br><br>I'm not old enough to remember 1950 and its technology but I am old enough to (barely) remember 1960 and its technology. There were some differences but not all that many, according to what I've been told by those older than me. Plenty of people in 1960 still lived with 1950 technology for the most part, and I knew some of them. <br><br>Since my husband and I began our collapse in the 1990s, our house looks a lot like a 1950 house, upgraded by things such as increased insulation plus a few later technologies we consider expendable. The 13 year old computer I'm typing on, for instance, is expendable: nice while we have it but not needed (we have a manual typewriter and we still write letters by hand). We didn't have internet access till 2001 and I won't mind when it goes away. I'll made limited and carefully considered use of it while it's here and be ready to say bye-bye with no regrets when it leaves. We have adopted the same attitude toward the other post 1950 technologies we retain for the time being. <br><br>It strikes me as odd that some readers seem to think that we have to go back to 1950 technology at 1950 efficiency. The two are not locked together. The wood stove we bought a few months back is a metal box which has US EPA registration for low particulate emission. It does this through good engineering and a mechanical timer that slowly closes the back draft after a new piece of wood is added. Not a bit of electrification or computerization in/on it (there are wood stoves out there that come with *remote controls* of all things), and it burns pieces of wood, not pellets. It's simple to use and works very well. When we can no longer afford natural gas heating, we can warm part of the house and cook, using small amounts of properly dried wood so as to make the minimum pollution possible. We have a human-powered wood splitter as well as the hand tools needed to process wood. We're burning wood from a tree we had removed two years ago, prunings from our trees, and scavenged wood. My husband enjoys processing the wood and we both like the sight and sound of the fire and the warmth of the stove. It does require us taking personal responsibility for heating instead of relying entirely on other things and people for that function. That takes some getting used to; it's another monster under the bed, one I had to wrestle with. I'm winning so far, and I expect to face this monster in different guises as we continue to decline, so I might as well get used to the process.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c960593427582810782 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 3:59 PM</a><br><br>

However, I do have some concerns which derive from what I think is relevant experience: I design products for a company that has been designing and manufacturing electrical instrumentation for some 110 years, and I have been there for 26. For a short time after I started I participated in manufacturing with some of the older technology products, so I learned a bit of what was required. We have old linen drawings from the early 20th century, and a few old notebooks and texts, etc. <br><br>However I don't really have the skills to design the types of equipment that was being made there in the 1950's, although perhaps I could learn. The thing that concerns me most is that 1950's technology was built on 1940's technology, and so on back to the beginning of industrial manufacturing. The specialty materials and components they used, and all the supporting industry, tools, knowledge and practices grew along with it, and all of that is gone now. <br><br>So my question to you is: From your excellent historical view, has something similar to this ever been achieved before? Can technology unwind gradually and gracefully backwards, or must it crash to a base level to be reinvented painfully from the bottom, with perhaps a few preserved clues to point the way? Good parallels might be difficult to find, ours being the first and last industrial society to collapse, and our technologies being more complex and specialized.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c5623002773170175574 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 4:04 PM</a><br><br>

I'm familiar with the reenactor scene -- there are Civil War and French &amp; Indian War reenactors all over the place where I live -- but not with people who simply adopt the lifestyle of an earlier time. Can you point me to more information about them? That would be extremely helpful for this sequence of posts. <br><br>Raven, why, yes. Watch how the incantations develop...<br><br>Ares, of course nobody's talking about it...yet. The plan is to change that. <br><br>Raven, good question, since absurdity fits equally well with the past and the future.<br><br>Les, that's one of the downsides I mentioned. The corresponding upside is that 1950 technology can be maintained, where most of today's can only be discarded. <br><br>Sophia, I do indeed -- "streetcar," one word, is the US term for what you'd call a tram. I'm delighted to hear that they're coming back in Oz; it's a source of some amusement, though, as when Seattle got its waterfront streetcar line a few decades ago, they bought used cars from Sydney, I think it was. <br><br>Sylvia, true. Now factor in the fact that all those things still have to be provided today, and paid for, and that you normally get a better product or service for less money by doing it yourself. As a more than occasional househusband myself, I've been pleased to notice how much improvement in quality of life can be provided that way. <br><br>Marc, I don't know, I think I'd take a simpler form of medical care in exchange for doctors who actually made house calls again, and could treat a simple illness without driving the patient into bankruptcy. <br><br>Matt, good heavens, I couldn't have made up anything so absurd if I'd brooded on it for a week.

The question at this point is how to handle the inevitable contraction. <br><br>Patricia, societies get into a punitive paradigm when their basic ground rules stop working, but nobody can admit that. That's when violence becomes the preferred option, in an attempt to force things to conform to a failed belief system. Once the failure on the belief system becomes impossible to ignore -- the collapse of the Soviet Union being a good example -- the paradigm shifts. <br><br>DaShui, pick up a 30.'06 and you can handle quite a bit more regression!<br><br>Permiechris, no argument there. The preservation and revival of what remains of regional and local cultures is another important theme, one we'll be discussing a little later. <br><br>Johannes, good. As I noted in my post, 1950 technology took different social, economic, and cultural forms in different parts of the world, and it's by no means likely that the American applications of the 1950 technosystem will be the only ones applicable in a future of deliberate regression. <br><br>Yupped, agreed; one of the great frustrations of the historian is not being able to hang around long enough to see a historical process all the way through. <br><br>Strovenovus, glad to hear it. <br><br>Brian, window screens go back at least to 1950 -- the houses I grew up in had them, and they weren't brand new by any means. Yes, they would be worth keeping. <br><br>Oilman, yes, but it's those uses that by and large pay for the internet. A technology has to be economically viable to be viable, and it's quite likely that without pornography, spam, and the like, the internet would never have gotten much beyond the Usenet era, and started losing even that much functionality once budget cuts began. On the other hand, if a BBS system is all you want, that might work, at least for a while. <br><br>Charlie, computers haven't noticeably decreased the consumption of paper, last I heard. Nice try. <br><br>David, the value of a specific era is that it gives a clear, easily understood target to shoot for. Of course there's plenty of wiggle room -- as noted in the post, 1950 technology meant something very different in Djakarta than it did in New York City -- but the conceptual frame of "1950 with some adjustments" is different in a useful way from the way most people conceive of the future just now. <br><br>Myriad, no, not a Butlerian jihad; that also had a single general principle, of the sort you're suggesting: "Thou shalt not make a machine in the image of a human mind."

That 1950 Schwinn was a good sturdy vehicle perfectly suited to everyday use, which is after all considerably more important than letting a handful of jocks set new records.<br><br>DiverCity, thank you. The world has got to be big enough to allow for a wide range -- a diversity, in fact -- of ideological perspectives. <br><br>Eric, I think it's quite possible that Europe is going to melt down completely into neofascism, mass persecution of Muslim minorities, and a spiral of religious warfare between Christian and Muslim zealots which will have no winners.

Not, btw, a single transistor or something -- a computer, however simple, from raw materials or readily available scrap. <br><br>Curt, delighted to hear it. <br><br>David, there you are. So you would have to cut your energy consumption sharply to get down to what was average in 1950; yes, that's a valid target!<br><br>Ray, no question, it's a rough road. Thing is, one way or another, we're all on it, and you're just a bit further down than some. <br><br>Roger, while I'm no fan of TV, if you're going to watch, that's the way to go about it. <br><br>Moshe, I gave you the answer in the post: sharply lower energy and resource consumption per capita. Could similar decreases be obtained in other ways? Heck of a good question -- while we know for a fact that the 1950 technostructure worked under those conditions, and provided a relatively high standard of living. <br><br>BoysMom, no, but I'm not surprised.

When I was a pre-teen in the 1940s we lived in a house that was probably built around 1890 or 1900. The back of the garage had a strong shelf on which there were, depending on the season, either storm windows or window screens for every window in the house. Each consisted of a wooden frame the size of the whole window, with either glass or screening. They were big and awkward, and the storm windows were also heavy. Twice a year my father went up on a ladder to change them all. Mounted on the window frame above each window was a pair of broad metal hooks, which matched broad metal eyes on the frame, and acted like hinges. He went up the ladder, unhooked the one that was there, carried it back down, then carried the other one up the ladder and set it on the top hooks, and came back down a second time. If it was a window screen, there also was a hook toward the bottom on each side of the screen, and a corresponding eye in the window frame, that held the bottom of the screen snugly in place. If it was a storm window, there two or three hooks of varying lengths on the window, so you could either hold the bottom of the storm window snugly in place, or let it stand ajar to some degree if you wanted to change the air. These bottom hooks were worked from the inside, so that you could adjust the storm window without going outdoors in the cold weather. I think it was my job to fasten the hooks from the inside once my father had put the screen or storm window in place from the outside.<br><br>Each window had an upper and a lower sash, and in the summer you opened both of them to bring cooler, fresher air in at the bottom and let warmer, more stale air out at the top. In the winter, usually both were tightly closed.<br><br>These window screens and storm windows seemed to be a little younger than the house itself, for each window was also equipped with louvred shutters that could be tightly closed and fastened from the inside. The louvres were adjustable, so you could let a little fresh air in even when the weather was stormy. The shutters only worked if neither the storm window nor the window screen was in place, so they were probably the original equipment of the house, and the window screens and storm windows a later addition.<br><br>It's forgotten technology these days, but I am here to say that it worked rather well. Our house was snug even in a great gale that brought a tall tree down across our roof and broke the ridge-pole in two, up in the attic. It took a while to replace that!<br><br>Oh, and the house had a coal furnace, but also a working (not just ornamental) fireplace on the ground floor.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c3128979686509814309 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 5:38 PM</a><br><br>

Your ISP charges you barely for the cost of the "last mile" connection. Of course they have to make a profit, so they make bombastic claims about "infinite" plans, and then do they level best to give you as little bandwidth as possible without you to notice (much).<br><br>One of the neater tricks is to use proxies. If you and your neighbors are all downloading the same content, the ISP keeps a copy around from the first trip to the original source, and just gives the copy to whomever request it in the next X minutes. This does not work well for research of truly valuable knowledge... or for the highly personalized gossip of social media, but it does wonders if you are downloading lots of mainstream multimedia (mostly entertainment).<br><br>At the far side of the wire, there is a content provider. The majority of those are, again, distributors of entertainment multimedia. Some of those are subscription based (ahem... porn) but many are in the business of pushing targeted adds to people. This is so lucrative business that many big players give you a free account to publish whatever you want, build a following, and then offer the opportunity to sell your readership down the river for a couple of cents per click. It is a blessing that our host has actual books of his authorship to advertise instead of the random grovel of adsense.<br><br>All this content providers have real costs, sometimes very high. They are in business ultimately as long as they can sell the adds, and the businesses that buy such adds can only do so as long as they keep getting actual customers that way. Not likely to play out right in the near future.<br><br>Finally, we get to the connection infrastructure, the backbone. Which paradoxically may end up broken by the proverbial shaft. You pay maybe a little bit for it, in the form of taxes... but you have no control of how much. As it exist today, it is mostly a government kickback to the entertainment and advertising industries. You don't directly pay what it costs to get your contents delivered, but as long as that contents makes someone connected a bit of money, you keep getting your daily fix.<br><br>Now, think about it. It is not that someone is going to hunt down anyone publishing valuable information in the Internet. It is rather that those that do rarely have a direct business model to make money out of that transactions, so they will be one by one priced out of the market by the shovelers of plain entertainment. Those will remain for some more years while the infrastructure is still maintainable, and there is money to be made in the maintenance.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c3819977589639758882 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 6:14 PM</a><br><br>

(Incidentally, I'm a vegetarian today, except for some fish -- but I've been a little surprised to realize I actually know more about where meat comes from than many meat-eaters I know).<br>I was not-quite-6 when my parents moved our family, including my little brothers, to a 5 acre farm. They proceeded to buy calves (I don't know how it's done now, but then you got them from dairies -- 1970s), weaner pigs, chickens, etc., and raise them for meat (and eggs). They were clear about it, calmly explaining that we were going to butcher the male calf when he grew up, and keep the heifer to milk, and butcher the pigs, etc. Possibly to drive the point home, they gave them names like "T-bone," and "Pork chop." Today I'm rather more squeamish, but at the time, they were so matter of fact about it all that we just accepted it. I even recall having conversations with my mom about this, at the time. <br> They gave me the job of doing much of the bottle feeding. I stayed in my room during the actual butchering, which did not prevent me from learning how it was done -- with the chickens, at any rate; professionals handled most of the other livestock -- but my first biology lessons came while watching my mom clean the chickens after they were plucked. "See, Honey, this is the gizzard, and this is the liver..." It was interesting.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c6930106642859839127 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 6:51 PM</a><br><br>

We'll likely find out just how crucial in the months ahead. As for your policies, you had me until the last one. How about, instead, ample funding for public libraries on the condition that they do what they were founded to do, and maintain a large, diverse book collection for circulation in the community? <br><br>Rd-M, er, "Dzhease"? Isn't that a bit baroque? <br><br>John, ah, but then you throw away one of the core advantages of adopting an older technosystem: we know what works, and how it worked, so can deploy it without the inevitable delays and failures that come from integrating untried combinations and systems into a whole. I also think it's high time that we take a look at regression, and give it serious thought, instead of dancing past it as fast as possible on the way to some shiny new model of progress. <br><br>Latefall, fascinating. Thanks for the link -- I'll check it out as time permits. <br><br>Tom, I won't argue!<br><br>Lynford, glad to hear that you're teaching. That kind of experience is worth preserving. <br><br>Arnold, sure, but what makes the internet useful for most of the people who pay for it, directly or indirectly, are the services those huge server farms provide. Once those go down, how many people are going to agree with you about the importance of the basic internet, to the extent of willing to see scarce resources go to that rather than to the many other critical needs of a difficult age? <br><br>Doctor W., I'm scratching my head here. Why is it that every time I go zooming off into what ought to be the sort of unthinkable heresy that ought to send five or ten thousand readers storming away in a huff, since I've just challenged the foundations of their worldview, what I get instead is a mixture of (mostly) intelligent commentary and people saying "Thank you, that's just what I needed to hear"? It's a real puzzle. ;-)<br><br>Peter, that's about par for the course. Our culture is utterly uncritical when it comes to its blushing schoolgirl crush on technology. Once, just once, I'd like to see an exhibit on technology with a banner saying, SOLVES MORE PROBLEMS THAN IT CAUSES, WE THINK. <br><br>Martin, no argument -- and I never owned a muscle car!<br><br>SLClaire, yes, and that's another point I propose to bring up as we proceed. Even in 1950, there were many ways to do 1950 technology, some considerably more efficient than others. More on this down the road a bit!<br><br>Twilight, individual technologies have regressed many times, and so have specific technological suites -- consider the way that manufacturing technology in China grows more complex in periods of economic growth and centralization, and simplifies again when the dynasty passes its peak and declines. You're right that some high-end 1950s tech might not be replicable, at least at first, but a lot can be -- for heaven's sake, I've been able to design and build regenerative receivers with modest electronics knowledge, and those were outdated well before 1950.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c2067644745324608298 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 10:34 PM</a><br><br>

What I'm saying is that once you unload all the things that attract most users to the internet, you then have to find a way to convince everyone else that the costs of maintaining the core of the system are worth covering, at a time when many other things will be begging for scarce resources. As for postal services, those are viable in a wholly nonindustrial society -- they existed before the Industrial Revolution, you know -- and so are arguably much more likely to survive than any form of the internet. <br><br>Betsy, no, I didn't get a double post.

This series is clearly going to be very worth reading!<br><br>With so many comments already, I would like comment mostly on the comments if I may. ;-)<br><br>First, I STRONGLY agree with JMG about the utility of " x time-in-the-past technology plus adjustments" framework for discussion. I use this often with good results. Talk of energy and whole systems thinking and general engineering principles gets glassy-eyed response very quick. People actually have some interest or understanding of past tech suites. So it is a good beginning.<br><br>Second, while as an early Net geek, I agree more with those positing that a much lower resource using Net has more staying power than JMG argues, I would like to assure all that nothing like "the internet" is required to get us most of what we use the Net FOR. In response to the above mentioned "solar steam Victorian future" post, I set out to design a way to have our dear ADR using Morse Code telegraphy a la the 1890s, and I believe it would work well. If I ever get time, I will write it up in detail for Green Wizards. Suffice to say here that if JMG strolled down to his local neighborhood radio telegraph office on a Wednesday evening, and had the coders send off this week's tlog (telegraph log, 'natch) post, we could all pick it up at our local radio telegraph office Thursday morning. During Thursday we all comment and have those sent off back to JMG (no comments after 4:00 PM East Coast time, please). JMG then composes his replies - perhaps while enjoying a light meal at a nearby solar steam cafe? - and has them sent off Thursday evening for our consumption Friday morning. The process then repeats daily, until the discussion peters out towards Monday, as it usually does now. <br><br>As slick as Net based blogging "powered by Google"? No. But would it get us what we use the ADR FOR? Yes, in spades. With 1890's tech. <br><br>Most of the useful stuff done with the Net can be done this way, from Green Wizard style fora to Wikipedia to Twitter-based news reporting and "online magazines".<br><br>Now, I am not specifically suggesting any such thing. What is important is that we adopt the principle of asking FIRST what job needs to be done THEN what technology is best to do it accounting for all factors. This I think is a good way to postulate what "adjustments" are needed in an "x time-in-the-past plus adjustments" scenario.<br><br>Thank you and looking forward to the rest of this series.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c6995131878792752135 title="comment permalink">1/29/15, 11:33 PM</a><br><br>

Interestingly, if you look at current young male fashion trends with the "Brooklyn Beard" and "Lumberjack Chic" we are already headed there fast. Kind of amusing for us 50-somethings who have been wearing the beard and the highly practical and durable denim-and-flannel wardrobe our entire lives to suddenly be the height of trendy fashion... Anyway, in my mind one of the biggest changes to "go forward" to the 70s would of course be the drastic reduction of media. The internet is not going away that soon, but the constant connection to it through expensive hand-held devices and service plans could easily be a casualty of a forced wave of personal austerity. Same for 500-channel digital TV and gigabit media streaming. If this happened within the next decade or two, there would still be many of us around who remember what we used to do before we spent all our time connected to media (like blogs...). Because a first step to ANY of this is to get people back in the world where we gathered together face-to-face, shared, learned, argued, and reconciled FACE-TO-FACE, with real consequences and rewards for our actions, and without antisocial anonymity.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c1928745809203248328 title="comment permalink">1/30/15, 7:27 AM</a><br><br>

One comment is on the spirituality of progress and the other is on the practicality of progress. <br>My comments about spirituality are immediately below. I’ll put the practicality comments in a separate post.<br><br>It seems to me that going back to the past (technologies of the fifties) could be a very useful and rewarding experience not only practically, but also spiritually. What make a person happy and fulfilled is not having the latest curved flat screen TV, or a seven bathroom house, or two Ferraris in the garage, but rather, being happy and fulfilled is about finding meaning and purpose in one’s life.<br><br>Knowing that your life has meaning and purpose fulfills a deep inner sense of self worth, that to my mind, fulfills a spiritual purpose (Why are we here?) of human existence. What gives purpose and meaning to life is not to be gained by a materialist perspective... It is the spiritual aspect of human life that provides meaning and purpose.<br><br>As for happiness, in his book A Revolution of the Middle...and the Pursuit of Happiness, John Ikerd writes, “ [O]ur happiness depends on our having a clear sense of purpose and meaning in life. Without purpose, there is no right or wrong, good or bad; no amount of wealth can give meaning to our thoughts and actions. We are multidimensional beings – physical, social, and spiritual; happiness requires a life of harmony and balance within the whole of our being.”<br><br>And so, going back to the fifties, where life was more about relationships, knowing and helping neighbors, living in neighborhoods, and generally more people and purpose oriented, will not only be more secure in our relations with the ecological world, but also be potentially a more happy and fulfilling type of lifestyle.<br><br>Greg<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c143757499339934805 title="comment permalink">1/30/15, 8:21 AM</a><br><br>

I find Myriad's vision of canal barges carrying barrels of LEDs far more compelling-- not for that exact technological mix, but because I think it's far wiser to pick-and-choose from history's junk-pile than unthinkingly adopt anything. <br><br>A couple examples of regression in action:<br><br>An Ontario, Canada automaker did try in the 2000s; "Feel Good Cars" set themselves up to produce 'restored' 1950s Renault Dauphine electric cars, sold in North America as the Henny Kilowatt.(Naturally, there weren't enough electrics to go around; they were importing the bodies of petrol-powered Dauphines from France for the conversion/restoration.) The use of vintage car bodies was supposed to allow the company to escape onerous and expensive safety tests and other sorts of red tape. There was, at one point, a waiting list for the cars, but I don't actually know how many were ever sold. The company changed its name and became a subsidy dumpster, near as I can tell. (They have part-ownership of a battery technology under development, EEStor)<br><br>It's a better game on the Aviation front: <br><br>The iconic de Havilland Otter and Beaver float-planes are already back in production by Viking Air of Victoria, BC (though with modern turbofan engines). The company got their start rebuilding old airframes, but demand exceeded supply, so they decided to build more.<br><br>The even more iconic DC-3 is back on the market as the BT-67, but the company, Basler is still rebuilding old airframes at this point. They estimate there are around 500 such available.<br><br>I also cannot avoid mentioning the Coalition for Sustainable Rail in the US, which ADR readers may be familiar with. Combining known low-tech advances in steam technology, they aim to produce a wood-pellet-powered passenger locomotive that can out-compete diesel electrics. Like all of the companies I've listed, they're starting with a conversion of old rolling stock, the ASTF 3643. <br><br>It's actually quite exciting out there on the trailing edge!<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c6212713572582358902 title="comment permalink">1/30/15, 8:31 AM</a><br><br>

Seriously, though, smoking for the last 100 years or so has been a battle between Big Tobacco, which had the upper hand for the first decades, and Big Healthcare and its associated biophobia, which reigns supreme today. 100 years from today, when neither of these industrial behemoths will wield much power, what will be the social role of the demon weed? What will be the social acceptability of smoking in the future, when neither the pressures of tobacco advertising nor the biophobia pushed by Big Healthcare come to bear? When premature death is no longer an issue, when people have more important problems to consider? I tend to think that smoking has resilience as a social phenomenon, as a social glue.

Beside me was a young woman absorbed in her I-device. And a grubby young guy came by looking for change. He didn't look quite disabled but sounded mentally slow. I coughed up a loonie, the chap thanked me and went on his way. <br><br>It made me think back 50 years. My dad worked for a local company in my hometown. And they employed a young guy much like the one I just mentioned ie developmentally slow. He worked on a machine that produced a lot of steam and heat. A repetitive, strenuous job. Not pleasant. I used to see him around town. He had money in his pocket, a place to live and some measure of self respect. Not like the young guy that had just come by.<br><br>I shook my head and looked at the young woman beside me. I said to her just look at that poor guy, fifty years ago the young fellow would have been able to find work. But now? Not even with university. And she said yeah, nowadays university is the minimum. And she went back to her gadget.<br><br>I suppose she thought it was just the ruminations of an old man. I guess it was. But, to me, this so-called "new normal", is nothing normal. <br><br>As for young folk, this is all they know, they haven't seen a time when locally owned businesses employed people, if not in the lap of luxury, at least with a semblance of a living wage. <br><br>And so to the point: you mention predators that ruthlessly gut economies in search of the lowest wage. We see the results everyday. Like that young guy. <br><br>But the statistical agencies claim that there's - cough - "growth". See, they have the numbers. Well, no, there ain't "growth". It's a bloody lie. The mess of an economy that we DO have is fake, based on artificially easy credit. As we've seen multiple times recently, this leads straight over the cliff. <br><br>You mention tariffs. That is a swear word to the elites. They cover their ears. They fooled people with all this big talk about free trade and free markets. <br><br>The politicians talk big about building infrastructure and lowering corporate tax rates to bring back industry. This is just a smoke screen. Do you know why? You can build infrastructure up the wazoo and you can lower corporate tax rates to zero. Won't matter. The CEO folk don't care. No, they look at wage rates. The politicos know this. <br><br>But you can't fool all of the people all of the time. The big talkers can talk big, the statisticians can lie like hell. None of that pays the bills. <br><br>If the elites were smart, which they're not, but if they were smart, they would take steps to un-do some of the damage they've done if for no other reason than for their own benefit. <br><br>I'm not holding my breath.

As he's constantly reminding us, you can't go by the theoretical/utopian effects of a technology, but the actual, real world effects of a technology. The question, therefore, that needs to be asked, is, "has widespread internet access made us a more informed, literate, connected society?" I would dare to argue on all of those points, the answer is a definitive "no". On any measure of literacy, logic and intelligence, I'd say that any measure of today's American society measures far below it's 1970s or 1980s counterparts. As far as social connectivity goes, the internet fails that test, as well. We're a way more atomized, isolated society now than before the internet was widespread. So, if you're looking at the actual, not theoretical, effects of the internet, it's effects are to normalize porn, decrease social connectivity, and to decrease attention span and literacy rates--that is its actual, real world effects. The book, newspaper, and magazine filled libraries of yesteryear did a way better job of educating the populace than the internet ever will, precisely because of what others have already mentioned--the bread and butter of the internet are the ads and the porn that keep it going. Therefore, like any business, the internet exists not to inform people, but to get them to buy stuff, either directly or indirectly.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c4479240740497750587 title="comment permalink">1/30/15, 10:01 AM</a><br><br>

"Intentional technological regression" is an idea so incendiary to our civil religion that merely writing it is an impressive feat of intellectual innovation. After the initial shock of that ideological broadside had faded, I realized the same thing had occurred to me after I learned about Peak Oil a decade ago. But I dismissed it as impractical given our dismantling of old infrastructures. I may have been too hasty. To what extent can our current infrastructure be retrofitted to support previous technological suites? I thought such a project would be too grand and energy-intensive for a resource-constrained society. I assume you'll be addressing this in future essays.

Take your 1928 Ford coupe and add federally mandated brake lights, turn signals, bumpers, side impact protection beams, seat belts, catalytic converter, and computerized engine control unit (required so the diagnostic port is available to check on emission history). Oh, and use better metal in the engine so it can run on unleaded gas.

She was a working woman and needed to earn a living; to that extent she could not escape the modern world.

She grew her own food, cooked and preserved it on a wood burning stove, made her own clothes, dyed a wove her own fabric, practiced a variety of traditional crafts, pumped her water, tended her flocks and did all of this into her nineties.

Sometimes it gets tedious and it's inspiring to read about your experiences and the possibilities, too. I've been in much need of an imagination shake up, so thank you all.<br><br>When I first found this blog I was also reading Sharon Astyk's blog Chatelaine's Keys which gave me a frame of reference and a name for the things I was interested in, and that was the concept of the household economy. Before that time I'd found a book about working down one's debt, being frugal, and investing one's money in bonds. That last method worked better in another time, but the rest of the concepts still serve my family quite well. Part of staying debt free and making the most of the money we have coming in is making quite a few things at home or simply doing without. We've got many perennials in and plans to grow more of our food each year, we are good at preserving, knitting, sewing, making our own cleaning and personal care supplies, I can even make my own incense from local plant materials. For the artists in our midst, I've recently begun following an artist named Nick Neddo who makes his own art supplies from life around him. Reviewing some of these things today helps soothe the nerves as I consider all the things we haven't yet begun that very much need our attention. We'll keep carrying on.<br><br>Lastly, I'm not able to find the original comment about health care, but read JMG's response and want to add, "And let us be blessed with doctors making house calls who have the least bit of curiosity and imagination!"

For me, vast information and contact at the click of a few buttons is an incredible tool. For others, yes, it's merely a source for easy, lurid satisfaction. <br>JMG, if you're still listening, a case for peak oil being the root cause of many present and impending global upheavals may be made, of course, and I see it as it relates to the fracking bubble. After all, fracking was a response to $100+/barrel oil. And $100/barrel oil is a result of 7.2 bln people trying to achieve a western lifestyle while the well is running dry. <br> Clearly though, the runup in commodity prices involves lots of money chasing a profitable return. Is there a causal link to peak oil here? Well, the much-discussed wealth inequality with ever-widening growth in wealth among the ultra-wealthy, as well as QE money looking for a place to go, drove the bubble, and like all bubbles, the rush for the exits is the endgame as the 'pop' becomes audible. The Goldman Sachs of the world will still do well of course by hedging their bets.<br> Did peak oil do this? Did peak oil contribute to wealth inequality? Maybe; I'm struggling with this. Crony capitalism is certainly leading us back to a Pikettyesque historical norm after a post-WWII brief encounter After Reagan, Clinton, and other misguided or self-serving political ideologies, globalization plus capitalism funneled money to the rich like an engine on nitro. Citizens United removed the governor. But peak oil as the cause? Show me. Don't get me wrong, a concentrated energy source like fossil fuel will rule the day--at the end of the day. And your regression contest is brilliant, and a practice I employ currently. But the ongoing surges in global economic forces are better understood within the broad historical concepts of Toynbee and Spengler, than peak oil alone. Hence a synthesis of these trends in your writings would be interesting. <br> <br><br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c43017404684786332 title="comment permalink">1/30/15, 7:08 PM</a><br><br>

By and large I agree with the post. I do, however believe that the social context and values are quite linked to certain economic and technological systems. Not in a totally determinist way. We don't HAVE to roll back female emancipation just because we use 1950s technology. But when you write: "The point could be made even more strongly by noting that the same technology was in use that year in Paris, Djakarta, Buenos Aires, Tokyo, Tangiers, Novosibirsk, Guadalajara, and Lagos, and the social practices and cultural mores of 1950s middle America didn’t follow the technology around to these distinctly diverse settings, you know." I think you make a bit too simplistic argument. After all, all these places have been subject to merging values and cultures over the years. The modern global consumerist culture has gradually replaced local cultures. We don't have to become Victorian just because we use that technology. But we will change and adjust to the technosphere and new economic conditions.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c5175754751919832219 title="comment permalink">1/31/15, 12:24 AM</a><br><br>

It was about that time that my grandmother went to work for General Telephone, and I remember the stories she would tell. I also remember mechanical step switches and party lines still being active in rural areas when I worked for the phone company. I also remember how well made and durable the Western Electric (Bell System) and Automatic Electric (General System) dial telephones were, and I loved dialing the phone. A neighboring community on an old step switch was still able to dial others in the community using just the last 5 digits of the number when I was in high school. I also loved the old telephone exchange names, though that was before my time (BUtterfield 8, BEechwood 4) In a day and age when phone numbers have to be remembered in your head, exchange names will make it a lot easier for people, especially kids, to remember phone numbers. If people 20 years from now could set up a successful telephone exchange using 1950 Bell or General System technology, and place a call from BEechwood 4-5789 to BEechwood 5-9078, that would be awesome.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c2654606011661708017 title="comment permalink">1/31/15, 9:18 AM</a><br><br>

Unorthodox economists regard it as the inevitable result of the fact that virtually all the world's money consists of bank loans on which interest must be paid at an exponential rate. Still others regard it as the inevitable result of a system that encourages banks to take ever-increasing risks which are eventually bound to materialise.<br><br>There is no reason why they can't all be right. Marxists use the term 'overdetermination' when a situation is the result of two or more different factors, any one of which would have brought it about on its own. It seems to me that that is our current situation. The fact that one explanation works on its own doesn't mean that others aren't equally valid.<br><br>Where JMG's argument scores over the others is that the oil situation is more fundamental than the money economy, so while banking and monetary arrangements can be changed, the oil situation cannot.

There are many old jokes about shortening messages ad absurdum to save money - since the price of telegrams was based on the number of words sent. The total bandwidth was very small, and was therefore rationed by price. A "tlog" would never work, even by subscription. The same principle would apply to a potential low-cost low-bandwidth internet (1980's-1990's redux), albeit the bandwidth available that way would be many orders of magnitude wider than the 1890's version, and numerous discussion groups did flourish back then ("Usenet").

When I look at our standard pharmacopoeia and general medical management, truthfully most of the low-hanging fruit was gathered in the 1950's-1960's. Since then it's been a pretty severe case of diminishing returns at spiraling expense. And contrary to popular belief, most of that spiraling expense doesn't wind up in physicians' pockets, if anything feeding the beast comes out of our pockets and sanity, too. Actually I think most doctors quietly regard 50 year old drugs that have withstood the test of time as generally superior to newly released ones, as they have an established track record, and the only reason to prescribe a new drug is if there's no suitable older alternative, which is actually fairly uncommon. It's sometimes hard to get that across to patients, though, who are fully into the narrative of progress and assume newer drugs must be superior. I've gotten puzzled looks before when explaining that drugs really don't work like Ipads.<br><br>A lot of diagnostic tests are the same. I pretty rarely see an MRI actually change the diagnosis and management, the only real purpose most of the time from what I can tell is to reassure the patient and prevent lawsuits from missing the outliers. CT's for head trauma do legitimately save lives as by the time signs and symptoms show up on the history and physical it's often too late to do anything about it, but this is more of an exception to the rule and probably doesn't make a huge dent at the population level regardless.<br><br>I couldn't really tell you how widespread the discontent among physicians is regarding the disconnect between the myth of progress and the reality, as a lot of it goes unspoken or deflected to more acceptable targets. I feel that patient expectations of the miracles the great god Progress is expected to provide and the marketers who fan these hopes to sell drugs and equipment are probably the major drivers of the failing narrative, though. Physicians are generally more realistic about what modern medicine can and can't accomplish, and our balancing act is more about reducing expectations while not appearing uncaring or incompetent, which is a tall order a lot of the time.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c6357262172416590838 title="comment permalink">1/31/15, 3:33 PM</a><br><br>

The two from the publicly traded companies said some nice-ish things about legally mandated conservation programs, and then a guy from a municipal electric utility got up and said "I'm what you call a DOUG: a Dumb Old Utility Guy, and the faster your meter spins the better I like it." And indeed, if you'd like to read up on the development of electric utilities in America, it's a story of a tremendous effort to do less with more, and to overcome the public's justifiable suspicion of the effort. If they weren't monopolies, your electric utilities would be spending untold millions on super bowl ads promoting artisanal home aluminum smelting. Luckily the ills of a monopoly are tempered by the utter lack of entrepreneurial drive or flair. <br>While that wasn't the "aha!"

Huge areas of my personal and professional lives involve overlapping suites of technology of varying ages and degrees of complexity that do mostly the same things just about as well.

Premarin is short for pregnant mare's urine, the original source and as far as I know the current one as well. I'm guessing we'll still have pregnant horses in the future, probably even more than we do now.<br><br>I'm actually rather sanguine about the future prospects of many pharmaceuticals. Like the purified extract of horse urine that launched a revolution, many of the important ones aren't technically difficult to refine or synthesize. The primary difficulty and expense was mostly upfront that's been paid for already. Figuring out what works, how it works, and the right dosage and route to administer it was the hard part, manufacturing and administering it, not so much. I'd venture to say almost all of the present expense and scarcity of pharmaceuticals can be laid at the feet of regulation and profit motive, not the laws of economics, chemistry, or thermodynamics. We had a critically dire shortage of saline solution all last year for crying out loud, which would be comical if it weren't so sad. I'm fairly confident anyone reading this could whip up a reasonable approximation of 0.9% NS in their kitchen if needed, and the careful ones could probably even manage to make it aseptic.

That would involve a drastic decrease in energy consumption per capita, both directly—people used a lot less energy of all kinds in 1950—and indirectly—goods and services took much less energy to produce then, too.<br><br>The idea has merit, but the numbers I come up with show a different picture<br><br>So here is the way that I am thinking about looking at things.<br><br>It isn't so much the total amount of oil produced/imported that matters, it is the quantity of oil per capita that matters.<br><br>Then, take a peek at this graph:<br><br><br>Data taken from EIA <br><br>So gentle readers, lets make some assumptions for the sake of argument.<br><br>First, the assumption that wells will keep pumping. But I post that the import fraction of our consumption will begin to dry up and the fracking will come back on line. I make some ball park guesses below about the imports available to the US.<br><br><br><br><br>Second, the fracking, when it comes back on line will dry up in around 10 years from restart, the phase "squeezing blood from a turnip" is the principle that will drive this.<br><br>So I am asking you to go back one page and take a look at how I come up with my S.W.A.G. (scientific wild-ass guess) for US production of oil in 2023.<br><br><br><br><br>So, really, what we are looking at is a steady decrease in overall oil supply and a lower oil consumption per capita and a correspondingly lower technology base.<br><br>I could run a new spreadsheet to add things together to give you a false impression of precision and accuracy, but when one is throwing together SWAG, that is considered bad form.<br><br>SO take the year 2023 (eight years from now) and add the oil production sans fracking and the imports that we will be able to access and you get this<br><br>Estimated US Oil Production: 1.5 Billion Barrels<br>Estimated US Oil Imports: 2.2 Billion Barrels<br>Total available US Oil: 3.7 Billion Barrels<br>Estimated US Population: 346 million<br>Estimated US Oil per capita: 10.69 Barrels<br><br>So, going back to JMG.<br><br>He posits a 1950's level lifestyle/technology base. Well in 1955 the US oil consumption per-capita was 16.8 barrels. In 2013, the oil consumption per capita was 17.5 barrels.<br><br>So, if we follow JMG's thoughts, we are looking at a per capita consumption roughly equivalent to 1941 in eight years. <br><br>Now, truth be told, there was not a lot of difference in technology between '41 and '55. So maybe he os on to something. But the downward slope of the oil curve will continue to be negative.<br><br>I am thinking that we maybe ought to be looking at the 1920's instead.<br><br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c6020179107167315957 title="comment permalink">2/1/15, 11:08 AM</a><br><br>

I often consider trying to set up an eco village that would be non-electric. This would not be a survival tactic, but it would be done in an effort to experience an enriched social life while living around people that are more Present. I'm aware of the difficulties in establishing an intentional community though, and I've often searched through JMG's writings for alternatives to setting up a commune, yet still experiencing interdependent community life.<br><br>I'm currently renter renting a mobile home, barn, and 20 acres for horses and a garden. I'm interested in draft animal power. I come from a rodeo background and left my roots for organic agriculture. So, I'm experienced at training horses, but I need to learn about driving instead of riding.<br><br>I'm certainly concerned about the welfare of draft animals, and I hope the people with a need for speed and ever higher profits can keep using machinery, but for those of us that want to work animals and care for them well, there exists a movement to keep the draft animal way of farming going. <br><br>Some resources:<br>Small Farmer's Journal<br>Rural Heritage Magazine<br>....books on working horses, mules, or oxen.<br>Plows, cultivators, and several other farming implements can be bought new from Pioneer or I&amp;J manufacturing, just to name two companies.

The thought of ratcheting back our technology does not scare me at all, and in fact excites me. For now I will focus my comment on two themes within the comment section - telephone and internet.<br><br>I too would like to see like to see a working telephone system in place. But forget about telephones in every house, let alone for every person. In the long run we will be talking about at best a small telephone exchange (actually a manual switchboard) in each community), with only important places connected (city hall, police, fire, etc.).<br><br>The problem, really the crux in all this, will be wire. There won't be any, or not very much. Even if copper ore remains available, the ability to make wire of any quality for the lengths needed just won't happen except in a few places. And even if we can substitute radio for the connections between communities, the number of "trunk lines" between will be limited. Telephone will once again be a rare and limited technology, costly to maintain and use.<br><br>Similar goes for internet. Even if we go back to local bulletin boards, or implement a mesh network. The technology behind the internet is as complex and demanding as telephone when it comes to connecting together over any appreciably sized area. If the making of copper wire is tough, imagine now making fiber optic cable. The tolerances and purities needed for manufacture of fiber itself, not to mention the lasers and detectors needed, is well beyond the scope of any backyard enterprise. Not to mention all the computer processors that are needed behind the scenes for each router or wireless access point, and the end user computers themselves. We are spoiled by our current commodity manufacturing process and cannot see this despite our efforts.<br><br>At best, telephone and internet, and computers themselves, can only be viewed as a "temporary" technology that will exist in much reduced form for only as long as we can salvage and repurpose existing materials and tools. I have the most hope for point-to-point radio, including some form of broadcasted radio, much like JMG has in his Star's Reach novel.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c7471475366319028009 title="comment permalink">2/3/15, 6:53 AM</a><br><br>

I’m always surprised when people who are supposedly accepting that the Internet will go away as tech winds down believe we’ll still have the technology to make mesh networks out of wireless routers. It takes the same technology to make those routers as it does for the backbone routers in the Internet.<br><br>Back in the 1980’s I had a couple friends who ran major BBS’s in Tucson, AZ. Remember the early days of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet rel=nofollow>FidoNet?</a> All phone line based store and forward. Running on the original IBM PC or a “Clone”. I built(assembled from bought boards)lots of those.<br><br>I also had friends that ran Packet Radio BBS’s running the W0RLI, MSYS, F6FBB software. I myself was into building the Packet Radio networks. NetRom, TheNet were some of the firmware used in the mountaintop nodes based on TAPR TNC-2 or clone hardware. Most of the radios were salvaged, cast off commercials. Motorola MICOR radios were the most popular, but also lots of MOCOM 70. Although this is seen as downright primitive by comparison to the WiFi networks of today, a massive High-Tech manufacturing base was needed to make this stuff. Who thinks they’ll make a WiFi node in their garage? Modify an existing castoff one, yes. Manufacture one? No way! Not without a multi-Billion $ <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_fabrication_plant rel=nofollow>Fab Plant</a>.<br><br>This is why JMG keeps bringing up the subject of Ham Radio. In the future, will the technology and manufacturing base exist to make our high-tech radio? Of course not! However that isn’t what was done in 1910-1930 time period when Ham Radio, in fact Radio at all, was getting started. Hams were doing more experimentation than anybody during the early days of Radio, read history. Read early issues (1915-1925) of QST, the Ham Radio magazine, and you’ll see just how many hams bought equipment already built. Almost none. You see articles about building transformers, rectifiers, filter capacitors. Yes, electrolytic capacitors built out of pie pans and acid. Power Supply rectifiers built out of metal strips in acid. Some even made their own tubes. That won’t build a WiFi node!<br><br>Let’s start getting back to Ham Radio…<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c8006955519744119820 title="comment permalink">2/3/15, 12:50 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks for the thoughts. When thinking about technology on an interstate basis like the phone system and Internet, it's important, I think, to understand its structure of operation. Is it a closed system or an open system integrated with intermediaries: vendors, other technologies, financing (debt)? If I'm not mistaken, the hardware of relay stations in land line infrastructure has been replaced, at least in part, by satellite relay. I wonder how many more intermediary dependency is involved. <br><br>Assuming the land line infrastructure can be kept running or reworked with older methods (is the knowledge base for the older tech dead), here some scaled back options. Long range walkie-talkies with rechargeable batteries and solar recharger. I've got four. If you need to reach someone outside your home system, you'll need to use the post (if phones work, got to think a post works). Or, in the country, what's known as an Amish phone. A neighbor provides a phone in a little house that the local Amish use and leave a little money in the lock box. In a village or town, maybe there will be phone cafes. Maybe phone booths come back. Of course, this also depends if the system can even work financially at this scale of use.<br><br>When Constantine decided to remake Byzantium into his new imperial capital, the knowledge base for grand monumental architecture had died out so much that Constantine had to start schools with the last of the old timers to teach the skills needed. This worked because he got to the old timers before death did and that there was still a strong central government to mobilize.

That number went steadily down from about 70% in 1840 to something like 5% in 1970 (pulling this from the next best diagram). Services jobs did pretty much the opposite (btw industry jobs peaked in the 50s at 35%). 1950s agri jobs are down to 12 % or so, while 1920s is still at 30%. This will define who your customers are, and to a large degree what tech you can sell (other than military). <br><br>However I agree with many people who made good points that some techs are "trick rich" or front loaded with high capex, but don't necessarily depend too much on a large flow of energy and (highly specific) resources once they are up and delivering valuable(!) services. For these I assume a kind of "last man standing" dynamic will become (or is) one important factor. It goes back to how resilient the tech suites are compared to locally smooth or bumpy ride the down the slope is. <br>One aspect that make this a little difficult to judge is that particularly many of the MSM hyped sectors are trying hard to make progress (e.g. Moore's Law). In a "world at rest" they could ditch these efforts to a large degree and focus on cost reduction (like everyone else has been doing since the late 70s).<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c7508821256018318559 title="comment permalink">2/4/15, 3:02 AM</a><br><br>

I truly hope the watermills and forges of New England and other places can be resurrected.<br><br>But you are forgetting that the copper still needs to get to these mills, and the finished product needs to get to users. We won't be able to work from just salvaged supplies of copper to feed these mills, as even that needs to get to site through bulk transportation of some form. Comparing the amount of wire that was manufactured back in the middle of the 19th Century, when telegraph was taking off, which is also back in the day of your watermills, is trivial as compared to today.<br><br>And yes, there is lots of copper wire around now that is just rotting/corroding in the ground that I hope we can reuse or reclaim when the time comes.

One cannot even resurrect a phone connection across any appreciable distance anymore that is done by copper wire.<br><br>The switch to digital for telephone and internet, while helpful now for handling the volume and bandwidth required by modern society, also brought with it a shortening of its future by creating so much more of an intricate system that is harder to maintain. Digital processing (other than the between-the-ears processing of Morse code by humans) requires a computer processor of some sort, with most needing sophisticated (in relatives terms of what I human can produce with a few transistors, resisters, and capacitors) Digital Signal Processing (DSP) systems. I suspect all but a few important and critical communication circuits (such as government and a few banking needs) will be worthy of such technology in the future.<br><br>Analog voice communication (as opposed to the digital encoding of voice), while not as great, is also simpler to imagine keeping going in some form. Yet the march of technology has been to eradicate all this older technology, especially in the telephone and internet industry (which is really one and the same these days), which suggests its resurrection will be in fits and starts in very isolated places and nothing close to a national network.<br><br>Only time will tell if I am right or not in how I interpret this communication future.<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c4115736033673291537 title="comment permalink">2/4/15, 6:31 AM</a><br><br>

Saturn now begins a two year journey through the sign of Sagittarius. Austin Coppock, who is a great astrologer, had this to say about it, which I think reflects the message JMG has been hitting each week since the new year:<br><br>"Insofar as Saturn offers a general tempo for the times, the one offered by the planet while in Sagitarrius is frenetic. Saturn's time in Sag. is in a sense a prelude to Saturn's return to Capricorn - the frantic endgame before a new order arises. Saturn was in sag during the wild speculation of the late '20s which led up to the depression. It was also there during the end of the 5o's - the last phase of American post WWII culture before the massive changes of the '60s. Finally the last time Saturn was in Sag was in the late 80's, where financial speculation and a culture of excess oversaw the final years of the cold war".<br><br>It seems there might be something to this idea of returning to the 20s &amp; 50s. But now is a time to point your arrows towards those projects which can benefit you most when Saturn hits Capricorn... <br><br>You can read the rest here:<br>"http://austincoppock.com/2014/12/saturn-in-sagittarius/"<br><br>Justin<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c7674848697679242378 title="comment permalink">2/4/15, 8:27 AM</a><br><br>

My first impression is that they're ignoring the bigger half of the problem. If people throw away massive quantities of spoiled food, maybe they don't plan and provision their consumption properly. Food almost never spoils at my house, because we don't buy (or harvest) more than we can eat in a timely manner. <br><br>The data graphs of "shelf life vs. temperature" are baffling to me. Take milk, for example. Are they saying that, depending on which literature they read, the shelf life for milk at 4C is 2 days, or 22, or somewhere in between? If this were an elementary school science fair (which I judge), I'd press the student to explain the scattered results, not just average them away.<br><br>This seems like another instance of a study which claims that "large savings are possible" by requiring <i>everyone</i> to make small changes in behavior.

I am a man with autism, aged 27, who has been following your blog, on and off, for many years. Thanks for your writings about the future related to Peak Oil. I started reading the works of the Peak Oil community as a teenager after sinking into a very deep depression when I was 14. I then read many of the battles featured in so much of this community, and will not name names. I resented how so many made so many claims that really couldn't be proven, and insulted you in the process of refusing to admit they couldn't, and I secretly was supporting you in the sidelines.<br><br>Yet, due to my autism, I never joined the Peak Oil, Rewilding, and other related communities, since I never had the means to. I know in my heart that I am truly helpless to do anything to prepare for the upcoming collapse because of my autism and my limited financial means, and have had to accept that reality. I have no friends or family members that are able or willing to accept this reality, and have no ability to relocate anywhere that can change that. I also challenged so many ideologies in a fight to survive. Now I accept the reality that I can't live outside of Civilization, not because I love Civ or are against Rewilders, but because my autism makes it impossible for me to do so.<br><br>I had to withdraw from the Movement in my early 20s to live my life. Now I return, however, looking to learn the realities and understand your and other perspectives, even though I can't adapt to any of them.<br><br>Thank you, from a fellow individual with Autism, James Williams<br><br><a href=the-one-way-forward.html#c7880828218600968481 title="comment permalink">1/2/16, 8:05 AM</a><br><br>
