<div class=MsoNormal>
If you’re like most Atlanteans these days, you’ve heard all sorts of unnerving claims about the future of our continent. Some people are even saying that recent earth tremors are harbingers of a cataclysm that will plunge Atlantis to the bottom of the sea. Those old prophecies from the sacred scrolls of the Sun Temple have had the dust blown off them again, adding to the stew of rumors. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So is there anything to it? Should you be worried about the future of Atlantis? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Not according to the experts. I visited some of the most widely respected hierarchs here in the City of the Golden Gates yesterday to ask them about the rumors, and they assured me that there’s no reason to take the latest round of alarmist claims at all seriously.<br>
</div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
***</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
My first stop was the temple complex of black orichalcum just outside the Palace of the Ten Kings, where Nacil Buper, Grand Priestess of the Temple of Night, took time out of her busy schedule to meet with me. I asked her what she thought about the rumors of imminent catastrophe. “Complete and utter nonsense,” she replied briskly. “There are always people who want to insist that the end is nigh, and they can always find something to use to justify that sort of thing. Remember a few years ago, when everyone was running around insisting that the end of the Forty-First Grand Cycle of Time was going to bring the destruction of the world? This is more of the same silliness.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Just at that moment, the floor shook beneath us, and I asked her about the earth tremors, pointing out that those seem to be more frequent than they were just a few years back. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Atlantis has always had earthquakes,” the Grand Priestess reminded me, gesturing with her scepter of human bone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“There are natural cycles affecting their frequency, and there’s no proof that they’re more frequent because of anything human beings are doing. In fact, I’m far from convinced that they’re any more frequent than they used to be. There are serious questions about whether the priests of the Sun Temple have been fiddling with their data, you know.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And the claim from those old prophecies that offering human sacrifices to Mu-Elortep, Lord of Evil, might have something to do with it?” I asked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s the most outrageous kind of nonsense,” the Grand Priestess replied. “Atlanteans have been worshipping the Lord of Evil for more than a century and a half. It’s one of the foundations of our society and our way of life, and we should be increasing the number of offerings to Mu-Elortep as rapidly as we can, not listening to crazies from the fringe who insist that there’s something wrong with slaughtering people for the greater glory of the Lord of Evil. We can’t do without Mu-Elortep, not if we’re going to restore Atlantis to full prosperity and its rightful place in the world order, and if that means sacrifices have to be made—and it does—then sacrifices need to be made.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She leaned forward confidentially, and her necklace of infant’s skulls rattled. “You know as well as I do that all this is just another attempt by the Priests of the Sun to dodge their responsibility for their own bad policies. Nobody would care in the least about all these crazy rumors of imminent doom if the Sun Priest Erogla hadn’t made such a fuss about the old prophecies in the scrolls of the Sun Temple a few years back. The Sun Temple’s the real problem we face. Fortunately, though, we of the Temple of Night have a majority in the Council of the Ten Kings now. We’re working on legislation right now to eradicate poverty in Atlantis by offering up the poor to Mu-Elortep in one grand bonfire. Once that’s done, I’m convinced, Atlantis will be on the road to a full recovery.”<br>
</div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
***</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
After my conversation with the Grand Priestess, I went uphill to the foot of the Sacred Mountain, where the Sun Temple rises above the golden-roofed palaces of the Patricians of Atlantis. I had made an appointment to see Tarc Omed, the Hierophant of the Priests of the Sun; he met me in his private chamber, and had his servants pour us purple wine from Valusia as we talked. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I know the kind of thing you must have heard from the Temple of Night,” the Hierophant said wearily. “It’s all our fault the economy’s in trouble. Everything’s our fault. That’s how they avoid responsibility for the consequences of the policies they’ve been pursuing for decades now.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I asked him what he thought of Nacil Buper’s claim that offering up the poor as human sacrifices would solve all the problems Atlantis faces these days. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Look,” he said, “everybody knows that we’ve got to wean ourselves off making human sacrifices to the Lord of Evil one of these days. There’s no way we can keep that up indefinitely, and it’s already causing measurable problems. That’s why we’re proposing increased funding for more sustainable forms of worship directed toward other deities, so we can move step by step to a society that doesn’t have to engage in human sacrifice or deal with Mu-Elortep at all.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And the ground tremors? Do they have anything to do with the sacrifices?</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s a good question. It’s hard to say whether any particular burst of tremors is being caused by the prophesied curse, you know, but that’s no reason for complacency.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A tremor shook the room, and we both steadied our golden goblets of wine on the table. “Doesn’t that lend support to the rumors that Atlantis might sink soon?” I asked. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Tarc Omed looked weary again, and leaned back in his great chair of gold and ivory. “We have to be realistic,” he said. “Right now, Atlantean society depends on human sacrifice, and transitioning away from that isn’t something we can do overnight. We need to get those more sustainable forms of worship up and running first, and that can’t be done without negotiated compromises and the support of as many stakeholders as possible. Alarmism doesn’t further that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I thought of one of the things Nacil Buper had said. “But aren’t the prophecies of doom we’re discussing right there in the sacred scrolls of the Sun Temple?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We don’t consider that relevant just now,” the Hierophant told me firmly. “What matters right at the moment is to build a coalition strong enough to take back a majority in the Council of the Ten Kings, stop the Temple of Night’s crazy plan to sacrifice all of the poor to Mu-Elortep, and make sure that human sacrifices are conducted in as painless and sanitary a fashion as possible and increased only at the rate that’s really necessary, while we work toward phasing out human sacrifice altogether. Of course we can’t continue on our current path, but I have faith that Atlanteans can and will work together to stop any sort of worst-case scenario from happening.”<br>
</div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
***</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
From the Temple of the Sun I walked out of the patrician district, into one of the working class neighborhoods overlooking the Old Harbor. The ground shook beneath my feet a couple of times as I went. People working in the taverns and shops looked up at the Sacred Mountain each time, and then went back to their labor. It made me feel good to know that their confidence was shared by both the hierarchs I’d just interviewed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I decided to do some person-in-the-street interviews for the sake of local color, and stepped into one of the taverns. Introducing myself to the patrons as a reporter, I asked what they thought about the rumors of disaster and the ongoing earth tremors. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Oh, I’m sure the Priests of the Sun will think of something,” one patron said. I wrote that down on my wax tablet. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yeah,” agreed another. “How long have these prophecies been around? And Atlantis is still above water, isn’t it? I’m not worried.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I used to believe that stuff back in the day,” said a third patron. “You know, you buy into all kinds of silly things when you’re young and gullible, then grow out of it once it’s time to settle down and deal with the real world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I sure did.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That got nods and murmurs of approval all around. “I honestly think a lot of the people who are spreading these rumors actually <i>want
</i>Atlantis to sink,” the third patron went on. “All this obsessing about those old prophecies and how awful human sacrifice is—I mean, can we get real, please?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You can say that again,” said the second patron. “I bet they do want Atlantis to sink. I bet they’re actually Lemurian sympathizers.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The third patron turned to look at him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“You know, that would make a lot of sense—” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Just then another tremor, a really strong one, shook the tavern. The whole room went dead silent for a moment. As the tremor died down, everybody started talking loudly all at once. I said my goodbyes and headed for the door. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As I stopped outside to put my wax tablet into the scribe’s case on my belt, one of the other patrons—a woman who hadn’t said anything—came through the door after me. “If you’re looking for a different point of view,” she told me, “you ought to go down to the Sea Temple. They’ll give you an earful.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I thanked her, and started downhill toward the Old Harbor.<br>
</div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
***</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d never been to the Sea Temple before; I don’t think most Atlanteans ever go there, though it’s been right there next to the Old Harbor since time out of mind. When I got there, the big doors facing the harbor were wide open, but the place seemed empty; the only sounds were the flapping of the big blue banners above the temple and the cries of sea birds up overhead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As another tremor rattled the city, I walked in through the open doors. I didn’t see anyone at first, but after a few moments a woman in the blue robes of a Sea Priestess came out of the sanctuary further inside and hurried toward me. She had a basket of scrolls in her arms. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I introduced myself, explained that I was a journalist, and asked if she minded answering some questions.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not if you don’t mind walking with me to the harbor,” she said. “I’m in a bit of a hurry.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sure,” I told her. “So what do you think about all these scary rumors? Do you really think Atlantis could end up underwater?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We left the temple and started across the plaza outside, toward the harbor. “Have you read the prophecies of Emor Fobulc?” she asked me.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Can’t say I have.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“They predicted everything that’s happened: the rise of the cult of Mu-Elortep, the sacrifices, the earth tremors, and now the Sign.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The what?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“When’s the last time you looked at the top of the Sacred Mountain?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I stopped and looked right then. There was a plume of smoke rising from the great rounded peak. After a moment, I hurried to catch up to her.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s the Sign,” she told me. “It means that the fires of Under-Earth have awakened and Atlantis will soon be destroyed.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Seriously?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Seriously.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I thought about it for a moment as we walked, and the ground shook beneath our feet. “There could be plenty of other explanations for that smoke, you know.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The priestess looked at me for a long moment. “No doubt,” she said dryly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By then we were near the edge of the quay, and half a dozen people came hurrying down the gangplank from a ship that was tied up there, an old-fashioned sailing vessel with a single mast and the prow carved to look like a swan. One of them, a younger priestess, bowed, took the basket of scrolls, and hurried back on board the ship. Another, who was dressed like a mariner, bowed too, and said to the priestess I’d spoken with, “Is there anything else, Great Lady?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Nothing,” she said. “We should go.” She turned to me. “You may come with us if you wish.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I need to have this story back to the pressroom before things shut down this afternoon,” I told her. “Are you going to be coming back within two hours or so?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I got another of her long silent looks. “No,” she said. “We’ll be much longer than that.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sorry, then—I hate to turn down a cruise, but work is work.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She didn’t have anything to say to that, and the others more or less bundled her up the gangplank onto the ship. A couple of sailors untied the cables holding the ship against the quay and then climbed on board before it drifted away. A few minutes later the ship was pulling out into the Old Harbor; I could hear the oarsmen belowdecks singing one of their chanteys while the sailors climbed aloft and got the sail unfurled and set to the breeze. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
After a few more minutes, I turned and started back up the hill toward the middle of town. As I climbed the slope, I could see more and more of the City of the Golden Gates around me in the afternoon sun: the Palace of the Ten Kings with the Temple of Night beside it, the Sun Temple and the golden roofs of the patricians’ palaces higher up the slope. The ground was shaking pretty much nonstop, but I barely noticed it, I’d gotten so used to the tremors. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The view got better as I climbed. Below, the Old Harbor spread out to one side and the New Harbor to the other. Next to the New Harbor was the charnel ground of Elah-Slio, where smoke was rising from the altars and long lines of victims were being driven forward with whips to be offered up as sacrifices to Mu-Elortep; off the other way, beyond the Old Harbor, I spotted twenty or so sails in the middle distance, heading away from Atlantis, and the ship with the priestess on it hurrying to join them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s when it occurred to me that the Sea Priestess couldn’t have been serious when she said that Atlantis would soon be destroyed. Surely, if the prophecies were true, the Sea Priestesses would have had more important things to do than go on some kind of long vacation cruise. I laughed at how gullible I’d been there for a moment, and kept climbing the hill into the sunlight. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Above the Sacred Mountain, the cloud of smoke had gotten much bigger, and it looked as though some kind of red glow was reflecting off the bottom of it. I wondered what that meant, but figured I’d find out from the news soon enough. It certainly made me feel good to know that there was no reason whatever to worry about the far-fetched notion that Atlantis might end up at the bottom of the sea. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

(Note: due to a date-linked transtemporal anomaly, this week’s planned Archdruid Report post got switched with a passage from the <i>Swenyliad</i>, an Atlantean chronicle dating from 9613 BCE. We apologize for any inconvenience.) </div>

Despite writing some relatively controversial things here over many years, I don't believe I've seen as much push back as on last week’s discussion about the whole drought thing before. I had to go back and re-read the rant just to make sure I hadn't really offended anyone, other than pointing out some unpalatable truths based on hard won experience and offering some useful suggestions (which were largely ignored). Those suggestions do work and one of my sources of respect for the Permaculture people is that they established a working productive property well below sea level in the Jordan valley. Compared to that place in Jordan I'm in a rainforest! I'm pretty certain there were other motives for establishing the property there, but all the same it is a very big challenge. All of the strategies that they use work pretty much anywhere it is hot and dry too. You don't need to do a course, just follow some common sense guidelines:<br><br>- Don't waste the water you do get from the sky. Either store it for later use or put it back into the ground. Don't bore me with stories saying how hard it is deal to legislators that are not based in the real world that people actually live in. Tell them that you'll personally ensure that you'll get rid of them or sue them or some such thing if that they don't get on board with what is actually a common sense proposal and costs no one anything except for those that choose to install a water tank. What do you reckon I do down here when I have problems with the legislators? It is easy to understand that.<br><br>- Build your top soil. Bring in any organic matter that you can get your hands on - even roadkill provides useful minerals for the soil. Manures and mulches are awesome. More top soil = more water in the ground all year round = healthier and hardier plants. It is easy to understand that.<br><br>- Shade your plants. Use artificial means at first if you have to, but then try to build up a solid, hardy over story of trees so that the more delicate plants underneath - which is a lot of the stuff that we eat - don't suffer so much heat stress. It is easy to understand that.<br><br>- Don't plough the soil. This should be obvious. All of the little creatures live in the soil, like the dark, cool and damp conditions. Expose them to the sun and they die. Plants then eat those minerals that get released from the dead critters and then we take those minerals off the farm. This is a strategy which humans have been pursuing for so long that we think of it as normal - but it has no shelf life of any length. If you have to dig the soil, repair it with mulches and manures because that is what nature does. It is easy to understand that.<br><br>- I'd have to suggest that your cities like Los Angeles are heat islands and they significantly affect the precipitation in the surrounding area. It is easy to understand that.<br><br>If you understand the above then you are so far ahead of industrial agriculture it is not funny. By all means gamble that they know what they're doing and in many cases they probably do, but from my perspective it is a very chancy gamble to expect them to cope with increasingly dry conditions.<br><br>cont...<br><br><a href=#c1668914065182762762 title="comment permalink">4/1/15, 7:03 PM</a><br><br>

As a comparative with here, we fear droughts for good reason. That fear allows us to discuss unpalatable subjects surrounding water and restrictions are on the table and well enforced during severe droughts. Still, there are many areas that we do fall down on in relation to water allocation. Respect for the work that you do.<br><br>Hi Glenn,<br><br>Many thanks for the explanation. I read your initial reply and was going to myself: So? Moving water from one area to another is quite expensive so with all of those large proposed schemes it will be very instructive to see who will pay for the infrastructure and then the ongoing maintenance? The cynic in me says that those rivers were allowed to run to the ocean in the first place because it was not economically viable to obtain water from them. It is quite instructive looking at their paths on the maps.<br><br>Hi Heather,<br><br>Thank you for the consideration. The tone was intended to shock because no one seemed to want to discuss adaption or the acceptance of limits. Seriously it is not the end, unless we take both of those options off the table and pursue business as usual. But as I said before, relative to current production methods, it is uneconomic to switch to dry land farming methods. It costs a lot of money to establish and involves a serious lowering of expectations of yield for years before a farm can recover. I also understood exactly what was involved and wondered at how the "too big to fail" meme became applied to that industry. Nature cares not one way or the other.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c1311373334880429360 title="comment permalink">4/1/15, 7:03 PM</a><br><br>

I knew just from reading the title this was going to be a good one. It's especially funny and not really that surprising that the names feel very authentic. And like all good satire, it has really helped put things in a new light. I have been struggling, in the past few years of reading your blog, with giving up on the luxuries of modern life, but imagining myself holding an infant's skull every time I pick up my smartphone might just do it for me.<br><br>On a different note, there is this idea that I first got while reading your Dark Age America series: all the suffering, decay and destruction we are and will be experiencing are simply, at a civilization level, the symptoms of old age and that the best response is the same for an individual would do in that situation. That is, accept death as inevitable and age as gracefully as possible. But since this requires a level of self awareness we don't have today, even as individuals, I don't expect it to really happen. In fact, I'm giving it another five or six global civilizations before this becomes the norm.<br><br><br>Kaitain, gasp, you're a Lemurian sympathizer! But seriously, while I have no doubt the people of the future will see us as demons, I don't think they'll bother differentiating between the empires of our age. Especially since they all seem to hypocritically denounce each other for things they themselves do. It also helps to keep in mind that your orcs might not be our orcs. Your orcs might just be our elves, and vice versa. There are people in Europe that actually love America and hope for its continued existence.<br><br>Also, I know it's totally unreasonable of me to do this, but at this point I just assume that every Russian blogger on the Internet is an agent paid by the Kremlin to demonize the West (and China occasionally) and present Russia as the savior of the World and the solution to all our problems.<br><br>Finally, one minor, irrelevant gripe: Shouldn't it be Barad-Dur on the Potomac, since Mordor was the whole country?<br><br><br>dfr2010, I have been reading the names backwards and I'm really confused.

I'm not disappointed :-). On a more serious note, I still have some trouble really internalizing the Atlantis metaphor for our own age mainly because, at face value, it touches on a few memes that are pretty harmful and already far too prevalent in our society. The biggest difference between us and Atlantis is that we have nowhere else to go. We can't just get on a boat and sail away, and the problem is many people faced with the predicament of our age will suggest exactly that as a response. The truth is, whatever Lemurian Quartz may have been able to do in the misty reaches of occult (and its continuation into New Age) legend, these days it may be nifty for enchanting but it's not much good for powering a starship. I know in a deeper level Atlantis is a metaphor for the institutions and niceties of our civilization not for the planet as a whole, though even taken to that level it can all to easily get twisted to fit the fantasies of "escaping" from the Atlantis of our civilization into the hunter-gatherer tribes of neoprimitivism, or intentional villages and communes which also don't do much to address the crises of our age. In a lot of ways, I feel like we're more like the reporter than anyone else... looking at the unscrupulous corporate cheerleaders on one end, the greenwashed proponents of business as usual disguised as "sustainable growth" on the other, and the people clinging to apocalyptic lifeboat mythology skirting the fringes. Is there a fourth temple that is neither a proponent of business as usual nor a cargo cult?<br><br><a href=#c2192245824002056596 title="comment permalink">4/2/15, 8:25 AM</a><br><br>

The weather was warm and perfect, as it is every day here in the land of Ain-Rofilac. The ocean was calm and blue. In the evening, my friends and I spoke of drought, climate change, technology, and the future. I ventured to talk about some of the things I have learned in my several years of reading this blog. I said that we live on a planet with physical limitations; that we are scraping the bottom of the oil barrel; that no other fuel we know of has the same bang for the buck; that things are going to change; and so on. As if they too had taken their lines from JMG's writings, my friends said, "But there has always been progress." And "They'll think of something." And "Our technology is so advanced--they'll find a way to make things out of thin air!" And "Well, you can believe we're all doomed, but I prefer to have hope." It was eerie. It was upsetting. Your story of Atlantis feels so very right on.<br><br><a href=#c7282121780738793135 title="comment permalink">4/2/15, 4:02 PM</a><br><br>

The Vicar called it Bus Stations of the Cross. Our little congregation and (to our happy surprise) quite a few people we'd never met before, trekked around town on the bus to places where people in our town had stood up for their beliefs and paid the price. In most cases there was a gap of many years before the community acknowledged that they were wrong and the people protesting against war, discrimination, environmental issues and the like had been on the right track. Most of the protestors are, of course, long gone and I think that we too will be compost before our children and grandchildren may be able to say that they are proud that we didn't drink get sucked in.

Life in Oykot itself seemed to be part of the problem, rather than a solution.<br>I keep the ship maintained out back in case my choice of landing appears to be not quite far enough. As a mid-level priestess of the Cult of Joy, the Sea and International Commerce (check out "Kompira"), I try to inspire post-Atlantian hope in anyone willing to hear the bad news first, and offer a life boat to our followers who feel they must remain in Oykot despite their awareness of the worsening situation.<br>@Everyone<br>Having been brought up as a Buddhist in Salt Lake City, I know from experience that once someone is deemed "evil," every act of kindness he or she performs is "evil," anything he or she likes is tainted, and anyone who extends a hand of friendship is committing an act of "evil." The latest meme seems to be that everyone posting positive views on Russia is a paid troll. I cannot even get a reply from the busy Mr. Putin, forget about a salary!<br>I do not know the man personally. All I know is that the lives of my friends in Russia have improved somewhat since he took office, though they have been forced into the capitalist mold to some extent. I've noted over the past decade that every time Mr. Putin did something to help average sorts of people internationally, negative press would appear in diverse media thereafter and stand unchallenged, because it was small, and anyone who knew Russia could see through it.<br>I now see the same incipient demonization of Japan starting up in the same way, with a negative Hollywood characterization. It is tiny enough to be dismissed, but constitutes a real threat in case Japan steps out of line. It takes just a few years of little cuts to cultivate a negative image. Even when people know better, it is natural to assume that "where there is smoke there is fire" when presented with an overwhelming barrage of disinformation. Thus I do not consider people writing negatively about Russia to be trolls. I am just grateful not to be living in a place with such a steady, one-sided drumbeat.<br>@JMG, I did not even consider turning the names around! It was fun reading through your story once more.

I'm curious as to why you feel the need to drag the conversation back to that, and away from the points central to this week's post. <br><br>Patricia, funny! I was pleasantly surprised by "Swenyliad" -- it really does sound like the name of an epic, with or without crazy Irishmen involved. <br><br>Carlo, thank you. <br><br>Ed-M, when I wrote my book on the Atlantis legend a while back, I plopped for simple sea level rise, amplified by tsunamis, as the modality of the sinking. If I were going to do it again -- or if I ever get around to writing that novel set in the last days of Atlantis -- I'll definitely want to use a supervolcano eruption, with a very large caldera collapse doing the deed. It's just better drama, all things considered!<br><br>Tidlösa, sorry about that -- I haven't yet been able to work out the necessary transtemporal anomaly to get my posts to appear worldwide at the same local time everywhere. ;-)<br><br>Thor, thank you. I know the feeling -- after all those years feeling like the only person on the planet who remembered that a sphere can only contain a finite volume of anything, when the first stirrings of the peak oil scene got under way, it was a real source of reassurance. <br><br>JML, i.e., "The power of Mu-Elortep is infinite and eternal, and if you disagree with me, you must be a Lemurian sympathizer!" Yes, I'm familiar with the cant. <br><br>Shane, "Did you hear the one about the Christian pizzeria?" reminds me way too much of bad middle school jokes...<br><br>Sven, if you can haul on an oar, I'm pretty sure they can find a place on a bench for you.<br><br>Other Tom, thank you -- that's very high praise! <br><br>Handyman, I know. One of the gifts of satire is that it allows the satirist to talk openly about the unmentionable. <br><br>SLClaire, thank you.

At the same time, one of the things that seems to shut down almost every conversation I have with people on the subject these days is that there are far too many people right now who think this is a ship catastrophe. These days there's a subset of the sun temple who uses the gravity of the crises of our times as ammunition for their campaign to double down on our space program now no matter what the cost so the exodus can commence before we all die. Not sure what the parallel in the Atlantis metaphor is. I know reading this piece most of those people would obviously identify themselves with the Sea temple which they obviously aren't. Hmm... maybe there's an archmage of the sun temple named Nosyt Essårg E'dlêin suggesting that the only way to solve the crisis, end the earthquakes, and stop the human sacrifices and the evil influence of the Mu-Elortep is to perform one massive ritual of human sacrifice, summon an army of demons, and storm the heavens slaying Mu-Elortep and all the other gods so the sun priests of Atlantis can rule the cosmos from on high for all eternity.<br><br><a href=#c491627243150311103 title="comment permalink">4/3/15, 6:32 AM</a><br><br>

BTW there is a huge resurgence in traditional archery here by young people in the area. Don’t know what to make of it but am happy to provide pointers on form and technique to those interested. TY in kind to JMG for providing good example to those of us new to writing fiction. On Wednesday while working on my story for the anthology a surprise storylet popped out by accident amazingly synchronized with the Atlantian story in terms of both artifacts (boats) and themes of direction of spiritual energy through fears and complacency. If you see fit, please post my first fiction storylet through the filter. <br><br>Whatever the case, another tip in thanks of my Donegal tam to you Archdruid.<br><br>Title: Two - Franticality in the devils hand basket.<br><br>Following a foreseeable Ocean vessel accident, people on a life boat are sailing for haven.<br><br>A rain squall hits, water in the boat is rising. Some grab buckets and begin to bail.<br><br>Rain continues into the boat, bailing has stabilized the rise.<br><br>Someone on the boat starts screaming “We are all going to die! ” (A true enough statement as ever was). The screamer follows with justifiable reinforcing hysteria directives.<br> <br>“ Quick, quick we MUST start chopping holes in the boat to let all the rain water out NOW! We are all going to DIE!”<br><br>Happy to have something to do and quell the screaming, anxious onlookers grab axes, and commence to chop holes in the hull.<br> <br>Satisfied, the screamer stops.<br> <br>Water rises faster in the boat, the screamer restarts. <br><br>”It’s raining more, chop Harder Faster, Harder, Faster! We are all going to die!” <br><br>Chopping proceeds with gusto. <br><br>The squall and chopping ends as the life boat sinks. <br><br>Standing on submerged gunnels those left hear one last prophetic scream cut short; “We are all going too!”<br><br>The screamer is picked up by a rescue helicopter, everyone else is lost.<br><br>P.S. The screamer helicopter runs out of fuel on the way back to land, the screamer dies. <br><br>In the devils hand basket, reality is a constant. <br><br>Some boats sink by chopping holes in the hull, others by different means. <br><br>Yes. WE are ALL going to DIE.<br>What to do?<br><br>Cheers! Michael<br><br><a href=#c9096785672171961335 title="comment permalink">4/3/15, 1:43 PM</a><br><br>

This is an imagined quote from a random cell in the body of a person who just died moments before: "Yes, it's become more difficult to acquire oxygen than it was a minute or two ago, but there's still oxygen all around; the water molecules are loaded with it, and there's plenty in proteins too. With so many changes going on, who's to say a solution won't be found? Maybe there's something even better than oxygen we should be using, and this will give us the kick we need to go find it. I'll admit, the neurons are having a hard time of it and have mostly died off, but the anaerobic bacteria are flourishing more than ever, and there are some exciting new kinds of spores showing up on the mucus membranes that seem to have very promising futures."<br><br>A few items of old business:<br><br>No response as yet from Global Population Speak Out about the water decontamination project proposal.<br><br>Belated congratulations to last week's squirrel case winners!

Obviously, how much money an oil company can borrow against reserves depends upon the value of those reserves. With prices collapsed, a lot of tight oil now isn’t worth drilling at all — it’s worthless. Companies are busting the terms of their bonds and bank loans left and right — it’s common for borrowing covenants to require a company to keep their total indebtedness to within four times their annual EBITDA. But banks are waiving that requirement, for now. <b>“We don’t know how to run an oil company; we don’t want to run an oil company,” says the banker. “Hopefully oil prices come back up this summer.”</b> If not, by the time the next set of borrowing base determinations come around in October, there will be blood in the streets as many zombie companies will finally have no choice but to give up.</i><br><br>The next paragraph in the article about egos is priceless too.

The protagonist survives because she is an excellent archer and has inspired lots of teenagers to take up archery, BUT what is interesting for Archdruid Report readers is that it is actually a fable for our times, with its central Capital draining all the resources from the districts, which remain in poverty, and are kept pacified with Ancient Rome-style gladitorial circuses.<br><br>I have had a number of interesting conversation with my teenagers on the subject of externalities, social justice and the likely future of the human race based on these novels, and recommend any readers with teenagers take the opportunity to do the same. The book is no doubt already on their book shelf (or electronic device), or at the very least they will have seen the movies, and they may as well take something away from the stories, other than an interest in archery - which is an excellent outcome as well.

It gave me the vision of a big greasy drummer who would regulate the rowers, with a harsh guttural snarl:<br>PUUUURLLLL! [pause] PUUUURLLLL! [...]<br>And after 3-5 strokes he would switch to a FOX News announcer's voice and recite short quotes from some of the links posted here. Each "announcement" would end with the jingle: "Gnih-Temos Fokniht Ll-Yeht!" followed by grunting, moaning, hissing, and creaking from below as strained knuckles and burning eyes force their little kinetics against thermodynamics.<br><br>I made interesting observations a few days ago when I spent a day in the shrubbery with family. There were lots of plastic bag pieces caught in the shrubs and really diminished the scenery (it is next to a bad place of town). As I have worked with/for plastics for a while I and felt a little restless I thought it would be a good idea to pick some of them up. You could see them for a long distance, and most probably for a few years minimum. It did not take me long at all to get a large bag full of shreds and clear perhaps about a square km (0.4 sq miles) on the way back. In a seriously energy constrained environment I would not expect such plastic trash to last very long (where accessible to humans). On the other hand plastic bags seemed to be able to catch and hold some rain water quite well, so maybe they'll end up becoming part of a catchment system in some places?<br>When I was nearing town again I saw a couple where he also had his hands full of plastic bags. I grinned and offered to stuff his shreds in my bags. As I came closer I saw she did not carry any plastic and both weren't "dressed for the shrub". Then I understood she was the parole officer and he was doing punitive community service. I may have been as well, I guess.<br><br><a href=#c8634568256414341150 title="comment permalink">4/5/15, 3:26 PM</a><br><br>

You have to remember that at that time, the very suggestion of any need whatsoever for any action or change at all was considered negative, if not down right anti-American.

His poll numbers actually went up after the speech, but they were very low to begin with. His energy policies were not unpopular, but most of everything else he was doing was. Energy was not the most important issue to most Americans, it was the economy, and that’s why Carter lost in 1980. Plus, the social and political trends had been moving to the right for years. <br><br>For a quick and easy read on the politico-cultural history of the time I recommend: “Mad as Hell: The Crisis of the 1970s and the Rise of the Populist Right” by Dominic Sandbrook. If your library doesn’t have it ask them to do an interlibrary loan. I was there in the ‘70’s and I think this book is a pretty accurate take on the era.<br><br><a href=#c6563435382764765107 title="comment permalink">4/6/15, 8:54 PM</a><br><br>

Instead, they are seed bearers. The High priestess had ordered copies made of their cornerstone sacred scrolls. Once the Sign comes in sight, she put one adept - no matter how novice or under-qualified - in a different boat, with a set of foundational copies, and a bunch of other important documents that were not copied due to time/resources limitations.<br><br>So, each one sails in a different direction, in the hope that at least a few will reach a relatively safe harbor. Once preservation is no longer an issue, eventual reconstruction will ensue - though most likely it will be in the hands of other peoples not directly linked to Atlantean culture.<br><br>The point was never to save themselves, it was to preserve their lore and their living traditions for the future generations. Of course, a humble sailor in the row bench is entitled to care little about those precious scrolls, as long as he keeps rowing hard and fast. And perhaps even the High priestess will prefer to not get swallowed by the waves - maybe more than what she likes to admit to herself. But I don't picture anyone there as motivated to reach some fantasy promised land where they will get forever after to merrily mock the ones that stayed behind.<br><br><a href=#c8123777175613779963 title="comment permalink">4/8/15, 1:32 PM</a><br><br>

Noah, in this version, pursues his vision of destruction for a decade or so, with very little encouragement. The sea does not creep up on them to hurry them along.

In the face of impeding chaos, the farsighted Hari Seldon establishes an "encyclopedia foundation" on the edge of the galaxy. They cannot flee their galaxy, but they can find a quiet backwater to settle. And then the second foundation is also established right in the heart of the old empire.
