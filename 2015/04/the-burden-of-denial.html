<div class=MsoNormal>
It occurred to me the other day that quite a few of the odder features of contemporary American culture make perfect sense if you assume that everybody knows exactly what’s wrong and what’s coming as our society rushes, pedal to the metal, toward its face-first collision with the brick wall of the future. It’s not that they don’t get it; they get it all too clearly, and they just wish that those of us on the fringes would quit reminding them of the imminent impact, so they can spend whatever time they’ve got left in as close to a state of blissful indifference as they can possibly manage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I grant that this realization probably had a lot to do with the context in which it came to me. I was sitting in a restaurant, as it happens, with a vanload of fellow Freemasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>We’d carpooled down to Baltimore, some of us to receive one of the higher degrees of Masonry and the rest to help with the ritual work, and we stopped for dinner on the way back home. I’ll spare you the name of the place we went; it was one of those currently fashionable beer-and-burger joints where the waitresses have all been outfitted with skirts almost long enough to cover their underwear, bare midriffs, and the sort of push-up bras that made them look uncomfortably like inflatable dolls—an impression that their too obviously scripted jiggle-and-smile routines did nothing to dispell. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, that wasn’t the thing that made the restaurant memorable. It was the fact that every wall in the place had television screens on it. By this I don’t mean that there was one screen per wall; I mean that they were lined up side by side right next to each other, covering the upper part of every single wall in the place, so that you couldn’t raise your eyes above head level without looking at one. They were all over the interior partitions of the place, too. There must have been forty of them in one not too large restaurant, each one blaring something different into the thick air, while loud syrupy music spattered down on us from speakers on the ceiling and the waitresses smiled mirthlessly and went through their routines. My burger and fries were tolerably good, and two tall glasses of Guinness will do much to ameliorate even so charmless a situation; still, I was glad to get back on the road. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The thing I’d point out is that all this is quite recent. Not that many years ago, it was tolerably rare to see a TV screen in an American restaurant, and even those bars that had a television on the premises for the sake of football season generally had the grace to leave the thing off the rest of the time. Within the last decade, I’ve watched televisions sprout in restaurants and pubs I used to enjoy, for all the world like buboes on the body of a plague victim: first one screen, then several, then one on each wall, then metastatizing across the remaining space. Meanwhile, along the same lines, people who used to go to coffee shops and the like to read the papers, talk with other patrons, or do anything else you care to name are now sitting in the same coffee shops in total silence, hunched over their allegedly smart phones like so many scowling gargoyles on the walls of a medieval cathedral. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yes, there were people in the restaurant crouched in the gargoyle pose over their allegedly smart phones, too, and that probably also had something to do with my realization that evening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It so happens that the evening before my Baltimore trip, I’d recorded a podcast interview with Chris Martenson on his Peak Prosperity show, and he’d described to me a curious response he’d been fielding from people who attended his talks on the end of the industrial age and the unwelcome consequences thereof. He called it “the iPhone moment”—the point at which any number of people in the audience pulled that particular technological toy out of their jacket pockets and waved it at him, insisting that its mere existence somehow disproved everything he was saying. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You’ve got to admit, as modern superstitions go, this one is pretty spectacular.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Let’s take a moment to look at it rationally. Do iPhones produce energy? Nope. Will they refill our rapidly depleting oil and gas wells, restock the ravaged oceans with fish, or restore the vanishing topsoil from the world’s<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>fields? Of course not. Will they suck carbon dioxide from the sky, get rid of the vast mats of floating plastic that clog the seas, or do something about the steadily increasing stockpiles of nuclear waste that are going to sicken and kill people for the next quarter of a million years unless the waste gets put someplace safe—if there is anywhere safe to put it at all? Not a chance. As a response to any of the predicaments that are driving the crisis of our age, iPhones are at best irrelevant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since they consume energy and resources, and the sprawling technosystems that make them function consume energy and resources at a rate orders of magnitude greater, they’re part of the problem, not any sort of a solution</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course the people waving their iPhones at Chris Martenson aren’t thinking about any of these things. A good case could be made that they’re not actually thinking at all. Their reasoning, if you want to call it that, seems to be that the existence of iPhones proves that progress is still happening, and this in turn somehow proves that progress will inevitably bail us out from the impacts of every one of the predicaments we face. To call this magical thinking is an insult to honest sorcerers; rather, it’s another example of the <a href=../../2012/12/last-weeks-post-here-on-archdruidreport.html>arbitrary linkage of verbal noises to emotional reactions</a> that all too often passes for thinking in today’s America. Readers of classic science fiction may find all this weirdly reminiscent of a scene from some edgily updated version of H.G. Wells’ <i>The Island of Doctor Moreau</i>: “Not to doubt Progress: that is the Law. Are we not Men?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Seen from a certain perspective, though, there’s a definite if unmentionable logic to “the iPhone moment,” and it has much in common with the metastatic spread of television screens across pubs and restaurants in recent years. These allegedly smart phones don’t do anything to fix the rising spiral of problems besetting industrial civilization, but they make it easier for people to distract themselves from those problems for a little while longer. That, I’d like to suggest, is also what’s driving the metastasis of television screens in the places that people used to go to enjoy a meal, a beer, or a cup of coffee and each other’s company. These days, that latter’s too risky; somebody might mention a friend who lost his job and can’t get another one, a spouse who gets sicker with each overpriced prescription the medical industry pushes on her, a kid who didn’t come back from Afghanistan, or the like, and then it’s right back to the reality that everyone’s trying to avoid. It’s much easier to sit there in silence staring at little colored pictures on a glass screen, from which all such troubles have been excluded. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of course that habit has its own downsides. To begin with, those who are busy staring at the screens have to know, on some level, that sooner or later it’s going to be their turn to lose their jobs, or have their health permanently wrecked by the side effects their doctors didn’t get around to telling them about, or have their kids fail to come back from whatever America’s war du jour happens to be just then, or the like. That’s why so many people these days put so much effort into insisting as loudly as possible that the poor and vulnerable are to blame for their plight. The people who say this know perfectly well that it’s not true, but repeating such claims over and over again is the only defense they’ve got against the bitter awareness that their jobs, their health, and their lives or those of the people they care about could all too easily be next on the chopping block. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What makes this all the more difficult for most Americans to face is that none of these events are happening in a vacuum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They’re part of a broader process, the decline and fall of modern industrial society in general and the United States of America in particular. Outside the narrowing circles of the well-to-do, standards of living for most Americans have been declining since the 1970s, along with standards of education, public health, and most of the other things that make for a prosperous and stable society. Today, a nation that once put human bootprints on the Moon can’t afford to maintain its roads and bridges or keep its cities from falling into ruin. Hiding from that reality in an imaginary world projected onto glass screens may be comforting in the short term; the mere fact that realities don’t go away just because they’re ignored does nothing to make this choice any less tempting. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s more, the world into which that broader process of decline is bringing us is not one in which staring at little colored pictures on a glass screen will count for much. Quite the contrary, it promises to be a world in which raw survival, among other things, will depend on having achieved at least a basic mastery of one or more of a very different range of skills. There’s no particular mystery about those latter skills; they were, in point of fact, the standard set of basic human survival skills for thousands of years before those glass screens were invented, and they’ll still be in common use when the last of the glass screens has weathered away into sand; but they have to be learned and practiced before they’re needed, and there may not be all that much time left to learn and practice them before hard necessity comes knocking at the door. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I think a great many people who claim that everything’s fine are perfectly aware of all this. They know what the score is; it’s doing something about it that’s the difficulty, because taking meaningful action at this very late stage of the game runs headlong into at least two massive obstacles. One of them is practical in nature, the other psychological, and human nature being what it is, the psychological dimension is far and away the most difficult of the two. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s deal with the practicalities first. The non-negotiable foundation of any meaningful response to the crisis of our time, as I’ve pointed out more than once here, can be summed up conveniently with the acronym L.E.S.S.—that is, Less Energy, Stuff, and Stimulation. We are all going to have much less of these things at our disposal in the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Using less of them now frees up time, money, and other resources that can be used to get ready for the inevitable transformations. It also makes for decreased dependence on systems and resources that in many cases are already beginning to fail, and in any case will not be there indefinitely in a future of hard limits and inevitable scarcities. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On the other hand, using L.E.S.S. flies in the face of two powerful forces in contemporary culture. The first is the ongoing barrage of advertising meant to convince people that they can’t possibly be happy without the latest time-, energy-, and resource-wasting trinket that corporate interests want to push on them. The second is the stark shivering terror that seizes most Americans at the thought that anybody might think that they’re poorer than they actually are. Americans like to think of themselves as proud individualists, but like so many elements of the American self-image, that’s an absurd fiction; these days, as a rule, Americans are meek conformists who shudder with horror at the thought that they might be caught straying in the least particular from whatever other people expect of them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s what lies behind the horrified response that comes up the moment someone suggests that using L.E.S.S. might be a meaningful part of our response to the crises of our age. When people go around insisting that not buying into the latest overhyped and overpriced lump of technogarbage is tantamount to going back to the caves—and yes, I field such claims quite regularly—you can tell that what’s going on in their minds has nothing to do with the realities of the situation and everything to do with stark unreasoning fear. Point out that a mere thirty years ago, people got along just fine without email and the internet, and you’re likely to get an even more frantic and abusive reaction, precisely because your listener knows you’re right and can’t deal with the implications. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is where we get into the psychological dimension. What James Howard Kunstler has usefully termed the psychology of previous investment is a massive cultural force in today’s America. The predicaments we face today are in very large part the product of a long series of really bad decisions that were made over the last four decades or so. Most Americans, even those who had little to do with making those decisions, enthusiastically applauded them, and treated those who didn’t with no small amount of abuse and contempt. Admitting just how misguided those decisions turned out to be thus requires a willingness to eat crow that isn’t exactly common among Americans these days. Thus there’s a strong temptation to double down on the bad decisions, wave those iPhones in the air, and put a few more television screens on the walls to keep the cognitive dissonance at bay for a little while longer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That temptation isn’t an abstract thing. It rises out of the raw emotional anguish woven throughout America’s attempt to avoid looking at the future it’s made for itself. The intensity of that anguish can be measured most precisely, I think, in one small but telling point: the number of people whose final response to the lengthening shadow of the future is, “I hope I’ll be dead before it happens.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Think about those words for a moment. It used to be absolutely standard, and not only in America, for people of every social class below the very rich to work hard, save money, and do without so that their children could have a better life than they had. That parents could say to their own children, “I got mine, Jack; too bad your lives are going to suck,” belonged in the pages of lurid dime novels, not in everyday life. Yet that’s exactly what the words “I hope I’ll be dead before it happens” imply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The destiny that’s overtaking the industrial world isn’t something imposed from outside; it’s not an act of God or nature or callous fate; rather, it’s unfolding with mathematical exactness from the behavior of those who benefit from the existing order of things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It could be ameliorated significantly if those same beneficiaries were to let go of the absurd extravagance that characterizes what passes for a normal life in the modern industrial world these days—it’s just that the act of letting go involves an emotional price that few people are willing to pay. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus I don’t think that anyone says “I hope I’ll be dead before it happens” lightly. I don’t think the people who are consigning their own children and grandchildren to a ghastly future, and placing their last scrap of hope on the prospect that they themselves won’t live to see that future arrive, are making that choice out of heartlessness or malice. The frantic concentration on glass screens, the bizarre attempts to banish unwelcome realities by waving iPhones in their faces, and the other weird behavior patterns that surround American society’s nonresponse to its impending future, are signs of the enormous strain that so many Americans these days are under as they try to keep pretending that nothing is wrong in the teeth of the facts. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Denying a reality that’s staring you in the face is an immensely stressful process, and the stress gets worse as the number of things that have to be excluded from awareness mounts up. These days, that list is getting increasingly long. Look away from the pictures on the glass screens, and the United States is visibly a nation in rapid decline: its cities collapsing, its infrastructure succumbing to decades of malign neglect, its politics mired in corruption and permanent gridlock, its society frayed to breaking, and the natural systems that support its existence passing one tipping point after another and lurching through chaotic transitions. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<a href=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/a-disaster-waiting-to-happen-in-oklahoma-the-link-between-fracking-and-earthquakes-is-causing-alarm-in-an-oilrich-town-10158524.html>Oklahoma has passed California as the most seismically active state in the Union</a> as countless gallons of fracking fluid pumped into deep disposal wells remind us that nothing ever really “goes away.” It’s no wonder that so many shrill voices these days are insisting that nothing is wrong, or that it’s all the fault of some scapegoat or other, or that Jesus or the Space Brothers or somebody will bail us out any day now, or that we’re all going to be wiped out shortly by some colorful Hollywood cataclysm that, please note, is never our fault. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There is, of course, another option. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Over the years since this blog first began to attract an audience, I’ve spoken to quite a few people who broke themselves out of that trap, or were popped out of it willy-nilly by some moment of experience just that little bit too forceful to yield to the exclusionary pressure; many of them have talked about how the initial burst of terror—no, no, you can’t say that, you can’t <i>think</i> that!—gave way to an immense feeling of release and freedom, as the burden of keeping up the pretense dropped away and left them able to face the world in front of them at last. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I suspect, for what it’s worth, that a great many more people are going to be passing through that transformative experience in the years immediately ahead. A majority? Almost certainly not; to judge by historical precedents, the worse things get, the more effort will go into the pretense that nothing is wrong at all, and the majority will cling like grim death to that pretense until it drags them under. That said, a substantial minority might make a different choice: to let go of the burden of denial soon enough to matter, to let themselves plunge through those moments of terror and freedom, and to haul themselves up, shaken but alive, onto the unfamiliar shores of the future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When they get there, there will be plenty of work for them to do. I’ve discussed some of the options in previous posts on this blog, but there’s at least one that hasn’t gotten a detailed examination yet, and it’s one that I’ve come to think may be of crucial importance in the decades ahead. We’ll talk about that next week. </div>

A few things, I'd like to add, if I may:<br><br> I think it could also explain the growing and very noticeable aggression and hostility we non-residents have seen over the past few years. I think I've mentioned that before: As a US expat, living in Hong Kong, almost every encounter with friends, family, businesses, etc., back in the States leaves me with this impression of some nebulous, unidentified rage seething beneath the surface. It feels like everyone is spoiling for a fight. This was not our experience up until about 5 years ago.<br><br>It COULD also (at least partially) explain the recent spate of police abuses that have become fairly prominent on the news. The latest coming from South Carolina looked nothing short of execution; which leaves one to ask, "What was that cop thinking?" "How on earth could he have done that?" Poor training as a cop is not remotely enough of an excuse - poor training as a human being is only faintly plausible. The important point being - he is not alone by a long shot in his actions.<br><br>Sorry for the length of this, but one other strong example I can't get out of my mind is the corporate gutting of the Hostess Baked goods company, again, because what happened there was by far, not an isolated incident in the corporate world. The CEO's and Senior managers purposefully gutting the company (short term gain) rather than follow the well-worn path of running and profiting from, (not astronomical profits, but good profits), or riding a successful, healthy company. <br><br>(This is one article about it, there are many others)<br>http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/hostess-employee-tells-all-about-ceo-guttin<br><br>CUZ- to me it looks like those CEO's and those cops are acting like the end of the world coming. Whatever they do impacting the future doesn't matter, so they're just living for today, whether it's corporate looting or living out some Mad Max us-against-them execution. Neither actions are rational if one has faith that there will be a future.<br><br>This is a very important discussion that must be had. I don't know if it is possible to do anything, but I have to ask: What can we do about it? Community is crucial to us herd-animals, (humans). What can we do about our herd falling to pieces?<br><br>(2 more points, but I think you have a word limit on these comments).<br><br>Again, thanks.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c2054143070031362485 title="comment permalink">4/8/15, 5:27 PM</a><br><br>

How to be cheap would be my best guess as to what is in store for next week. In light of a post you wrote a few years back on the prominence of the salvage economy in the days immediately following the collapse of Empires I have done my best to begin to find ways to utilize would be waste to my advantage. An interesting anecdote on said waste. A couple of weeks ago while volunteering at the local food bank distribution center. I received instruction on what food could be utilized and shipped out and what food was to be put aside for what I was told would be pig food but quite obviously there were going to be no farmers feeding half open cans of vitamin water and ketchup bottles with crack in them to their pigs. At the end of the 4 hr shift an entire pallet of what I would consider completely edible food was to be disposed of due to what would not pass inspection. A bag of rice or beans that had any tear in it was a no go. Presumably they were grown in the bag never having seen the light of day. It was very hard for me as someone who has learned to despise wastefulness so be a part of this madness. The bureaucrats making these rules have obviously never been hungry.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c5692423081921938960 title="comment permalink">4/8/15, 5:40 PM</a><br><br>

This "proof" that the Man will always find a way to fix things, even if the little people get a few less toys, reinforced by family and friends tired of hearing about "the long run" might be just the kind of excuse for people who know better to ignore what appears to many of us as Catabolic Collapse in action around us.

It's bizarrely quiet. We just stare at the screen. Lot's of people, including me have missed our stops because of the distraction. The bus drivers insist they hate it too, but they can't turn them off. <br>Now, I may be imagining this because I can only see trees in this particular forest I am in; but I think people here are generally becoming less polite, less generous, less civil. There may be a causation, not just a correlation in those screens and our public civility. At the least, it is contributing to a downward spiral of our connectedness.<br><br>(ALSO: I would bet donuts to dollars, your scantily clad waitresses would have been more friendly and personable if they were not (literally!) uncomfortably exposed and visually exploited. An air of disdain and a smile that screams "FAKE!" may be their only cover of self protection in their circumstances.<br><br>Lastly: You touched on another facet of this decline that I think is pertinent to note. People who are 'waking up', disengaging from this screen induced torpor are largely doing so because they are in some ways falling through the cracks. One by one, or family by family; we fall through. I think this is the face of the stair-step down decline for most of us. True, there will probably be another Katrina or Fukushima that we aren't prepared for and can't recover from. That will precipitate a huge resounding crash to a big chunk of civilization as a whole.

Hehe!<br><br>The weird thing is that they usually have them displaying an image, but with no sound which I've always thought to be a significant point. I actively avoid places with multiple screens as it is just too distracting – look at the pretty flashy colours! Fortunately, there are still plenty of places that do not have any screens displayed, which is a relief.<br><br>I've often wondered - given where those screens are produced and just how unrealistically cheap they are, whether there is a subtext behind it all. Like it may be possible that these toys which are virtually gifted to us are just considered to be a nice helping hand along the road to histories dustbin - and we (well not all of us) happen to be cheering the helping hand along. It is weird you have to admit.<br><br>Thanks for the new word too: Buboes - sounds very unpleasant. No one wants swollen lymph glands.<br><br>Well most of those smart phones that I've seen have broken screens - which I'm cynical enough to consider as an apparent design feature to boost parts sales - but what do I know? Obtaining more sales from existing customers is always a possible but very risky growth strategy. And what does it say about our society that people jump up and down get very excited by a product that is so easy to break whilst at the same time holding that up that same product as representation of progress? It is all very weird to me.<br><br>If tools here don't road test well or are not able to be easily repaired, they get disposed of or converted into something else. There is no place for a lack of resiliency here.<br><br>The smart phones also distract people from the task at hand and on many occasions I've noticed that people start to look something up on the Internet usually to back up a point that they’re making on conversation and find that they are unable to find what they're looking for, but then repeat the same process over and over again. It is weird and it smells of a sort of intellectual crutch to me. The whole thing is like a giant "neg" and I bet the developers were saying to themselves: "I'll bet they'll buy this easy to break and hard to use product". The last thing I want to receive whilst I'm out for dinner or at the local cafe enjoying a coffee is an email - what an invasion of privacy.

Tomato and tree seed stuff. I also reveal how I can move 1 cubic metre (1.3 cubic yards) of manure in under 30 minutes.

I have often noticed the "denial" you cite and I tend to think of it as "the argument from bad faith". <br><br>At this point I dive into conjecture, but I suspect the motivation for this denial is less from fear of risk or fear of the truth or fear of the future. I think it has more to do with the Straussian "<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_lie#Leo_Strauss rel=nofollow>Noble Lie</a>". Many Americans see and recognize the signs of decline, at least at some unconscious level. But as befits a country founded on Exceptionalism, every single American thinks they're someday going to be the one-in-a-million breakout success, buy their way into some kind of gated community for the wealthy and powerful, and laugh Galt-style while the rest of their countrymen go down in flames. As Steinbeck aptly put it, average Americans to a man "see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires." <br><br>When people of a certain mind-set aid and abet and pass along the "Noble Lie" which the elite uses to maintain its power, then in their minds they become more like the elite by association, and therefore more likely to join it. To a people unaccustomed to systems thinking, the more of their neighbors who fall for the lies and the myths, the better their own chance of success.<br><br>When such a deceitful people sees the lies spread all over their TV screens, smart phones, and entertainment, they can spot the lies easily and it will actually make them feel better about themselves, thinking they're not fooled by something that the stupid proles obviously fall for. Unfortunately -- when everyone is actively promoting propaganda, and fewer and fewer people are actually fooled by it, the net effect is just the same as if the broader society buys into the propaganda wholeheartedly. I don't think the rich and successful are any more likely to hand out lifeboats and champagne to anyone from the steerage class regardless who does and doesn't understand the Noble Lie. I think the America of the future will have certain things in common with the past: if you're not born into wealth and security, and you're not ruthless enough to outright steal it, then your odds of achieving it by hard work are tiny, and your odds of being granted it on a silver platter by means of blatant @$$-kissing to your "betters" are probably even less than that.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c4909410522534413145 title="comment permalink">4/8/15, 6:59 PM</a><br><br>

I simply can’t concentrate on conversations or trains of thought for more than one minute if that type of energy is in the room. I’m not deaf as I can hear thunder 50 miles off, buzzing of beneficial insects six feet away and the sound of my own beating heart(actual function of blood pressure on the inner ear) during the day where I live. <br><br>I fell off the cliff 4 years ago. It was a devastating and emotionally torturous experience. Without money for gas, having failed at an attempt to save my rentals (and retirement) I found myself stranded in the channeled scablands of Eastern WA. Could I have returned to the city over the mountains west of there? Jumped on a plane, left all of my belongings behind and headed back to the north east? Sure I could have. Some of my friends had already begun to distance themselves from lack of contact or perhaps afraid they would catch what I had. Family members were living through their own gradual financial ebbs but supported me emotionally where they were able. <br><br>Instead I woke up. I gathered what no one can take from me; my degree in Environmental Science and Native American Philosophy, my PDC and all of my life’s observations of the world around me. I created my own employment at an organic farm instead of dooming myself to a route 90 off - ramp job and landed a place to stay in exchange for the permaculture knowledge I now have and put to good use. <br><br>Voracious reading, research, and well-designed action now fills the void where distraction and fear based self-soothing consumerism existed. Quietude and critical thinking take the place of endless hours of high profile restaurant work and quacking about the latest greatest gastronomic encounters at parties. Instead of shopping at Nordstrom’s I cut my own hair, chop my own wood, and make my own candles and so on. 800 perennial shrubs and trees have been planted from seeds, cuttings and some crazy Espoma award money that will provide food, medicine, fuel, wind breaks (needed), shade, mulch and native habitat. <br><br>Money is fiat currency. Got it. First 5000 years of Debt. Got it. How Patriarchy and agriculture has shaped the world. Got it. Collapse isn’t linear, but fractal. Got it. How to disappear from the centralized monster. Got it. I’m no longer under the illusion that social security will be there when I need it and no longer interested in aiding and abetting an out of control empire or their bff elite friends. They can have their Earth and eat it to. Good luck with that. <br><br>The ability to Observe, Learn and Implement is worth more than everything I let go of. <br><br>Sheila<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c8605240485635454192 title="comment permalink">4/8/15, 10:31 PM</a><br><br>

That said, I'll have a few things to say about possible futures in a bit. <br><br>Brother K., nah, it was one of the faux-Celtic themed versions. It still had a greasy quality, though as I noted, the food wasn't bad. <br><br>Nano, heh heh heh...<br><br>Jonathan, nah, those are my work clothes. ;-)<br><br>Escape, excellent on both counts. <br><br>Onething, I'm by no means sure I agree with you. Addictions are very often a way of hiding from some deeper problem, and I see that very much in the present case. <br><br>Fudoshin, I spent a year in the runup to the 2012 nonevent running an End of the World of the Week feature to make fun of apocalypse fandom. Of course they ignored it -- though I did field some engagingly furious denunciations when nothing happened that December 21. It was highly entertaining, no question. <br><br>Lynford, the police need an APC because the US is gearing up to fight a domestic insurgency, of course. <br><br>Hal, I'll keep that in mind!<br><br>RepubAnon, exactly. <br><br>Will, well, yes -- it's not hard to tell the difference between those who actually believe in and follow the gospel of Jesus and those who are using their own distortions of it to justify behaviors he condemned in no uncertain terms!<br><br>Vincent, you misunderstand me. It doesn't matter at all who can manufacture how much money -- money is simply a system of tokens. What can't be manufactured at will is real wealth: actual energy, raw materials, labor, and goods and services. That's what's running short at this point, not money. <br><br>Claire, and it's probably not worth pointing that out to her, either...<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c8560603689247985460 title="comment permalink">4/8/15, 10:36 PM</a><br><br>

Reading it, however, I found it noteworthy that a couple of pints of Guinness helped you to ignore all those TV screens. Could it be that by so over-stimulating their customers the business owners are ensuring that the only way out is to soften the experience with alcohol? Kind of like a high-energy wasting version of putting salt on the bar snacks.<br><br>And all those people staring at their iPhones all the time (all over the world) - I think it has less to do with stimulation and everything to do with anaesthesia. They are treated to a never-ending sequence of mildly stimulating tosh (what colour is this dress; Look at this kitten dressed as a dog; such and such celebrity has plot up with some other celebrity ... as well as unimportant emails, status updates, 'news' alerts etc ) and the effect is mesmerising - a bit like lying on your back and watching clouds pass. The end result is probably similar to having a local anaesthetic injected into your cerebral cortex: it doesn't make the world's problems go away but it keeps you in a dreamy state where if the iPhone doesn't mention it then it doesn't exist.<br><br>Incidentally, I have noticed another modern way of dealing with cognitive dissonance: the cult of busyness. When people say they are always busy it's often a subtle way of saying "I don't have time to deal with the concerns that you are raising about the state of the world - I'm too BUSY." There is sometimes the implication that having the time to think about things is an indulgence. It's a neat mental trick, a bit like the one ostriches use when confronted with danger. I've touched on this in my latest <a href=http://22billionenergyslaves.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/busy-as-b-movie.html rel=nofollow>blog post</a> - along with my recent experiences working in the production end of the mind anaesthesia industry.

You see the Iphone's and TV spam is not because these objects hold any material value, it is because they are talismans to ward off the evil demons of collapse and catabolism. There is a great serpent by the name of Ouroboros, who consumes its own tail to stay alive just a bit longer the personified version of catabolism. Much like buddhist papers and flags written with mantras, these talisman's are the cross we hold up to vampires and demons. I can almost envison people holding up their iphones to ward off rust, poverty and unemployment.<br><br>As the cycles continue, I notice that in an age where politics is gridlocked and power so conflicted a diffuse, there is somewhat a cult gaining momentum that only accepts shows of strength and fortitude as anything of consequence. While the average American demonizes Putin mostly due to propoganda, they actually according to polls respect him as a leader more so than the clowns in congress and the white-house. There is an air of envy, when people see leaders who get things done, whatever that may be for better or worse.<br><br>Personally, I have found most twenty somethings, including myself, have abandoned television watching the occasional documentary or series over some service like netflix or the internet. Young people are more likely to use adblockers and be annoyed or immune to advertising. I think these cycles of change are in the pipeline, it will just take later generations dying out for it to take full effect. <br><br>Anyway, I loved reading Twilight's last gleaming, Wealth of Nature and Decline and Fall, wonderful pieces. I am working on After Progress as well. Of course I've seen all these concepts in bits a peices and understood them fairly well, but they take on a new effect when applied in the more coherent and dense a form as a book, such is the way of human memory.<br><br>Best Wishes,<br>Andrew Crews<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c6424804349392371923 title="comment permalink">4/8/15, 10:50 PM</a><br><br>

I especially like the point about younger people being unable to accept that the world can and did indeed run fine before email, cell phones, text messages, and the like. I encountered just the other day someone that was illogically upset when I suggested that email was not a human necessity nor was the internet. That means, in the words I told him, that you do not need a direct line into your home. <br><br>They made many statements about finding work, banking, using their apps, that sounded like hollow, weak, veiled attempts at justifying something that until 5 years ago was considered an unaffordable luxury in many of the fly over states. It still is in many parts, though the government is trying to peg it as a necessity by making children take classes over the web in schools. (One teacher for 5 schools of English classes in Middle school) or insisting they carry only laptops instead of books.<br><br>Whatever happened to the one tv in the entire school that teachers had to reserve a week in advance? What happened to computers being at best an aid in science or computer science, not high tech video game machines you carry around 24/7? <br><br>I'm so glad my children are limited in what gadgets are at their disposal. No tv. One landline. One tablet, which we share. My laptop in my office for work, which I do from home for their sake. That is the extent of their interactions and every piece I secured had to pay for itself in some way. How many Americans could live like that?

As it is, fast-cut flashy TV advertising (and programming) is literally nausea-inducing to me, and very much makes me want to dis-associate myself from the thing being touted.

I have no transcript, so take what I am about to say as a rough approximation.<br><br>A healthy mind depends crucially on integration. The mind is not just the brain, but includes the entire body proper, our gut bacteria, the people we know, and the broader environment. A 'desert island mind' cannot even be imagined, much less implemented.<br><br>The mind is also a complex adaptive system. As such, it shares features with other complex adaptive systems. One of those features is that, to function flexibly, it must be composed of individual components which communicate and interact with other components. (I would call this a pretty good description of Anarchism.) I will just note that while two humans, or a human and a dog, or a human and a domesticated plant can interact and communicate with each other quite well, a human cannot really communicate or interact with a government or a corporation. As we substitute government and corporate bureaucracies, we can expect the complex adaptive system to fail. Siegel said that when the linkages fail, we get either fatal rigidity or chaos. When the linkages work, we have what Siegel called 'integration' and 'health'.<br><br>I'll just remark that 'free trade' is really about the ability of corporations to construct global supply chains with a minimum amount of bother about interacting with anyone or any government.<br><br>So...as we go about abdicating more of our life to bureaucracies and global supply chains, we give fewer and fewer working links in our mind. Is it any wonder that many resort to the kind of burger joints featuring jiggle and TV screens that JMG experienced? Thinking, perhaps, that fake linkages are better than no linkages.<br><br>I suggest that 'freedom' means escaping from BAU and re-learning the art of using the linkages Mother Nature endowed us with.<br><br>Don Stewart<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c6073706154344620776 title="comment permalink">4/9/15, 5:27 AM</a><br><br>

I was channelling Sun Tzu who wrote in the Art of War: "If the enemy be at rest in comfortable quarters, harass him; if he be living in plenty, cut off his supplies; if sitting composedly awaiting attack, cause him to move." What better way than to harass the enemy through large scale distraction and better still they’ll pay for it willingly.<br><br>Wise words indeed and a nice summary of the situation. You may believe that I have some other subtext for looking for some sort of power, people or civilisation to blame for the present predicament and fall of empire, but no, both you and I live in magician states and I feel that other powers are well aware of that circumstance and the attendant weaknesses. And, I don't believe that they would hesitate to take advantage of that weakness.<br><br>I've always suspected that the screens in public places are also happily employed as a pacifying and controlling tool for either the patrons or the public at large - plus it greatly extends the reach of electronic messages into places that people would otherwise be communicating.<br><br>People here this week are describing the effects of the screens, but only hinting at their larger role.

These are all well educated people, but typically, I’m the one who represents, “the Voice of Doom”. When I attempt to turn the usual inane conversation toward something a little bit more substantial (and interesting) such as the galloping corruption in our government (both sides), the dominance of the economy by the Big Four (or is it five?) investment banks, the deterioration in local, regional and national infrastructure or the ongoing crisis in energy, the usual response is basically what I call denial. They are “dimly aware” of the issues but maintain that TPTB will keep everything on more or less an even keel.<br><br>But guess what? I was well aware that my niece who was hosting Easter dinner was running a farm with chickens and all sorts of other good things. But to my wondering ears I was also informed of my nephew’s chicken coop. “An amazing structure that must have set him back $1,000”, according to my nephew-in-law (I like to tell myself that my nephew somehow inherited his skill with wood and hand tools from ME).<br>And most amazingly, my other niece was ALSO raising chickens in HER chicken coop. This niece who is a card carrying member in good standing of the denialist club! <br>Obviously, these people are starting to get it. And they may not be articulating it in casual conversation, but there is NO WAY this group of people would be doing things like this unless they were experiencing growing (and grave) concerns about the future.<br><br>But we expect this, right?

They still refuse to pluck and eviscerate themselves before jumping into the refrigerator. For the chores that will never be fun, there is another aspect: it is WORTH IT! Cooking from scratch, raising our own food, making our own clothing ... some parts are fun and others are a chore, and some leave us sore and aching physically, but all are worth the effort. You just can't buy that sort of satisfaction that results when you have put forth the effort, both physical and mental, and reap the rewards.

I do my best to avoid going to restaurants or places where I'll be around television, but sometimes it's hard to entirely avoid it. It seems that the parlor walls (wall-sized televisions screens) in Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 have become the reality.<br><br>Apart from retreating to my own house or walking into the woods, it bothers me that it's hard to escape the onslaught of screens, especially in places that were traditionally quiet sanctuaries. While I dislike the ubiquity of screens in restaurants, airports, train stations, and government buildings, their intrusion into libraries has caused me the most grief. I can write a long list of ways public libraries have been debased, but I think #1 on my list is the invasion of screen media into the book areas of the library. As someone who works in youth services at a library, my #1 workplace frustration is witnessing how the presence of screen media distracts children and families away from books (no surprise that frustration was articulated in my After Oil 2 story). During certain times of the day at some neighborhood libraries you will not find any children reading books; they will all be on the computers playing video games--often very violent ones with machine gun shooting too. In the Teen Space amidst the books, there is a large screen that is used for showing movies and video games or doing karoake, all library programs. It's ironic to me, that a library, supposedly promoting literacy, does so much to distract people away from books.<br><br>A few months ago, as part of a forum where staff could propose ways to improve our library system, I proposed that we reconfigure all the children's rooms so that the book areas are screen-free environments (&amp; put the computers in a separate section at least), so that families wanting to come for books can more easily do so. I haven't yet gotten a response from the administration if this is an initiative they've decided take on; I should find out soon. But I was pleased that a number of staff agreed with me and thanked me for speaking up; not one staff person voted down my proposal.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c6210900100152763715 title="comment permalink">4/9/15, 7:07 AM</a><br><br>

I kick butt often on my works, but burn out some times, sage advice would be awesome.<br><br>Looking forward to coming post series, one project of mine is gathering a Hedge of Wizards to hedge against some of the uncovered risks of our era. Many people are doubling down on denial, but among the young alot are waking up, but they often lack the emotional tool kit to use the wake up call well. Listening to people on their terms is vital to helping with this; being loved and being listened to feel similar enough that most people don't distinguish them. Remember the screenbound are deeply lonely, much can be done by giving them an ear to chew, in fact I cation that this technique can be too powerful and must be only used with great carefulness.<br><br>On April 21st I will very publicly give up Facebook as a gift to myself, and hopefully to rattle some of my screen bound friends.

Of course, the effect of all this video mediation on children is really ugly. I think the worst of it is fairly subtle, especially true of video games, but the rest of it as well. There is an expectation of rules, intention, discrete and solvable puzzles, fair compensation or reward: in other words, a dream world of human control and progress. My experience is that kids seem uneasy in the face of open ended systems (like reality). When they do take risks, they are stupid risks, but most of the time they are intimidated by a world with sometimes unpredictable consequences. Exposure to the system assumptions of video games, television, social media, impairs their ability to grasp the very different system assumptions of the natural world. My guess is it is far worse than exposure to violence. Not sure I’m doing justice to these thoughts with these words, but my hope is other parents on this blog might be able to improve on the theme.<br><br>So I’ve started a 4H club in town and this weekend we’ve got the kids coming over to learn about sunshine, soil, and plants, to dig around in the garden and compost, visit with the chickens, and plant some tomato seeds to take home.

Irish pub. <br>But, you do what you can with what is available to you, right? :)<br> I agree with you on the TVs. I find myself avoiding some of the more popular 'sports' centric food establishments, because the barrage of blinky lights hinders my ability to enjoy the company. Plus all the environmental noise in the world can't hide bad food and poor service. I rarely have a good experience the few times I go. It's like modern day gladiator games of Rome...only the rabble watching now is expected to pay for the admission price and most of the infrastructure support price, along with the cost of the people that serve them. To put it another way, when you go out you pay for: the overhead costs of the restaurant via the food and beverage mark ups, and the wait staff salaries. Not to mention the tax subsidies you pay out to farmers to keep the base ingredients flowing to the processing plant. And though I can't explain it well, there's a another monetary drain in that the processing companies are enjoying tax breaks and standing up jobs in other countries where labor is cheaper. <br>The audience for the entertainment offered these days has such a short attention spans that multiple games must be presented at one time in order to keep them interested. That adds to the cost of production and requires more people paying into the process in order for it to work. (maybe my logic is off there, feel free to correct me if so). all said, I'm glad you survived your encounter (a good beverage helps).<br><br> Thank you for so patiently pointing out all the ways that we can succumb to the seduction of distraction. I enjoy your fluid descriptions and ability to repeatedly point out that perhaps putting the phone down, turning off the TV and venturing out into reality might actually help you in the long run. I'm going to start reading Peak Prosperity as well - thank you for the introduction!<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c647656910766927516 title="comment permalink">4/9/15, 7:48 AM</a><br><br>

I had encountered something different from the "iPhone response" from my older coworkers and parents, what I will call the "iPhone arrival." That is, that the existence of the iPhone proves we have finally arrived in the future, and that we are living in a science fiction world come to life. That <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TW9j1F9MQk&amp;list=FL4Hh0BPhWV5P8FG5rpFbDHQ&amp;index=28" rel=nofollow>video I encountered</a> was of the Sandaoling open-pit coal mine in China, being operated as of 2013 by steam locomotives. When I told people that their iPhones were really just steampunk devices with the coal-soot output removed from the device to its manufacture in China (for where does the energy used to produce an iPhone come but from the coal those weary scrap-bucket locomotives pull out of the ground?), I was generally written off.<br><br>Now a year later I have an iPhone out of sheer survival, as life in the building design professions calls for ritual sacrifice at the altar of Cilahakrow (to add one to your Atlantean pantheon). There has been a lot of doubling-down on previous investment going on just within the professions, not to mention in the built projects. Even though people struggle daily with the computer technology that is supposed to make their lives easier, they just muddle along without giving it any serious thought - we have to stay competitive, right? Even when that comes at the expense of work-life balance. I inwardly laugh when it is the older managers (who are in the generations criticizing mine for being technology obsessed)who are constantly jumping at their iPhones and interrupting unimportant meetings with underlings to take calls from clients, or having meltdowns when emails aren't responded to quickly enough.<br><br>The considerable sacrifice of a design education makes for considerable willingness to double down on previous personal investment. In the meantime I do what I can to make sure my life is on a path to the Steampunk Future - likely not for civilization at large, but for myself at least.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c8418776084332387817 title="comment permalink">4/9/15, 8:45 AM</a><br><br>

In a nutshell they are basically trying to squash herbal medicine out of existence. And it wasn't that way a year ago. Comfrey is now a bona fide demon. So is eyebright. Both major healing, that's right HEALING, ingredients in one or more of our products. As well as numerous others. Claims of diagnosis, healing, curing, etc, for any disease, disorder, ailment or condition, printed or verbal!, is strictly forbidden without mega-expensive FDA drug testing (think US$10 million to get started).<br><br>It feels really personal! Especially since we felt like we were well-positioned for the future and have already done a proper portion of collapsing at home. Can't they just leave us alone? Poor, disenfranchised, trying like heck to make a living in a non-predatory way? We're fine with all that.

As someone who has just come home from a week caring for my mother, exposed to constant mindless tv for at least 8 hrs/day, I can vehemently support your statement. I have watched more tv than I watched in the past 5 years at least (I don’t own a tv), and it will take weeks to recover. (My mother, personally, is denying/avoiding her final decline; refusing to discuss or think about it). There is <b>nothing</b> on 500 channels that addresses the grim situation we are in, and the theme of the mindless chatter or drama is entitlement (Antiques Roadshow and SharkTank), defensive righteousness (BlueBloods, GoodWife) and just sheer prattle (OMG the daytime talk shows…!!!) Sports are a non-verbal version of the other shows. And don’t even start on the commercials… they are an assault force for the corporate invasion of our lives. I am positive that the average person watching at least 4 hours of this per day is not in their right mind (and I’m speaking as a retired therapist)… there is no way one can watch this (or even have it on and “ignore it”) and still have the ability to look at the world clearly and to think linearly about our problems. And when I saw the proliferation of tvs in the restaurants, I knew they were a symptom of collective illness, also. I resent having to search out an eating place that doesn’t have such nonsense (I take a 91yr old friend out to lunch weekly, and neither of us can have a decent conversation about poetry with the tvs and also music playing!!) <br>Please excuse all the exclamation points, but I have been on 24/7 duty, slept one overnight in 8 days and have only had two nights sleep since… I will be more coherent soon… I hope.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c2862345198666040948 title="comment permalink">4/9/15, 8:58 AM</a><br><br>

L.E.S.S. is an important concept, in fact, it is what I have termed the central organizing principle of the Resistance to the System. To live your life as much as you can, as if the System were irrelevant. This looks different in kind and in degrees for each person. But the concept is simple enough for everyone to follow. I have a TV but no pay service like cable. I have a car but I walk to work daily. I could buy books for an electronic device, but I use the local library. The future looks a lot like New Orleans after Katrina; massive failures but small local victories by people willing to get in a boat and pick people off roofs. I was there 9 days after the hurricane 10 years ago and stayed 2.5 months helping out with a Christian relief organization. Also been to Haiti. Post-Katrina New Orleans reminded me much of Haiti.

That said, the political situation in these parts is quite schizophrenic. On the one hand we have made some significant strides towards building alternative energy infrastructures, subsidizing urban farms and community gardens, encouraging bicycle riding by making it much safer and so on, and the Minneapolis City Council just voted recently to divest from fossil fuels. At the same time we are building a billion dollar, taxpayer funded Vikings stadium (after building a mostly publicly funded Twins stadium and Gophers stadium) over the objection of a majority of voters. Every one I know sees these monstrous things as modern day coliseums that future generations will see and curse as a colossal waste of money and energy. And of course the highways and car dependent suburbs continue to be subsidized. One can feel hopeful or collapse into despair depending on which side you choose to focus on. Perhaps as more and more people face their denial and start doing something about it as the current counter-culture is more people will peel away from the denial culture and join in. Encouraging others through example, i.e. changing the culture by making the transition to a sustainable lifestyle seem like a less frightening prospect than continual denial is key in my view.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c6148959327193309447 title="comment permalink">4/9/15, 9:32 AM</a><br><br>

The bar television is a phenomenon that I have also been observing with horror and amusement. My view is that there are two different things going on here. The first , which mostly takes place in waiting rooms etc, is the distraction motivation which you have nailed in this weeks post. The second ,which mostly takes place in bars and restaurants, is the gravitational pull of the sports marketing machine which has worked it's magic on American Society for the last 30 years. They have convinced people that they have some sort of faux tribal connection to their favorite sports team ( or teams) and are not complete as humans unless they watch said team ( or any other contest which might someday affect their team). This of course is a modern day blend of the Bread and Circuses distraction from the Roman Empire, and sports as the consumption of a brand like soda pop. <br> I know several well meaning bar owners who lament this trend but have had to give in to it or go out of business. One fellow owns two establishments ,within a block of each other,and has several televisions in one and none in the other. These establishments have different themes but equal quality and price of beer and food. When any big sports event is going on, the bar with the T.V.'s is packed and the one without is empty. The sports marketing juggernaut has made sure these "must-watch" events are more and more common and as such are difficult to ignore. <br> A great example of this happended at our Pacific Northwest green wizards meet-up a few weeks back here in Portland. We had arrived early and taken over a large table in a back room of a large brew pub. The room was peacefull and its resident big screen turned off. As the lunch crowd grew several groups of customers arrived to sit at the remaining tables. They stared with horror at the blank television screen, and one of them got up to find a waitperson to rectifiy this disturbing situation. They found someone to turn on the screen and tune it in to the sports event that was more important than spending time with the friends and family they had brought with them. I am sure if there was no TV these people would have gone somewhere else. Luckily there was only one of these screens in a large room and we could easily ignore it, but the juxtaposition of the green wizards with those deep in denial was both comical and frightening.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c4066152483438130983 title="comment permalink">4/9/15, 9:43 AM</a><br><br>

The numbers say that the middle class is doing OK or even improving its lot; middle class families themselves say they're being crushed under economic hobnail boots....The disconnect comes from the different approaches of economists and sociologists to defining the middle class. Economists do it by the numbers, typically defining the middle class as households with income roughly 50% higher and lower than the median....Sociologists, according to {William R. Emmons and Bryan J. Noeth], define the middle class "by evaluating demographic dimensions like race, education, occupation, and status." <br><br>Emmons and Noeth separated families into three groups, all headed by someone at least 40 years old:<br><br>Thrivers, which are families likely to have income and wealth significantly above average in most year and are headed by someone with a two- or four-year college degree who is non-Hispanic white or Asian<br><br>Middle class, which are families likely to have income and wealth near average in most year and are headed by someone who is white or Asian with exactly a high school diploma or black or Hispanic with a two- or four-year college degree<br><br>Stragglers, which are families likely to have income and wealth significantly below average in most years and are headed by someone with no high school diploma of any race or ethnicity and black or Hispanic families with at most a high school diploma<br><br>They combine the approaches and solve the mystery. In effect, they've shifted from defining middle class as merely anyone earning a middle-income to defining the class as a fairly stable demographic group and looking at how it's doing relative to middle income. By defining the middle class demographically, they find that families falling into the murky category of "neither rich nor poor" are under much more crushing economic pressure than the sheer numbers indicate. <br><br>By measuring the income and wealth of each of those groups against the economists' median standard, the authors show exactly what's happened to the economics of American households. The median income of the demographically defined middle class hasn't been as stable since the 1980s as the numbers suggest. It's 16% lower now than it was in 1989; relative to the overall U.S. median, it's down by 21%. To put it another way, the sociologically defined middle-class family ranked at the 55th percentile of U.S. income earners in 1989; by 2013 it had fallen to the 45th percentile. If you're riding in that car, it's a steep drop. The same trend shows up in wealth; the middle class has fallen short by about 24% of overall median wealth since 1989.</i><br><br>http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-why-the-middle-class-is-doing-20150407-column.html<br><br>http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2015/04/the-financial-pressures-of-the-middle-class.html<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c471854594045570753 title="comment permalink">4/9/15, 10:23 AM</a><br><br>

I have not bought one because it is another gadget and because I think people would turn on me like they did on John Savage in Brave New World when he interrupted the soma ration distribution. People might also consider it rude, but so is forcing someone to watch tv. <br><br>I have certainly noticed that people no longer try to deny our current trajectory when I mention the interesting times we live in. But instead they give one of the two responses you mentioned, "hey have you watched x show?" or "I will be dead by then" <br><br>I find it pretty boring when I get together with family and they spend so much time talking about the TV shows they watch and they have little attention span to hear about the things I'm doing in the real world. I admit I still watch a very limited amount of TV online, but the fixation on it amazes me. We watch at most 3 hours per week and even that number seems to be steadily dropping as I lose interest and have other things to do.<br><br>While my wife and I have long felt a feeling of release about not having to buy into the mainstream american lifestyle anymore, it certainly pains me to see family members who are riding for a fall. <br><br>I'm also glad I'm not single. I hear bars are full of people looking at dating, or hookup, apps on their phones. Sometimes to meet people who are in the same bar/club they are in.

I recall thinking how strange, even evil and incomprehensible that sentiment would have sounded to the majority of the world's population.

It seems that the Eastern view could be summed up as "Oh no, not again," with the goal of spiritual development being an escape from the pain of earthly existence.

One was a very similar experience in a sports bar on a date with my wife. It was our first time going to this particular bar, and our last. Every corner of the place was covered in TVs at a million different angles. It was overwhelming, and this is from a fella who enjoys watching the game from time to time. We remarked on it then and our reaction was very similar to JMGs.<br>The second experience had to do with the environmental sustainability office at a workplace of mine. I worked in that office for a time. They recently had an opportunity to get a renovation done, and one of the key elements was the addition of an LCD TV above the entryway with constantly streaming content about their programming. It always struck me as contradictory that a sustainability office would be so interested in consuming electronics and electricity to power it, although seeing it through the lense of L.E.S.S. is even more of an indictment.<br>Finally, someone needs to make a L.E.S.S. infographic that can be spread about the interwebs.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c7174329915523393895 title="comment permalink">4/9/15, 12:37 PM</a><br><br>

And then raised the question of how a woman would respond to the challenge of a quest, and whether that would be different than a man’s response. To which the Archdruid replied, that’s a good question but one “that women will have to answer.”<br><br>I’ve been thinking about that answer for a good while. Now, spurred on by the latest Space Bats challenge and JMG’s story of Atlantis, not to mention Cathy McGuire’s diligence in completing her novel and posting it online, I’ve finally completed my answer in the form of a continuation of that story, which is posted here:<br><br>http://singingdownthelongdecline.blogspot.com/2015/04/a-new-tale-meg.html<br><br>I’ve quoted from the original essay, with proper attribution and links, which I hope JMG will permit.

Check it out on <a href=http://www.meetup.com/The-Archdruid-Report-Study-Group/events/221583290/ rel=nofollow>Meetup</a>.<br><br>I like hearing about the Archdruid living in the world of Hooters (my guess) and smartphones. I usually imagine you in a secluded, old-fashioned homestead in the woods, restricting your contact with mainstream culture to the bare minimum. I think it's important to remain engaged with the mainstream. I think there are many more receptive ears out there than we're inclined to believe. <br><br>But you're right: the urge to deny collapse is strong and pervasive. However, I think what keeps most people chained to the mainstream is emotional dependence. Our social lives seem to be in a much more advanced state of decay than our economy. I used TV and material goods to fill the psychological and spiritual voids encouraged by the mainstream culture. A lot of people seem to be doing the same.<br><br>Ergo, I believe the answer is rebuilding community, to provide for our psychological and spiritual needs, thereby eliminating our emotional reliance on the American Dream of mindless consumerism.<br><br>I'm still trying to overcome the need for my parents' approval of my occupation. They still have a lot of faith in Progress, which makes them less-than-thrilled about my interest in organic farming. Unfortunately, I've lost touch with the friends who would've been most supportive of that career choice, but the friends I have now are still pretty supportive of that. I'm trying to make friends with people who are interested in sustainability. Luckily, I'm an amateur playwright and comedian, and you can't swing a dead cat in those scenes without taking out a dozen or so like-minded folks.

It is a gift to others to be in balance and caring for oneself as much as possible. I’m sure there’s a significant reason that our modern culture sees true self-care as “selfish”.

Your kids will grow up knowing how to use their own brains without electronic assistance -- rather a useful skill, all things considered.<br><br>Raven, nicely put!<br><br>Evodevo, try it sometime. You'll be impressed by how fast they'll change the subject. <br><br>Christopher, good gods. Okay, that's well into self-parody territory!<br><br>Marc, agreed. It's going to be harsh. <br><br>Aunteater, my guess is that most people will be frantically tapping at an assortment of blank screens, trying to get something to happen, until the night closes in around them once and for all. <br><br>Matt, glad to hear it. The next step is to fling the screen out the window, you know!<br><br>Karim, thank you and I'll be glad to accept one! Put it down to a taste for old-fashioned pulp fantasy fiction, where the cliffhanger was an essential part of the story. As for spoilers, mum's the word...<br><br>Don, that's fascinating. I'll have to see if Siegel has published any of this in print formats; it sounds worth following up on. <br><br>Cherokee, of course rising powers will take advantage of the weaknesses of the US and its allies. The question is simply who's going to exploit which weakness in what way. Me, I wonder how many Chinese electronic components have been rigged with little internal self-destruct switches, or the like, so that they go dead on command -- and how many of those components are currently installed in the military technology of the US and its allies...<br><br>Ozquoll, that must have been eerie. It would make a great painting -- an assortment of people standing apart from one another, their faces lit from below by their allegedly smart phones, the expressions of lost souls on their faces, all against an evening landscape and a darkening sky.<br><br>Justin, I trust you can keep it hidden while using it. Being lynched by a restaurant full of people who are desperately trying to avoid thinking about their lives and the future doesn't sound like fun to me. <br><br>Fred, that's very good to hear.

By less "stuff", I tacitly mean those who have less due to their income levels being toward the bottom echelon of normal.<br><br>I have an entire family who went "back to the boonies" near my farm. It was precipitated by one child losing their job and nowhere to live at the means they had. Thus they bought a small trailer and moved it onto some property, via a 99 year lease, owned by other family members. No water, no sewer, no electricity. They got electric, but boost it with tiny solar. Water is hauled in weekly and sewer was recently installed with pickaxes and shovels. Their outgo is minimal, increasing their income. Their luxury is no noise, no television (save weekly Redbox binges), stars all around, and progressively better living conditions as they develop what they need.<br><br>Formerly, this pair were working IT and in insurance (AIG), got burned and when government assistance ran out, decided to do what they needed to do. Their 2 kids are thriving in this environment.<br><br>Item 2 is that the younger seem to be either aware that the future will change drastically, or else in complete denial and drinking the kool-aid pouring from the TV and internet. There are very few that do not fall into these two categories from what I have experienced in the last 10 years. The latter appear to be prominent Iphone waivers and believe in transhumanism and other such rubbish. <br><br>There are small groups of aware 20-somethings banding together and figuring out what to do to in order to deal with a life not-so-easy. They discuss possibilities, and are honestly shunned by the other segment of their peers, those bathing in the elixir of digitized distractions.<br><br>I have one group working on my farm building with me, and recently another guy bought property down the road, and his 20-somethings and friends are colluding, going as far as borrowing ideas and equipment from my group. But all are trying to live simpler and closer to an older normal - the land and the seasons and no 'daylight savings time'.<br><br>I have both groups within my offspring, and those that are working on the farm are actively aware that their brother and sister are likely to show up hat-in-hand sometime in the future. They will be met with open arms and opportunity - and a few told-you-so's...<br><br>Again, just my own observations but I think that some of us elders (with remembrances of low energy ways due to poverty) and the 20-somethings are forging on down the slope effectively. It is the 30-40 somethings that I am not seeing and who seem to be very "butt-hurt" (per my 20-something) about their lot and in extreme denial of a viable future. <br><br>Not to say this is all encompassing - just something we all discussed and seemed to have observed during a ride to the farm last week.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c6073797242383058522 title="comment permalink">4/9/15, 5:38 PM</a><br><br>

Exposure to the system assumptions of video games, television, social media, impairs their ability to grasp the very different system assumptions of the natural world…."<br><br>Yes! I totally get that. As a primary school art TA, that 'touch-screen' expectation of how the physical world works is by far, my students' biggest handicap and has become what we primarily teach to overcome. Our art instruction has increasingly become more 'crafts' than 'arts' because that hands-on, tangible materials-manipulation, (everyday physics) seems to be where the real gap in their capability is. <br><br>Clearest example: In our lesson plan, every year group must have at least 1 sewing project. Almost none, (300 kids, aged 5 to 12) knew how a knot is tied, let alone how to do it themselves - just the basic mechanics of it. They would put it on the table, touch the thread to the needle and look at it, then look to me and ask, "Why is it not working?" <br><br>I find myself saying constantly, "See? It doesn't do it by itself. You have to MAKE it happen. Yes, it's more work, but the good news is - when YOU make it happen, you can make ANYTHING out of it!" This goes for every material we use; clay, paper, fabrics.... Most have never played with play-dough or made paper airplanes. They've never been allowed to handle any sharp object, including a sewing needle. IMHO, our once-a-week instruction is not enough.<br><br>You're right, this is cause for GREAT concern.<br><br>Ironically; I think this is an affliction that affects wealthier kids / schools, like ours, far more than poor ones who can't afford the technology. <br><br>The good news is: Some get it and for those; I can't shoo them out of the art room with a stick at every single break, lunch, 5-minute free time… They can't get enough of 'making stuff' happen. (I don't shoo them, actually - I love it). <br><br>If you work with kids, IMHO, THIS is the new challenge: To integrate into your projects or lessons: hands-on, tangible, everyday physics. Play-dough, paper-airplanes, spit-balls. <br><br>HA! Who-ever would'a thunk!?<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c1767708333333346377 title="comment permalink">4/9/15, 7:13 PM</a><br><br>

Every year, more and more Americans stop seeking mainstream medical care and go to herbalists, acupuncturists, and the like, where they can get care that actually helps them feel better and get well at a price that makes any kind of sense. The whole point of Obamacare was to force people to pay for the mainstream medical industry whether they wanted to use it or not, and even that isn't doing the job. Yes, there'll be all kinds of draconian attempts to force people to pay prices they can't afford for "health management" that just makes them sicker, and to shut off access to the alternatives -- but I don't expect that to last long. Fly under the radar as much as you can, and you should be okay. <br><br>Cathy, I think the fact that you're reading this post rather than simply stumbling off to sleep counts as heroic dedication. Sweet dreams, and don't worry about the exclamation points!<br><br>Dr. Kris, you're most welcome, and thank you. <br><br>Sean, just one of the services I offer. ;-)<br><br>David, I found that out a long time ago -- I have plenty of Christian friends. <br><br>Goldmund, I find it easier to laugh at the absurdities of contemporary life by taking the long view, and remembering what those stadiums are going to look like in fifty years or so. <br><br>Dammerung, quite the contrary. For something like the Butlerian Carnival to thrive, it's got to start small, with individuals embracing the role of early adopters and spreading from there. I'll be discussing this in more detail shortly. <br><br>Clay, of course -- the bar and restaurant owners are simply giving the public what it wants, which in this case is something to numb them into insensibility. <br><br>Leo, best of luck!<br><br>Varun, that's an interesting point. It would be worth doing a detailed survey, but it does look as though modern industrial society puts more resources into allowing its inmates to sink into a drug-sodden coma than any other society in history. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, did you think that any of the screens in the restaurants over here show the news? If so, permit me to disillusion you. They show everything but -- and our TV news isn't news any more, except to the same extent that Pravda in the Soviet Union's heyday was news. (I sometimes think that when the Soviet Union broke up, all the people who used to write those giddily counterfactual propaganda pieces for Pravda all came to the US and now work for our media.)<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c8913382220952746678 title="comment permalink">4/9/15, 7:17 PM</a><br><br>

I tend to avoid them. <br><br>Rita, fortunately, the New Age is not representative of Western spirituality in general. What I've seen in Western traditions that embrace reincarnation is something closer to "Okay, if I can deal constructively with what's on my plate in this life, I can move on to something a notch or two more interesting the next time around" -- which seems quite sensible to me, certainly. <br><br>Matthew, do you know how to make infographics? I don't...<br><br>Pantagruel7, delighted to hear it. <br><br>Zach, not at all. Magic is the art of causing change in consciousness in accordance with will.

A very large part of my job -- one of the places, in fact, that my job overlaps with that of Gandalf, Radagast, et al. -- consists of challenging people in ways that get them to rise to their potential; it's always good to see when such a challenge gets taken up, and capably, too. <br><br>Mickey, nah, I live in a brick house on a little lot in a small city in the Appalachians, fifteen minute's walk from downtown and about the same distance from the nearest woods of any size.

Yes, distractions are everywhere even when you're not looking for them, yes, people are trying hard not to notice (some are, anyway). If the ancients are to be believed, you can try not to notice, but it just doesn't work. La-la-la! Doesn't work. Yes, the way forward is to recollect (pun intended) how it used-to-was. But I haven't noticed a lot of comments about not getting too wrapped up in a critique of what everyone else everywhere seems to be doing, but to "cultiver vos jardin" (hoe your own garden). And to try to show some compassion for the usually overwhelmed-beyond-crazy people around us. <br><br>And no, a lot of us aren't likely to make it, skills or no skills. Depends on the speed and intensity of chaos and collapse in part. <br><br>Me, I've no children and few reliable friends, and I'm a bit older. Have been working on the building community part for some years now, and its hard work! You can't be looking at the effort/reward ratio, or you might give up in despair. If it's good to be there and doing what you do, that might have to be good enough, I think. We get so awfully ambitious! Maybe more "step by step catchee monkee" (quote from "Kim") is called for. Even though getting free is urgent! Make haste slowly, another bit of advice from the middle ages. Works for me, but then I'm the sort who gets hurt badly (physically not least) when I try to make haste any other way!<br><br>I think the expression "I hope I'm dead" really means "I can't get there from here," or "I'm in despair," or "What?" At a certain level of extremity, thinking beyond the present, even to consider one's children, isn't happening. I think it's a measure of the desperation of people that they say this. Concentration camp feelings, I think.<br><br>When the lights do go out, everything being equal (as a commenter who went to Nawlins and Haiti to help noted in this thread) a lot of good stuff happens, human-wise, despite all the other lot-of-awful stuff (human-wise and materially).<br><br>My point? You can emulate Yeats' poem if you've the energy and inclination, and "rage, rage, against the dying of the light," or you can sit down, quiet down, and reach out to your neighbor and yourself on the spot. I don't know. I'm sure there's a lot of love and compassion among the readers here, but tonight I just was feeling/seeing everything else, with a few exceptions. Maybe just me feeling sad and not noticing. Corragio!<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c5681570487155847437 title="comment permalink">4/9/15, 7:51 PM</a><br><br>

How could one not? Once the city that used to manufacture most of the automobiles in the country (what could be more American than building cars?) goes bankrupt, one must know its all downhill from there economically. <br><br>Certainly there is little sign that this knowing is fully acknowledged or articulated. It is probably registered consciously as more of a vague sense of ill ease for most. One reason it is not fully recognized is that the skills to do so have been deliberately allowed to atrophy. Those who create and sustain the tone of public life in the USA saw it in their favour to lobotomize the nation. <br><br>The TVs and screens everywhere reflect and encourage that dumbing down process. I suspect that if you we not “in tow”, you would not have stayed at the restaurant. I feel sorry for the waitresses. Working at such a place in such a way reduces their sense of themselves. Much the same happens for the regular patrons if there are any. I recall the culture shock of going to a big box cinema some years ago. It was the full body assault on one's senses and values. I expect your experience was much the same but slightly subtler. At least the beer was good! <br><br>And thus the morale is that consumption of alcohol can be a functional response to a dysfunctional situation ... at least in the short term.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c1338316217994247486 title="comment permalink">4/9/15, 8:41 PM</a><br><br>

Other typical dysfunctional and predictable responses are the bog standard trio of anger, bargaining, and depression. Mix in some sustained substance abuse or just a legal addiction (excessive screen time?) and you've got a working way to avoid reality. <br><br>I have soft spot for neurosis i.e. “avoiding real problems in your life by creating and focusing on unreal ones.” Its the thinking man's way not to think! As it has a creative element to it, I think its a step above your more plebeian dysfunctional responses. Of course I'm not looking down my nose at anyone. From each according to their ability to each according to their needs what? We all should be free to spike our individual glass of koolaid however each of us wants. <br><br>OK. More seriously ... L.E.S.S is good. It allows the mental space to comprehend the problem so as to think of actual functional responses as well as frees up financial resources to do something functional. I don't see it as an actual full course of action in itself however; just a good first step. You have given dis-inter-mediation as one practical course of action in other posts. <br><br>I can think of one other general guideline. Situation yourself in that part of the local economy that has legs in the short and medium term. If one produces good and services that are inexpensive and fluff, it may have legs, the recreational drug and entertainment business did well during the great depression. On the other hand, if one's product is expensive and not essential, one is in a very poor position.

It could even be simpler to arrange than that too - critical components that are designed to fail under stress. So many people are specialists these days that they forget about the big picture: Most contracts for that sort of supply contain detailed specifications. The supplier then delivers the product with certificates, someone else bolts them in and it is then long forgotten about... The purchasers rely on the rule of law to enforce the certification, but didn't Sun Tzu say something about applying ruse? And what would the rule of law mean when in such a scenario anyway? <br><br>Just sayin, I wouldn't allow any supplies to come from off shore for military stuff - at all. Seems common sense to me, but other people want to save a buck or two.<br><br>The recent repairs to the steel plate on the 4 year old wood fire box here has had me thinking about such matters as I spoke to a guy down in Tasmania who’s wood heater is over 20 years old, locally made, with local steel and not showing signs of damage. He suggested that a lot of import steel - it is still locally made, just not as cheap as the import steel - has a high percentage of lower grade ore and recycled steel in it's make up.<br><br>And people say the local car manufacturing industry is not worth saving because the imported product is cheaper. They forget about the very serious strategic role that such industries and people involved in them play. During war situations importing stuff is very difficult and imported military hardware would be a massive target.

It was designed and implemented throughout NorthAm during the early 21st before full onset of Catabolic Collapse.

I'll sometimes read something by counter-culture authors from the 60s and 70s who predicted that drug usage would allow people to free their minds to an extent previously thought impossible. And of course entheogens have a long history in many societies.<br>But I personally am not a fan of the usage of illegal drugs and know of a great many people who have been messed up from their use. And even though something like marijuana comparatively harmless, it seems to me that most people I know who use it primarily use it as a tool for mindless escapism, usually paired with watching TV. (I'll admit that I am not sure if my disdain stems from my own snobbish/elitist tendencies rather than anything more legitimate.) Further, in my area heroin abuse is endemic; the library I work at, until recently after we hired more security, overdoses used to be a very routine occurrence. Meanwhile the amount of nonviolent drug offenders who are filling the prisons is staggering...<br>I'm sure I don't have much to offer on the subject that you don't already know, but I would very much be curious to read a post on your thoughts on the matter!<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c5326694631276302170 title="comment permalink">4/10/15, 9:17 AM</a><br><br>

And, we have one of the faux-Celtic breastaurants here in our town, though I’m happy to say that I’ve never been. There are a few older places that seem to have maintained immunity to the TV virus, though, even in many of those music is piped in. In fact, my place of work is located in the downtown of one of the larger LA satellite cities. A few years ago, the city remodeled the downtown outdoor walking mall. As part of this remodel, the new lampposts were fitted with speakers. So now, music blares all along the walking mall from sun up to sun down and beyond (please feel free to work that into the lamppost/gallows motif). Apparently, all of our activities must now be accompanied by a soundtrack. In addition, most mornings, there is a crew “sweeping” up leaves and debris using gas powered leaf blowers. What a lovely greeting as I walk up through the haze of dust, fumes, and noise. Oh happy day!

This week's post was social criticism, so, yes, you're going to see a lot of people being critical of their society. <br><br>Agent Provocateur, good heavens, of course I'd have gone somewhere else if it was my choice. One of the realities of carpooling with fellow Masons is that you get to have lunch in places you might not otherwise ever visit -- which can be a good thing or a really, really awful one, depending. That said, it's useful to check out what's going on in the unreal world where most Americans spend their time -- and, as already noted, the meal wasn't bad and the beer was, well, Guinness. <br><br>Nuku, once again, the line between satire and reality is hard to trace...<br><br>Agent, good. We'll be talking about practical options shortly. <br><br>Onething, Americans are mostly passive from the neck up; they're perfectly willing and able to go places in large numbers and do stupid things, as long as they don't have to think about it. That's a dream come true for the manufacturers of insurgencies, who just have to get them stampeding in the right direction. <br><br>Tony, good question. It must be entertaining, though. <br><br>Cherokee, as far as I can tell, the Australian government has to be assuming that there will never be another shooting war large enough or close enough to interfere with shipping. When that turns out to be wrong -- and it will -- well, I just hope you get along well with your new overlords. <br><br>FiftyNiner, I should do another post on the pace of decline sometime, shouldn't I? The key point will be that the closer you get to the collapse process, the more it breaks up into a fractal landscape of macro-, meso-, and microcollapses at many different rates of speed. That's why so many people have managed to convince themselves that the collapse that's currently under way isn't happening at all -- after all, only a certain fraction of the people they know are permanently out of work, only some bridges and roads are falling apart, etc., etc. That cat is already swinging, but it only has some of its claws out...<br><br>Kyoto, I figure that's why all the hype these days about self-driving cars. That way the people on board don't have to interrupt their time spent staring at screens so they can look at the road!<br><br>Shane, or simply hypocrisy, like the preachers who praise traditional marriage every Sunday morning and go pick up a boy toy at the gay bar in the next county every Saturday night.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c994390306283654305 title="comment permalink">4/10/15, 7:32 PM</a><br><br>

Thing is, a lot of people who get dumped out of the rat race never do catch on; the ability to say "What <i>was</i> I thinking?" is not that common, and worthy of respect. <br><br>Earthworm, excellent! I see a Space Bats story in there...<br><br>Ares, many thanks for the links! The thing Bradbury missed was that a single program still allows too much thought. That's why all the different screens show different programs -- viewers can jump from program to program and keep their nervous systems sufficiently off balance to keep troubling thoughts from ever emerging. <br><br>Ed-M, glad to hear it. I don't imagine you'll have heard of ramps -- they're a wild onion that grows here in Appalachia. We got some from a friend and planted them in the back garden, and they're up this spring, a nice bright green patch of them, over between the comfrey and the Joe Pye weed. So your green onions have a relative waving to them from afar!<br><br>Flagg, stay tuned to that meme. I expect to see it take off in a big way, and for good reasons, in the time immediately before us. <br><br>Mark, hmm! I didn't watch it -- I'd discarded TV by that time -- but it's interesting to hear that the idea was in circulation. <br><br>Charles, I'll consider it. By and large, I'm not impressed by the claim that drugs can have any sort of positive impact on the crisis of our age, even on an individual level; that hypothesis has been tested quite extensively since Timothy Leary's time, and the results are not particularly impressive. <br><br>Blue Sun, that image is spooky. Yes, it does rather catch the national mood, doesn't it? <br><br>Brian, actually, you're a year late -- note the date on the post -- but it's still an interesting study!<br><br>Moshe, comforted a child in pain?

I am not sure if one ever reaches absolutes, but our culture is developing a mindlessness that is reminiscent of Bert's old prophecy.<br>I have the reading material of ten thousand geniuses at my beckon call, but so does everyone, and being mortal beings, with time enough on this Earth to study one or two great minds to their full depths and perhaps if one is a scholar by disposition time enough to know a couple dozen fairly well, this great power has a dark side. Because the more works are available to a culture and the more individualized choice each member has concerning who they study, the less our wisdom paths and experiences overlap. Granted, in the deep past when a culture was limited to a tiny handful of sources, say the Bible and Aristotle, it created something like intellectual inbreeding over time, but to lift an idea from Plato and the Buddha, the opposite of a bad idea is usually a complimentary bad idea.<br>As our access to knowledge has multiplied to give us more sources we have as a culture taken a path opposite of Einsteins prediction, we know nothing about everything. I have read some Plato, but never studied it in-depth because I moved on to Spinoza, Gabran, Carse, Wittgenstein, Nietzsche, Bateson, Goethe, Spengler, Mollison, Franklin, Darwin, Sagan, Stamets, and a dozen other intellectual flings I never got to know that well or called back the next morning.<br>Now through social media the size of thought most often encountered is cut in to a piece slightly smaller than a television commercial. A one liner or quip from anyone rarely gives context, or can guide one back to the lived experience the person developed their thought from. Knowing any stand alone thought ripped from the life and times of its source is as close to knowing nothing as a hand ripped from its body is to death. But we can see these dismembered parts of every thinker you can name quoted automatically on any of the screens that line the walls of public places and the palms of most Americans.<br>The power, called thinking, to see many different claims, experiences, sensation, questions, accusations, explanations, excuses, justifications, hopes, fears, dreams, suppositions, orders, prayers, accounts, reckonings and requests together in a cohesive whole and see each as it relates to its neighbors, and to imagine how they might relate to others is not something that we posses by birth as humans, any more that a person raised in man constructed environments can naturally make sense of the ecological relations of a rain forest. It is developed through encountering and struggling to make coherent sense of complicated thoughts. The fact that our culture has so many things to allow us to avoid this activity, in exchange for sound bites and articles that, though some times long, very often are schulpted to manipulate our feeling more than stimulate our minds is alarming.<br>"Common sense is the most well distributed commodity, because each person is convinced they have an adequate share." some dead dude, and I ain't gonna google who. All of us are sacrificing our potential (which in each case is quite finite, but vastly greater than is commonly actualized) when we let ourselves be split thus.<br><br>How much of why this is can be attributed to the burden of denial? Concerning the collective situation of our society, I would say a respectable minority, concerning the burden of denial generally (including all the other things humans have do deny in the daily life of social primates) most likely a modest majority. Of course measuring proportions of such things is very very tricky, the law of cause and effect is tricky.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c673288316821625794 title="comment permalink">4/10/15, 8:01 PM</a><br><br>

That's what I and a lot of people I knew were doing. I meant to say "30s-40s" instead of 30-40. Gen X'ers. We're a small generation sandwiched between boomers and millennials, and have awkward characteristics of both. Enjoyed the wild times of the 90s, some got good jobs and did well, still won't have good retirements and will be kinda old (I'm going back to the traditional definition of anything over 40 as "over the hill", as I firmly believe collapse will accelerate aging and shake us out of our youth obsession and the lies we tell ourselves about how old we really are) when things really start to fall apart.

For fifty bucks I was not disappointed. We strung up new clothesline in the back yard and I was back in the laundry business. The thing that amazed me was that we immediately realized a $30 to $40 per month savings on the water bill! I plan to take the savings on the water bill and construct an outdoor laundry just off the garage, with washtubs, a hand wringer and scrubbing board, This was the kind of laundry that I first remember my mother having in the 1950's.

The last big collapse bump was the stock market dump in 2008, which was preceded by a huge oil price spike - don't think that was coinkydink - globalism is sensitive to oil price greater than $.03 per ounce (I use oz because oil is highly undervalued relative to what it delivers to society).<br><br>Today's demand destruction is due to QE, which allowed oil guys to attract capital investment by offering 5% return when banks and bonds only offered 3% at best - resulting in massive cash influx from the flood of dark pool money waiting for a chance to earn. The resulting shale oil boom, unsustainable, threw lots of oil into a market in the midst of global deflation (bubble). Now we have excess oil, and declining wages/employment as capital pools up within the .01% group and oil industry downsizes back to pre-shale boom levels.<br><br>Next up is an oil price shock when people finally realize that without $90/BBL oil, we cannot afford to find more - low oil prices are uneconomical for exploration as the cheap finds are long gone. Combining world depletion, even with consumption flat, this spells an eventual ouch...<br><br>Mesocollapse could be seen 10 years back when Wallymart quietly but systematically reduced their China-built product offering. Ostensibly, they widened the aisles in all their stores. Surreptitiously they also ceased carrying many items, while increasing the major throwaway profit items. Why? Chinese prices rose on the back of a rising Yuan...<br><br>Home Depot also curtailed their product offerings, downgraded their lumber offerings and reduced quality while maintaining prices.<br><br>Microcollapse can be seen easily - just drive through any metropolitan area. You will see empty strip centers, empty mall spaces and a dearth of Mom&amp;Pop businesses. Retail space renters DO NOT want Mom&amp;Pop. They want chain stores who accept higher rents, CAMS and other nonsense because it comes out in the wash for big S-corps offshoring their profits. Mom&amp;Pop cannot even open a business without mortgaging their entire life any longer - even with life-mortgaging, it now requires partners or inheritance windfall just to open the doors.<br><br>Technical innovation is displacing many jobs and few are talking about it. But one glaring example is found in grocery stores and bulk hardware stores (Lowes, etc.) - where the self-serve checkout lines now outnumber those with cashiers. Home Depot now closes all save one lane of cashier checkouts after 6pm, forcing the issue.<br><br>Waiting jobs are seeing touch-screens or I-menus curtail even this staid profession in metro cities.<br><br>Fewer low wage jobs are on the horizon - problematic in a service oriented economy.<br><br>The collapse is here, but the Great Unraveling is only visible in the rear-view mirror to those with a 30 or 90 day outlook. Soundbites are insufficient to explain it and those in the media dare not expound on it, while many listening do not have the faculty to comprehend it. <br><br>Slow motion collapse is invisible in a digitally paced world...<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c4532837181870097471 title="comment permalink">4/10/15, 9:40 PM</a><br><br>

They had found a cave under the gnarled roots of a fallen tree, invited me to a tea party of primrose petal bread and river water tea under it, thrown lots of rocks into the river just for the splash, closely examined all sorts of growing things, found a wee stagnant pool full of frogspawn, and seemed content in themselves.

Back in the 19th century, there was very real and serious concern that the Russian navy would pay a visit. The Great White Fleet exerted its muscle here whilst we were still English colonies and we did what we do well: We got them drunk and entertained them. The Japanese bombed Darwin during World War 2 and also just happened to get a mini sub into Sydney harbour. Didn't a small German raider sink the pride of the Australian fleet off the coast of Western Australia, losing all hands on board during World War 2 too?<br><br>Sun Tzu said something about long supply lines, but then Napoleon thought he was above such concerns as well so it is probably a very common error. Such hubris.<br><br>Such short memories too. Meanwhile in today's world, the US is landing 1,000 marines - as they regularly do each year - in Darwin whilst the powers that be in Canberra appear to be agreeing to China's proposed banking arrangements. It must be inordinately stressful for them to say both yes and no at the same time meanwhile filling the media with hot air and posturing – I can only conclude that they are perhaps morally flexible which is hardly surprising given how many of them have a certain professional background predisposed to that particular condition? <br><br>You are doubly correct. We have always had overlords here. It is funny that the powers that be here never consider taking the option of taking a big hit to the national income and standard of living and simply manning up to the challenge of becoming independent (or at least largely independent). My guess is that it will happen eventually - when there is nothing left to take.<br><br>On an altogether more positive note, I finally visited my favourite naked hippy, old school, second hand book shops today looking for both William Catton and Clarke Ashton-Smith books and completely failed to find either which was a real surprise. Even Ursla Le Guin's book mentioned earlier this week wasn't there. All I can say is that your readership is large indeed and perhaps in the future I should move somewhat faster?<br><br>On a positive note, and I believe that you will approve of this - I picked up a 1969 book entitled: Public Speaking and Chairmanship. Well blow me down but there is some serious complexity involved in running a proper and orderly meeting. No wonder all three of the groups that I've been involved with in recent years were a disaster zone on such matters. The rules, guidelines and order are in place as much to protect the group as the members themselves. There is a certain laziness in side stepping such niceties, but it doesn't end up well.<br><br>You'd love this but the book covers various meeting problems for example: Discussion out of control; the side talker; the over talker; the non talker; the grievance airer; and best of all the arguer. I tell you what, I've met a few of all of that lot in my time. Fortunately it also has much discussion about how to combat these individuals (or members maybe a more appropriate description).<br><br>Take that! from the dread pirate Chris - nemesis of all meeting time wasters and wafflers!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c97732967023752300 title="comment permalink">4/11/15, 4:30 AM</a><br><br>

So many months ago I was at a restaurant and also at that same restaurant there also happened to be a bikie gang - now I realise that sounds very dodgy indeed and brings into question my own choices, but I can assure you it was an unusual and unprecedented coincidence. Me, being me, I took the advantage of that opportunity to quietly observe them - no harm in that as long as you don't bring any attention to yourself.<br><br>What was fascinating is that not one of the members and their partners present were on a smart phone (or even displayed one) and they all were existing in the moment and seemed to be largely having a good time.<br><br>So I was reading an article by the very respectable crime journalist John Silvester the other week and spotted this about bikie gangs: <a href=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/the-brutal-truth-there-is-no-outlaw-code-bikie-gangs-are-all-for-money-power-and-fear-20150320-1m2pi4.html rel=nofollow>The brutal truth: there is no outlaw code</a>. I agree with everything the guy wrote as it seemed pretty common sense, but one bit really troubled me as it documented a disengagement of a certain section of the community. I'll repeat the quote here:<br><br>"And yet the publicity generated from police raids by the Echo taskforce has a bizarre side effect.<br><br>Bikie bosses say they have never had so many inquiries from men who want to join, claiming they can't keep up with the demand."<br><br>Chilling stuff as the barbarians are clearly already within the gates.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c588204462781387865 title="comment permalink">4/11/15, 5:18 AM</a><br><br>

Apparently he finally caught wind of the so-called progress the real estate market is making here in New Orleans (inflating a bubble is more like it). Average household income is $35K and the average rent is $1200/mo; average house prices are $300K and for a $100K house the monthly insurance note is as big as the monthly mortgage payment, making the monthly costs for that to be about $1000/mo.

The opening description of the average Victorian stepping out of bed in the morning onto a cold floor in a room where the washbasin might have frozen over, both because textiles, including rugs, were very expensive, and because the social custom even among the wealthy was not to "waste" a fire in a sleeping room, alone provided enough food for thought to justify the purchase price for me. I found myself looking soberly at my closet stuffed full of clothes and thinking of the salvage economy to come, once unlimited textiles in the form of new $5 t shirts stop flowing in. LESS indeed.<br><br>I also watched and enjoyed the BBC shows you mentioned. I found them inspiring in practical ways- am learning to make baskets after seeing it done and thinking, 'I could do that', and teaching kids to make them too- and also useful as an entry point into conversations about LESS with family members who were watching with me.

Our civil service too is a sewer of sloth and indifference. And worse, a kafka-esque maze that serenely inflicts grotesqueries on its citizen-victims. <br><br>Like our Dept of Veteran Affairs making de-limbed Canadian war veterans prove, on an annual basis, that they are still missing the arm or leg they left behind in Afghanistan. Can you imagine? <br><br>So, it won't astonish you that we too see distraction in the political sphere. <br><br>For example, in one of our recent mayoral elections we had a ranting fat-man running against a former government minister. The fat-man vowed to end the corruption and waste that grips city hall. The former minister touted his executive experience. He also happened to be a married gay man who, along with his husband, (both Caucasian) adopted a black baby boy. <br><br>You can see the outlines of where this is going. Guess who the local intelligentsia and establishment supported? Not the ranting fat-man. Stop corruption? Why would the establishment want that? <br><br>The enlightened would claim that sexual orientation was irrelevant. But I'm not very enlightened. I saw it as central to the candidacy, that is, implicitly the shining example of what could be done by a truly progressive society (ie us). All other things being equal, maybe it was. But also very useful, like I said, as a distraction from the opponent's issues. It was an original approach, I'll grant them that. <br><br>Original or no, the intelligentsia miscalculated. The man-in-the-street wasn't having it. Guess who won by a wide margin. You guessed it, the ranting fat-man. <br><br>Do you think the election campaign was a circus? You should have seen the aftermath. You see, the citizenry voted wrong, the establishment couldn't reconcile themselves to the result and so, after the self consoling sneer-fest, set about overturning the election, by hook or by crook. <br><br>Respect for a democratic vote? No chance. End corruption and waste? Not in this life-time. <br><br>You may have heard some stuff about our ex-mayor's excesses. Yeah, well, we have a long tradition of that here. Like, for example, the founding father of this country (Sir John Eh?) and the ex-mayor of Calgary (Ralph). Roaring drunks these guys. Ralph got government business done at his table at the St Louis Tavern. Both men were highly effective. Ralph was later elected Premier of Alberta. No matter.<br><br>Was Rob Ford a drunk? Yes. Did he use crack? You bet. Did he employ a two-bit hood as a driver. Yes. Ford consorted with low-life. Tell me, is drinking fine wine with crooks in five thousand dollar suits any better? <br><br>In the end, was Ford charged with anything, let alone put on trial? Nope, not even after months and torrents of police effort to pin something, anything on him. <br><br>So what about this preening we do about our alleged mercy and compassion? Was there any shown towards Ford with regard to his addictions? Not a stitch, not by the glitterati. He had to be gotten rid of no matter what. Due process? Bollocks. Fairness? Not here. <br><br>This was a Barnum and Bailey affair whose sole object was removing this obese annoyance that threatened to upset the gravy-train. And, with so much money at stake, this obviously couldn't be allowed.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c1909730103501194363 title="comment permalink">4/11/15, 9:47 AM</a><br><br>

Recently Shell gas stations here replaced pumps with units that have advertising/news blaring from LED screens while you pump your gas. Starts playing as soon as you insert your debit card or pay the cashier. It is quite the cacophony when several people gas up, since these digital streams are NOT synchronized and quite loud.<br><br>Within Lowes, there are now screens within departments directing you to other screens for great information about how to repair your widget or perform a task. It is the entire concept of one screen directing you to another within a store filled with supposed 'service employees' that brings my grin. Yet these same employees are oblivious to their pending redundancy, readily evident around them.<br><br>My daughter was with me today buying hinges, etc. I have a flip phone, she has I-phone 6-7(?).

The screens are everywhere - the younger generations buy them, live with them and many love them.<br><br>If we drive about 25 miles, there is still a seriously low tech bar buried in the woods (more tavern, as there are sometimes meals). This bar has no television, no radio - just an old classic jukebox with 45 RPM records that still costs a dime to play. This bar has been there for 35 years, and you will find conversation, argument, seduction and even quietude merely by selecting your seating.<br><br>Found out that this bar is no longer acceptable due to structural deficiencies - the restrooms, doorways and lack of ramps do not support the handicapped. Hence the county has required them to put in these improvements by CERTIFIED and APPROVED county contractors or else shut down. Option B is likely as the costs to upgrade exceed the cost of the building. Surely it makes sense for the 1% handicapped population to have access to 100% of everything?

In medicine, new techniques of prolonging life thrust upon unprepared and unwilling human beings the burden of decision (rather than leaving to luck and microbes the task of 'deciding') when human beings should die.... they also began to give to the living more power to implement the antagonism between themselves and the unborn, antagonism which was being intensified by the age of population pressure. For the whole Western world, the tradition of bestowing upon future generations advantages exceeding those received from the past was becoming inverted. We had become competitors with, rather than benefactors of, our descendants."

In the approximately 30 years of it, I do not think I can recall, ever, not once, seeing a wheelchair bound or obviously handicapped person use a public restroom. Yet there are often 2 stalls. One for the general public, and 1 for the handicapped, which you shouldn't use. I did once know a person of the male persuasion who went about town in a wheelchair. Most of the time handicapped parking spots sit empty, and they are of course the prime real estate. In the case of your bar, it would seem common sense to have some sort of grandfathering law, where old establishments worth less than X dollars would be exempt. I do think that a certain amount of handicapped access esp in new construction is warranted, rather than the old way in which they were totally invisible and not planned for. But I am very sensitive to waste and what I see is a lot of waste.<br>Once size fits all laws are unjust.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c3448990829642345264 title="comment permalink">4/12/15, 10:48 AM</a><br><br>

We had a small garden area, which my fiancé planted with herbs, peppers, tomatoes, etc. She also planted small pots of herbs inside. We had plants stolen, tomatoes eaten off the vine. Once, the landlord had a handyman "tidy up" the garden. I asked him to wait until my fiancé got home, but no, he knew which were herbs and which were weeds...NOT.

It was winter, no Harleys in sight, so once I'd looked around and realized I didn't fit in I said to myself: "Just be cool, finish your beer and saunter out." But to my surprise, I never sensed any hostility, and even had a few more beers while talking to several of the guys. Of course, I behaved myself, and it helped that I'm a blue collar guy who doesn't radiate privilege or pretentiousness. I wouldn't want to forget where I was, though.<br>There was a story on NPR here a few years ago about an FBI agent who went undercover and joined a biker gang. He became so close to these people he eventually considered switching sides. The interesting part was that he had never before experienced the loyalty and empathy he got from the gang. He said the moment he almost decided to quit pretending and really join the gang was when his mother died. The FBI colleagues were sympathetic in a desultory, obligatory way, while the gang members gave their heartfelt comfort. In a modern society where loyalty is absent or at best conditional it's easy to see why gangs would be attractive to some. It seems like a toxic side effect of globalization.<br>I think it is useful to consider how we are going to get along or at least coexist with gangs, especially as growing insecurity makes them so viable.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c3127414141200465171 title="comment permalink">4/12/15, 2:16 PM</a><br><br>

I often recommend your Long Descent book.<br><br>I've not had reason to comment here before - but this post really did resonate! OOH, I doubt that the meritorious behavior on the part of random individuals will forestall the most likely unpleasant aspects of our future. OTOH, it seems complicit not to take some action. As an old retired guy who likes to bicycle and has some spare time, I've partnered with our local county to encourage more people to ride bicycles for recreation instead of more car oriented activates. A very modest idea but I figure anything to reduce motor vehicle use is a start. So, I created a website http://www.bikex.net/ to encourage cycling to visit the many natural attractions and villages in our county. The tourism people have been supportive and the site has had some modest success - even if less than hoped for.<br><br>Recently, I agreed to help someone create a website prototype that had certain features (blog, forum, etc). As the site would only be a technical example, the content was irrelevant. However, I needed a theme to organize my thoughts so I picked my two major biases - cycling and the state of the planet. The latter topic echoing much of what's in your books and blog. I've sent the link for the site http://www.bikex.net/virtue to a number of friends just to get some feedback on how it appeared on their various screens (please don't give up on me here) and incidentally, what did they think about the content. The content, of course, is a direct attack on our car culture and excessive consumption habits (i.e. JMG - LESS).<br><br>The point of my rambling here is the fact that most of my friends are pretty environmentally sensitive and do generally try not to be wasteful - but, with the exception of one friend, the response has been noticeably muted. No one suggested that we really ought to challenge our car culture and promote bicycling as a positive step for using less energy. Brainless motor vehicle usage is obviously the low hanging fruit for cutting fossil fuel consumption. Which supports your contention that most people do understand the problem at some level, but really don't want to face the obvious.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c3999128446956629592 title="comment permalink">4/12/15, 7:41 PM</a><br><br>

It's been pointed out more than once, and rightly, that you don't really know a book until you've read it so often that you can open it at random and know immediately where you are and what stage the plot (in fiction) or the argument (in nonfiction) has reached. <br><br>FiftyNiner, excellent. Yes, that's just one of the technologies that are set up to function as though there are no material limits. <br><br>Oilman2, I suspect that a lot of people are going out of their way not to notice it.

I'm not sure how many American children could figure out what to do without a video game handy...<br><br>Cherokee, Australia could have become a major regional power, but has backed away from that status over and over again, in favor of the status of local lapdog of whatever major power dominates the western Pacific. I'm not at all sure that's a safe strategy in a world in which the Chinese might just as well decide that the best use for Australia is as a consolation prize for the Indonesians. As for the book, excellent! Yes, that's exactly the sort of thing I referenced in an earlier discussion. The real challenge will be getting anyone else to follow the guidelines in the book -- yes, they make for good, effective, pleasant meetings, but they get in the way of all sorts of currently popular power games and passive-aggressive maneuvers, and we can't have that, can we? <br><br>Ed-M, ouch.

It seems you are reaching for the borders of your other blog's dominion with your latest post.<br>Quite incidentally, I have been studying the landscape of my dreams for several years now. Basically, taking notes on paper of my whole dreaming experience.<br>I have always been prone to bouts of microsleep, most probably due to an easily clogged respiratory system, and interestingly, not only have I become better at remembering and piecing together my dreams (or maybe it is just a natural process of maturity in the brain... I don't know) I have also developped very vivid flashes of dreaming which occur in my somnolence state.<br>I was very surprised to discover that entire pieces of dialogues or stories were briefly popping into my mind. This is not schizophreny : I am perfectly aware of what belongs to dreams and what belongs to daydreaming.<br>Om a side note, this is also why sleep deprivation is an effective mode of torture : the more deprived of sleep you are, the harder it becomes to tell apart reality from your inner stories, which involve a lot of what you fear.<br>Again, I do not know if that "shaping of stories" is a natural process or if I have pushed it myself by actively engaging my dream memory. I have also observed that the environment plays out in how I sleep at night : a warmer or colder temperature will yield a slight difference on the length of the stories, on the vividness of the pictures...<br>It has clearly shown me that our brain does not create stories in the same way depending on the external environment or the mental state.<br>If, as I think is the case, human consciousness is in a large part derived from building stories, I believe it is entirely plausible that being exposed to the current landscape of leisurely media has affected not only the content of the inner stories we build, but their nature as well.<br>This is not a scientific reasonning, just an intuitive leap of the imagination, half-analogy half-extrapolation to all the other people who are not me.<br>Basically, we are being prey to a cognitive distortion that has been building pretty insidiously : we think that our level of intelligence has remained the same, because the volume of our thoughts has remained constant over time.<br>But each of the thoughts making up that volume has actually been decreasing in length. The change has been gradual... so we haven't noticed it yet. And the screens make for an easy culprit, since they work by increasing our optical light intake which is known to increase our short-term focus. There may be such a thing as short-term and long-term focus, playing out in how we build inner stories.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c2130312172780747888 title="comment permalink">4/13/15, 7:21 PM</a><br><br>

But as a revelatory insight it would require a participatory set of rituals, to peruse the magickal analogy.<br>And it could be that one of the counterspells might be to "reenchant the world", as Kunstler puts it, that is give more meaning in your landscape by reclaiming somall businesses where you can go walking, etc...<br>Where I live is quite enchanted enough but I can imagine how it might feel to live in the USA. Another counterspell might be to develop rituals that train you to build longer and longer stories.<br>Magickal practice usually involves invocation of some sort. That raises a basic question : how do we invoke longer stories ? My experience from dream recall is that once you have outlined the contents of your night's dreams, you tend to forget some of it along the day and later have to try to remember it more than a few times.<br>I suspect this is where invocatory practices will come in handy : even if the mind is worked upon by exercise, just like you do with your body, the self-suggestion benefit from magickal practices could help a lot.<br>And you could extrapolate that sort of practice to the very ability of building longer, more coherent stories. This is truly a topic for your other blog, as I believe that the effects of global decline will be eloquent enough to inspire us. And just shutting out the screens is usually enough for me that I don't need magick to engage in longer stories... But your mileage may vary.<br>I am not sure of the practical implications. As usual with magickal themes, the real-world implications may be far-reaching on the social or political plane. Therefore its connection with this blog as well.<br>Or it could just be that repetitive, manual chores like housework, performed away from screens or modern sensory inputs, can be a good complement in a balanced mental lifestyle. I noticed flashes of microsleep where I would just get the physical sensation of the body movements after a day of a repeated physical activity that I am not used to practicing.<br>Walking could be one of the "story rituals", and it may be part of the feedback loops which make us conscious.<br>Since even my food intake shapes the way I build stories, I assume that there is a lot to explore there. Inner story-bulding could be an essential tool in dealing with the decline of industrial nations.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c2913204483933927152 title="comment permalink">4/13/15, 7:22 PM</a><br><br>

I do not think at all that you are at the borders of the blog's dominion. If we are to have people with the insights to deal with the many problems that this collapse will bring, somehow our culture has to get rid of this preoccupation with the "waking" manipulations of the "symbols" of our culture and the physical "materials" of it and teach children once again how to dream. Daydreaming and night dreaming are essential to mental health and a sane world.<br>I was trained into the graduate level to be a teacher, but I give thanks everyday that I was not put into a preschool or kindergarten at some ridiculously early age. I think that the play that I engaged in outdoors and the reading that my mother did to me were infinitely more important than anything that could possibly have happened in any preschool classroom.<br><br>It has always been my belief that the violence so prevalent in American life can be linked to the many ways that our industrial society has interrupted the natural diurnal rhythms to which all life on earth adheres.

It is so true. There is a regional supermarket chain that recently built a gigantic, new store. It was on the site of the old one, but of course they couldn't remodel the "old" building; it had been built a whole 30 years ago, obliterating a historic dairy farm with beautiful brick buildings. They built and entirely new structure on the lot, then razed the old one and made parking. There had always been a sit-down deli, but now it was a much bigger room with high ceiling, two stories, maybe more. There were large flat-screens hung on every wall at the second-story level. I stopped counting at 14. The really hilarious thing was that fully half of them were on the same thing, which was Fox News.

But I always lived far away from them and never bonded that well because reasons. I like them, but most of them seem to be pretty clueless about this stuff, just going on with the normal middle-class aspirational things and I don't think I would be able to make them understand what is happening if I tried. Everyone else I know is old. I would like to do something but I don't know what. I grew up on a farm, but my attempts to grow food, etc., have been pathetic failures. I'm pushing 60 and for several reasons I would say the odds of making it to 70 are no better than even.

And there were TV screens in an enormous row above the bar. It was not obvious to me that this was a good thing, but perhaps this explains it: if you're watching a particular screen (e.g., a particular sport/team combination), and you notice someone else focusing their attention at the same screen, then <i>maybe</i> you have enough in common to begin a conversation... especially after a beer or two. Selecting a screen becomes a membership pin, a secret handshake, a device for recognizing Our Kind. Among the mobile atomic fragments of our nuclear families, maybe this is what passes for community. <br><br>Match three screens of interest and compatible sexual orientations, and marriage becomes a possibility, if only for a few years.<br><br>It ain't much, but maybe it's all they've got to work with.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c7466973500346243763 title="comment permalink">4/14/15, 7:03 PM</a><br><br>

Dreams, like every kind of intense experience (including mystical experience), are always reduced enormously if you do this, that is, if you think and remember by means of sentences and words. I'm one of those people who doesn't do this habitually; instead, I think and remember, for the most part, in patterns and networks, textures and other sensations. So I notice how much is lost every time I try to put any memory or any thought into words in order to communicate it to some other person. <br><br>I suspect that anyone can (with practice) learn to remember his or her most profound dreams and waking experiences without using sentences and stories, and can keep these memories alive by deliberately re-calling them to mind. If you store these dreams and experiences up in your mind in this way, then you don't need to write them down. The very process of verbal description destroys the meat within the shells of one's dreamt or lived experiences. If the meat is not destroyed in this way, your experiencse will nourish you more fully.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c7893977445812697 title="comment permalink">4/14/15, 7:14 PM</a><br><br>

Foam earplugs give me ear aches so, for cubicle work (grading papers, entering data on computer, etc I got cheap headphones (with padded rims) simply as a physical barrier. That worked for when I couldn't find a quieter place to work.<br>But what helped in more lasting ways, for me anyway, was to practise Dr. Andrew Weil's prescription for calming breathing (4-7-8). Meaning counting to four while breathing in, counting to seven while holding the breath, counting to eight on the exhale. <br>Persistent practice of this is strange at first-- which showed me how very shallow my breathing had become as a habit. Easing into the discipline of the 4-7-8 rhythm shifted a number of things: my focus, my attention, my body's adrenaline/cortisol response. <br>A second piece that helped a great deal might be an incantation (though he'd likely not call it such) from Eckhart Tolle's book A New Earth. I mean where he speaks of our inner resistance as a hindrance to realizing what else might be going on;as long as you resist, the insight is, you hold on to a particular, now frozen, interpretation of your perceptions. If your ego can let go, you no longer identify your sense of yourself so much with what you thought was true.<br>That leaves openings to see what's really going on, maybe for your coworker, too.<br>Not sure I'm being clear; these are huge topics. <br>Maybe another (related?) way to work with one's perceptions is to keep in mind the idea from martial arts: use the energy of your opponent as you get out of his way?<br>you can't control the other guy or gal. But you can go some distance controlling your breathing, your attention. <br>I have been working on the Sphere of Protection ritual for some weeks ( Thank you, JMG); I did pick up on that message. The neighbors must think it's calesthenics. Just as well: one of the neighbors is an exterminator.) <br>Anyway, as the Weil and Tolle ideas I reference date back to about 2005, I hope you won't mind the mention.<br>Thank you for your kindness. <br>pmg<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c7447991251282477624 title="comment permalink">4/14/15, 9:30 PM</a><br><br>

Pay is down to 10% of base, but enlightening my understanding people in lower pay rungs (now me). <br>In Tech I regularly worked with people from China, India, Africa all without going anywhere. The new job required me to work at many different places well out of walking distance or public transport. 28% of my net income was spent on transport (not counting time). <br>A value thing that most gets me from the people in my new realm is: the devotion/investment in gadget phones and services. Money people on this level spend on this I estimated per interviews to be 10-15% of net. <br>In further conversation with my low income mates to find out reasons for expensive device fetishes and awareness of transport costs I found they had little to no awareness but rather accept auto transport cost. “It is what it is.” Quote from interview. <br>They were flabbergasted that I should even question devotion to the gadget. Most of these people are younger than me and very smart in terms of processing ability but seemed to lack a means to formulate context outside of narrow ranges. <br>I’m due for another change of ladder rung. Fortune smiles as the local hardware store calls to tell me I’m hired. <br>Hourly will drop 7%, offset by a huge raise in net after expenses as transport costs will be little more than an extra bowl of oatmeal per morning plus bike and or shoe wear to cover a 7 mile round trip. <br>Another boon is a tremendous transport time save (est. 10 hrs/wk.) assuming biking. On the minus, I lose employer sponsored healthcare coverage with a $2000 deductible (10% of Gross per year) costing me 8% net wage premium contribution.<br>With the hardware gig /pay reduction, I’m eligible for “Free Healthcare” from government without a deductible. <br>I have always loved hardware stores and look forward to working at one.<br>Viva Evolution!

FPGAs or Fast Programmable Gate Arrays.<br><br>By and large, most complex, custom electronics these days (beyond the digital toaster oven and refrigerator) no longer design and build custom silicon. Rather they use an FPGA chip. The programmable part of the FPGA means that it can be configured into whatever electronic parts a project wants/needs. A tiny processor here, some A/D sensors there, some memory, and so on. This allows the use of an off the shelve chip which can be customized in software, rather than requiring the development of a custom silicon chip; much cheaper and faster for most projects.<br><br>And since it is programmable, the same chip can be used in one gadget one day, and then plugged into another with a new program and serve an entirely different purpose another.<br><br>Certainly FPGAs are fairly high up on the technology curve, at least to make them. But they exist in the millions and can be repurposed into a variety of other things, as long as the level of technology allows for PCs and some folks left who know how to program them.<br><br>I'm not suggesting here that FPGAs are the saviour of electronic gadgetry in a collapsing world. Rather that they may offer a possible intermediate step before we devolve into harvesting used 74xx series electronics from the dumps.<br><br><a href=the-burden-of-denial.html#c8023718680061151045 title="comment permalink">4/18/15, 2:33 PM</a><br><br>
