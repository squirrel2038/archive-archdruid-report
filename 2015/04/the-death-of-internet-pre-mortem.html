The mythic role assigned to progress in today’s popular culture has any number of odd effects, but one of the strangest is the blindness to the downside that clamps down on the collective imagination of our time once people become convinced that something or other is the wave of the future. It doesn’t matter in the least how many or obvious the warning signs are, or how many times the same tawdry drama has been enacted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once some shiny new gimmick gets accepted as the next glorious step in the invincible march of progress, most people lose the ability to imagine that the wave of the future might just do what waves generally do: that is to say, crest, break, and flow back out to sea, leaving debris scattered on the beach in its wake.</div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It so happens that I grew up in the middle of just such a temporary wave of the future, in the south Seattle suburbs in the 1960s, where every third breadwinner worked for Boeing. The wave in question was the supersonic transport, SST for short: a jetliner that would fly faster than sound, cutting hours off long flights. The inevitability of the SST was an article of faith locally, and not just because Boeing was building one; an Anglo-French consortium was in the lead with the Concorde, and the Soviets were working on the Tu-144, but the Boeing 2707 was expected to be the biggest and baddest of them all, a 300-seat swing-wing plane that was going to make commercial supersonic flight an everyday reality. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/boeing-sst-2bc57b-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=204 src=../../img/boeing-sst-2bc57b-320x204-g95.jpg srcset="../../img/boeing-sst-2bc57b-g92.jpg 1.7x" width=320></a></div>
Long before the 2707 had even the most ghostly sort of reality, you could buy model kits of the plane, complete with Pan Am decals, at every hobby store in the greater Seattle area. For that matter, take Interstate 5 south from downtown Seattle past the sprawling Boeing plant just outside of town, and you’d see the image of the 2707 on the wall of one of the huge assembly buildings, a big delta-winged shape in white and gold winging its way through the imagined air toward the gleaming future in which so many people believed back then. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There was, as it happened, a small problem with the 2707, a problem it shared with all the other SST projects; it made no economic sense at all. It was, to be precise, what an earlier post here called<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><a href=../../2014/03/the-crocodiles-of-reality.html>a subsidy dumpster</a>: that is, a project that was technically feasible but economically impractical, and existed mostly as a way to pump government subsidies into Boeing’s coffers. Come 1971, the well ran dry: faced with gloomy numbers from the economists, worried calculations from environmental scientists, and a public not exactly enthusiastic about dozens of sonic booms a day rattling plates and cracking windows around major airports, Congress cut the project’s funding. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/7c19132bf9882c65a9444ddc1a2cf5-193d98-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 src=../../img/7c19132bf9882c65a9444ddc1a2cf5-193d98-g95.jpg></a></div>
That happened right when the US economy generally, and the notoriously cyclical airplane industry in particular, were hitting downturns. Boeing was Seattle’s biggest employer in those days, and when it laid off employees en masse, the result was a local depression of legendary severity. You heard a lot of people in those days insisting that the US had missed out on the next aviation boom, and Congress would have to hang its head in shame once Concordes and Tu-144s were hauling passengers all over the globe. Of course that’s not what happened; the Tu-144 flew a handful of commercial flights and then was grounded for safety reasons, and the Concorde lingered on, a technical triumph but an economic white elephant, until the last plane retired from service in 2003. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All this has been on my mind of late as I’ve considered the future of the internet. The comparison may seem far-fetched, but then that’s what supporters of the SST would have said if anyone had compared the Boeing 2707 to, say, the zeppelin, another wave of the future that turned out to make too little economic sense to matter. Granted, the internet isn’t a subsidy dumpster, and it’s also much more complex than the SST; if anything, it might be compared to the entire system of commercial air travel, which we still have with us or the moment. Nonetheless, a strong case can be made that the internet, like the SST, doesn’t actually make economic sense; it’s being propped up by a set of financial gimmickry with a distinct resemblance to smoke and mirrors; and when those go away—and they will—much of what makes the internet so central a part of pop culture will go away as well. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably necessary to repeat here that the reasons for this are economic, not technical. Every time I’ve discussed the hard economic realities that make the internet’s lifespan in the deindustrial age<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>roughly that of a snowball in Beelzebub’s back yard, I’ve gotten a flurry of responses fixating on purely<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>technical issues. Those issues are beside the point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No doubt it would be possible to make something like the internet technically feasible in a society on the far side of the Long Descent, but that doesn’t matter; what matters is that the internet has to cover its operating costs, and it also has to compete with other ways of doing the things that the internet currently does. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a source of wry amusement to me that so many people seem to have forgotten that the internet doesn’t actually do very much that’s new. Long before the internet, people were reading the news, publishing essays and stories, navigating through unfamiliar neighborhoods, sharing photos of kittens with their friends, ordering products from faraway stores for home delivery, looking at pictures of people with their clothes off, sending anonymous hate-filled messages to unsuspecting recipients, and doing pretty much everything else that they do on the internet today. For the moment, doing these things on the internet is cheaper and more convenient than the alternatives, and that’s what makes the internet so popular. If that changes—if the internet becomes more costly and less convenient than other options—its current popularity is unlikely to last. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s start by looking at the costs. Every time I’ve mentioned the future of the internet on this blog, I’ve gotten comments and emails from readers who think that the price of their monthly internet service is a reasonable measure of the cost of the internet as a whole. For a useful corrective to this delusion, talk to people who work in data centers. You’ll hear about trucks pulling up to the loading dock every single day to offload pallet after pallet of brand new hard drives and other components, to replace those that will burn out that same day. You’ll hear about power bills that would easily cover the electricity costs of a small city. You’ll hear about many other costs as well. Data centers are not cheap to run, there are many thousands of them, and they’re only one part of the vast infrastructure we call the internet: by many measures, the most gargantuan technological project in the history of our species. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Your monthly fee for internet service covers only a small portion of what the internet costs. Where does the rest come from? That depends on which part of the net we’re discussing. The basic structure is paid for by internet service providers (ISPs), who recoup part of the costs from your monthly fee, part from the much larger fees paid by big users, and part by advertising. Content providers use some mix of advertising, pay-to-play service fees, sales of goods and services, packaging and selling your personal data to advertisers and government agencies, and new money from investors and loans to meet their costs. The ISPs routinely make a modest profit on the deal, but many of the content providers do not. Amazon may be the biggest retailer on the planet, for example, and its cash flow has soared in recent years, but its expenses have risen just as fast, and it rarely makes a profit. Many other content provider firms, including fish as big as Twitter, rack up big losses year after year. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
How do they stay in business? A combination of vast amounts of investment money and ultracheap debt. That’s very common in the early decades of a new industry, though it’s been made a good deal easier by the Fed’s policy of next-to-zero interest rates. Investors who dream of buying stock in the next Microsoft provide venture capital for internet startups, banks provide lines of credit for existing firms, the stock and bond markets snap up paper of various kinds churned out by internet businesses, and all that money goes to pay the bills. It’s a reasonable gamble for the investors; they know perfectly well that a great many of the firms they’re funding will go belly up within a few years, but the few that don’t will either be bought up at inflated prices by one of the big dogs of the online world, or will figure out how to make money and then become big dogs themselves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice, though, that this process has an unexpected benefit for ordinary internet users: a great many services are available for free, because venture-capital investors and lines of credit are footing the bill for the time being. Boosting the number of page views and clickthroughs is far more important for the future of an internet company these days than making a profit, and so the usual business plan is to provide plenty of free goodies to the public without worrying about the financial end of things. That’s very convenient just now for internet users, but it fosters the illusion that the internet costs nothing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As mentioned earlier, this sort of thing is very common in the early decades of a new industry. As the industry matures, markets become saturated, startups become considerably riskier, and venture capital heads for greener pastures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once this happens, the companies that dominate the industry have to stay in business the old-fashioned way, by earning a profit, and that means charging as much as the market will bear, monetizing services that are currently free, and cutting service to the lowest level that customers will tolerate. That’s business as usual, and it means the end of most of the noncommercial content that gives the internet so much of its current role in popular culture.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All other things being equal, in other words, the internet can be expected to follow the usual trajectory of a maturing industry, becoming more expensive, less convenient, and more tightly focused on making a quick buck with each passing year. Governments have already begun to tax internet sales, removing one of the core “stealth subsidies” that boosted the internet at the expense of other retail sectors, and taxation of the internet will only increase as cash-starved officials contemplate the tidal waves of money sloshing back and forth online. None of these changes will kill the internet, but they’ll slap limits on the more utopian fantasies currently burbling about the web, and provide major incentives for individuals and businesses to back away from the internet and do things in the real world instead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then there’s the increasingly murky world of online crime, espionage, and warfare, which promises to push very hard in the same direction in the years ahead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I think most people are starting to realize that on the internet, there’s no such thing as secure data, and the costs of conducting business online these days include a growing risk of having your credit cards stolen, your bank accounts looted, your identity borrowed for any number of dubious purposes, and the files on your computer encrypted without your knowledge, so that you can be forced to pay a ransom for their release—this latter, or so I’ve read, is the latest hot new trend in internet crime. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Online crime is one of the few fields of criminal endeavor in which raw cleverness is all you need to make out, as the saying goes, like a bandit. In the years ahead, as a result, the internet may look less like an information superhighway and more like one of those grim inner city streets where not even the muggers go alone. Trends in online espionage and warfare are harder to track, but either or both could become a serious burden on the internet as well. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Online crime, espionage, and warfare aren’t going to kill the internet, any more than the ordinary maturing of the industry will. Rather, they’ll lead to a future in which costs of being online are very often greater than the benefits, and the internet is by and large endured rather than enjoyed. They’ll also help drive the inevitable rebound away from the net. That’s one of those things that always happens and always blindsides the cheerleaders of the latest technology: a few decades into its lifespan, people start to realize that they liked the old technology better, thank you very much, and go back to it. The rebound away from the internet has already begun, and will only become more visible as time goes on, making a great many claims about the future of the internet look as absurd as those 1950s articles insisting that in the future, every restaurant would inevitably be a drive-in. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To be sure, the resurgence of live theater in the wake of the golden age of movie theaters didn’t end cinema, and the revival of bicycling in the aftermath of the automobile didn’t make cars go away. In the same way, the renewal of interest in offline practices and technologies isn’t going to make the internet go away. It’s simply going to accelerate the shift of avant-garde culture away from an increasingly bleak, bland, unsafe, and corporate- and government-controlled internet and into alternative venues. That won’t kill the internet, though once again it will put a stone marked R.I.P. atop the grave of a lot of the utopian fantasies that have clustered around today’s net culture.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All other things being equal, in fact, there’s no reason why the internet couldn’t keep on its present course for years to come. Under those circumstances, it would shed most of the features that make it popular with today’s avant-garde, and become one more centralized, regulated, vacuous mass medium, packed to the bursting point with corporate advertising and lowest-common-denominator content, with dissenting voices and alternative culture shut out or shoved into corners where nobody ever looks. That’s the normal trajectory of an information technology in today’s industrial civilization, after all; it’s what happened with radio and television in their day, as the gaudy and grandiose claims of the early years gave way to the crass commercial realities of the mature forms of each medium. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
But all other things aren’t equal. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Radio and television, like most of the other familiar technologies that define life in a modern industrial society, were born and grew to maturity in an expanding economy. The internet, by contrast, was born during the last great blowoff of the petroleum age—the last decades of the twentieth century, during which the world’s industrial nations took the oil reserves that might have cushioned the transition to sustainability, and blew them instead on one last orgy of over-the-top conspicuous consumption—and it’s coming to maturity in the early years of an age of economic contraction and ecological blowback. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The rising prices, falling service quality, and relentless monetization of a maturing industry, together with the increasing burden of online crime and the inevitable rebound away from internet culture, will thus be hitting the internet in a time when the global economy no longer has the slack it once did, and the immense costs of running the internet in anything like its present form will have to be drawn from a pool of real wealth that has many other demands on it. What’s more, quite a few of those other demands will be far more urgent than the need to provide consumers with a convenient way to send pictures of kittens to their friends. That stark reality will add to the pressure to monetize internet services, and provide incentives to those who choose to send their kitten pictures by other means. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s crucial to remember here, as noted above, that the internet is simply a cheaper and more convenient way of doing things that people were doing long before the first website went live, and a big part of the reason why it’s cheaper and more convenient right now is that internet users are being subsidized by the investors and venture capitalists who are funding the internet industry. That’s not the only subsidy on which the internet depends, though. Along with the rest of industrial society, it’s also subsidized by half a billion years of concentrated solar energy in the form of fossil fuels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As those deplete, the vast inputs of energy, labor, raw materials, industrial products, and other forms of wealth that sustain the internet will become increasingly expensive to provide, and ways of distributing kitten pictures that don’t require the same inputs will prosper in the resulting competition. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are also crucial issues of scale. Most pre-internet communications and information technologies scale down extremely well. A community of relatively modest size can have its own public library, its own small press, its own newspaper, and its own radio station running local programming, and could conceivably keep all of these functioning and useful even if the rest of humanity suddenly vanished from the map. Internet technology doesn’t have that advantage. It’s orders of magnitude more complex and expensive than a radio transmitter, not to mention the 14th-century technology of printing presses and card catalogs; what’s more, on the scale of a small community, the benefits of using internet technology instead of simpler equivalents wouldn’t come close to justifying the vast additional cost. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course the world of the future isn’t going to consist of a single community surrounded by desolate wasteland. That’s one of the reasons why the demise of the internet won’t happen all at once. Telecommunications companies serving some of the more impoverished parts of rural America are already letting their networks in those areas degrade, since income from customers doesn’t cover the costs of maintenance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To my mind, that’s a harbinger of the internet’s future—a future of uneven decline punctuated by local and regional breakdowns, some of which will be fixed for a while. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That said, it’s quite possible that there will still be an internet of some sort fifty years from now. It will connect government agencies, military units, defense contractors, and the handful of universities that survive the approaching implosion of the academic industry here in the US, and it may provide email and a few other services to the very rich, but it will otherwise have a lot more in common with the original DARPAnet than with the 24/7 virtual cosmos imagined by today’s more gullible netheads. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Unless you’re one of the very rich or an employee of one of the institutions just named, furthermore, you won’t have access to the internet of 2065.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You might be able to hack into it, if you have the necessary skills and are willing to risk a long stint in a labor camp, but unless you’re a criminal or a spy working for the insurgencies flaring in the South or the mountain West, there’s not much point to the stunt. If you’re like most Americans in 2065, you live in Third World conditions without regular access to electricity or running water, and you’ve got other ways to buy things, find out what’s going on in the world, find out how to get to the next town and, yes, look at pictures of people with their clothes off. What’s more, in a deindustrializing world, those other ways of doing things will be cheaper, more resilient, and more useful than reliance on the baroque intricacies of a vast computer net. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Exactly when the last vestiges of the internet will sputter to silence is a harder question to answer. Long before that happens, though, it will have lost its current role as one of the poster children of the myth of perpetual progress, and turned back into what it really was all the time: a preposterously complex way to do things most people have always done by much simpler means, which only seemed to make sense during that very brief interval of human history when fossil fuels were abundant and cheap. </div>

In other news, I’m pleased to announce that the third anthology of deindustrial SF stories from this blog’s “Space Bats” contest, <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2015/04/new-release-after-oil-3-years-of-rebirth.html>After Oil 3: The Years of Rebirth</a>, is now available in print and e-book formats. Those of my readers who’ve turned the pages of the two previous <i>After Oil</i> anthologies already know that this one has a dozen eminently readable and thought-provoking stories about the world on the far side of the Petroleum Age; the rest of you—why, you’re in for a treat. Those who are interested in contributing to the next After Oil anthology will find the details <a href=../../2015/03/planet-of-space-bats.html>here</a>.</div>

It will continue to be subsidized until it cannot, but it is unlikely to be seriously degraded where money is flowing until a lot lower fruit is picked clean.<br><br>Take my industry, for example, the Yellow Pages. It's a medium where the advertiser pays for production and distribution, with the consumer paying nothing except a fee to a third party (phone company) when it is used. Compare that with internet advertising. The cost of delivery of production (photons on a screen of some type) and delivery (internet connection) are externalized onto society in general via subsidies, and consumers in particular via energy bills and internet costs. That's two of the biggest costs gone; with artwork processes often off-shored to China, India or the Philippines, you're down to commissions, admin, and profit. Then you are left with a product that helps suck the remaining resources out of the community by discouraging local trade, sales tax evasion, etc. <br><br>The company I work for refuses to sell digital products, we've been talked into trials a couple of times, but they haven't shown the ROI for the advertiser, and my employer, a fellow European of our generation, will not compromise his ethics and sell a sub standard product, even though it would be more profitable. We have also discussed at length the fact that we have a product that only needs 19th century technology to work, so is extremely resilient. <br> <br>That same 19th century technology is all that is needed to maintain some of the most useful aspects of the years of the internet. For example, with the clever application of punched cards, a telegraph, and paper placed around a cylinder on the other end, with a set of colored pens, I could still send you a cute picture of my cat - but at a vastly reduced baud.<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c4146577836651770863 title="comment permalink">4/29/15, 6:22 PM</a><br><br>

My immediate reaction is: most of the data sent online is video and bittorrent. About 6% is standard web pages, many of which have "rich" content -- if we went back to a text-based internet, there'd probably be less than 1% current data rates.<br><br>But, of course, your point is that such a technological regression wouldn't occur as a considered, logical process that maximises utility (to all) -- it would instead be haphazard, messy and driven by people's ability to pay (ie. online video is maintained for the wealthy while the poor are driven off).<br><br>On a side note, I've done some <a href=http://guesstimatedapproximations.blogspot.com/2015/04/update-on-water-systems-part-ii.html rel=nofollow> analysis of last summer's rainfall at Adelaide in the historical context</a> (Adelaide, I think, has a similar rainfall amount and pattern to California) that might be interesting to some of your readers. Cherokee Chris put it well when he said it is important for systems to be robust to worst-case scenarios and not just long term averages. My thought is that it would be possible to maintain a dense city in a place like Adelaide, even with climate change effects, but (like the internet above) what remains to be seen is whether we approach this sensibly or in a haphazard free-market manner. In the US, I'd bet on the latter, in Australia I don't know. If course, Adelaide's population is about 1.2 M -- California's is somewhat larger.<br><br>Also, I've finally <a href=http://guesstimatedapproximations.blogspot.com/2015/04/kitchen-hot-water.html rel=nofollow> completed the installation of my kitchen solar hot water system</a>, which I'm very happy about.<br><br>Cheers, Angus<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c5019686280556870069 title="comment permalink">4/29/15, 6:23 PM</a><br><br>

I am often aware of the subsidized nature of my Internet access, because I have been blocked out of some of the sites that are already asking for money, and I know that my budget will not allow me to indulge in the “pay for play” sites. Using Firefox and the add-on Ghostery, I am fortunately able to avoid looking at 98% of the advertising that basically pays for my free access. And I know that that could stop at any time. And, as I am just coming back from losing quite a lot in a computer hard drive crash, I am also aware of the ephemeral nature of what I have. My paper journals are up in the attic, and I can look at them anytime I want (okay, mice got to the 1997 pages). Once I switched to document files for my journals, I can only reread them if I have software that will open that file. (On the one hand, I have saved reams of paper, because most of my rumination isn’t worth printing, but on the other hand I’ve several times almost lost years of journaling). It is another excellent example of first world countries getting so used to having their luxuries subsidized that they have stopped seeing them as luxuries. You mentioned that there are cheaper and more basic ways to do a lot of this, but one of the things I see is that we have dropped most of those and some of it is not recoverable. For example, cell phones versus pay phone booths, libraries that are jettisoning hardcopy in favor of e-books or closing altogether, and the newspapers that are dying because nobody will buy the paper version. As you say, this is the age of declining supplies of cheap power, so our ability to step back and manually reproduce what we are taking for granted on the Internet might be far less than it would have been a couple generations ago. I am building a private library full of how to and reference books, and yet the few days that I was off-line with my computer crashed, I was itching to let the search engines do the hard work for me. And I noticed in my Master Food Preserver classes that the younger women had a huge problem looking up information in the 4 inch thick binders that were our textbook, while those of us middle age and older at least understood the technique. :-) I guess I can only pray that the process will be slow enough that we will be able to recover the old ways of doing some of this without massive trauma. And in that light, I will say that I have two paper copies of my novel, which continues to be posted on www.cathymcguire.blogspot.com, and I will have the paper copies of the green wizards mailing list out in the mail very soon.<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c7923483311657042865 title="comment permalink">4/29/15, 6:33 PM</a><br><br>

Mind you, the technology does one thing consistently well: it has the wonderful side effect of consistently getting visitors lost in transit to the farm here. This is despite my advice to ignore what the GPS or smart phone is telling them and simply follow the map which I provide them. It is not hard reading a map, but the wonderful thing about faith in progress, is that despite hearing stories about how others have been lost, and people having a laugh about it, they can still repeat the error and end up lost because they wanted to use the GPS and/or smart phone software and show just how much clever-like they were!

It brings sneers and snickers to my family, But I too grew up in Seattle and remember the dashed technological hopes for the future. I have been reluctant to totally adopt new technology. I use a simple cell phone that is a flip phone that does one thing..make phone calls, I still have and use a land line phone, use a digital camera but am gravitating toward film, and pay my bills by writing a check and mailing them in. These are things everyone did up until just recently, and I believe these are some of the resurrected skills that will be needed in the future. My older teenaged children don't even know how to banlance a checkbook, or even know how much money they have without accessing some computer device. I just look in my checkbook register.

Right now Google is positioned for a sort of quasi-monopoly over the Internet... if you're a small entrepreneur trying to start a company, you just go to Google Business and in one fell swoop you get domain, e-mail, office apps, cloud storage, and social media set up in an hour. Heck if you want you can basically install a Google operating system on your computer, all through your web browser. As more and more people do that, the individualized, specialized websites of the big players... and what Cory Doctorow likes to call "general purpose computing"... certainly won't disappear, but they may be pushed to the margins, until people think of Google "owning" the Internet the way that Microsoft "owns" personal computers. With monopoly or oligarchy, then the inevitable cheapening, cutting corners, and nonresponsive customer service will set in. The small users will eventually find that Google doesn't care about their accounts, much like your phone company doesn't care about you unless you have ten lines. Then Internet commerce will start to seem like a quaint holdover from an earlier day, much like people consider voice phone calls to be a primitive and inconvenient intrusion much of the time. By the time we reach that extreme -- hopefully face-to-face, highly localized commerce will have experienced a resurgence.<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c608483109784996553 title="comment permalink">4/29/15, 7:45 PM</a><br><br>

Here it is 10:45 and still no comments! It shows how easily people have taken to the internet without giving any real thought to how it actually worked or what the real cost of it is.<br><br>In my one semester of graduate study in the Graduate School of Library Service at the University of Alabama, my instructor in a reference course told us that the library hoped at that point--fall of 1978--to have the entire card catalog of the Gorgas Library available on computer terminal access in house some years in the future. She put the time on the project of at least 10 to 15 years but it actually happened in about 5 years.<br><br>I don't bring this up as any kind of counter to what you say in your post, because the internet came some time later. It make me think also of the cataloging instructor taking us into the cataloging room of the library during a night class that I took and showing us the OCLC terminal(Ohio College Library Center)which was housed at the Ohio State University Library and became one of the most trafficked academic sites of the internet before the internet was released to the general public.<br><br>I have actually been thinking for some time that I will disengage from the internet at some time in the near future. I am beginning to feel about it as I did television many years ago. It's just not worth my time. <br><br>I do hope you will do a post on what you think the "postal service" will look like in the future. I worked there for 20 years as a part-time flexible employee and saw all the Byzantine management foul ups, but also left two years ago feeling that in the long descent we had probably better hold onto that infrastructure for as long as we can. Most people think that UPS and FEDEX could take up the slack if the post office were to disappear. Nothing could be further from the truth. When I left the USPS was still carrying 62% of all parcels and was doing end point delivery for both UPS and FFEDEX in order so save each of them enormous fuel costs.<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c4075543469497298280 title="comment permalink">4/29/15, 9:13 PM</a><br><br>

One of the stories I tell my students when they consider the internet and the de-industrial future is one that came to my attention during Hurricane Sandy. The power was out all over NYC, and a small ISP was trying to keep their server running for their customers as long as they could. They were doing it by passing jerry cans of diesel by hand, assembly-line style, up 5 flights of stairs to keep the generator running!<br><br>I wonder if you could elaborate on what the alternative to the internet for several of the things you mention would be, though. The obvious answer is the old-fashioned world of snail-mail. I don't know how the USPS is doing these days, but Canada Post is not doing well. They are in the midst of massive layoffs, pension decreases, big postage cost hikes, and a controversial shift away from door-to-door service, in favour of community mailboxes.

As for the "internet of things," my guess is that it'll be short-lived due to economic factors -- not to mention the disadvantages that accrue when somebody can hack your refrigerator...<br><br>Yucca, one of the ambiguities here is what counts as "the internet." A DARPAnet style network the general public can't access may be an internet, but is it "the internet" in any current sense of the phrase?<br><br>Jean-Vivien, to me, it's the daily news that reads like a collection of malign fairy tales. <br><br>Zachary, that comparison makes perfect sense to me. <br><br>LatheChuck, hmm! That makes sense. I'll want to look into it. <br><br>Allan, I read that post when it first came out! As for reading problems, if that ever started happening to me I'd drop my computer out the window at once -- I love books far too much to let the internet get in the way. I'd definitely encourage you to try a media fast. <br><br>Harry, true enough, but I suspect the point at which there's no more fruit to pick is closer than it appears. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Angus, no argument, a text-based internet would be a lot cheaper -- but a postal service is cheaper still, you know. The question is whether the additional value of the internet would be enough to cover the higher costs; I'm far from sure it would be. <br><br>Cathy, oh, it's going to be traumatic, no question. One of the core reasons I've been encouraging people to adopt old technologies is that that might make it a little less traumatic than it would otherwise be. <br><br>Rapier, mass information storage using current technologies is incredibly vulnerable to sudden loss. As for electronics, I expect salvage to keep quite a range of components available for decades after the last chip factories shut down; the question is whether they can produce enough value to be worth the energy and material costs in a deindiustrializing world. <br><br>Fudoshin, maybe so, but a great many people seem to think otherwise. I'm less interested in the internet as a technology than I am in the internet as a myth, a talisman of progress, and an excuse for ignoring the ongoing reality of decline -- but the creeping failure of the technology itself also seems worth discussing. <br><br>Cherokee, as far as I know, no, Attila never got lost; of course he had the advantage of an army of Huns to gallop ahead of him and report back. You might suggest that option to your visitors -- I don't know if you have a ready supply of Huns, but drunken football fans ought to be available, and that's almost as good. As for Xero, a fine example of the species; I wonder how much investment capital they'll burn through before anyone notices that it's all, so to speak, a Xero-sum game.<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c2604266119636477150 title="comment permalink">4/29/15, 9:39 PM</a><br><br>

What is it that you've been learning about? I've never been able to do any research that was worth doing on the internet, and I've tried hard. The information on the internet is always way too superficial. <br><br>To pull from my own experience in biology: Need to test seawater for the amount of certain chemicals? The procedure isn't on the internet, it's in a dusty book above your professor's desk. Need to culture a rare species of mosquito? Their dietary needs have never been published, but another professor can recommend a colleague who knows. Need to make a GIS rangemap? Have fun digitizing these maps from the library by hand. <br><br>Speaking of biology, I can't resist kindly recommending that you double check how evolution works. If you roll your eyes and acknowledge that you mean something completely different with the word than a biologist would, perhaps consider how the mythology of Progress relates to what you do mean.<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c5704357847966019822 title="comment permalink">4/29/15, 10:16 PM</a><br><br>

I doubt that something new and unimagined will be able to compete with that. <br><br>Wayne, fraying of the satellite network needn't shut down the internet as such, though it'll terminate some of its associated technologies such as GPS. As for trolls, they'll do what their exact equivalents used to do in the days before the internet: write nasty letters with no return addresses. "Poison pen letters" was the common phrase at the time. <br><br>James, it's worth a quease or two. <br><br>D. Mitchell, my guess is that a lot of people are in the process of making that decision, or moving toward it, right now. <br><br>SweaterMan, welcome to the real cutting edge!<br><br>Jim, a library consists of a collection of books and a means of cataloging them, and books don't require a global economy -- a few printing presses are enough, as Benjamin Franklin demonstrated. A radio station can work entirely on local programming -- some still did in my youth -- and a postal system can run on a very small scale; those in colonial America began that way, for example.

The answer, though, depends on which one will pay the bills, because profitability is more important than technical factors such as data rate. <br><br>Godfree, the benefits don't matter unless they cover the costs. That's one thing I've noticed that internet users rarely seem to grasp; it doesn't matter how much you personally benefit from the internet, what matters is what, if anything, can pay the internet's expenses. <br><br>Cat, exactly. The illusion of something for nothing is one of the things that makes the internet so potent a source of confusion and misunderstanding. <br><br>Backyardfeast, no question, long distance communication will suffer. My guess is that those countries that come through the next round of crises in better shape than most will rebuild their postal services, and the rest will have to make do with whatever can be jerry-rigged together. Ham radio operators used to pass messages from city to city in a kind of informal telegraph network; the old message traffic system still exists among US hams, though I don't know whether it's widespread elsewhere. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Nestorian, do you remember mail order? I certainly do. My guess is that where functional postal services remain, mail order catalogs (which of course remain very much a living technology today) will become standard for those specialty goods that can't always support brick and mortar. As for the energy footprint of internet shopping vs. local stores, I don't know of an impartial assessment; if anyone does, I'd be interested to hear of it. <br><br>Mark, if you're employed in the hardware end of things, you probably have a job for the foreseeable future. Software, not so much -- there are a lot of signs that the current boom is simply a second tech stock bubble, which will end the same way the last one did. <br><br>Wiseman, it's entirely possible that India will have a fairly widespread internet long after the US doesn't have one at all; we're past the peak of empire and on our way down, while India's still coming out from under the long economic burden of British empire and is arguably on its way up. <br><br>Cherokee, just one of the services I offer. I'll take a look at the story as time permits, and offer any suggestions that seem relevant.<br><br>William, well, I did mention defense contractors, you know. I agree that there will be a lot less business computing going on; partly that'll happen once labor costs drop below the costs of automation, and it becomes more profitable here -- as it already is in much of the Third World -- to hire a person than to pay for a machine. As for the internet of things, I think there we've finally approached the reductio ad absurdum of the internet revolution; I'm thinking here of an ad I saw recently for a Bluetooth-enabled toothbrush, which tracks your dental habits on a website and sends you text messages when you forget to brush your teeth after meals.

Or was it ultra-fast? No, wait, I think it was hyper-fast...<br><br>I don't think I've lived anywhere with a truly reliable internet connection since dial-up went out of fashion, so I wonder where all these people are who already have "fast" broadband (which I'm sure never breaks down, or cuts out unexpectedly, or fails to send an important email). It was particularly amusing since, at that time, we were about a week into what turned out to be a three-week argument with BT customer services about the fact that we had effectively no internet access at all, and yes we had followed all of their instructions, and could they please send out an actual engineer, preferably on the day they said they were going to?<br><br>Taking the cake in this whole fiasco, however, was my mother's insistence that this all showed that I needed to get a smartphone...<br><br>It seems to be a case that, as far as economics goes, the internet - along with air travel - exists in a grey area between "profitable" and "completely unsustainable". That is - and particularly in the halcyon, wealthier days of the 90s and early 2000s - it might never have been, strictly speaking, a financially *good idea*, but the cultural/social/emotional benefits it provided were sufficient for people to support it anyway. And had the good times continued, even accounting for the typical processes of maturation, the internet would have been likely to continue in a fairly recognisable form. (As opposed to things like fracking and space exploration, which could only exist for as long as it took people to calculate the actual costs involved. And yes - I know things were getting worse before the 90s, but there's still a big difference between then and now.) Of course, since the good times didn't continue and aren't coming back, we will soon reach a point where the cultural etc benefits don't justify the costs - sooner than for air travel, I'd guess, given that a) many of the "benefits" provided by the internet were always somewhat dubious and b) the differences between the internet and competing, cheaper technologies are much less stark.<br><br>That is to say, we can defy the rules of economic good sense for the sake of sentiment, but only up to a point.<br><br>I worry about the effect of constant internet (and general screen-based) access on the psychological development (not to mention the skill-set) of children born in the last 10 or 15 years. I'm just old enough to remember when having your own computer was a novelty. Today's children will have the hardest time disengaging from the tech-driven, digital world we're all being encouraged to inhabit - and from emotional blocks such as the "iPhone defence" - because it's all they've ever known. Then again, on a larger scale this is true of industrial society as a whole: it always baffles me when people seem to think that the way we live is the natural way of things, and the last, oh, half-million years* of the human species, or even the ten thousand years of the Holocene, small farming communities and occasional non-oil-powered civilisations, were the blip.<br><br>*Anatomically modern humans have existed for maybe 200,000 years and this is most people's preferred start-point for Homo sapiens, but I favour inclusion of the Neanderthals and other archaics given the evidence that they were highly intelligent and interbred with modern humans, and most of our characteristic features are likely down to drift anyway. "Species" is not a precise concept anyway. If I get around to writing a Space Bats entry before the deadline, this may become relevant.<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c1805378551135434463 title="comment permalink">4/30/15, 2:17 AM</a><br><br>

How the two posts play out together doesn't look pretty. <br>Rural disconnection. I worked for an independent non Bell Telco in the 90s, when landlines still dominated. The system was still regulated in such a way that urban still subsidized rural, back when landline voice was still the dominant communication. Deregulation has since chipped away at that. Basically, if you live in a rural area, depending on how rural, I wouldn't count on th. reliability of communications lasting very long at all, as the legal framework ensuring rural connectivity has been gutted, and never applied to the internet in the 1st place. <br>Another thing to remember, at least for the time being until the internet collapse gets good and going, you don't have to be online for your data to go online. The Target breach was from store computers/registers that were online. If you call a call center, the rep is going to put your info in a computer that is online.

Firstly the practice of selling below cost, generally with the idea that your competitors which have less access to cash/credit will go out of business before you, and when that happens you can jack up the price. It occurs to me that whether intentionally or not the internet has used artificial low prices to make it better than it is, and in doing so has put destroyed a lot of competition and cause a lot of sunk capital to be put into it. Could this cause the internet to keep going a lot longer than one would expect from a purely economic perspective?<br><br>The second was somewhat tangentially; while often the internet is trotted out as a conciliation price for not having moon bases, why the internet and space colonization are qualitavely different. Ultimately the dream of space colonization/fusion/any number of other things would have led to the expansion of the natural resources available to be exploited by humans, the internet on the other hand merely represents new ways in which those resources can be spent.

<div class="avt a_b6373a" id=c1520414738395382573></div><b><a href=http://megpie71.livejournal.com/ rel=nofollow>megpie71</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>A very simple question for the people who say "the internet is forever" - the technologies which constituted the Internet have been around since the 1960s and before. The World Wide Web and HTML were formulated back in 1983. So why didn't the internet start to boom until the very late 1990s through mid-2000s?<br><br>As a very popular science fiction writer once put it, the answer to any question which begins with "why" can often be summarised as: money.<br><br>Put simply, prior to the late 1980s, it cost too much to buy computers and run them, it cost too much to get the dedicated telephone lines for the necessary data transfers, and it cost far too much for the necessary international call times to set up a dedicated World Wide Web at the time. So until about the very early 1990s, the internet remained a subsidy sponge in the US Department of Defence and the academic world, and it was primarily an internal thing to each country, with occasional batches of data exchange. <br><br>What made it more affordable? Well, it was a combination of things. Firstly, a lot of mining projects got off the ground in third world countries, dumping copper on the market. So it was suddenly within the budget of the larger telecommunications companies and the smaller governments to do things like laying trans-oceanic cables. So that knocked down the cost of telephone calls (and thus the cost of data transfer) between the USA and the rest of the world. Here in Australia, it meant our main connection to the outside 'net was no longer the weekly delivery (by trans-oceanic flight on commercial airliner) of magnetic tapes containing the relevant data (never underestimate the bandwidth of a jumbo full of magtapes!). <br><br>Then someone figured out how to make optical glass fibres of a sufficient length to do more than just be novelty lamps (does anyone else remember those particular decor wonders of the 1970s?). Given glass is made of sand, and sand is (literally) dirt cheap, optical fibre allowed the creation of bigger, cheaper cables, and once they'd figured out how to use lasers and optical fibres to transmit binary data, it wasn't as expensive to put down the dedicated cables for data transfer. Oh, and then some bright spark came up with a way to send both binary and analogue data down the same copper wire, thus getting twice the service out of the existing telephone infrastructure.<br><br>As the cost of connecting to the internet came down, the commercial possibilities became more obvious, and in the USA, ComCast was the first commercial provider of internet services. Then came America Online, which not only sold business-to-business (which was ComCast's main money maker) but also sold to individual consumers... and the Eternal September started in 1993 (look it up).<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c1520414738395382573 title="comment permalink">4/30/15, 5:29 AM</a><br><br>

That's a fancy way of saying we don't talk to each other face-to-face, up-close and personal anymore. And that's if we ever did. The amount of separation between people who are within relatively close proximity to one another is very shocking when you stop and think about it. One reason the Internet is such an obsession here is because it has become a surrogate for having friends and having real interaction with our neighbors and co-workers. If anything good comes from collapse, it will have to start with people forgetting about the computer and the television set and going outside and talking to people once again about things that matter!<br><br>Second thing: I listened to your recent interview with Chris Martenson, and I think part of the problem with Baby Boomer (or Baby Boomer men, at least) isn't just their circumstances but their generational character. As an astrologer, I think a lot of it is because they are the "Pluto in Leo" generation, which influences so many of them into being less mature and more self-involved.

Just before going into its certain and not so far demise, it’ll certainly be cannibalized by the wealthier people at everybody else expense.<br>Actually, Internet Service Providers (ISP) are allowed to base their fees only on two limiting factors : speed and quantity. Let’s give an hypothetical simplified example. Suppose an ISP with a 10GB/sec capacity having two customers. Customer 1 pays for a 1GB/sec limited service and Customer 2 pays for a 10GB/sec limited service. If they both simultaneously want to download something, Customer 1 gets it at 1GB/sec while Customer 2 gets it at 9GB/sec because the ISP is not allowed to prioritize a customer when allocating its capacity.<br>Now, ISPs are working hard to get rules changed so they could base their fees on capacity allocation priorities. So, in my hypothetical simplified example, we would now have the Customer 1 paying for a class C service and Customer 2 paying for a class A service. With this approach, if both customers try to download something, Customer 2 gets all the capacity while Customer 1 waits for the capacity to be available.<br>If we put this on both ends, it’s not hard to imagine who will be the facto able to use the Internet between a low priority customer trying to access its favorite ADR blog and a wealthy porn junky.<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c8960534273279347215 title="comment permalink">4/30/15, 7:06 AM</a><br><br>

I find that, when it comes to learning, the combination of speed and volume on the internet amounts to something qualitatively different from what existed before. It is especially useful when dealing with informal fields of knowledge that are polluted with a lot of speculative or shoddy information—at least if you have the skills to cull the good from the bad. Take for example vegetable gardening, which I have learned largely from the internet. Gardeners, including many veterans, propound all sorts of remedies that are, in the end, based more on metaphor than science. Many of these ineffectual techniques which presumably date back to before the web. If this were the old days, when I would have been learning mainly by mail, I'd have had to rely on whatever my few newsletters and gardening catalogs were telling me, checked against whatever published academic research I could (slowly) get from the local library. And the latter might well not deal with the specific mundane, small-scale, technical problems I was confronting. Of course I'd still be able to learn to garden—hundreds of generations did, after all—but I really think that, with the internet, I have been able to quickly skip past a lot of mistakes, which would formerly have taken years, lifetimes, or generations, to overcome.

It would seem that such information would be cheaply and easily diseminated via the internet, especialy since the intended audience is uber connected twenty and thirty somethings in an urban setting. Even though both these weeklies maintain advanced modern website with all the same information the circulation of these papers continues to grow while the daily mainstream subscription paper dwindles. Both papers have taken the opportunity to use some of their space for the best muckraking and political journalism in the city and have been responsible for uncovering most of the political scandals in Oregon.<br> It is quite a sight when the papers arrive at a local coffee shop on wednesday ( often by bike) and all the young people who were previously glued to laptops or cell phones put them down and the room becomes a sea of old fashioned newspapers.<br> I am Not quite sure why, perhaps because they are free ( paid for by advertising) or perhaps because their bread and butter is listings of every music or arts event for the next 7 days. These can be considerable with in excess of 100 musical acts performing on any given night so perhaps the newspaper is a better venue for purusing such listing's interspursed with adds for those acts that want more attention. Or perhaps , being somewhat countercultural the revenue from advertising things that are not welcome on mainstream sources such as canibus dispensaries, strip clubs and risque personal adds pay the bills.

No doubt you'll be pilloried by the techno-fabulists out there.<br><br>To me, it's pretty simple. In an environment in which energy is no longer cheap, technologies that use less energy to perform a particular task will be more valuable than those, like the Internet, that require huge energy inputs. Google gets this. The company has invested heavily in alternative energy production.<br><br>But even Google cannot change the laws of physics, and nobody I've read has calculated how much PV it would take to run the current iteration of the Internet. Perhaps the Internet could be run on non-fossil energy; I don't know. There's always that nagging issue of storage when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. Maybe Tom Murphy could tackle this question over at Do the Math.<br><br>Anyway, this has me thinking of radio, AM radio in particular. I worked in the field for 25 years, and have always been amazed at the medium's resilience. It survived the onslaught of television by changing its programming, and continues to hold on in the era of the Internet via streaming. The reason? Radio, relatively speaking, is cheap. On a per-user basis, AM radio is super-cheap, especially at night.<br><br>There is a layer of particles in Earth's ionosphere called the Kenelly-Heaviside layer (after its discoverers) that has a useful quality when it is shadowed from the sun by the Earth: it reflects radio signals at the frequency used for AM radio, allowing them to travel thousands of miles. We used to call them skywaves. <br><br>That's why, when I was growing up in the midwest, I could routinely, after sundown, tune in KNX in Hollywood or WBAP in Dallas or XEROK in Juarez. AM radio is what propelled radio legend Wolfman Jack to fame: his station on the Mexican side of the border, where there were essentially no limits to the power of AM transmitters (and no cultural prohibitions on the type of music he could play), would at night cover all of North and South America. <br><br>Let's assume that Wolfman Jack's station reached the entire population of the US at night. My back-of-the-envelope calculation is that his station's transmitter required between one and two million kilowatt hours of electricity annually. Newer AM transmitters are more efficient than they were in Wolfman Jack's era, so we could cut that figure by about 20%. Still, that seems like a lot of electricity. <br><br>However, the energy usage figures I've seen for the US's Internet infrastructure are nearly 100 billion -- yes, with a "B" -- kilowatt hours annually. <br><br>Add to this the fact that one can make a crude crystal radio receiver at home for less than a dollar that will pick up AM radio signals, and you have a pretty viable post-crash technology. Will it sound good? Be as cool as an i-Pad? No. Will it be good enough to receive information? Yes.<br><br>Now the techno-fabulist would argue that Wolfman Jack's border radio station was just one channel of information, and the 100 billion kilowatt hours of energy spent on the Internet buys you access to an almost limitless number of voices. The techno-fabulist would be correct. But if those 100 billion kilowatt hours were reduced to, say, 100 million kilowatt hours, the techno-fabulist would have to change his or her argument into the past tense.<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c3638178911199450027 title="comment permalink">4/30/15, 8:41 AM</a><br><br>

And everybody on earth knows that innovation only occurs in small groups. Put three people on a committee and they may get something done. Ten people, and it gets harder. Thirty people, and nothing happens. Thirty million, it becomes impossible. That's the effect of mass media - it keeps anything from happening. Mass media swamps diversity. It makes every place the same. Bangkok or Tokyo or London: there's a McDonald's on one corner, a Benetton on another, a Gap across the street. Regional differences vanish. All differences vanish. In a mass-media world, there's less of everything except the top ten books, records, movies, ideas. People worry about losing species diversity in the rain forest. But what about intellectual diversity - our most necessary resource? That's disappearing faster than trees. But we haven't figured that out, so now we're planning to put five billion people together in cyberspace. And it'll freeze the entire species. Everything will stop dead in its tracks. Everyone will think the same thing at the same time. Global uniformity.

However, having studied and written about computer technology for 30 years, I see a few weaknesses in your rather sweeping generalizations. First of all, Internet technology was deliberately and carefully designed to be very scaleable indeed. It works very well within single buildings, and I use it to link the few computers in my house. No external infrastructure is needed for this. Second, Internet applications like the World Wide Web add a lot of value beyond the older alternatives you list. Tim Berners-Lee has explained those better than I could, but the main point is the "world wide" part. The Web has made it vastly easier for people all round the world to communicate and talk things over. The immense data centres you mention are certainly unsustainable, but the Internet and the Web can be scaled down almost without limit, just as ham radio can persist when giant broadcasting organizations disappear.<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c5942234640132765156 title="comment permalink">4/30/15, 9:00 AM</a><br><br>

I grew up near the shore of a large lake, my friend (whose parents often spent days and weekends away) grew up in a house right on the beach. <br><br>His folks weren't micro-managers, so as long as we didn't do anything too stupid, they let our gang hang out there while they were gone. In that place we were unbothered by adults and unmolested by the law. <br><br>Picture summer nights spent on the beach around a fire, a girl beside you, listening to the radio, drinking and smoking.

You’d have to be somebody who was actually involved in building those past packet networks, as I was, to appreciate that complexity. In the late 1980’s and into the 1990’s we enjoyed Packet radio BBS’s that rivaled the Land-Line BBS’s. They are all gone today.<br><br>Back in the early to mid 1990’s I was building and selling a Bit-Regenerator accessory that converted a TNC2 type Terminal Node Controller into a full repeater controller for Packet Radio. Using just a Microchip PIC 16C71 it provided a DCD State Machine for digital carrier detection, full bit regeneration and re-timing using a 16-bit FIFO, all programmed in software. I’m surprised to actually be able to find reference to it on today’s Internet! Notice that page is dated 2003. I doubt that repeater is on the air anymore. I actually have a few of the chips around here still but I’ve lost the source code over the years.<br><br>http://www.qsl.net/cra/info/squaw.html<br>"The repeater is comprised of a General Electric Master II repeater, an MFJ-1270C TNC operating as an identifier, and a KG7BZ Bit-Regenerator, the component that turns a TNC into a repeater."<br><br>Hardware used for Packet Radio:<br>TNC2 (Terminal Node Controller) Stand-Alone microprocessor controller Made by MFJ, Kantronics, AEA, etc. Now basically obsolete and discontinued.<br><br>Network Node Firmware to run in a TNC2 TNC:<br>TheNet, NetROM, G8BPQ<br><br>BBS Software to run on a PC, either under MSDOS or Windows 3.1<br>MSYS, W0RLI, F6FBB, AA4RE<br>NOS (KA9Q), PA0GRI (GRINOS), WG7J (JNOS)<br><br>Some old info about Packet Radio Networks, notice how many dead links these pages contain:<br>http://www.mi-drg.org/network-training.shtml<br>http://ohiopacket.org/index.php/Packet_Software<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPRNet<br>"Packet radio had an exponential decline within the amateur radio hobby over twenty years, and remaining users have switched to the private address space (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16, etc.)."<br>http://www.ampr.org/pubs.html<br>http://www.febo.com/packet/<br>ftp://ftp.ucsd.edu/hamradio/packet/<br><br>There’s one lone network that is like the packet radio networks of the past, WinLink. Although it does mention a radio-only mode, that’s rarely used, WinLink appears to mainly be used for some 10,000 sailors to pick up their Internet email by HF Radio while at sea. It still relies on modern computers running big programs and almost totally connected to each other via the Internet for its operation.<br><br>WinLink<br>http://www.winlink.org/<br>http://www.philsherrod.com/Winlink/Winlink_PowerPoint.pdf<br>http://www.philsherrod.com/Winlink/Radio_Only_Winlink.pdf<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winlink<br><br>Most packet radio and other digital mode programs today are run on a PC. Very few if any, other than WinLink, support any kind of automated store and forward. Yes, with a LOT of hard work and time by dedicated programmers, and PC’s to run the software on, a Packet Radio Network could be re-created. Old 286 and 385 based PC’s are not powerful enough to run the DSP software needed to do packet with sound cards instead of dedicated hardware (TNC’s).<br><br>I think we’re going to find that in the future a Network based on the <a href=http://www.arrl.org/nts rel=nofollow>NTS (National Traffic System)</a> and using voice and CW (Morse Code) will be far more likely. This may not come to pass within the lifetimes of some of us, but the time to start learning how to do it is now so we can pass this knowledge on, not just at the moment when it’s needed.

Another great post. And it moved me to do something I have been contemplating for sometime now. Last evening I went to the web page for my online banking service and changed preferences to have my monthly Bank and CC statements sent via the postal system instead of receiving them “electronically”. I’ve decided to pay my bills by Post as well. <br><br>Overtime I have become more and more wary of the malevolent part of the internet. I’ve twice been hit with the “FBI” ransom attack. Fortunately having a Mac it was an easy cure but it did make me aware that even the glorious Mac is not invulnerable which was one of the big selling points for Mac’s in years past. <br><br>The Firewall on my Mac has an utility that tracks attack attempts to get into my machine. Those attacks now number over a thousand an hour. The internet is obviously filthy with probes looking for any vulnerability. <br><br>So I find myself becoming more “Retro” all the time. I only do a very small amount of buying online. Mostly books (all of yours I am happy to say). And I try to buy from sites that use PayPal since I think (but don’t know for sure) that it is more secure then giving my CC online. <br><br>I’ve mostly stopped using my CC as well and mostly use cash and/or check and my Cell phone is just something to have with me when I travel in case of problems. It is turned off most of the time (I have a pay-as-you-go plan). <br><br>You’ve said in other posts that a laptop without the net is just a flat paperweight. Actually though I find it a very useful tool in the offline mode. I keep my financial accounts (I’m lousy at book keeping) and 2 daily journals and a great deal of written material on my Macbook. I also occasionally watch a Dvd on it as well as I have no TV or Dvd player. But in all these task I alway have the internet connection turned off. So I am down to 30 to 45 minutes a day on my Mac and maybe 10 to 20 minutes online for email.

Mentioned in comments is Telework. <br><br>This adaptation I believe will expand dramatically in the short future as the growing pains of LESS spreads to more. <br><br>About 10 million people per work day, drive 30 miles round trip in the United States alone (by themselves). Companies and Governments conduct much business via the Internet. <br><br>If 20% of the 10 million who drive 30 miles to work and back 5 days per week in the USA worked from home using the Internet then: 60 million miles saved per day, 20 million gallons of gas saved/day, 2 million hours of commute time, about 500 cars/day not consumed and hundreds of millions per week in real estate rent/tax not spent. <br><br>Impacts include : Automobile Industries/Supply chain shrinkage, Commercial Real-estate and Property Tax base/pension fund value erosion, lobby interest shifts, physical/mental health and neighborhood cohesion improvements. <br> <br> This is not happening now but in a LESS world by nature choice options change to “Either or” instead of “ A and B and X….to infinity” . <br> <br>Modern society is not used to handling tough (life support) priorities well. I expect society may improve prioritization skills through big fights leading to new political decision processes forced by harsh reality. <br><br> Moving ahead, there will be large scale breakups, institutional divorces, new beliefs/values, unexpected encounters and relations with sexy things down the hall and monsters of various sorts.

Streaming video wasn't made ubiquitous for cat videos, folks :) I wonder how much of that will continue to be so. Some googling brings up figures like 30% of internet bandwidth use is porn, (and another 30% is netflix). How many porn addicts will pay for their online fix before food &amp; shelter?

But I still do all the same things in the same way as I did them before we connected to the Internet because I like them done the old way as well or better. <br><br>I still use paper maps to navigate; we refuse to get lost by GPS when getting lost from a paper map is so much cheaper and more fun ;-). <br><br>I type emails and blog posts, of course, but hand-write letters on paper that I send through the USPS. Recently I learned that my 12 year old nephew really likes the handmade birthday cards I send that always include a photo of my garden on the front. The kid knows just what to say to his aunt ;-). <br><br>I've kept a diary, using pen and paper, for 47 years, and keep them in a cedar chest that is pest-proof. I just need to remove whatever clutter is on top of the cedar chest to read them. <br><br>I pay bills by check and manage home finances with pencil and paper (the pencil so I can erase and correct when I make a calculation error). We get paper statements from our credit unions and balance our own checkbooks. Online banking? No thanks! <br><br>I still get paper catalogs and order things out of them by check and USPS as well as buy off the Internet. (Some of the vendors I patronize refuse to accept anything but checks and paper order forms mailed through the USPS.) Sometimes we actually shop at a store and enjoy conversation with store employees.<br><br>We still have a rotary-dial phone. Now that we have VOIP it won't make calls but it does still receive them. We use our hard-wired digital phones from the 1980s to make phone calls. The sound quality is much better than a cell phone because it just does one thing: make and receive voice calls. <br><br>I take photos with a 35mm film camera that is 33 years old as well as a digital camera; the film photos are of higher quality than the digital camera photos. I've also taken a drawing course just so I know how to do that, in case film becomes difficult to get (better take that botanical drawing course sometime ...).<br><br>I used to get obscene phone calls (who else remembers those?) and received a poison-pen letter through the USPS as recently as 10 years ago so I know just what the trolls will use when the Internet goes down. Just because your phone has caller ID now doesn't mean it always will. When it no longer has caller ID is when the obscene phone calls will begin again. <br><br>And remember file cabinets for data storage? They still work. I still have a four-drawer and a two-drawer file cabinet, and I continue to use them.<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c4082649661082996263 title="comment permalink">4/30/15, 3:32 PM</a><br><br>

Especially since I set my software to not show images on web pages, except those I specifically wanted to see. Since then though it seems that they, and most others, have abandoned their past efforts to accommodate low-bandwidth users. This could be rolled back I suppose, if it seems worth their effort in a future where bandwidth becomes more limited again.<br><br>Which brings me to another point, that these days internet access is generally billed by the month rather than the byte. (Other than in "mobile" networks, and even there those who signed up for "unlimited data" are fighting to keep that absurd entitlement.) I find that fundamentally unfair, since that means the people like me, relatively frugal in bandwidth use, are subsidizing those who can't resist watching any kitten video thrown their way and so forth. Perhaps this cross-subsidy is actually important to the current economic survival of the internet? Will conditions change in the future so as to make by-the-byte billing more profitable to the ISPs? How would that affect the uses of the internet at that point?<br><br>This is somewhat analogous to how we're being billed for electricity. Around here, there are many people claiming that "net metering" customers are being subsidized. But my repeated claims that everybody who uses air conditioning is much more heavily subsidized are ignored. That claim of mine is based on the fact that electricity at peak demand times (hot summer afternoons) is much more expensive than at other times, often more expensive at wholesale than the retail rate. And yet, we are being billed at a constant rate, even now that we've collectively invested a gazillion dollars to equip every house with a "smart meter", with the stated aim of allowing variable rate billing - which hasn't happened. It seems that there is a political force preventing that? I know they do have variable rate billing in some places (California?), but not here in Vermont.<br><br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c7706176213064810509 title="comment permalink">4/30/15, 6:01 PM</a><br><br>

It's always seemed bizarre and out of whack, to me, that these incredible devices that hold so much specific finely tuned technology, a rare combination and precise configuration of rare-earth and other materials should to the end-users, (us) be so utterly cheap and available. I mean it just seems like it should cost more, right? Or the decision in the long term to make the with 'planned obsolescence', using very finite resources! A real noggin-scratcher.<br><br>Many families I know both here and in the US feel very left behind if their 7 year old doesn't have their own smart-phone, iPad and laptop. The kids break them, they replace them, again and again and again. Most have the iPad by age 3. The ability to do this doesn't make financial sense to me, ( not to even BEGIN with the parental decision to soma-tize them with these brain-draining 'drugs'). RE: the socialization issue - it can't disappear fast enough IMHO.<br><br>And no, it doesn't sound plausible that the internet (like every other measure of global collapse) will just one day crash. Boom! Gone! Walking Dead! It makes much more sense that it will stair-step down, like it stair-stepped up. Govt. Military and big businesses and some wealthy individuals will get to keep it, in some form or another. The poorest will lose it altogether first, (if they ever had it to begin with). <br><br>Certainly, for the semi-poor/working classes, middle classes, there will be more 'Cyber-Cafes' in towns and cities charging minimally for rented time and use. That will ease the withdrawal symptoms, I think. (( We have a US home base/retirement home in a tiny 900 person town in WY. Most folks use the local Cyber Cafe on Main Street for any online business they need and are connected face to face only - they do just fine)). My prediction is that next: the young, the artists and hipsters/cool-kids will find other cool things to do and the mainstream will, as they always do, follow. Reminds me of the teens you wrote about bicycling around town for fun instead of 'cruising' in cars, a few posts back. Have you ever seen those BMX bikers doing flips and jumps - pretty wicked cool, but not a patch on the, (even lower tech) Parkour acrobats.<br><br>OTOH: I too will miss these discussions as well as being able to easily look up texts and videos on "How to make your own lye" &amp; "Prickly Pear Shampoo Recipes" or "Know your Kiln".

With regard to your first serious point, it'll depend on how much traction the rebound away from the internet gets in the near future. With regard to your second, exactly -- although I'm far from sure space travel would ever have brought in more resources than it consumed. And as for meat women, I don't pine for them at all, having been happily married to one for getting on for 31 years now. <br><br>Vilko, of course the internet saves you money and gives you all kinds of free services. If you'll take the time to read my post, you'll find that I addressed that -- and the temporary investment bubble that's driving it.<br><br>Megpie, nicely summarized -- and yes, I remember fiber optic lamps. I know, my age is showing. <br><br>Meg, granted, but there's a difference between having to be careful where on the internet you speak your mind freely on controversial subjects, and having to weigh the risk of having your bank account cleaned out and your identity stolen if you have internet access at all. <br><br>Fudoshin, good heavens, keep the gold star -- I have way too many of them around the place as it is. You have every right to disagree with my choice of a topic, just as I have every right to harrumph and keep on writing about whatever bat-witted notion happens to pass through my head. <br><br>Betsy, interesting. BTW, was "catatonic collapse" a deliberate joke or an accidental one? Either way, it's a keeper. <br><br>Otto, well, yes, that's probably a topic for the other blog. <br><br>Margfh, it'll be interesting to see what happens when more and more people get forced offline by price rationing -- and are still supposed to use the internet to access the government. It might be a very convenient way of creating a population of legal nonpersons. <br><br>Professor D., by all means see if you can find a copy of Russell's book on the subject -- it's well worth reading. He covers in great detail how the myth of the flat earth was invented, and used to make premodern cultures look stupid so we can look smarter. <br><br>Mister R., the cult of atomization is a huge issue, not least because it leaves so many people unable to interact with others in a constructive way in crisis. My guess is that a lot of people will either break out of it, or die -- and yes, I mean that latter quite literally. <br><br>Electricpants, maybe I should plan on an annual Archdruid's Almanac, with planting tips, recipes, instructions for gardening by the moon's signs, and the like!<br><br>Peakfuture, if we're going to see the internet throttled, I want to have my hands around its throat. ;-)<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c561285175030633108 title="comment permalink">4/30/15, 10:34 PM</a><br><br>

All the points you've made about the internet can be applied equally well to the US road and highway network, and that's falling apart right now. Our current economic system doesn't work by giving consumers what they want; it works by coercing or cajoling them into buying whatever makes the most profit for industry -- and when the internet finishes its expansion phase and has to make a profit, a great many of the features that make being online bearable will go away in a hurry. <br><br>Martin, makes perfect sense to me. That's why there will be a print version of the Report down the road, when those limits start to bite. <br><br>Claudia, in that case, now's the time to start establishing the networks of communication and support that will help keep you going when you've been priced out of internet access. <br><br>K-dog, er, did you somehow manage not to notice that I was talking about the <i><b>economic</b></i> viability of a future internet? As I noted in the post, the technical challenges are modest; the question is how your simple website is going to pay its share of the costs of a future internet. It's a source of wry amusement to me that so many people hear that and then go on talking as though the words had never been said at all...<br><br>Dave, I learned to garden before the internet existed. I've also watched people learn how to garden in the age of the internet, and it takes them about the same amount of time to get good at it as it took me and the other novice organic gardeners I knew at the time. As for your claim that books and newsletters are full of inaccurate data and the internet isn't -- er, you must not be using the same internet I am, because the internet I use is riddled with misinformation and nonsense on any subject you care to name. <br><br>Joe, I don't share your fondness for the internet -- quite the opposite, I find it unpleasant, and use it only because that's how you keep a writing career going these days. I certainly won't argue if you choose to mourn its passing, but I won't be mourning with you. <br><br>Ron, yes, that's also a factor. My guess is that it'll go in waves, starting from the poorest end of society and working up from there. <br><br>Nina, if you can afford to have power in your house at all...<br><br>Dax, yes, I saw that! It's a very good example of the rebound effect, yes. <br><br>Clay, that's very good to hear -- and, yes, I expect such things to become major channels for information exchange in the not too distant future.<br><br>Justin, I'm surprised that those haven't sprung up yet.<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c4365181662613481734 title="comment permalink">4/30/15, 11:02 PM</a><br><br>

Talk to an experienced ham radio operator sometime about skywaves and bouncing signals off the layers of the ionosphere; it's a fine art much practiced these days, especially now that QRP (really low power transmissions -- five watts or less) have become the cutting edge of ham-radio cool. <br><br>Gepetto, fascinating. He's quite right, of course; the internet is among other things a very powerful tool for eliminating cultural and intellectual diversity. <br><br>RPC, excellent! That observation about the real meaning of the word "optimal" gets you tonight's gold star. <br><br>Tom, now go reread my post and notice where I said that I was talking about economic rather than technical viability. That applies to issues of scale as well. Can an internet be scaled down technically to whatever scale you want? Of course. Does it make any kind of economic sense to do so below a fairly large threshold size? Not a bit. If you have a community of a few hundred people and limited resources, it would be idiotic to waste those resources on a micro-internet when you could apply those resources to more pressing needs and get the necessary information flow using a real bulletin board -- you know, the kind with thumbtacks and slips of paper -- a library, and perhaps a weekly newsletter. <br><br>Leo, when I was at the University of Washington, you could go up to the fourth floor and find all the old books that had been bought before they switched to the Library of Congress system. The librarians hadn't recataloged them in the new electronic system, or assigned them LoC numbers; they sat up there, forgotten by almost everyone, with their card catalog along one wall. I found some of the most astonishing things there. I have no idea if they're still there; my guess is they've been purged, in the ongoing struggle to erase the past that absorbs so much effort in contemporary American culture.<br><br>Hello, you're welcome and thank you! I'm not sure how much of the current USPS will survive the next few rounds of political and economic crisis, but postal systems are fairly easy to set up -- Ben Franklin managed it very nicely using 18th century technology, after all -- and there are also informal workarounds. More on this in a future post. <br><br>George, thank you! That's a great anecdote. <br><br>Glenn, yeah, costs keep going up; good thing inflation's under control! ;-)<br><br>Ordoliberat, if that's going to happen, someone who knows computer technology is going to have to get working on it now. You might consider taking it on as a personal challenge.<br><br>Roger, thank you. I was 29 before I first encountered the internet, while finishing up my degree; I dropped off it again as soon as I graduated, and didn't return to it until my writing career required it, most of a decade later -- so I can affirm everything you've said. <br><br>August, thanks for the detail! I knew I could count on you. ;-) For what it's worth, I think you're right about the National Traffic System -- as I've noted here more than once, that has all the features necessary for a durable and resilient long-distance communications net. <br><br>Lew, I'll certainly agree about the asparagus. We've had two side dishes of fresh homegrown asparagus so far this spring, with a third shortly on the way, and for a culinary sense of awe, it's hard to beat.<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c544380330431954784 title="comment permalink">4/30/15, 11:21 PM</a><br><br>

I think it is popular because it is faster. Fully amortizing the lifecycle cost of owning a computer, software and ongoing support services are likely to drown-out to insignificance the cost of doing the same things with paper and pencil, postage stamp or ledger book. If productivity has seen any improvement, it is because of off-shoring most externalities and reduced the number of bookkeepers in the world. In fact, a quick search of that same old Internet will show an array of studies that call into question if computers have actually increased productivity at all.<br><br>Personally, I think speed is overrated. "The speed of doing business" has just added stress to our lives. Back before cell phones, I was required by an employer to wear a beeper. I found it quite irritating, mainly because the whole point was – if you are beeped – it must be urgent. Stop what you are doing and answer it NOW! Well, in three years of wearing it, not once was a call so urgent that it would have made a spit of difference if it had waited even to the following day! Cell phones aren't much different.<br><br>Not only the Internet as a whole, but the computer itself that you are reading this on have incredibly complicated supply chains. Special sand from Africa, shipped to Germany for refining into purified silicon, shipped to China and combined with rare earths from Russia, grown into crystals, (a process, by the way, that basically requires the creation of artificial lava under exacting temperature control), assembled into finished products and further shipped to the four corners of the world. And talk about complicated technology, the processing of computer chips now requires clean rooms that have less dust than outer space, because the functional elements are smaller than visible light! With each new shrinking of the chips, they have to make a whole new factory, (Fab in computer jargon) at a cost of $5 Billion or more. And for all that, are they reliable? I have a perfectly functional mechanical typewriter that is 50 years old. If you could not replace your present computer in-whole on a regular basis, how long do you think it would last?

I would suggest that, apart fromn economics, there is a more sinister role of Internet. And that's destruction of human psyche. Who will perish first, it's hard to tell. but the race between machines and humans has begun. <br><br>In 1995, while visiting the America House library in Kiev, I had discovered on the shelf of newly arrivals a book by Stephen Talbott “The Future Does Not Compute: Transcending the Machines in our Midst" (O’Reilly, 1995). Having skimmed over a few pages, I couldn’t tear myself off the book. All my experience accumulated for years, all fears and insights regarding “the technique” – particularly, computers –were studied and described in detail by Talbott.<br> By that time, I was reading the course “Energy and Ecology” in Kiev Polytechnic and had arrived to a firm belief in the destructive character of technology against personality, nature and society; I saw that people increasingly began to substitute their humane goals with the solutions of purely technical problems. In attempt to share my fears with the colleagues, students and friends, everywhere I would bump into a bewilderment, incomprehension, and sometimes sincere enmity; eventually, I became alienated from my work, and generally, from “progress”. <br> Particularly, I sensed the negative effect of computers on human health. Having spent a considerable time in front of the computer, I spoiled my sight, and earned a host of other illnesses. I noticed that human functions had been ousted by computers in all conceivable and non-conceivable areas, in the institutions, and above all, in schools. I saw as managers of all levels had assigned work with computers to young workers, knowing that such work demands huge physical and psychic effort. I clearly understood that a gradual destruction was taking place of personal communication, degradation of psyche, human qualities and language. To resist this plague was already a huge challenge. <br> And at that very moment, I saw Stephen Talbott’s book. Having read it in one gulp, I decided to translate it and publish. But all publishers declined to publish the book, saying : How come? We have a computer boom, you can’t criticize! Meanwhile the problem was becoming more grave. My own children became obsessed with computers, whereas my attempts to limit their “sitting” were futile. Must confess, I’m very pessimistic about the future.<br> I would highly recommend the teachers of primary schools to read the book. It allows to look inside our souls and ask a troubling question: what qualities we, humans, can actually, set off against computers? <br>As long as we are able to raise these questions, there is a little hope. Otherwise we don’t have it.<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c1938479532834251511 title="comment permalink">5/1/15, 3:25 AM</a><br><br>

We have legacy networks in Britain from when we urbanised early; like water, sewage, transport, health systems (before that we regularly got cholera in our free-market choice days). Britain also needed a world food network since before 1850, and we still do as we cannot feed ourselves: that is straight calories, never mind the modern supermarket shelves. <br><br>We still needed an Empire after we lost ours.

I hear that we Brits are going to take out our on-shore legacy copper that connects all UK homes to the whole thing (telephone) and wonder if maybe optic fiber will not be quite as resilient or future-proof. <br><br>But worse still, we throw away our social collective way of making our networks universal (well... sort of universal... in Britain).

Cyber-space is a pale shadow."<br><br>I agree that cyberspace is a pale shadow, but I've found it to be very useful as dress rehearsal for real life. Just about everything I ever wanted to do in real life, I was able to put it in practice online first, then transfer into the rest of my life when I felt ready. This includes my love life, where I found more suitable mates than I did in person. I was able to take my time and achieve a better understanding of them in a low-risk environment before I ever approached them. Consequently, I wasn't fooled by looks or superficial charm, although I did end up with good-looking and charming women just the same. I also found that I was more interested in women relatively far away from me, which meant that <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2013/02/wayne-state-research-on-love-for.html rel=nofollow>I was involved in long-distance relationships that required communications technologies to maintain</a>. This was true even of my ex-wife, who I met before either of us got on the Internet and lived 60 miles away, so we did a lot of phone communication while we were dating. I met both the girlfriend I dated between marriages and my current wife online. Both lived more than 250 miles away at the time, which meant that I used the Internet a lot while dating. In retrospect, I probably wouldn't have gotten together with my ex-wife if I had met her online; she didn't express herself well in writing. That would have saved me a lot of trouble; there are reasons she's my <b>ex</b>-wife! I was much happier with my ex-girlfriend, even though that ended badly, and even happier with my wife. I don't know if I have such good fortune without being able to cast a wider net through the Internet.<br><br>That reminds me of a topic our host talked about last year--the wandering of peoples and the formation of new ethnic and national identities. Yes, people may migrate long distances, but once that is done, I expect their horizons will shrink dramatically. I suspect that most people in the post-oil future will not travel more than 20 miles, much as they did before the Industrial Revolution.<br><br>On the topic of both May Day and my love life, I leave you all with <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2014/05/drum-corps-maypoles-for-may-day.html rel=nofollow>a photo of my ex-girlfriend and some of her friends dancing around a maypole</a> while performing with a drum and bugle corps.

In some systems, if you tried to ring someone up, you rang up everybody that was hooked up. Of course all kinds of people you didn't want to talk to picked up the phone.

It is only recently that I bought my first "computer," which is an IPad bundled cheaply with my expensive SmartPhone. I rarely use the IPad, and I use the SmartPhone sparingly &amp; have a very low data storage amount, which I'm constantly being asked to increase in size (not needed; I just delete stuff).<br><br>I do use the Internet a lot at work, but mainly it's for email and/or legit research purposes. I teach people how to use the Internet for certain purposes, which can be useful.<br><br>I've always been skeptical of GPS systems; they often don't work correctly. I do use the Internet to print off maps and use them to find my way. Albeit I must admit that - with reluctance bc I know the NSA or someone is tracking me - I do refer to my SmartPhone maps function sometimes to figure out where I am going.<br><br>I use computers at work for certain financial functions. That's because we have a much more secure firewall &amp; malware, but I realize that NOTHING is secure and proceed with caution.<br><br>That said, I do like to blog here and there. And I will miss Smartphones when traveling. They are helpful devices but expensive.<br><br>Other than that I prefer to read print books. My old eyes don't like to be on a computer screen at home after doing so most of the day at work. Enough is enough.<br><br>I chucked out my tv years ago and listen to radio sparingly. I'm busy; don't need lots of gizmos and gadgets and tv shows (even high quality ones) to distract me. Would rather spend my money attending live performances or going to movies - although I am growing ever closer to going mental on my neighbors who simply cannot get off their *&amp;^% phones at the movies, at the symphony, at the theatre, at the ballet, etc. It's crazy. Spending upwards of $100 on some entertainment, and then there's these pinheads in the audience enthralled with their stupid phones. Go home and read your *&amp;^% phone there. <br><br>I have acquaintances whom I believe to have serious addiction issues with their phones. And I witness in public places how often the phone absolutely supersedes any and all face to face human conversations and interactions. It's not just younger people; it's everyone. If that *&amp;^% phone rings, boyohboy!! It's gotta be answered PRONTO! I envision wedding ceremonies being interrupted at the crucial juncture with the bride, groom or both having to answer their *&amp;^% phone before agreeing to marry the human being standing next to them. Wouldn't surprise me in the least if it's happened already.<br><br>Sigh. I think the Internet will go out with whimper, not a bang. Already there is a digital divide in our nation (and elsewhere), where the poor have limited access. Access is likely to become more expensive and for a while some percentage of the populace - those who are super addicted and they are out there - will pay and pay and pay for it.<br><br>Others, like me, will wean away gradually and not notice much difference except when attempting to drive somewhere new at night where the *&amp;^% streets signs are either non-existent or so small as to be worthless.<br><br>Interesting article and comments.

Two quick thoughts on the internet: <br><br>First, like many things which have become more available, having facts/info pop onto the screen at the touch of a button has "cheapened" the value of information (regardless if that info can be biased, misleading or outright lies). Back when one had to truck on over to the library, and then spend hours digging for the information yourself, that found info had a greater value and usually higher quality.<br><br>Second, I have thought for some time that a possible interim solution to the private internet going dark would be to have the USPS take it over. At least for the email part and perhaps private browsing. The USPS could become everyone's ISP, for a fee of course.

It feels like most of the people I encounter, even the most grounded among them just can’t get past the idea that the internet is floating around in an alternate dimension somewhere completely divorced from the laws and demands of the physical world. I wasn’t disappointed, and I thank you for this excellent overview of the internet as a piece of technology with real physical constraints and real costs. Of course, I also hadn’t expected to be quite so distracted by the sounds of cold wet reality mackerels flopping on the ground outside my balcony. I’d actually half expected a brief departure from the usual schedule this week, but it’s easy to forget that outside my area life is going on in its own normal ways with no interruptions. Still, when you’re out on your balcony doing your Monday evening gardening against a sky red and smoky from nearby fires, navigating past police blockades and national guard troops on the way to work, rescheduling long planned community events to work around mandatory government curfews, and struggling to sleep to the sounds of sirens and low flying helicopters, it’s difficult to pull out of the weirdness of the moment to think about something as mundane as the economics of the internet. For anyone wondering, things are emotional and exhausting, and there’s a strange vibe in the air, but everything I’ve seen in the newspapers has been greatly exaggerating the actual danger here. So far, the government response has been much larger and much more striking than anything I’ve seen with the protests (and definitely than the riots, which were focused on a few small areas). There’s a lot of tension, and things could change quickly, but most of what I’ve seen has been people going about their lives, going to and from work, chatting, laughing, playing in the playgrounds… though the soldiers and riot police standing by definitely adds some texture.<br><br>Anyway, trying to stay on topic: you’ve talked several times about media fasting and the advantages of cutting back from media exposure, and this week in both the essay several comments you’ve highlighted the importance of learning to replace functions the internet fills on our lives with more stable versions of the same thing (the first step of that being reducing exposure to and therefore dependency on the internet and other forms of media). There are many of us, I’m sure, who spend a good portion of their time between 9 and five on Mondays through Fridays sitting in front of computers at work. And being unemployed without a safety net is a bit more collapsing than anyone I know would choose to do. Can cutting media out of home life while still being required to use it at work have the same benefits? Or are there other ways to “recalibrate the brain towards reality” (such as time spent in stillness in natural settings) that, combined with cutting out media and internet use at home could counter the impacts of regular computer use at work?<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c6887346823352541457 title="comment permalink">5/1/15, 2:08 PM</a><br><br>

Sounds like we could be seeing an insurgency in the United States sooner than anyone expected. And think of all those young African-American men who were trained in the latest guerrilla warfare and counterinsurgency tactics by the US military and then got screwed over after they got out of the military. How many angry black veterans do you think are out there who can’t even find work after serving their country in the Middle East due to poor economic conditions and structural racism? <br><br>I remember another commenter from a few weeks ago shared a link about the Chechen government threatening to send military aid, including weapons, to the Mexican government and Hispanic separatists in the Southwest United States in retaliation for the US government fomenting anti-Russian revolutions and rebellions in the former Soviet Union. I wonder how long before the Russians, the Chinese and their allies start openly aiding American dissidents and separatists? You know what they say about payback…<br><br>Not surprisingly, the Russian media is having a field day with the news coming out of Baltimore. Some Russian media commentators are already predicting an insurgency pitting African Americans against the system. Here are English translations of a couple of op-eds that recently appeared in the Russian press:<br><br>http://fortruss.blogspot.ca/2015/04/andre-fursov-racial-lid-has-blown-off.html<br><br>http://fortruss.blogspot.ca/2015/04/african-americans-may-carry-out.html<br><br>The first columnist, Andre Fursov, who is a historian and sociologist, makes many of the same points that John Michael does. He notes that standards of living for most Americans have been declining since the mid 1970’s, that the US has kept its economy afloat by American corporations robbing the rest of the world (the imperial wealth pump the Archdruid speaks of) and that Russian economists estimate the US consumes 3-4 times as much as it produces, creating a global economic imbalance that cannot continue much longer. Fursov and many other Russian analysts believe the US is headed for another civil war, motivated in large part by centuries of pent-up racial grievances.<br><br>Fursov writes, citing Chalmers Johnson, “In the 1990's under Clinton, the US ceased to be a Republic and turned into a military empire. And it is crumbling before our eyes. This is a huge dying "dinosaur", but his "seizures" can be very dangerous for the world.

The book in question is The End of Absence by Michael Harris and you might want to check it out if you have the time. He discusses one of the things that, in our mad rush to hurl ourselves into the glowing embrace of our screens, we have almost completely lost touch with as a society - Absence. 24/7 connectivity simply isn't working out that well for homo sapiens, apparently. And neuroscience (irony of ironies) has verified this. <br><br>The ability to deal with solitude, to embrace being alone and disconnected, the ability to daydream, to be absent from the world for a period of time, the capacity to welcome loneliness and not be freaked out by it - these are things that the online generation is losing. And he asks: "Who actively seeks out loneliness?". No one, as the mainstream would say. I guess this fascination with near-ubiquitous connectivity has enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with the particular American quality of fetishizing extroverts. You're seen as abnormal if you actively seek out quietude, if you claim to like being alone. This is added to the list of "problems" that technology can/must fix.<br><br>Which is patently untrue, and has proven to be disastrous for flesh-and-blood human interaction. You can't substitute real conversation with text messages, Snapchat, and what have you. I am glad to say, however, that a lot of people around me on campus seem to be realizing that. There is a lot of work to be done, but not everyone is plugged into the Matrix.<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c2136002851539358097 title="comment permalink">5/1/15, 4:39 PM</a><br><br>

I'm fond of the Internet, not least because it lets me blog at minimal cost. I hope it survives, and not just for the wealthy few.<br> <br>Not all the complexity and expense you describe is intrinsic to the beast; it grew those layers of fat to feed resource hogs of every kind: albums of high-resolution images, video clips, audio files, and now the ultimate bandwidth-waster of streaming video. Instead of publishing a movie on a few thousand DVDs which can each be played hundreds of times, we transmit that movie over the phone line/cable network every time someone wants to watch it!<br><br>The original ARPANET was assembled out of computers already owned by universities and research facilities; the only equipment they needed to add was acoustic modems for sending files over telephone lines. They didn't put much extra load on the lines; many text files could be transmitted in the time required for one voice call, and an occasional image didn't overload the system.<br><br>Such a system could survive in a resource-poor future, as you say, probably as long as the users could afford to run computers. Files could be broadcast by shortwave radio, in those night hours when the ionosphere links half the earth in a radio network. <br><br>And computers and software don't have to be as short-lived as they seem today; I'd guess the solid-state machines -- netbooks and chromebooks -- ought to work for many years.

With modern algorithms able to filter out the ones most likely to actually build a bomb or commit to a rebellion, the security agencies are very interested in who posts what on the internet/e-mail/text messages.

I have been rereading Rollo May’s The Courage To Create, written in the 70s, and chock-full of statements that directly address this. For example the opening chapter says, “frightened by the loss of our familiar mooring places, shall we become paralyzed and cover our inaction with apathy?… [Or] Shall we consciously participate, on however small the scale, in the forming of the new society?” And he goes on to describe what he sees as necessary to the latter. He says that Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Camus and Sartre have all “proclaimed that courage is not the absence of despair; it is rather the capacity to move ahead in spite of despair.”<br><br>The part of his book that addresses this week’s post comes in the chapter on Creativity In The Unconscious – I was really impressed by how he predicted the dilemma we are now facing: “what I am saying is that the danger always exists that our technology will serve as a buffer between us and nature, a block between us and the deeper dimensions of our own experience.” And he goes on to say “for if we are not open to the unconscious, irrational, and the trans-rational aspects of creativity, then our science and technology have helped to block us off from what I shall call ‘creativity of the spirit’.… I mean creativity in art, poetry, music, and other areas that exist for our delight and the deepening and enlarging of meaning in our lives rather than for making money or for increasing technical power.” There are so many, many other parts of this book that deal with the challenges that we are now facing 40 years later that I would encourage everybody to read it if they can. It is a small book, and not difficult to read.

All I mean by saying that right now doing things via computers is cheaper is that an email costs less in immediate, direct, personal costs than a postage stamp; you can generally get products online for less than you'd pay for the same thing from a local store, and so on. The additional costs of the computer are shoved off onto others or charged indirectly, while more of the costs of the noncomputer alternative need to be paid up front. <br><br>Vic, I'm familiar with the book; I wonder if you could get it published now that people in the Ukraine have more experience with computers, and more reason to be troubled by them. <br><br>Katy/Phil, oh, granted. The shock of losing Facebook may seem dreadful at the time, but I wonder how it'll look in retrospect compared to years of extreme poverty, say, or being conscripted to fight in the next European war. <br><br>Kyoto, I tend to be a bit gloomier about the prospects of democracy and freedom; I think that a lot of people traded in actual democracy and freedom for an online simulation, and when the simulation goes away, they'll be left with neither. <br><br>Fudoshin, so noted; unfortunately people seem to be perfectly able to do us-and-them thinking without the internet, too. <br><br>Erica, funny. Glad to see someone caught that. <br><br>Ray, it's possible.

The hypersonic spaceplane gets dusted off every decade or so and paraded around as the next great leap; it's technically feasible but economically hopeless -- rumors in the aerospace scene have it that the SR-91 Aurora, a prototype hypersonic spyplane tested in the 1990s, had an operating cost of $1 million per flight, and that's for something much smaller than a jetliner.

Without the capacity to provide the services (such as streaming video) that people want enough to pay for, the only form of internet that's still viable is something like ARPAnet, which won't provide you an opportunity to blog, or do most of the other things you currently do online. <br><br>Dennis, true enough. <br><br>Cathy, thanks for this!

What did you think of the internet at first glance? <br><br>Rumighoul, we're probably on the brink of a major economic crisis, and the job you have now is probably the one you'll have -- or lose -- as the crisis unfolds. I don't recommend anything that would require going to college, either, as the costs have been inflated far beyond the value of what you get for it. That is to say, you're probably better off staying where you are, unless you have reason to think that your job is going to go away soon. <br><br>Rob, I'm trying to make sense of your comment. If we go back to doing things the way they were done before the internet, why, yes, things that weren't possible before the internet won't be possible after it, either.

The idea isn't new, but the plants have been commercially available in the UK only since September 2013 and are just hitting the US market now. To make it work, they had to find varieties of tomato and potato that had compatible maturing times, stems of equal thickness for the graft and which did not result in tomato flavored potatoes or potato flavored tomatoes (since you can buy the latter at the supermarket every winter). They wound up grafting cherry tomatoes to white potatoes.<br><br>Grafting different varieties or related species of woody plants onto a hardy rootstock is a common practice, but grafting soft tissue annuals is more trouble than it's usually worth, since you have to do it over every year.

In the US you have a lot more services (e.g. streaming video) but your monthly minimum generally is pretty high.

On the one hand you have the compulsion to go into any and all crazy techs to a degree "to avoid strategic surprise" as DARPA puts it I think. On the other hand the US probably will try to make technological dominance (partly) pay for itself - exploiting pretty much all options. This is of course not limited to the internet (see: Echolon).

Since then (to make a long story short), not only have we strung many more wires for long distances across the landscape, but we've also installed circuit breakers which will (if properly operated) automatically detect ground-induced current and disconnect the wires. We also have real-time monitoring of solar conditions, to warn grid operators. A modern Carrington Event could easily be handled as a global blackout of several days duration; inconvenient (especially if you were, say, hoisting an enormous ladle of molten steel at the time), but nothing that keeps me awake at night. <br>I'm sure it's mere coincidence, but a series of alarming stories about the danger of geomagnetic storms came out right around the time NASA was looking for more money for solar monitoring...<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c5267759047656366358 title="comment permalink">5/3/15, 5:24 PM</a><br><br>

Good Heavens! I am going to have to prepare a fitting funeral for the Net when it goes belly up, and some spiritually encouraging prayers to offer up in special ceremonies to help people heal from the trauma of being cut off personally. I'm afraid, however, that what they will want me to pray for is that the gods will smile on them and help them find the cash to fire up the old phone and go back on-line again. On the other hand, when the Internet goes, there is likely to be so much other trauma that I will be dealing with many things at once. I'll just have to play it the way it happens.<br><br>I am reminded of the time I brought up Old King Sugar as one of the worst causes of addiction. To hear the vehement denials that such a thing could be true, particularly from guys! A sweet tooth is chided as a babyish taste that you're supposed to grow out of, but that doesn't seem to help anyone actually deal with it. In fact, I'm sure that is counterproductive. I see guys denying that they like sweets, all the while their hand keeps going for the cookie bowl.<br><br>There are people who never get addicted to the Net. They can't, because they have been aware for years that wireless, digital in particular, has been making them ill. To stay in touch with people by the favored mode, they spend a limited amount of time with it, to the extent that they can tolerate it. Evidence of biological effects of this form of radiation abounds, and it is used therapeutically, as a matter of fact. Given that, I think there is more than a psychological form of addiction at play here.<br><br>One other note, the US government seems to be trying to force people to use the Net for official purposes, and there are penalties for non-compliance. The Japanese government has tried to make on-line tax filing available, but not compulsory. For oddballs like me with multiple income sources, foreign accounts, etc., they seemed to throw up their hands and start mailing me the forms again. For US taxes, though, I've got to go on line. Then I just download the forms, print them and mail them, because there seems to be compatibility issues between Japanese software and whatever the IRS is using. But I encountered one legal requirement (for reporting overseas accounts) where there is no choice but to file a report on-line. I have also heard of all kinds of grief arising from the so-called Affordable Care exchanges due to software glitches, and it sounded like people are being forced to apply on line.<br><br>I imagine that as this proceeds, a lot of people without means will find themselves unable to comply with legal requirements. Times are going to be "interesting," as they say in the famous Chinese curse. I'm sitting over here wondering how it is that people over your way are going to manage in that sort of collapse. I suppose I know the answer, too. Quoting Ambrose Bierce: "and Justice is never heard to snore, and every assassin is made a ghost and, howling, is cast into Baltimost!"<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c5133265831666002031 title="comment permalink">5/4/15, 2:20 AM</a><br><br>

Those that fall off the trail will be facing fierce competition (because many seasoned programmers with advanced degrees and/or decades of experience will be looking for any job that pays the bill) to land one amongst the shortening supply of new positions (because companies will adjust their expectations and prioritize which projects are desperately needed to continue regular operation vs which may provide strategic advantages vs which are nice to have).<br><br>I am not saying that knowing this stuff cannot be useful.

And that's probably true. But then a lot of sober thinkers in the 70s predicted civilization collapse by 2000 based on the depletion of copper, oil and other vital commodities. Maybe the biggest problem we have is that they miscalculated and, since the dire predictions didn't come true, the Archons assumed that there would always be some technological fix to every issue and stopped worrying about it.

Don't you think there'd be a general public outcry defending freedom of the Internet, freedom of information, and so on ?<br><br>That has made me think that we place our values, like freedom of information, or keeping a sense of History, yes we place our values in a certain set of technologies or social arrangements. This is one of the ways societies are kept functionning together. And maintaining one social arrangement is usually done at the expense of another. You just don't see it in everyday life because the other arrangement would look inaccurate to you. But that is a cognitive distortion created by society, a distortion necessary to maintain a common mental framework without which the current social arrangements would fall apart.<br><br>I remember I grew up both with and without the Internet. Well if you wanted to hang out with other geeks, you had quite a few options. The phone books were delivered for free to your door if you wanted so, you'd just look for the local role-palying games store, give them a phone call and use that as a bootstrap to access the local roleplaying community.<br>Dungeones &amp; Dragons was created, and enjoyed much of its popularity, way before the Internet was widely used throughout the public. Internet does not even have the monopoly of geekiness !<br><br>So for all the people out there worrying about the impending death of the Internet, I think it is not as much a concern as is the life and death of the moral values we invest our technologies with. Maybe a topic for the Well of Galabes blog too, as we are treating our technological systems the way we used to treat our deities, investing them with moral values &amp; superhuman powers. The current startup investment boom is not very far from deity worship, too. I am not saying it had no economica value by the way, but so do many other religious institutions.

It also provides a way to begin to interact with other people with the written word - a great boon for the introvert, the socially isolated, those who are very uncomfortable with real life social interactions.<br><br>But the truth is, the internet can become a crutch.

They are of a very unimaginative design - it is almost as if they gave the contracts out to an architect with a fetish for concrete!<br><br>The original fear which prompted the need to build Fort Nepean was that the Russian navy would pay a visit and the English navy would be too far away and over stretched to protect us (Victoria was a colony at the time). There was just so much gold floating around in those late 19th century times that it is surprising that only the odd bushranger or twenty thought to waylay the powers that be and help themselves to some well-deserved booty. Melbourne was the second richest city on the planet after London which of course demanded more than her fair share.<br><br>There are many examples along the north eastern coast of this continent of those forts. The Battle of the Coral Sea in WWII could have been understood to be the precursor to another attempt at a Japanese landing on the Australian continent and was not far from all of those hastily erected forts. The Japanese were certainly not mucking around and they bombed the daylights out of the far northern coastal city of Darwin. If not for the US naval and armed forces then things would not have gone well for us here at all.<br><br>I was aware of that history as I visited all of those WWII sites along the coast. Even south of Darwin there are wide tracks of land that were once allied air fields and field hospitals. What was interesting though to me at the time was how they were all left to fall into ruin and disrepair as if history had nothing to teach us today in these enlightened (sic) times...<br><br>Incidentally, I hadn't really followed the recent disturbances in Baltimore, but for some strange reason I decided to watch some media footage of the riots. What I immediately noticed was that some of the footage included looting of a pharmacy. Now that generally doesn't have any greater meaning than any other shop, but I did notice that the pharmacy was then raised to the ground and that repeated attempts to put the fire out were stopped because the firefighting hoses were slashed. Now, at that point my internal alarm bells went off and it was screaming at me - war band activity. Just sayin...<br><br>During really big bushfires here, the police have to seal off the area because apparently criminals in the past have tried to dump burnt bodies in those areas simply to be rid of them. Anyway, I stopped watching the footage of Baltimore at the point that I had that realisation...<br><br>Oh yeah, I finished re-reading The Great Crash 1929 today and thought that I would share some of my favourite quotes with you and the commenters:<br><br>"The habit of months or years, however idle it had now become, could not be abandoned at once"<br><br>"the Democratic incumbent, James J. Walker, scored a landslide victory over his Republican opponent, F. H. La Guardia, who had been soundly denounced by the Democrats as a socialist" - I'd like to say I made that one up but it is on page 146 if anyone wants to confirm it. Too funny!<br><br>"one of the oldest, most important - and, unhappily, one of the least understood - rites in American life. This is the rite of the meeting which is called not to do business but to do no business. It is a rite which is still much practised in our time." Oh yeah, I read that with a bit of personal pain for such silliness with all of the community groups here, and I reckon you know what I mean...<br><br>And his final prescient words to all, if they had but the wit to understand:<br><br>"Long-run salvation by men of business has never been highly regarded if it means disturbance of orderly life and convenience in the present. So inaction will be advocated in the present even though it means deep trouble in the future." "It is what causes men who know that things are going quite wrong to say that things are fundamentally sound."<br><br>And it was with that understanding and first-hand experience that I ran away from the top end of town.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c1671015742035722095 title="comment permalink">5/5/15, 4:38 AM</a><br><br>

I think the exercise you suggest is a useful one, though- what's the big deal about the Internet anyways? Of course, like everyone else, I'd miss the easy access to information. I think this information falls into three categories: 1, the information I could access elsewhere without too much trouble if only I weren't so lazy. Phone numbers, map locations, etc. It probably would build character for me to lose access to this category. 2, the useful specialized info that would be quite a bit more difficult to find non-digitally; I'm thinking of things like obscure recipes, many different plans for building, say, a movable chicken pen (for comparison), lots of images of the different species of a plant for ID purposes, and so on. My local library system might not have such depth (not to mention the fact that the hours keep getting cut...). It would be frustrating to go back to not being able to find out things I know I want to know. 3. The surprising info that I come across serendipitously, which I just wouldn't in daily life- certain book recommendations, say, or unusual music, which would be unlikely in my small town. Or the exotic ideas in the Archdruid Report. The unknown unknowns, one might say. This adds such richness to life these days, but of course this category isn't strictly necessary.<br><br>I do agree that the Internet allows us hermits, by temperament or by geographic circumstance, the chance to find our tribe. I think it's also a boon for introverts to be able to listen in on so many enlightening and interesting conversations without the obligation to join in unless we desire to. I consider it a great privilege to cruise the Archdruid's salon, or your blog's virtual living room, without changing out of pjs and without having to make excuses about freshening a drink to get out of less than scintillating conversations, and to watch others whose intellect I can't hope to match with fascination without being rude. That, I would miss, in the absence of the Internet. Getting such intellectual stimulation without the rigors of face to face social interaction... I really don't want to hear that this experience is like eating white bread, with essential components refined out. Guess I'm going to need to think about that one some more... <br>Thanks, I think-<br>--Heather in CA<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c1647925096617384496 title="comment permalink">5/5/15, 10:06 PM</a><br><br>

Having worked in banking, and having done honest work now for a decade since, I was stunned how many banks came running to throw low-interest loans at me when I started a new business (always a risky proposition).<br><br>To put it another way, the Fed can put the reins on a fast-growing economy by raising rates, but raising rates in a slack economy is like pushing on a string. Ask European central bankers (off the record, of course).<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c5882058668435556168 title="comment permalink">5/6/15, 6:29 AM</a><br><br>

To me that is a "no brainer" - as soon as content providers can no longer get revenue from advertisers or customers, servers and content will begin to disappear.<br><br>Another key to internet survival will be electricity and end-to-end connectedness.<br><br>If your own power becomes intermittent, I suspect one of the last things you will want to worry about when the power does come on is taking the time to boot up your computer.<br><br>More critical will be whether power is available for local internet service provider, the telephone company, the backbone providers, and all the places in between that wire an internet together. Even fiber-optic cable requires a power source every 30-40 miles, if not closer together, as that is as far as a connection can be maintained before the light signal needs to be regenerated. If you drive along freeways and railroad tracks, you will periodically see the brown concrete huts that are these repeater points. You recognize these as they are the equipment huts without a cell tower standing over it.<br><br>The internet is dependent on end-to-end connectivity so your computer can reach the server your content is coming from. All need to be up to work. The internet, at least the backbone links, can handle some routes going offline to some degree, but most local service providers that we depend on often only have one link to the backbone. Keeping all these points powered will be key.<br><br>I agree with August and a few others that in the end we will need a communication system for messages that is once again based on a design known as "store and forward." When e-mail and early bulletin boards were first developed, and before that telegraph and teletype systems, their design was that of mesage being "stored and forwarded." Sending a message took place in steps, from one server/person to another, until it reached its destination. (Unlike modern day e-mail, which generally goes in one step, although internally within an organization it might still take more than one step.) As long as alternate routes are available, a message can get through. Especially if there might be people helping to direct the movement of a message. This flexibility, and the ability for a message to sit for awhile, will be key to getting around power cuts.<br><br>Radio-based transmission schemes are potentially very flexible here, as they are not necessarily limited to just the path of a particular wire. The National Traffic System (NTS), already mentioned, is one such system. Your message - essentially a public telegram - is routed from one ham radio operator to another from where it started to where it ends up with the recipient. And both the 1980s ham radio packet BBS system and Fidonet BBS system were built on the same idea of relay. Even the U.S. national amateur radio association, the ARRL, got its start 100 years ago from the idea of relaying message, as the ARRL is the American Radio Relay League.<br><br>So I want to suggest a bare bones e-mail (or more generically "message") system could be doable and potentially very flexible in a world when electricity becomes intermittent. Even a rebirth of a telegram system might make much sense. It won't be today's internet, but the key component of the internet - the ability to send messages - can hopefully be preserved at least for a longer time.<br><br><a href=the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html#c6464519042868904595 title="comment permalink">5/6/15, 11:16 AM</a><br><br>

Most of what I've learned has been from offline mean, past and present.

Maybe people with blogs online with have their stuff published by their own local printing press. Maybe people will write long letters again( I've never used email much anyway). Maybe the 'village square' will come back and people will be social again-with no iPhones or any of that nonsense as distractions. Who knows.<br><br>Thank you very much for writing this.

What of the trained manpower with sophisticated knowledge?
