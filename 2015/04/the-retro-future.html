<div class=MsoNormal>
Is it just me, or has the United States taken yet another great leap forward into the surreal over the last few days? Glancing through the news, I find another round of articles babbling about how fracking has guaranteed America a gaudy future as a petroleum and natural gas exporter. Somehow none of these articles get around to mentioning that the United States is a major net importer of both commodities, that most of the big-name firms in the fracking industry have been losing money at a rate of billions a year since the boom began, and that the pileup of bad loans to fracking firms is pushing the US banking industry into a significant credit crunch, but that’s just par for the course nowadays. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then there’s the current tempest in the media’s teapot, Hillary Clinton’s presidential run. I’ve come to think of Clinton as the Khloe Kardashian of American politics, since she owed her original fame to the mere fact that she’s related to someone else who once caught the public eye. Since then she’s cycled through various roles because, basically, that’s what Famous People do, and the US presidency is just the next reality-TV gig on her bucket list. I grant that there’s a certain wry amusement to be gained from watching this child of privilege, with the help of her multimillionaire friends, posturing as a champion of the downtrodden, but I trust that none of my readers are under the illusion that this rhetoric will amount to anything more than all that chatter about hope and change eight years ago.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let us please be real: whoever mumbles the oath of office up there on the podium in 2017, whether it’s Clinton or the interchangeably Bozoesque figures currently piling one by one out of the GOP’s clown car to contend with her, we can count on more of the same: more futile wars, more giveaways to the rich at everyone else’s expense, more erosion of civil liberties, more of all the other things Obama’s cheerleaders insisted back in 2008 he would stop as soon as he got into office.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As Arnold Toynbee pointed out a good many years ago, one of the hallmarks of a nation in decline is that the dominant elite sinks into senility, becoming so heavily invested in failed policies and so insulated from the results of its own actions that nothing short of total disaster will break its deathgrip on the body politic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
While we wait for the disaster in question, though, those of us who aren’t part of the dominant elite and aren’t bamboozled by the spectacle du jour might reasonably consider what we might do about it all. By that, of course, I don’t mean that it’s still possible to save industrial civilization in general, and the United States in particular, from the consequences of their history. That possibility went whistling down the wind a long time ago. Back in 2005, the Hirsch Report showed that any attempt to deal with the impending collision with the hard ecological limits of a finite planet had to get under way at least twenty years before the peak of global conventional petroleum reserves, if there was to be any chance of avoiding massive disruptions. As it happens, 2005 also marked the peak of conventional petroleum production worldwide, which may give you some sense of the scale of the current mess.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Consider, though, what happened in the wake of that announcement. Instead of dealing with the hard realities of our predicament, the industrial world panicked and ran the other way, with the United States well in the lead. Strident claims that ethanol—er, solar—um, biodiesel—okay, wind—well, fracking, then—would provide a cornucopia of cheap energy to replace the world’s rapidly depleting reserves of oil, coal, and natural gas took the place of a serious energy policy, while conservation, the one thing that might have made a difference, was as welcome as garlic aioli at a convention of vampires. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That stunningly self-defeating response had a straightforward cause, which was that everyone except a few of us on the fringes treated the whole matter as though the issue was how the privileged classes of the industrial world could maintain their current lifestyles on some other resource base.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since that question has no meaningful answer, questions that could have been answered—for example, how do we get through the impending mess with at least some of the achievements of the last three centuries intact?—never got asked at all. At this point, as a result, ten more years have been wasted trying to come up with answers to the wrong question, and most of the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>doors that were still open in 2005 have been slammed shut by events since that time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Fortunately, there are still a few possibilities for constructive action open even this late in the game. More fortunate still, the ones that will likely matter most don’t require Hillary Clinton, or any other member of America’s serenely clueless ruling elite, to do something useful for a change. They depend, rather, on personal action, beginning with individuals, families, and local communities and spiraling outward from there to shape the future on wider and wider scales. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve talked about two of these possibilities at some length in posts here. The first can be summed up simply enough in a cheery sentence:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Collapse now and avoid the rush!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In an age of economic contraction—and behind the current facade of hallucinatory paper wealth, we’re already in such an age—nothing is quite so deadly as the attempt to prop up extravagant lifestyles that the real economy of goods and services will no longer support. Those who thrive in such times are those who downshift ahead of the economy, take the resources that would otherwise be wasted on attempts to sustain the unsustainable, and apply them to the costs of transition to less absurd ways of living. The acronym L.E.S.S.—“Less Energy, Stuff, and Stimulation”—provides a good first approximation of the direction in which such efforts at controlled collapse might usefully move. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The point of this project isn’t limited to its advantages on the personal scale, though these are fairly substantial. It’s been demonstrated over and over again that personal example is far more effective than verbal rhetoric at laying the groundwork for collective change. A great deal of what keeps so many people pinned in the increasingly unsatisfying and unproductive lifestyles sold to them by the media is simply that they can’t imagine a better alternative. Those people who collapse ahead of the rush and demonstrate that it’s entirely possible to have a humane and decent life on a small fraction of the usual American resource footprint are already functioning as early adopters; with every month that passes, I hear from more people—especially young people in their teens and twenties—who are joining them, and helping to build a bridgehead to a world on the far side of the impending crisis. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second possibility is considerably more complex, and resists summing up so neatly. In a series of posts here<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in 2010 and 2011, and then in my book <a href="http://www.newsociety.com/affil.mvc?Affil=ARCH&amp;Page=../Books/G/Green-Wizardry">Green Wizardry</a>, I sketched out the toolkit of concepts and approaches that were central to the appropriate technology movement back in the 1970s, where I had my original education in the subjects central to this blog. I argued then, and still believe now, that by whatever combination of genius and sheer dumb luck, the pioneers of that movement managed to stumble across a set of approaches to the work of sustainability that are better suited to the needs of our time than anything that’s been proposed since then. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Among the most important features of what I’ve called the “green wizardry” of appropriate tech is the fact that those who want to put it to work don’t have to wait for the Hillary Clintons of the world to lift a finger. Millions of dollars in government grants and investment funds aren’t necessary, or even particularly useful. From its roots in the Sixties counterculture, the appropriate tech scene inherited a focus on do-it-yourself projects that could be done with hand tools, hard work, and not much money. In an age of economic contraction, that makes even more sense than it did back in the day, and the ability to keep yourself and others warm, dry, fed, and provided with many of the other needs of life without potentially lethal dependencies on today’s baroque technostructures has much to recommend it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nor, it has to be said, is appropriate tech limited to those who can afford a farm in the country; many of the most ingenious and useful appropriate tech projects were developed by and for people living in ordinary homes and apartments, with a small backyard or no soil at all available for gardening. The most important feature of appropriate tech, though, is that the core elements of its toolkit—intensive organic gardening and small-scale animal husbandry, homescale solar thermal technologies, energy conservation, and the like—are all things that will still make sense long after the current age of fossil fuel extraction has gone the way of the dinosaurs. Getting these techniques into as many hands as possible now is thus not just a matter of cushioning the impacts of the impending era of crisis; it’s also a way to start building the sustainable world of the future right now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those two strategies, collapsing ahead of the rush and exploring the green wizardry of appropriate technology, have been core themes of this blog for quite a while now. There’s a third project, though, that I’ve been exploring in a more abstract context here for a while now, and it’s time to talk about how it can be applied to some of the most critical needs of our time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<a href=../../2006/07/climbing-down-ladder.html>In the early days of this blog</a>, I pointed out that technological progress has a feature that’s not always grasped by its critics, much less by those who’ve turned faith in progress into the established religion of our time. Very few new technologies actually meet human needs that weren’t already being met, and so the arrival of a new technology generally leads to the abandonment of an older technology that did the same thing. The difficulty here is that new technologies nowadays are inevitably more dependent on global technostructures, and the increasingly brittle and destructive economic systems that support them, than the technologies they replace. New technologies look more efficient than old ones because more of the work is being done somewhere else, and can therefore be ignored—for now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the basis for what I’ve called <a href=../../2015/02/the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html>the externality trap</a>. As technologies get more complex, that complexity allows more of their costs to be externalized—that is to say, pushed onto someone other than the makers or users of the technology. The pressures of a market economy guarantee that those economic actors who externalize more of their costs will prosper at the expense of those who externalize less. The costs thus externalized, though, don’t go away; they get passed from hand to hand like hot potatoes and finally pile up in the whole systems—the economy, the society, the biosphere itself—that have no voice in economic decisions, but are essential to the prosperity and survival of every economic actor, and sooner or later those whole systems will break down under the burden.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unlimited technological progress in a market economy thus guarantees the economic, social, and/or environmental destruction of the society that fosters it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The externality trap isn’t just a theoretical possibility. It’s an everyday reality, especially but not only in the United States and other industrial societies. There are plenty of forces driving the rising spiral of economic, social, and environmental disruption that’s shaking the industrial world right down to its foundations, but among the most important is precisely the unacknowledged impact of externalized costs on the whole systems that support the industrial economy. It’s fashionable these days to insist that increasing technological complexity and integration will somehow tame that rising spiral of crisis, but the externality trap suggests that exactly the opposite is the case—that the more complex and integrated technologies become, the more externalities they will generate. It’s precisely because technological complexity makes it easy to ignore externalized costs that progress becomes its own nemesis. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yes, I know, suggesting that progress isn’t infallibly beneficent is heresy, and suggesting that progress will necessarily terminate itself with extreme prejudice is heresy twice over. I can’t help that; it so happens that in most declining civilizations, ours included, the things that most need to be said are the things that, by and large, nobody wants to hear. That being the case, I might as well make it three for three and point out that the externality trap is a problem rather than a predicament. The difference, as longtime readers know, is that <a href=../../2006/08/problems-and-predicaments.html>problems can be solved, while predicaments can only be faced</a>. We don’t have to keep loading an ever-increasing burden of externalized costs on the whole systems that support us—which is to say, we don’t have to keep increasing the complexity and integration of the technologies that we use in our daily lives. We can stop adding to the burden; we can even go the other way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course suggesting that, even thinking it, is heresy on the grand scale. I’m reminded of <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/a-radical-pessimists-guide-to-the-next-10-years/article1321040/?page=all">a bit of technofluff in the Canadian media a week or so back</a> that claimed to present a radically pessimistic view of the next ten years. Of course it had as much in common with actual pessimism as lite beer has with a pint of good brown ale; the worst thing the author, one Douglas Coupland, is apparently able to imagine is that industrial society will keep on doing what it’s doing now—though the fact that more of what’s happening now apparently counts as radical pessimism these days is an interesting point, and one that deserves further discussion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The detail of this particular Dystopia Lite that deserves attention here, though, is Coupland’s dogmatic insistence that “you can never go backward to a lessened state of connectedness.” That’s a common bit of rhetoric out of the mouths of tech geeks these days, to be sure, but it isn’t even remotely true. I know quite a few people who used to be active on social media and have dropped the habit. I know others who used to have allegedly smart phones and went back to ordinary cell phones, or even to a plain land line, because they found that the costs of excess connectedness outweighed the benefits. Technological downshifting is already a rising trend, and there are very good reasons for that fact. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Most people find out at some point in adolescence that there really is such a thing as drinking too much beer. I think a lot of people are slowly realizing that the same thing is true of connectedness, and of the other prominent features of today’s fashionable technologies. One of the data points that gives me confidence in that analysis is the way that people like Coupland angrily dismiss the possibility. Part of his display of soi-disant pessimism is the insistence that within a decade, people who don’t adopt the latest technologies will be dismissed as passive-aggressive control freaks. Now of course that label could be turned the other way just as easily, but the point I want to make here is that nobody gets that bent out of shape about behaviors that are mere theoretical possibilities. Clearly, Coupland and his geek friends are already contending with people who aren’t interested in conforming to the technosphere. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s not just geek technologies that are coming in for that kind of rejection, either. These days, in the town where I live, teenagers whose older siblings used to go hotdogging around in cars ten years ago are doing the same thing on bicycles today. Granted, I live in a down-at-the-heels old mill town in the north central Appalachians, but there’s more to it than that. For a lot of these kids, the costs of owning a car outweigh the benefits so drastically that cars aren’t cool any more. One consequence of that shift in cultural fashion is that these same kids aren’t contributing anything like so much to the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, or to the other externalized costs generated by car ownership. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve written here already about <a href=../../2015/01/the-one-way-forward.html>deliberate technological regression</a> as a matter of public policy. Over the last few months, though, it’s become increasingly clear to me that deliberate technological regression as a matter of personal choice is also worth pursuing. Partly this is because the deathgrip of failed policies on the political and economic order of the industrial world, as mentioned earlier, is tight enough that any significant change these days has to start down here at the grassroots level, with individuals, families, and communities, if it’s going to get anywhere at all; partly, it’s because technological regression, like anything else that flies in the face of the media stereotypes of our time, needs the support of personal example in order to get a foothold; partly, it’s because older technologies, being less vulnerable to the impacts of whole-system disruptions, will still be there meeting human needs when the grid goes down, the economy freezes up, or something really does break the internet, and many of them will still be viable when the fossil fuel age is a matter for the history books. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, there’s another aspect, and it’s one that the essay by Douglas Coupland mentioned above managed to hit squarely: the high-tech utopia ballyhooed by the first generation or so of internet junkies has turned out in practice to be a good deal less idyllic, and in fact a good deal more dystopian, than its promoters claimed. All the wonderful things we were supposedly going to be able to do turned out in practice to consist of staring at little pictures on glass screens and pushing buttons, and these are not exactly the most interesting activities in the world, you know. The people who are dropping out of social media and ditching their allegedly smart phones for a less connected lifestyle have noticed this.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s more, a great many more people—the kids hotdogging on bikes here in Cumberland are among them—are weighing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the costs and benefits of complex technologies with cold eyes, and deciding that an older, simpler technology less dependent on global technosystems is not just more practical, but also, and importantly, more fun. True believers in the transhumanist cyberfuture will doubtless object to that last point, but the deathgrip of failed ideas on societies in decline isn’t limited to the senile elites mentioned toward the beginning of this post; it can also afflict the fashionable intellectuals of the day, and make them proclaim the imminent arrival of the future’s rising waters when the tide’s already turned and is flowing back out to sea. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
I’d like to suggest, in fact, that it’s entirely possible that we could be heading toward a future in which people will roll their eyes when they think of Twitter, texting, 24/7 connectivity, and the rest of today’s overblown technofetishism—like, dude, all that stuff is <i>so</i> twenty-teens! Meanwhile, those of us who adopt the technologies and habits of earlier eras, whether that adoption is motivated by mere boredom with little glass screens or by some more serious set of motives, may actually be on the cutting edge: the early adopters of the Retro Future. We’ll talk about that more in the weeks ahead. </div>

It broke and I didn't replace it, went back to my old flip phone. I'd only had it for a year - I needed it for a work project - and it was quite addictive.

I've never done social media (fakebook and twittering), thank Jobs, so I won't miss that. <br><br>Dropping back to the old technology really means having more time on my hands. I am spending substantially less time fiddling with my phone. It's amazing how a personal efficiency device took up so much of my time. I notice already that I'm reading more books (joined the library today) and walking more. Plus I'm saving a good amount of money. Much like when we got rid of the TV several years ago now.

You can't get back to it quickly by INDEPENDENT "mutations", because it evolved as a highly interconnected network. I think it will take a really long time, more than a few generations. Much pain could be avoided by speeding up the process with a CONCERTED effort of specialists--farmers, engineers, pre-industrial craftspeople, historians of technology, alternative medical practitioners. I mean they don't have to start as specialists, they just have to be serious about devoting their time to some specialized pursuit of this COLLECTIVE effort.<br><br>In the intentional community where I live, there are a few such people but not enough. Most are seduced by the current system to make more money with less effort by plugging into the service economy. I don't blame them--they are mostly just trying to survive. The vintner has a day job as a cook. The CSA farmers have such jobs too. The dairy farmers/beekepers are able to scrape by selling raw milk and honey. The wooden spoonmaker left when we found out the owner was going to sell the land because he wanted a mass production factory to produce alot more stuff and employ alot more people. People are still giving it a shot though, with new businesses. I am chainsawing firewood and splitting it (though with petroleum-run machines) for sale. Another guy is milling trees into lumber with a petroleum guzzling saw. Someone else is processing/cleaning wool from local sheep with a propane furnace. I weave cloth with a human powered loom, my partner spins yarn, we bike, we have a bike shop. I help garden and in the vineyard (but we are using tractors sometimes and electrical pumps and other materials from industrial system), I am trying mushroom cultivation, I am trying to build a thermal-solar mirror and storage device, We have water from rain year round and a low-tech way to filter it, we have heat from wood for cooking and heating. But it is just a drop in the ocean, it is kindergarden, without coordination and enough people who devote their lives to this. We need to stop pretending that we can do all this without the industrial machine and look at how we can seriously cut dependence on it. I can't do it all myself though...<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c6068867907401110744 title="comment permalink">4/15/15, 7:15 PM</a><br><br>

Flush toilets are fairly simple devices, but if you want a prime example of externalization or increased cost, there it is. My old house has a septic tank, and my plumber says it pre-dates the leach field concept. He says that a system this age would typically have a single pipe that runs generally down hill, dissipating moisture as it goes. I look down hill and see the shallow muddy pond of cattails. Don't swim there.<br><br>On the other hand, a new system runs something like $20k, and is a mound of concrete vaults with a footprint nearly as large as my planned next residence.<br><br>Luckily, I live in a place with relatively few and simple building regulations.

That hiss you hear is the shale bubble deflating. The reporter then tried to spin the situation into a buying opportunity for oil futures, noting that both WTI and Brent were above their 100-day moving averages for the first time since June 2014. In the meantime, the actual prices of WTI, Brent, and RBOB gasoline feedstock were actually down from last week. I'll buy that story when the futures set new highs for the year.

Yeah, it only took seven years for that to happen, the longest duration of not setting a new driving record in U.S. history. Eventually, the decreased supply and increased demand will cause prices to increase, but not any time very soon. Maybe by this time next year, the price of oil and other energy will rise high enough to suck the money out of people's wallets and send the U.S. into official recession again.

Social media has never "floated my boat" as they say, so you won't find me on it. As an interesting side story too: I was once stalked on social media - Facebook, in fact - and only heard about that weirdness through a friend. Yes, the individual made some unpleasant threats, which were happily related to me (the great unburdening, perhaps?), and no further evidence was required that such communication systems had far greater costs than benefits - as I suspect a lot of people find.<br><br>Funnily enough, I don't contribute as much these days to the forums relating to solar energy - particularly off grid systems - because there was a bit of a minor difference of opinions. It is sort of weird really, because a lot of the equipment I use here relating to solar power is very old school and locally made. Much of it is still made here and it is all locally repairable too - one of the suppliers operates a factory in the inner north of Melbourne and they were very helpful when needed.<br><br>Anyway, to cut a long story short, there was a shift in the preferences displayed by the off grid people towards the newer technology of MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) regulators and lithium batteries. I stuck with the old school and very mature technology of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) and sealed Lead Acid batteries - and thus was relegated to the fringes.<br><br>Man, don't you know that is so 70's? Get with the program, dude!<br><br>Hehe! There are benefits to the newer technologies and I can't dispute that. However, there are also downsides to the newer MPPT regulators which have a very nifty trick of varying voltage and amps to achieve the best possible combination so that the batteries charge more efficiently. However, in performing that neat trick which makes them about 10% more or less efficient under some weather conditions is that those devices run hotter. In a hot climate that is no small thing. The electronics here in the battery room have rarely exceeded 26'C (79'F), but I have read accounts of the newer technologies running at more than double that temperature and they require fan forced cooling systems. Fans break or get clogged up with gunk, when you least expect it. The older systems can also be bypassed if for any reason they break, whereas the newer ones cannot be bypassed without major rewiring.<br><br>cont...<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c8497749779858477827 title="comment permalink">4/15/15, 7:57 PM</a><br><br>

It is not a gamble that I'd like to make. Also it is worth mentioning that because people are upgrading, some of the older stuff which will have a longer life span is available really cheap second hand. Go figure?<br><br>And lithium batteries, well they require a whole new technology called a battery management system in order to ensure that the individual cells don't become out of balance with each other. They are more efficient though and you get more bang for your buck and the batteries themselves are much smaller and lighter than lead acid, but well you know, lead acid batteries require far less ongoing supervision – just because a machine is supervising the system, doesn’t mean that it can operate unsupervised.<br><br>So, we have a difference of opinion and I get shouted down for being like: so 70's man! Don't listen to him he lives in a cave! hehe! It would be funny, if it wasn’t really happening.<br><br>Just a bit of a brief update on the local group situation here. I must confess that it was profoundly disturbing to say to the remaining members: "The group is dying. I pointed out the severe drop in active members over the past 12 months. I suggested that the cause was the lack of formal process in the meetings which made them hostage to whomever had an idea and they also went over long. I also suggested that the group identify its raison d'être and then conduct activities based around that reason." I repeated the message four times and delivered it in an objective and a neutral delivery.<br><br>Well, the disturbing part was that the other people involved in the meeting unanimously blamed the people that were no longer involved. My experience with such responses is that sooner or later when I'm not around, they'll be saying that about me too.<br><br>Yesterday I took the novel approach of simply telephoning past members to have a bit of a (group and politic free) chat and see how they and their gardens were growing.<br><br>There's no need to tell me that leadership can possibly become senile and out of touch! Hehe!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: My latest blog post is up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>The leaning tower of water</a>. Some repairs were made to the chickens water system with the help of a visitor. Excess rock crusher dust is converted into a fertiliser.

One is an article saying that now the fracking boom is fizzling, America needs to ramp up production in the Arctic in a big way. There was a real undertone of desperation in the article. The other was an op-ed talking about the California water crisis. The article mentions towards the end in passing that heresy of heresies for the pseudoconservative right: global warming. <br><br>It points out that geological evidence suggests that the last century was an unusually wet one for the southwestern United States by historical standards and that the climate will likely be much drier in the future. But the same article goes on to insist that this is something that can be solved by tinkering with the system of water rights, better technology and more rational economic incentives. <br><br>It hasn’t crossed the minds of many yet that there is no way in the world that an arid place like California can sustain the sort of large, highly complex society that it has metastasized into without cheap fossil fuels and that the basic problem is that California is grossly overpopulated and overdeveloped. Tinkering with water rights (which is probably a non-starter given the nature of special interest politics, the power of the agribusiness lobby in California and the sheer complexity of the legal issues involved) and building desalination plants won’t solve that basic predicament. It was noted by early European explorers that the Native American tribes in California tended to be poorer and more primitive those of the Pacific Northwest or the Great Plains and they explained this by pointing out that the environment was harsher than the environments that the tribes of the Northwest or the Great Plains lived in.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c6850050476539445844 title="comment permalink">4/15/15, 8:22 PM</a><br><br>

I have never owned a smart phone, and never will, I'm completely uninterested in them and actually hate them. I am not on Twitter, BaceFook, or other social media; yes, I blog and do e-mail, but if those things become impossible in the future, I won't be too upset about it for too long.<br><br>I'm also an insulin-dependent diabetic on an insulin pump. When the big crash occurs, if there is not a way to get insulin from where it is made (Indiana?) to where I currently live (Washington state), my life contracts to the length of time that I have sufficient supplies and insulin to live at subsistence levels of it, which (under ideal circumstances) might be as long as six months, or could be mere days, depending on when I last got refills. Stockpiling isn't an option, as insulin goes bad after a year; and even if I did have a stockpile, if there was no electricity, then the insulin would go bad in a matter of days as it needs to be refrigerated.<br><br>I am not the worst-off, health-wise, person that I know. What will happen to all of us when things go belly-up? No matter what other changes I would have to make, or have already made (and understand, I do not disagree with anything you've mentioned above), insulin is a necessity for me, and at present, is entirely controlled by a corrupt pharmaceutical corporation, the interstate transport systems, and so forth.<br><br>Because no one has actually addressed this topic yet, I'd be very interested in hearing your thoughts on the matter.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c7405918765455584549 title="comment permalink">4/15/15, 8:39 PM</a><br><br>

Then I plan on allowing myself only late Wednesday afternoons and evenings to peruse the web and to possibly order any supplies that I may need.<br><br>My hope is that within a year I will have us 90% self-sufficient in food, buying only cooking oil, butter, coffee, tea, and spices. We have a good local supplier of grass fed, free-range beef.<br><br>The tasks I have set for myself should pretty well take care of my internet addiction. But, of course, I'll never give up this blog!<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c1725442595228075544 title="comment permalink">4/15/15, 8:42 PM</a><br><br>

The region is good for fishing and potato cultivation, it has a strong cultural integrity and we have a good infrastructure for housing extended familly members and practicing extensive gardening<br>(communities that abide and green wizardery are on my bedside table-). <br>The trick is convincing my parents to take a plane ticket there once the crisis starts to bite hard as montreal is probably not the best place for us to stay.<br>Anyway, I hope my english is not too ankward at times, I learned the expressions and the grammar mostly through experience and mimickery so it may be strange at times. <br><br>Thank you anyway for all your work, It will probably save my life in the next 20 years as well as thousand of other people's.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c2784793556174185406 title="comment permalink">4/15/15, 8:43 PM</a><br><br>

On April 1, I did a little piece about Google Glass. Toward the end, I reported on rumors of another bit of wearable technology, Googlepants:<br><br><i>“If this is more than just vaporwear,” said a cautious but hopeful Mansfield, “Googlepants will do for pedestrians what the Google Car is poised to do for drivers.” Software geeks and engineers, some with purported inside info, say the pants use radar-like sensors combined with tiny electric pulses to guide the user’s legs and avoid obstacles and dangers, such as smart phone users, texting drivers, and Google Glass wearers.</i><br><br>While I thought I was safely in the realm of farce, exactly one week later I read this:<br><br><i>...The Apple Watch’s most ingenious feature is its “taptic engine,” which alerts you to different digital notifications by silently tapping out one of several distinct patterns on your wrist. As you learn the taps over time, you will begin to register some of them almost subconsciously: incoming phone calls and alarms feel throbbing and insistent, a text feels like a gentle massage from a friendly bumblebee, and a coming calendar appointment is like the persistent pluck of a harp. After a few days, I began to get snippets of information from the digital world without having to look at the screen — or, if I had to look, I glanced for a few seconds rather than minutes.</i><br><br>Yes, The New York Times tech reviewer is ecstatic over the prospect of being prodded by a machine for the rest of his life. (Note that he is already preparing himself to abandon the previous technology!)<br><br> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/technology/personaltech/apple-watch-bliss-but-only-after-a-steep-learning-curve.html?_r=0" rel=nofollow>Here's the link</a> and a few more choice snippets:<br><br><br><i>...By notifying me of digital events as soon as they happened, and letting me act on them instantly, without having to fumble for my phone, the Watch became something like a natural extension of my body — a direct link, in a way that I’ve never felt before, from the digital world to my brain...</i><br><br>No more pesky phone fumbles! (So many people have them constantly in front of them, the only time they fumble is putting it away.)<br> <br><i>..As the tech analyst Tim Bajarin has written, Apple also seems to be pushing a vision of the Watch as a general-purpose remote control for the real world, a nearly bionic way to open your hotel room, board a plane, call up an Uber or otherwise have the physical world respond to your desires nearly automatically....</i><br><br>Hey, I'll take a private oil supply and all the organic veggies I can eat, please. Oh, and those thousand virgins? Thanks!<br><br><i>What’s most thrilling about the Apple Watch...is the way it invests a user with a general sense of empowerment...the Watch builds the digital world directly into your skin. It takes some time getting used to, but once it clicks, this is a power you can’t live without.</i><br><br>Bingo! Just as The Archdruid predicted--can't go back, can't live without it! I mean, how to give up that...empowerment!<br><br>I'm trying--no car for 2.5 years now, basic clam shell cell phone (constantly figuring how to get back to land line. I always said civilization started down when the phone climbed off the kitchen wall.)

I'll try to make time to pop over to your site in a bit. <br><br>Dan, sounds like a plan. Composting toilets are on the agenda here -- we're in town, so will have to get a UL-approved model, but when funds permit, it's going to happen. <br><br>John, do you recall Plato's comment on the effects of writing? Arguments over whether technology fosters learning or the opposite go back a very long way. <br><br>CJ, the crucial thing is don't try to bring people on board. Go about your life, do your Green Wizard thing, and don't worry about other people following your example. Some will, after a certain amount of leaning over the fence and marveling at your garden, or what have you; others won't; it's as things tighten up, and your choices continue to work while others don't, that you can expect more interest. That is to say: all this is playing a long game, as long as your life or longer. <br><br>Nick, delighted to hear it. <br><br>Pinku-Sensei, no surprises there. These days I read the US media only when I want to know how our decline is going to be spin-doctored this time around. <br><br>Hapibeli, delighted to hear that, too! <br><br>Cherokee, I really wonder where this bizarre inability to think about the lessons and consequences of failure comes from. It's as though the senility of the elites has penetrated much further down the social ladder than it usually does. <br><br>Sven, exactly. The degree of detachment from the real world in the US media these days has gone past the merely delusional into the profoundly surreal. <br><br>WW, Gibson's a smart guy, so I'll take that as a compliment. <br><br>Aedicula, I'd encourage you to go back and read some of the earlier posts. As I've discussed at great length, the future we face isn't one where everything goes belly up one fine day; it's a long, slow, ragged fractal decline, equivalent to the fall of Rome or the collapse of any other civilization you care to name, during which people will scramble to maintain their access to the things they need to survive; some will succeed, others will not. It's impossible to know in advance which resources will become impossible to get in any given place, because that depends on cascading sequences of change in which unpredictable factors play a massive role. Thus you could be unable to get insulin at some point as things unwind, and die; or you could live out something like a normal lifespan and go to your grave from some other cause before anything of the sort happens. <br><br>I'd also point out that everyone who's taking part in this conversation is going to die of something. The decline and fall of industrial civilization means that quite a few of us will die of things that an intact industrial society would have been able to prevent. That's part of the normal process. Given your background -- I'm guessing that, like most worshippers of Antinous, you have a solid reading knowledge of Latin -- I'd encourage you to check out some of the late Roman historians who chronicled the last years of the Western Empire and its aftermath; that'll give you a good basic template for the sort of thing we're facing.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c5151828021467885934 title="comment permalink">4/15/15, 9:17 PM</a><br><br>

I suspect that a great deal of that inability arises from faith in the vast infrastructure in our societies which shields us from the stupidity of our own actions.<br><br>I'll give you an example of what I'm trying to say: Down Under on hot windy days, we have a Total Fire Ban declared. This has all sorts of implications and can mean far more than what most people think it does mean. Most of the old timers tend to understand what it means and live within those limits. However, you'll occasionally get some dolt – often weekend farmers - who just don't get what it means and they’ll hear the ban declared, look out into their paddocks and think to themselves, gee, that dried grass is a bit long. So they get into their tractor and start the slasher and trundle around their paddocks - without even realising they're breaking the law. Eventually as happens, the slasher unit on the back of the tractor hits a rock and produces a spark which then ignites the very dry grass and before the person on the tractor even knows it, there is a fire burning behind the tractor which then quickly spreads.<br><br>Then at vast expense in terms of resources, energy and volunteers time, the now raging fire destroys thousands of hectares and threatens a nearby town. I saw this happen in Daylesford in 2009.<br><br>I suspect that the vast support services which shield us from the worst of our mistakes at huge costs to the community also tend to make us very blind (or very blasé) to risk and failure.<br><br>Dunno, there is probably more to it as well. I live in a remote area so have to consider failures in systems, whereas other people seem to be able to ignore that risk.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c2183875598363839144 title="comment permalink">4/15/15, 10:07 PM</a><br><br>

Less energy and stuff I can manage without mourning; but less stimulation I am not cool with. My life was a constant quest for "enough to read" until the Internet and smart phones together gave me an infinite supply of smart people's opinions and skills to read about. Fortunately, it seems to me that connectivity is <i>cheap</i> in resources compared to energy and stuff. Much of the "cost" of a smartphone today is an artifact of vampire capitalism; Apple can sell a smartphone with $150 worth of stuff in it for $600, so they do; but in other parts of the world where $50 is a stretch for most people, $50 smartphones already exist, albeit with fewer bells, whistles, and designer grace notes. Thus I am intensely hopeful that connectivity and devices to enjoy it with will remain affordable (albeit probably costing a much greater percentage of my surplus productivity) for the remainder of my natural life. <br><br>But meanwhile back at the ranch, I'm urgently aware that the $1.00-a-pound carbohydrate staples (mostly dried legumes, noodles, and fresh frozen corn) I enjoy at my local Megalo-Mart are <b>not</b> likely to be a feature I can count on during my (drier, hotter, poorer, more-dangerous weather) retirement-aged future. Those just-in-time trucks won't run forever, and I'm not confident they'll outlive me. And so my "collapse now" efforts are focused on teaching myself the non-trivial skills required to grow food without petrochemical inputs in a place that birthed the term "dustbowl" eighty years ago.<br><br>What I'm learning is that permaculture and organic gardening are great tools in the hands of expert gardeners, but the plant carnage that results when a rank amateur stuffs seeds in the local native (poor) soil is impressive in its scale and totality. But slowly (please don't pay any mind to the plant body count) I learn. Each year I perfect something else, or get a few more perennial herbs established, or get one or two more fruit trees up tall enough that the deer cannot murder them. <br><br>Judging by my current progress, you'll starve <b>hard</b> if you try to make a standing start on the day the just-in-time grocery trucks stop running. My advice after two years of concentrated effort: start now, and pray that you've got five (or better yet) ten years to learn what you are doing before you <i>need</i> the skills you're learning.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c1085962822869783074 title="comment permalink">4/15/15, 11:01 PM</a><br><br>

It's more than a tiny bit ironic that none of us would be connected with the wisdom we so crave from JMG without the Internet and/or smart phones. I too would be lost for reading material in the absence of the Internet. So much is written lately that I love to read and it's all available for instant download to my kindle. And yes, I've downloaded JMG's work that way.<br><br>I too am attempting to collapse now, which appears to be on the same timeline as yours. I started a garden two years ago, so this is my third spring planting. I have experienced some epic failures, but have also experienced some very encouraging successes. Growing potatoes, for instance. My first year, I simply planted two rows and waited until they turned brown and harvested. From 15 lbs. of seed, I got nearly 50 lbs. of potatoes! Now I'm learning the importance of planting deep in trenches, so we can "hill" the potatoes and increase yield. <br><br>This year I added a chicken coop and we have a pet Vietnamese potbellied pig who makes buckets of the best fertilizer I've ever seen! My neighbors look at me like I have 3 heads when I'm out in the yard scooping up pig poop and putting it in a bucket. But it sure makes for healthy tomatoes. <br><br>I suppose what I'm learning is what grows well where I am located, just like you, Bacchus. One thing I've given up on is squash. The vine borers get it every time. So my collapsed future will not include squash. But it will include cabbage, cukes, lots of beans, lettuce, onions and peppers of all varieties. <br><br>You summed up my philosophy perfectly. The time to learn how to grow food is BEFORE your life depends on it.<br><br>As for other aspects of collapse, I tried the double-edged safety razor from a couple posts back. I gave it my best effort, but I'm back to the modern double-blade cheapies. My face couldn't handle the constant razor burn and poor shave. That aspect of collapse will have to wait until the real thing. But I suppose then, it won't be necessary to shave daily, so when I do shave, it won't be so bad. The Monday shaves on 2 days' beard growth were good. It was the remaining 4 days that kept me feeling blistered.<br><br>Keep up the good work JMG!<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c7806889714056770978 title="comment permalink">4/16/15, 5:53 AM</a><br><br>

It clearly shows the flaw in comparing an economy to a living thing. An economy can increase or decrease it its activity, but growth really only goes one way unless you're Benjamin Button. Additionally, growth inevitably leads to death and decay, which most economists don't believe about the economy. <br>A contracting economy is so contrary to their thinking that they can’t even be bothered to address it with proper terminology, so you can only imagine how much serious thought has been put into the condition as a whole. The use of “negative growth” shows that the experts still don't believe that the economy can reverse/decline/contract. They have to know "negative growth" is a non-sense term and should be embarrassed to use it in public. I can only assume that they must figure that this situation is so temporary that they can afford to briefly acknowledge it in this silly way and hope it passes before anyone notices. So far I've not hear anyone call them out on it, so it must be working for them.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c5944681571803589681 title="comment permalink">4/16/15, 6:36 AM</a><br><br>

The older I get (I'm 36) the less enamored I am of kitchen gadgets which are an unholy pain to dis/assemble and clean. I set great value on our washing machine - I did all my laundry by hand for a year when studying abroad in Russia, so I know it can be done, but it is truly labor. If I had to wash my, my husband's, and our 2 kids' clothes by hand, in water I gathered and heated by hand, I would disappear 80% of it and get aprons for everyone. We also use a dishwasher, an electric kettle, and a toaster, but those are merely conveniences. The other things are inconveniences that are noisy, hard to clean, and gobble storage space. <br><br>I think part of the success of domestic technology is due to the atomization of the family. It can be a lonely task to run a household alone, especially if you are struggling to entertain children under the age of reason at the same time. Completely different if granny or a spinster aunt lives with the family - or even if you are on social terms with your neighbors, and/or have family within walking distance.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c2603632635631852747 title="comment permalink">4/16/15, 6:42 AM</a><br><br>

"the commercialisation of farming has led us to view land, water and nature as private property and the life of the land, our symbionts, as commodities.

I've been attending classes about growing crops in 'high tunnels' (simple low-tech green houses) and the class included suggestions about how to market your production. A part of the course involved the necessity of having a "great website" where potential customers can go to view and purchase what one grows. Eventually, one of the attendees spoke out and said she has been selling everything she could grow for ten years without a website and had no need for such. When asked how she did it, she said; <i>"by word of mouth, and I put out some paper flyers early on".</i> One instructor went on about how that "just won't fly these days. People don't think that way any more". I expect he was following his government script.<br><br>Anyway, next week I'm attending a workshop on how to get an 'organic certification', and one of the speakers will explain how to "enhance the success of your organic operation with new technology". That should be enlightening.<br><br>I'm still on the fence about the sustainability of growing in a high tunnel - the plastic needs to be replaced every 4-6 years, and it does involve a government grant and annual inspections for four years (to make sure you actually grow things), but considering climate change, that crop failures will be more impactful going forward, and that these structures can significantly improve success rates and extend growing seasons, it seems 'appropriate' to give it a try.

I was born in 1961, so have similar memories of the appropriate technology movement. I actually did the exercise on energy in elementary school, tracing the links from sun to plants, to animals, to decay, to geology, to fossil fuels. Back then, National Geographic did an article on energy. I distinctly remember its breathless optimism about nuclear fusion. Tokomaks! Inertial confinement! Ten to twenty years! That was the early 70s. Oy.<br><br>I really liked your depiction of an early 20th century home, especially the battery powered radio. My grandmother lived for many years in a rural home near Havre de Grace, Maryland. The only plumbing was a pump in the kitchen, heat was fireplace and woodstove, an outhouse stood out back. She raised chickens, gardened, hung out her laundry. After her children moved away, she lived there alone, with only a cousin nearby. She finally moved into a "modern" home in the mid 60s. At family gatherings, we marvel at her toughness, but she never saw herself as tough. <br><br>I myself could easily do without television, even though this week I geeked out by binge watching "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea."

Our neighbor, a mandarin rancher, was away for a day in late May. His elderly dad felt that Junior hadn't gotten the weeds cut back in the orchards well enough- it was getting to be fire season, you know! So dad got out there with the tractor (with a shovel on the back, as always, in case of sparks), but didn't notice or react to the inevitable quickly enough, and the entire neighborhood was lucky that the resulting fire didn't quite reach the leaning oaks that form a canopy over the only road in or out. Fortunately there is a rural fire station only five miles away, and fortunately we have excellent fire defenses around our house, and fortunately the other neighbors sprung into action to help my husband hold off the advancing flames with a garden hose long enough for the fire trucks to arrive.<br><br>I am sure there are multiple morals tucked in there- the folly of being aware of danger approaching, but choosing a response that is already too late for the situation; the importance of being as prepared as possible (structurally and community-wise) for the dangers that you are likely to face; and maybe the realization that, as prepared as we try to be, without a whole lotta luck and some functioning systems, the chances are good that we are going to be toast anyways at some point, eventually.<br><br>On that cheerful note- great post as always, JMG. <br><br>--Heather in CA<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c4441640586526223730 title="comment permalink">4/16/15, 7:50 AM</a><br><br>

What I'm sharing is a hope (not a prediction) that when all the accounts come due and external costs are internalized and settled up, we'll discover that some sort of decentralized pared-down solar-powered or even hand-cranked person-to-person and point-to-point packet-radio-driven heavily-cached store-and-forward at-least-regional networked communication system will survive that's cheap enough to use at least partially for recreational purposes. Will it support HD video of endless funny cats? Maybe not. But something like UseNet at its prime? I don't think we know the sums well enough to rule that out.<br><br>Vernor Vinge's 1984 book <i>Peace War</i> had as a modest plot point a technologically-suppressed society in the American west that maintained a cottage industry of electronics craftsmen. Their long distance communications depended on careful bouncing of sophisticated radio packets off features in the ionosphere. I don't claim this is a likely outcome or method, I'm just using it as an example of how far it is possible to scale back our recreational connectivity before it's lost altogether.<br><br>Even if you're right that we lose most of the electronics industry by the time the fractal collapse process is well advanced, I think the very fractal nature of it is going to allow for manufacture of some scaled-back essential components (traded by burro and windjammer as luxury goods, perhaps, in the deeper future) for much longer than my remaining lifetime. And coming as I do from a family of ham radio experimenters (although I am not one myself) I'm aware of some surprisingly sophisticated and functional devices that a skilled hobbyist can construct by hand with primitive components (like vacuum tubes) that are not beyond the reach of handicraft. Mix in a few simple integrated circuits and display components imported like silk from farthest Cathay (plus a healthy dose of salvaged parts from the midden-heaps of the late 20th and earliest 21st) and I can imagine (not predict) some surprisingly functional devices being, if not sustainable, at least sustained for quite a long time.<br><br>Please understand I'm not coming to your blog to argue with you about how much collapse is coming. Your views are clearly-expressed and well-supported. Although I do think that the uncertainties in the data support a spectrum of outcomes at least some of which are more optimistic (especially in the timescale of just one more partial human lifetime) than the ones you describe so well in your writings (and I also think you may underestimate human technical ingenuity in the face of extreme resource constraints) I'm not trying to change your mind or that of your readers. I'm just expressing what I think is a reasoned hope that the "stimulation" part of your LESS rubric may enjoy less lessening then the energy and stuff part of the equations.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c9141150950436818710 title="comment permalink">4/16/15, 7:53 AM</a><br><br>

These are three:<br><br> We look at time backward. as individuals, we experience a sequence of events and so think of the present moving along a vector from past to future, but the reality is change turning future into past. Tomorrow becomes yesterday because the earth turns. There is only the present and the past is order receding from it. A faster clock/rate of change just uses energy quicker and so recedes into the past faster. The tortoise is still plodding along, long after the hare has died.<br> This makes time an effect of action, similar to temperature, i.e. frequency and amplitude. Therefore reality is not this narrative history from some initial creation event to a final denouement, but cycles of expansion and contraction. Energy expands, order contracts. Future is where the energy goes, past is where the order goes.<br><br> The next is that monotheism has spirituality backward. The spiritual absolute would be the essence from which we rise, not an ideal from which we fell.<br><br> The last point is that money is a contract, not a commodity and as such is used to displace more organic forms of social reciprocity and harvest value out of local communities and their environment. Fortunately the banking industry is in the process of cooking their own golden goose and starving the industrial behemoth in the process.<br><br>Trying to keep it short, but if this is interesting, here is an essay on the general subject I entered in a contest at FQXI;<br>http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/1981<br><br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c3099246131236521520 title="comment permalink">4/16/15, 9:37 AM</a><br><br>

If you can't afford or don't want to buy the book, How to Grow More Vegetables etc., the most important parts of the method are covered on the Ecology Action website and in its' free seed catalogue. I have found that double digging is the most productive method of gardening around. Some aspects of the method need altered for one's own climate. For example, the nightly watering is necessary for the West Coast soils; where I live now in NY state, daily watering is unnecessary and wasteful.<br><br>Permaculture has some good ideas, but needs a lot of work to install and a lot of upfront capital.

My computer is about 7 years old (thank you, Linux, for working so well), and I've turned it on twice in the last week. My plain cellphone is basically just my watch and emergency/travel contact machine. I've learned to use steel-nib dip pens to improve my handwriting. I collect working typewriters and have learned to fix a few of their inevitable injuries. Now I'm even using oil lamps for lighting, which is improving my sleep. (When I retire I'll be able to rise and bed down with the sun.) AND ALL OF THIS IS INDEED FUN! Much more fun than staring at screens. Not only that, but I get others interested, old and young alike.

These two bills not arriving in my mailbox have saved me thousands of dollars which I didn't need to earn and tens of thousands of hours not starring at screens. Still, lots of hours are being spent starring at the screen (probably 3-4 hours each week on this blog alone!). <br><br>I read an article in german newspaper about the digital addiction and digital penetration of life in Japan and South Korea : mothers in Japan who couldn't imagine putting their kids to leep without the ipad, people using an app to have virtual dinner guest and so on. One professor for literature said he doesn't think anybody in his university is able to have a deep conversation any more - the ability of the younger generation to focus on a real conversation is that low! Attention deficit anyone? There are now private schools in S.K. who banned the smart screens and raised their tuition fees significantly - they are now drowning in applications, since the students enrolled have a much improved ability to focus. Smart phones - dumb people. <br><br>On a more positive note: a small board game store here in town expanded in its new location into a board game cafe - over 500 board games to choose from. Believe it or not, but this store rocks: almost impossible to get a place on the weekend and even during week days, this place is packed with asian ESL students, hipsters, grandparents or parents with their kids, couples in their 30's &amp; 40's and hardcore board gamers. I am pretty sure most of them have a iscreen in their pockets, but to see them actually connect &amp; communicate face to face is a small relief in this izombie world. <br><br>@ Rhisiart Gwilym: I've been trying to guerilla plant nut trees in my town here, but many did get cut down. However, I'll plant more trees &amp; shrubs anyway. Have a few hundred seabuckthorn seedlings growing in the coldframe... Thanks for sharing your story, thats the kind of heros I am inspired by. <br><br>Oh, btw - whoever mentioned William Coperthwait's book " A handmade life" -thanks so much. One of the finest reads and highly recommended to all green wizards here! <br><br>cheers<br>K!EF<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c1837747690719990944 title="comment permalink">4/16/15, 12:17 PM</a><br><br>

I wish we could combine households with my in-laws, who came up the hard way in Oklahoma and so have very useful skills and understandings under their belts (plus they are good company). Unfortunately, they became California-ized decades ago, and look at their old country ways as something embarrassing and smelling of poverty. They are politely baffled at my attempts to recreate ways they worked hard to leave behind. They see multigenerational housing, equally, as a sign of failure on somebody's part. But it would be so nice to have "Mom" around to teach me how to make a tough farm chicken tender or to have "Dad" help build (rather than buy) the movable chicken pen, and to be comfortably close by to help as they begin their inevitable age-related decline. I'm cultivating relationships with the neighbors that sort of serve some of the same functions of shared purpose and skills and enjoyment of each other's company, but there's something about family… I'm already laying the groundwork with my kids: "There will probably come a time when you want to go out in the world, and/but you can always come home…"<br><br>It's very interesting to think about how reworking ideas about family structure and function could ease the collapsing process.

By going back and comparing accounts of the standards of living of indigenous peoples before the coming of the industrial revolution, you can gain a better idea of what will be sustainable over the long term once the crutch of cheap fossil fuels, the Cult of Happy Motoring and all the rest are gone.<br><br>The problem is that while California has much warmer winters, much of it is semi-arid or desert and most areas only receive modest amounts of rainfall for a few months out of the year. Southern California summers and autumns in particular tend to be very hot and dry with little or no rainfall until winter arrives, which is why that part of the country has such brutal fire seasons during late summer and fall. When I was living in San Diego as a little boy, we had to attend an annual wildfire safety lecture given by the San Diego Fire Department at the beginning of each school year, which gives you an idea of how bad the problem is.<br><br>Before the arrival of the white man and his industrial technologies, the native populations tended to be sparse and primitive because the land was too arid and too sparse in game and edible plants to support larger and more complex cultures. Go back and read descriptions of the Native cultures in California when the white man first encountered them and then compare those accounts to tribes living in the Northwest. Yes, the winters in the Northwest were colder, but there was a lot more rainfall and the land could support much larger populations with more complex cultures because there were a lot more resources (food, timber, fresh water, etc) available. I think that in the post fossil fuel era, the Pacific Northwest will be able to support relatively large populations with plenty of rainfall for farming, at least west of the Cascades. I expect that the Northwest will be well-positioned to support an ecotechnic society in the future, although most of the population will probably be descended from Asians arriving during the coming volkerwanderung as John Michael pointed out in some of his earlier posts.<br><br>On the other hand, I think much of California will go back to being what it was, which was barren desert inhabited by a few nomadic tribes trying to eke out a living from an unforgiving environment. Without abundant supplies of fossil fuels and the vast irrigation and water supply systems that were made possible by the cheap fossil fuel economy, the land simply cannot support large numbers of people. And as John Michael has pointed out, the geological evidence suggests that as the Earth’s climate grows warmer and climate zones shift, the Southwestern United States is going to be a lot hotter and drier than it is today, so living in Southern California in the post-industrial era will be a lot like living in the Sahara or the Atacama without air conditioning or cars. Good luck with that! Conditions in the rest of the state probably won’t be much better, with the possible exception of the northerly areas near the Oregon state line, which from an ecological and cultural perspective are really part of Cascadia rather than California.<br><br>I have lived in many parts of the United States and Europe, including southern California, the Napa Valley and the Pacific Northwest, so I have some first hand experience of which I speak.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c3687362266071975885 title="comment permalink">4/16/15, 2:38 PM</a><br><br>

Her mom uses Facebook as her main means of communication for family news. It is the only reason I still have an account. My husband and I stayed with the older 3 children for several days while her parents were staying in the DC hospital where her surgery took place (it was spring break, so no school. ) Other grandmother took turns with us. During the course of conversation, she went on and on about her different groups of “friends”, and how important being “with it” and connected is to her…even mentioning how “left behind” some people are (like us, I had to think!). And no conversation about social media would be complete without the importance of twitter for fast breaking news. “People tweet right as emergencies are happening!” etc...<br><br>I understand how important it is for my daughter in law to be able to keep the news out there for others to see…she is a very busy woman, a great wife and mom, and I genuinely admire her and her husband. They have 4 children, live on one income and basically do LESS but without the overt connection to collapse. Just frugality and common sense…Yes!<br><br>I suppose I will keep my account for now…she’s posting how many seizure free days (8 so far!) our little fighter has had…but I see it more as a necessary evil. I don’t expect others to cater to my choices to be or not to be “connected”, but I also don’t put myself out there to be scorned by the aficionados.

He has been promoting something he calls “Retroculture”, which he also uses as a plot device in his new novel “Victoria: A Novel of Fourth Generation War”. I am also reminded of recent posts and comments about steampunk, the growing popularity of reenactment groups, efforts to preserve and bring back traditional skills and crafts and so on. How many other civilizations have had so many people who were eager to jump ship and turn their backs on the status quo? More and more people are discovering that the Cult of Progress has serious flaws and are looking for saner alternatives.<br><br>As the cracks in the status quo grow more and more visible, I think we will see two responses. One will be people who continue to wave their iPhones just as Chris Martenson described and live in denial until the crocodiles of reality drag them under. But there are also an increasing number of people who get it and are jumping ship and I believe we will see more of that in the years to come. This will act as a major mechanism of Darwinian selection in the decades to come, especially in countries like the United States where so many people have become dependent on the luxuries, conveniences and prosthetics made possible by the cheap fossil fuel bubble.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c574332029954288638 title="comment permalink">4/16/15, 4:07 PM</a><br><br>

It is probably a fair comment to say that it is a whole grab bag of disasters (I should trademark that?) based on the premise that we are trained to look at the world - from a very young age - in ways that don't match the facts on the ground.<br><br>Some of the grab bag of beliefs includes:<br><br>- Corruption is only a problem for the third world;<br><br>- Justice and fairness pervades our society;<br><br>- The legal system is applied to all fairly and produces just outcomes;<br><br>- Our education systems provides good outcomes for the students;<br><br>- If you can't see pollution then it isn't happening;<br><br>- House prices will always keep increasing;<br><br>- If you work hard you will be rewarded fairly for your efforts;<br><br>- Cooking from scracth using raw ingredients takes real skill, time and is not for the faint of heart. <br><br>Honestly, I could just keep going on and on, but I became side tracked for a short while watching a magpie looking at itself in a mirror whilst preening (they're very vain birds!). Anyway back to the topic: the whole thing is broken from day 1 and people are trained to simply ignore information that doesn't comport with their rusted on world view. It is pretty scary actually, but the previous example of the backup support services was there to show how much effort goes into maintaining the big charade. A very difficult and expensive beast to maintain.<br><br>Oh yeah, about television I wasn't going to say this, but the little sprite told me too and it seems like a good idea at this time: A huge number of parents use television as a respite care for children. It pacifies the children but at the same time indoctrinates those kids into many of the strange myths that operate within our society. And you lot know why television is used in that capacity too.<br><br>Hi Heather,<br><br>Oh yeah, that is exactly the same problem here. Except that the police would investigate and the tractor driver would be charged with an offence if it was a total fire ban day here.<br><br>Hope you are enjoying the photos and all of the weird things I had to do to build the house here given the similarities in environment and climate. Most houses here burn from the roof down and it only takes about 4 minutes. People always say houses explode, but what they're seeing is the roof collapsing in on the structure. Bushfires produce a whole lot of flying embers here - it is like being showered by a giant really hot sparkler - and those embers get into roof spaces and ignite the very dry timbers in there and then it's gone before you know it. That is why I'm building the sheds out of steel for both the structure and the cladding.

We're millennials (she's 32, I'm 29) and surprisingly to most we aren't amused by endless conquesting after the latest gadget. We fill our time with experiencing life and going places with our 17 month old daughter. Even more strange are the stares, puzzled faces and utter shock I get from colleagues because my chosen profession is information technology. I ALWAYS get asked at some point if I'm a "gamer" from everyone I work with like it's a prerequisite for the job. I proudly exclaim that I do not own a game console nor am I interested in virtual reality. I have enough interest in real reality to sustain me. I'm sure I got this quality from my 56 year old father who's never been on the Internet and never owned or operated a cell phone. He's a mechanic for heavy equipment and does car inspections on the weekends. I love hearing him talk about the inspections and how they've changed over 40 years. My dad brings up a good point about the technology in cars today compared to 40 years ago from the viewpoint of a mechanic. You almost need an advanced engineering degree to work on them now. Many more wires and sensors and other components that will eventually go  bad and need replacing for a good expensive price. Thinking along those lines I often wonder how those vehicles will fare as they age on their way down to the lower classes who are onl the in the market for an older used car. Another reason to ditch the automobile.<br><br>Looking forward to next week's post. Lately I've been trying to figure out how to get rid of my debt from a false educational promise while developing a craft of useful skills I can develop for a post oil economy and pass on to teach my children.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c6309888647479324493 title="comment permalink">4/16/15, 7:58 PM</a><br><br>

The points you reference, JMG, are most likely intended to be ironically funny, not a true prediction. Coupland is usually looking at the dark side of technology and seeing its extension in the future as a loss. <br><br>The lecture series/novel that's being promoted by the article you referenced, _Player One_ is actually a really funny, almost-but-not-quite bit of sci-fi that fits very nicely into JMG's theory of catabolic collapse. <br><br>I found it fascinating that our (Canada's) very staid, pre-eminent lecture series producers invited Coupland to make a statement on our current situation, and his response was to bring Peak Oil theory to the fore. Quite remarkable, really. And the "fast collapse" scenario that another commenter mentioned is the driver of the plot at the beginning. But the deeply ironic twist at the end is that in fact, the world does not come to an end at all, but carries on like it always does, with just a change in the scenery thanks to oil stabilizing at $350/barrel.

The abolition of extended-family living arrangements was a core element of the process by which the market economy took over the household. <br><br>Gunnar, thanks for the link and congrats on the article!<br><br>Marc, I wonder how much of that is California-specific; your state does have a distinctive culture of its own, you know. <br><br>GHung, I see high tunnels as a transitional technology -- won't be around once hydrocarbons get scarce, but for the time being, it's often a useful choice. As for the loud insistence that you can't just work via word of mouth, well, of course the suits are going to say that -- they have plenty of nice courses to sell you. The best local produce here in Cumberland MD is for sale in a beat-up old storefront in the poor end of town, which does no advertising at all except for a sign out front. We learned about it from the neighbors, of course. <br><br>Leo, glad you liked it. May I ask you for a favor? Tell some people who weren't born yet when Reagan took office how mainstream environmental awareness was when you were a kid. Ask them if they know what happened. <br><br>Justin, I hope you'll be going back to that bar! As for zines, a lot depends on the availability of duplicating technology. I've been keeping my eye out for old mimeograph equipment -- printing presses right now are way too expensive for my budget, but the sort of cheap mimeo that used to be the mainstay of those science fiction and fantasy zines that had gotten beyond hektographs might be a good option. <br><br>Heather, sooner or later all of us are going to die. That comes with being biological beings. I find that awareness useful in keeping a sense of perspective when it comes to the risks we'll be running in the future. <br><br>Bacchus, do you by any chance have training and/or a degree in electronics engineering? The reason I ask is that so far, everybody I know who thinks that something like the system you've outlined would be possible after the end of the fossil fuel age doesn't have that background. The people I've talked with who do have it -- who know, for example, just what would be involved in building a computer out of individual transistors -- all tell me it's not gonna happen: that if there are computers at all, they'll be like computers in the 1950s and 1960s, huge, finicky, and very expensive to build, maintain, and operate. I'm not a computer professional myself, and thus am quite willing to be proved wrong, but I'd want to see some serious facts and figures to justify the claim that a deindustrial society can support even a massively scaled down computer network that ordinary citizens can access. <br><br>Luke, okay, let's take the comparison the rest of the way. Let's imagine that you carry a book of poetry around with you all the time, and constantly interrupt other activities and inconvenience other people so you can read poems. Let's imagine, furthermore, that you insist on communicating with other people by writing sonnets to them, and demand that they reply in sonnet form as well. Finally, let's imagine that you insist that there's no difference between reading a poem about something and actually experiencing the subject of the poem -- that, for example, you insisted that reading a poem about love was the same thing as having a relationship with an actual human being, reading a poem about a forest was the same experience as actually walking out into a forest, etc., etc.<br><br>In that wholly imaginary case, would it be reasonable of me to point out that in fact, all you're doing is staring at black ink marks on paper? You bet.<br><br>Now of course this implies that there can be situations in which looking at a screen is a useful activity, and I don't deny that at all. It's the attempt to insist that the screen doesn't matter, and more generally that all those technological filters separating people from the real world don't matter, that I'm trying to discuss here.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c1195190678208624731 title="comment permalink">4/16/15, 10:07 PM</a><br><br>

For example the primary expression of energy is the wave and waves go up and down equally, so you can have lots of little waves, or one ginormous wave. Since the crest of a wave is mostly foam and bubbles and that is the stage we appear to be at, the downside seems imminent. Which isn't all bad.

Though probably in a different way than you two. <br>Of course there is a large scatter in possible outcomes depending on sequence, rate, location, and magnitude of major collapse events.<br>We can probably agree pretty much on salvage possibilities, with a couple of caveats perhaps. For example information deficit may be a big problem if you go beyond replacing capacitors. <br><br>Regarding communication networks I'd like to frame it in a map with coverage of various layers of communication possibilities. Neighbors, smoke signals, messengers with solid state disks, libraries, ham, glass fiber links, you name it. These get you (some) data at a certain latency (waiting time), upkeep, extra cost per "bit", persistence, and intermittency. You (and your community) can trade a fraction of your disposable wealth for these. However the disposable wealth of many communities is arguably negative at the moment. Still you can use some of it for entertainment, some for efficiency, some for both, some taxed, and some contraband. My gut feeling is that these tech suites will mesh far better than they have before and you use one thing for fast low bandwidth (e.g. ask for update on the amazon catalog with reviews via ham) and another thing for bulk data delivery (mailed ssd or books). No netflix or crazy profits on mobile texting. Libraries - absolutely, but you may have their catalogue + summaries at home. What infrastructure will be paid for today is decided by military, industry, and consumers. Their relative say and outlook will probably change over time. Stimulation by screen will probably be a pretty small factor unless it is mainly for efficient population control (both, sentiment and reproduction). It is pretty unlikely (not impossible) that you are generating wealth sitting in front of a glass screen.

Imagine Norway in winter: travel sucks, outdoor work sucks, you have energy, but you don't have terribly many people because of sustainable fishing &amp; lack of farm land. So you can try to sell the energy straight, or e.g. try to turn it into a complexity heavy commodity, among many other things: communication network infrastructure and computers. Eventually the question becomes: What is your return on investment for investing in complexity, and perhaps getting into a niche? I'd argue it is relatively high in the long run (though orders of magnitude below what is considered acceptable ROI nowadays, in other words steel-plough-high vs facebook-high).<br>Let's say 300-year-post-peak-Norway decides to give computers another shot. Would they be able and willing to gradually work back through 60s style computers to perhaps eventually making the smart phones we have today (perhaps with an average lifetime of more than two summers)?<br>I would say that the first is very unlikely, the latter is a little more likely. Integrated circuits want to be produced on a relatively large (not cottage economy) scale with a high yield, otherwise they get REALLY expensive. A good thing is that they can be made to last a long time (mostly ignored today). Another good thing is that we know how (and will probably remember it is possible in principle - very important in engineering). We don't know how to do this in a resource efficient way - and that is not good.<br><br>I liked the screen discussion last week. That was one symptom that really hit me when I came to live in the US a few years ago (left again pretty soon) - a big change from the 90s. I have a hard time keeping my eyes off animated screens - though it helped that they showed sports. In my apartment I had no flat screen tv (had a projector though), no internet, and most furniture was simple and self made. People called it yoga studio.<br><br>On the noise front I can really recommend (apart from leaving) noise blocking in-ear buds with a little button to switch on/off with a compatible small mp3 player. I used to make them from cork before you could buy them. Without appropriate masking sound they will only be half as good though. I like to record sounds from outdoor locations for that, but music or podcasts may work as well depending on your kind of work.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c1167305033993026720 title="comment permalink">4/17/15, 5:58 AM</a><br><br>

I am sure these non-governmental toll road companies love their eager, harried road rage filled rats running their paid mazes.

You roll your window down and it is easily 120 dB due to high mileage tires traveling on ultra-safe concrete.

The excuses usually come down to the fact that we are a single-income family while they all both “need” to work, so they don’t have the time to invest in the garden, chickens, bees, etc that we have. It may be that they are still comfortably well enough off that it doesn’t seem applicable to them, and the recent crash in the price of oil hasn’t helped, but there’s not much sense of urgency that I can detect. The kids however are a different matter, in that they get to see what constitutes normal isn’t limited to a fringe eco-hippie sort of situation. That comforts me somewhat.

I clearly support the position of JMG here because I do know what the resource footprint even of small electronic devices looks like. It is incredible how much resources have to be poured into a small chip with just some grams mass, how complex and global the supply chains for various necessary materials and ingredients are.<br><br>To give an impression of what I mean: I remember a study from the early 1990s, and they figured out that making a standard desktop PC (which was much simpler back then!) required as much resources and energy as making a complete electronic-free CAR, like the original VW beetle from the 1950s.<br><br>It isn't a counter argument that iGadgets are smaller than a desktop PC because it isn't the housing case nor the PCB that requires the resources, it's the electronics.<br><br>One of the problems is that the real resouce demand only starts AFTER the raw materials are there, i.e. in the production process. Which means that recycling isn't a promising approach, completely unlike e.g. things made of steel.<br><br>Focusing on the energy consumption of the end-devices is irrelevant since their production and not operation is what counts. Plus of course the infrastructure like servers, mobile base stations and the like, each requiring even more electronics which are so resource-craving to produce. Again, the operation itself isn't the actual issue, though all the server centres with air conditioning need a lot of power themselves.<br><br>The main reasons for computers built of discrete transistors is that (1) those are much easier to manufacture, and that they can be tested individually after the production, sorting out the broken transistors. Maybe even slightly integrated chips will be possible. And (2), the big and complex production facilities required for modern computer chips are VERY expensive to set up, and that can only pay off if you have mass production (economies of scale). With the resource base for mass production gone, only much simpler production facilities will be viable, and those will only produce much simpler technology.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c2187965474885603590 title="comment permalink">4/17/15, 10:06 AM</a><br><br>

(The wide adoption of integrated circuits took the joy out of the hobby for him because they were hard to solder by hand.) So I'm for sure not trying to make any sort of argument from expertise or special knowledge. I know some words and concepts, but I'm not qualified to make or assert any of the relevant technical judgments. <br><br>Re "...the claim that a deindustrial society can support even a massively scaled down computer network..." all I can say is that I'm not trying to make that claim, or anything very close to it. I'll freely grant you that there's a level of potential deindustrialization beyond which my hoped-for vision of a surviving communication network is impossible. If humanity is deindustrialized to the extent that you predict, the day will come when the last chip fab on earth will be struggling to remain in operation. And some years or decades after it fails, the ad hoc communications network of my imagination may truly become impossible.<br><br>I do reserve -- but am not asserting here -- some doubt about the amount of industry a post-fossil-energy world might retain. But I'm not here to argue about my own doubts, which don't even rise to the level of arguments anyway. So I tried not to let my residual doubt inform what I actually said.<br><br>No, my assertion here is that given the fractal nature of decline, that last chip fab may be somewhat deeper in our future than the <i>general</i> decline of globalized industrialization. And if that hopeful sentiment of mine proves correct, weird hybrid networks of weirdly-constructed devices may preserve our connectivity considerably past the expiration date of our broader industrial culture. As I've said repeatedly, it's a hope more than a prediction. If you don't think it likely, well, fair enough; I'll grant that you've spent many years thinking much harder about these things than I have, and may therefore have the right of it.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c2473195448286153010 title="comment permalink">4/17/15, 11:25 AM</a><br><br>

Fair enough. I won't ask you to be my housekeeper, nor would I ask my MIL to be. I work very part time, mostly from home, because I do prioritize making a home for myself, my husband and kids- it just seems to me that maybe each nuclear family unit doesn't need its own entire house (lawnmower, dishwasher, vacuum, washing machine, etc.), and that sharing households might have some task efficiencies possible in terms of fewer lawns to mow, fewer separate meals to cook, etc. Your retirement activities sound lovely (and important to me too) and I can appreciate your desire to have space and leisure time to pursue them, after years of service to your family (and ongoing babysitting, how wonderful!). It feels like either my inlaws' home or ours (both have plenty of extra space, I will confess) could accommodate both families without crowding past the square footage that, say, I or my parents grew up in, with room for everybody's collections and tools. Certainly, having little people around might crowd the pace a bit (ahem). My MIL seems to have too much time on her hands- no real hobbies like those you listed- and unfortunately spends a lot of it buying stuff for my kids that they don't need, which then get delivered in huge loads in the 4 or 6 times a year that we do see them (2.5 hours away). Of course every family's situation is different, but it seems like there might be a better way for some of us. Plus, I truly do worry about my inlaws as they age- wouldn't think of dropping them in a "home" where I'd have no real idea how they were being treated- and feel like combining households when it is self-evidently beneficial to both families might reduce any possible worries about "being a burden" or "imposing". If Mom and Dad are already part of our daily lives, then our caring for them when they need it will be natural all the way around, not a big fraught event.<br>Thanks for pointing out a perspective on the situation that I hadn't thought of.<br>--Heather in CA<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c3928006491110785061 title="comment permalink">4/17/15, 12:19 PM</a><br><br>

That's pretty much what mainframe computers around the 1950s and 60s were.<br><br>However, there are many digital devices that aren't fully programmable computers that can be made with far fewer transistors. Things like shift registers and character encoders/decoders (the things you need to turn a telegraph line or radio link into a text TTY instead), line selectors (what a telephone operator does), digital clocks with multiple functions and alarms (the billion-transistor circuitry of your smart phone is really slacking off when it performs that thousand-transistor task), and music/effects synthesizers.<br><br>An old book called <i>The TTL Cookbook</i> (still in print!) used to be my bible for this kind of hardware, using chips that each contain (usually) four separate logic gates of a given type, One such chip can be replaced by about 25 individual transistors, so any of those designs could be replicated using individual transistors in about a five times larger box. (And yes, if you connect together enough of those sorts of various digital modules you have a CPU, but by then it's room-sized.)<br><br>That kind of task-specific digital logic design is mostly obsolete, because even for the simplest functions (e.g. a toaster) it's now cheaper to use a processor and program it to perform that function. But on the other hand, it's not very difficult, so where transistor manufacture exists there will likely be some kind of electronic inter-polity messaging system even if it doesn't resemble the Internet in capabilities or public accessibility.<br><br>The other side of the retro-computing coin is the potential in salvage of all those processors and other large-scale integrated circuits, in appliances and cars and everywhere. For instance, if you have an intact chip from a pocket calculator and a power source, the rest of the device (keyboard and display) can be made of low-tech materials, and far more durably than the originals.<br><br>The imagined "Almagest" mentioned in my After Oil 2 story is something similar: a preserved ROM module containing the text of several hundred books, accessed via simple switches and a hand-cranked mechanical binary address counter. For output, instead of the more complex process of converting the binary characters into text, the device simply strikes a different percussion sound (a bell, drum, or wood block) for each bit in the encoded character being read. Adept users learn to "read" the text directly from the combinations of sounds, at about five times the speed of telegraphy.<br><br>The combination of salvaged LSI chips <i>and</i> available manufactured transistors (with other basic parts) would make a lot of things possible, albeit more likely in the military, public works, academic, and business spheres than any "personal devices." In other words, retro to the 70s instead of the 60s.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c289620762757234767 title="comment permalink">4/17/15, 12:56 PM</a><br><br>

Still, I have worked in a clean room, with silicon, but mostly nano, not so much micro, and very little electronics or MEMS. <br><br>There was a nice (engineer) hands on description of industrial very large chip fabrication on reddit a while back (can't find it anymore). It led me to believe if you make compromises and don't customize terribly much you could cut costs significantly. I have acquaintances that worked in cleanroom tech and my take is there is very, very large potential to cut resource costs there as well - although it'd take a lot of trial and error to boil it down. Something industry does not seem to feel it has time for just now. And it is absolutely possible to run into showstoppers that cannot be simplified (e.g. diagnostic instrumentation). <br>I am not sure about recycling. You'll get the rare elements I guess, but not necessarily save much energy. If I remember correctly the (mostly energy) cost breakdown is currently: make 80%, use 20%. The make breaks down into 40% refining and 40% processing in fab. <br>If you design your product accordingly I can see ICs in use for several decades (redundant features, perhaps diffusion adjusted geometries). Eventually use energy may become dominant (especially for always on infrastructure). <br><br>Perhaps a few more words on "smartphones". In the early 00s I was convinced something very much like the iphone would hit the market and I would have to buy it. If not because I wanted it, then because I needed it to "remain competitive". I ended up skipping it and going for another brand because the contracts were ridiculous where I lived. I had become used to having PDAs (personal digital assistants, casio, palm, SL5500, n810) long before that. For me they were genuinely useful, even without phone connection. I expect this to be even more true when things slow down more. Of course they'll have to look different for different people. When I finally got my smartphone I downloaded very few apps because I already knew what I wanted. For most people I see they are primarily mobile billing machines (or ad pushers), and secondly status symbols or entertainment devices.<br>They have potential for so much more useful purposes as PDA. On the other hand a paper notebook and a book of stamps will cover many of these for a lot less.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c7412204717957821475 title="comment permalink">4/17/15, 3:09 PM</a><br><br>

Because I was that girl at school, sadly. Also distressingly argumentative.<br><br>I would like to return the favour and award you a gold star for your reply to CJ's question, which is a big one, basically, 'How do we change the communities we live in?' Your reply - that changing the world is not the point of living with LESS at all - is the pivotal realisation that has indeed changed the way I live.<br><br>For many years the thought that nothing that I could do individually would have any effect on society at large kept me from making significant change in my life. That was my excuse for not 'being the change I wished to see'. The real reason was that I was scared and uncomfortable about that change, and was convinced that all my neighbours, family and friends would think I was completely mad. But the thought that nothing I could do would change anything after all was a brilliant, seemingly rational cover-up for my conscience.<br><br>Your posts over the last few months, and comments directed to me and others, challenging us as to what WE are doing personally, right now to turn our lives in the direction of LESS, have been the catalyst for recent changes in the way I am living.<br><br>That and a re-reading of To Kill A Mockingbird. Atticus Finch didn't set out to change the world - and he didn't change it. He just did what he knew was right, did the only the thing he could do so that he could continue to look his children in the eyes.<br><br>But he opened a space for conversation about a forbidden subject in a town where once there had been a wall of silence. And every time we do something contrary to societal expectations, each of us does the same thing. We may be considered strange, wrong or contrary but we open the possibility that there is an alternative to the status quo.<br><br>So really, individual change is a paradox. No, having a vegie garden in the front yard is not going to make a difference in the sense that all the neighbours are going to follow suit. Some of them will think you are mad, and others will ring the council and complain.<br><br>But at the same time, growing food in the front yard opens up the possibility of growing food in a front yard. Or growing food at all. The neighbours may discover the amazing truth of a home grown apple, the neighbour kids might learn that a pea grows on a vine, not in the frozen food section at the supermarket. And that causes a tiny tear in their perceptions of 'normal'. And when individuals (whose individual efforts won't change anything, remember) all over the city, start to plant apple trees instead of silver birches, then the neighbours are going to start to see a 'new normal' for growing food.<br><br>But someone has to plant the first apple tree. Just like someone had to buy the first iPhone. And every day we have the choice to plant the apple tree or buy the iPhone. And each tiny choice will pile onto each other tiny choice and send society in one direction, or another.<br><br>And thanks to the individual choices of many people in my community and others on-line, and here at ADR, who all choose to plant the apple tree on a regular basis, I also have a 'new normal', which is to plant the apple tree more often than buying the iPhone..<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c1148059783521213881 title="comment permalink">4/17/15, 7:29 PM</a><br><br>

I studied basic electronic theory in the early 1970s. The textbook had diagrams for counters assembled from flip-flop circuits made of discrete components. The devices I worked on in the mid seventies consisted mainly of discrete components with a few simple integrated circuits of the kind Myriad describes, soldered into printed circuit boards with some hand wiring.<br><br>Those circuits were for measuring instruments and industrial control. Useful in the future or not? I dunno. I developed an appreciation for the way the boards looked, with various diode and capacitor designs, colorful striped resistors in several sizes and transistors standing up like tiny water towers. Wire wrapping, something I never learned how to do, also has esthetic qualities, as does tying down bundles of wires with bicolor cotton cord in continuous larks-head knots instead of with plastic cable ties.<br><br>Nixie tube numerical readouts are the neatest devices ever.

Heather's response was very gracious, I think. <br><br>I have two perspectives on this, both informed by the other. I live abroad so I am across the world from my own family in California, so my sisters will have to look after our parents. But we have my MIL here. She is active and fit and just approaching retirement. She's financially responsible and very independent. We've never discussed it but I expect at some point that we will be living together. Where I live we have universal health care and that includes district nursing and care homes. The at home care is one thing, the care homes are something else. <br><br>My other perspective is that I am a district nurse. My workday consists of biking around part of the city and providing nursing care at home. There's a wide range of users of our services. Some are active and have a fine network, and just need some wound care or someone to dispense all their medications. But in my experience most people have a period at the end of their lives where they are dependent on other people for some, if not all, of their most basic needs. How this plays out in reality depends on their personal history, their family and friends, and how much they and the system can cooperate. Some homes are disgusting, with a shut in resident who is completely isolated and will barely let us in the door. Others are neat and tidy, and function fine inspite of some level of incapacity. <br><br>This personal collapse from an active elderhood can come gradually, with a loss of strength and mobility, through disease, or just aging, or a loss of memory. Or it can happen fast - I have been present in a professional capacity when we use a locksmith to break in when someone doesn't answer the door or telephone. <br><br>I don't know what the system will look like in 5 or 10 years when my MIL may be needing help. But my long term plans include the possibility that she will be living with us - or we with her - for mutual benefit, and certainly not for free housekeeping and babysitting. An independent elderhood is one thing, but it is difficult to guarantee that you will transition straight from independence to death. I would encourage anyone of a certain age (and everyone really) to give some thought to what arrangements you can make for a period of time when your needs may be great and your contributions little. Especially if the system is no longer in a position to catch you as you fall.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c1571114389467168984 title="comment permalink">4/18/15, 3:28 AM</a><br><br>

OK, maybe a shop vac to clean up the bad spills, but obstreperous kids can be handed a broom. As for lawns, have you considered a planting of useful herbs, likely not illegal or frowned upon, and you don't have to tell the neighbors the herbs can cure your colds? I profoundly respect your decision to make a home for your family, and honor you for it, but your MIL is a grown-up and will make her own decisions. I think you do have a right of refusal of what toys you allow into your home.

Since I discovered this blog last summer it has become a Wednesday night fixture in my life. Now I cannot imagine my life without it. This is a wonderful community that helps me to keep more honest with myself in my effort to live a real life.<br><br>@winingwizzard, your description of the commuter nightmare reminded me of how important the "intangibles" are in a society that runs on numbers. <br>I have often marveled at how people in modern society can become so seemingly oblivious to their own senses, and sense of wellbeing. There are so many of us who cannot see the aesthetics of their own lives, or lack of it. They live in an endless chasm of concrete, noise, and superfluous stimulation, and then wonder why they are crazy.<br>Several years ago I was between jobs and had a choice between a job 20 miles away on the highway and another job only three miles away. The more distant job was far more lucrative and would last longer, but I chose the closer job renovating a house because most days I could walk there through the woods. I could leave my tools in the house and enjoy my "commute" through hemlock ravines in a river valley, on a trail that came within 100 yards of both my home and the one I was working on. I would get up in the morning feeling exhilarated to go to work! It was spring, the woods alive with birdsong. I would check on the beavers and the painted turtles, in the soft green light that filtered through the trees, with only the sounds of water and birds. <br>An advantage of LESS is that it is possible to make this choice. I don't care how much the other jobs pay; when life can be this good, I'll take it any day.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c4755163019429667028 title="comment permalink">4/18/15, 9:51 AM</a><br><br>

At work I've dealt with lawyers with reputations as top notch intellects not only by virtue of their negotiating skill but also a seemingly bottomless memory and ability to comprehend and retain convoluted, endlessly run-on verbiage that you find in law books that would utterly baffle a lesser being. <br><br>I've seen university under-grads with astonishing depths of mathematical insight that even impressed hard-to-impress professors. They sure impressed me at least. <br><br>But, the thing is, I've seen brilliant lawyers that can't bloody add. And mathematically talented people that cannot write coherent three word sentences. OK, maybe I'm exaggerating but not by much. <br><br>My own take is that, notwithstanding certain limitations (like the inability of some mathematicians to spell), the intellectual A-Team goes into mathematics and the hard sciences. And maybe law (I'm not in any of the foregoing). <br><br>But what does it take to be one of the "elites" you mention? Does it take some kind of outsized and exaggerated mental capability? Having seen some of them up-close, I don't think it's an Einstein-ian power to visualize or anything approximating it. I think it's more along the lines of personality traits, among them energy, ruthlessness, focus, ambition. <br><br>However, to me, what it takes to be a truly effective national or societal leader is a different type of intelligence, that is, a generalist of sorts not typical of the Intellectual A-Team League. Not someone that we would typically think of as "genius". <br><br>Not someone that would make a good lawyer or mathematician or physicist but one rather more exceptional, one that can take patterns of sparse and fragmentary and maybe inaccurate information and knit it all into pictures that approximate reality. It requires a type of insight and judgment that neither people in the hard sciences nor mathematics typically possess. Nor law. At least, not that I've seen. <br><br>Nor, for that matter, do you see that type in the business world although you do sometimes see something like it. In business you typically have to make good decisions on the fly with woefully incomplete facts. <br><br>The problem is taking what you do in a business, with its own set of incentives and priorities and modifying and magnifying the decision making process to a setting that's national or international in scope, that is, orders of magnitude greater in size and complexity than an individual corporation. That takes a rare talent. Not often found. <br><br>Do I see that kind of ability in today's elites? Nope. Too bad really. Today's world, inter-connected as it is, needs such a type. People that can take bits and pieces, shake them into a working model of the world, take a deep breath and make a good decision. <br><br>What you see instead in today's elites are pretenders. Maybe good for making money, maybe people possessed of rare ambition or vision of a sort, but very limited and specific.<br><br>What are the results? The invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, insane, impractical economic policies based on models of human behavior that have only a glancing connection to the real world. <br><br>And also, what you get, as you say, is serene clueless-ness. Or, if not utterly clueless, serenely self interested and self serving. <br><br>As you might say, the day we realize that our own survival depends on our up-ending or ignoring our elite is the day the world changes.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c736054773386935260 title="comment permalink">4/18/15, 10:18 AM</a><br><br>

Often on older Scythes which have not been used lately, the handle bolts will be so rusted they are close to failure so replace them as needed. Use gloves even if you have tough hands.<br>4.Even if you’re in great shape take it easy to start with as you need to use your whole body to make the thing work and lots of your body parts may not be used to working together in the integrated manner which will evolve as you practice this.<br>5. Keep the blade sharp with a file.<br>6.Make sure your footing is good. Feet planted a little beyond shoulder width, wider if on an embankment.<br>7.Once again, go low and slow, form is more important than speed to start.<br>8.Have some fun while you’re doing it.<br>9.Yes you can do this on bumpy uneven ground even if it is strewn with boulders.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c5761854899556816984 title="comment permalink">4/18/15, 1:02 PM</a><br><br>

Now I described it that way because it is an industry and the individual businesses are owned and run in order to produce a profit (whether they acknowledge that or not. Not for profits describe profits as surpluses - whatever!). Therefore staff levels are kept at the bare minimum to meet legal standards. Families often have expectations of care that can far exceed the ability of those businesses ability to implement and often those families lack the funds to meet their expectations.<br><br>There are of course alternatives, and it is worthwhile noting that the arrangements in place today are not the arrangements in place even half a century ago. As JMG noted above in the comments, the family unit has been broken up in order for the market economy to get a wedge in on that action.<br><br>The stories those people told me about the system were neither pretty, nor were they nice - and they often remarked that things were now much better for the patients than in the good old days. They do a tough job, there are no doubts about that.<br><br>From personal observations of friends and acquaintances, I have to suggest that a lot of the elderly are medicated for potentially fatal conditions such as pneumonia only to then have them linger for many months and years. As an observation, we hold on too tightly - and I can say this from experience as having in the past been forced to make a decision about another person’s life.<br><br>As a further observation, a great number of the baby boomers whom I know are suffering ethically and emotionally with the decisions that you yourself raise. It is not just the baby boomers either as a Gen X friend recounted to me that when their remaining parent died, they were forced to consider the very real situation that they were next in line and this is an unpleasant and difficult realisation for a person.<br><br>I dread speaking of such matters because in the past some have said to me in bitterness, well you've had years to get used to your situation. In turn I have replied, yes and you have had many more years with your parents than I. No one comes out of that discussion well.<br><br>All the best and please understand there is no perfect situation, there are only decisions - whether they are made or avoided.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c3407243720301152918 title="comment permalink">4/18/15, 4:29 PM</a><br><br>

Scything on a slope is not too difficult if the terrain is fairly even. When the ground gets too uneven, it may be time to break out the sickle. There are different lengths and styles of scythe blades, too. A shorter blade is better for rougher terrain.

It's a fad, and that's what happens with fads. Especially when a capability that used to be expensive becomes very cheap, and everyone piles on and over-uses it for a while. It reminds me of the early days of "desktop publishing" when every printed document you saw had twelve different typefaces and liberal use of the "bold outlined shadowed underlined text" option.<br><br>A lot of those TV screens discussed last week are there for the same reason. They got cheap. A flat screen costs less (at least in initial outlay) than a typical framed piece of modest quality original artwork of the same size. And yet, for the moment, they still retain a trace of the cachet they had when they were expensive enough to give distinction to the boardrooms of Enron. That won't last another two years, after which those gratuitous screens will seem about as stylish as out-of-season Christmas lights.<br><br>How many current fitness-tracking-wristband users, two years from now, will still be interested in looking up how many steps they walked that day, let alone sharing that information with the world? Probably about as many as will still be on whichever brand-named diet they're currently on.<br><br>Resisting such marginal fads is the purview of the older-and-wiser. The greater imperative, for anticipating decline or collapse and preserving retro methods, lies in resisting (that is, practicing alternatives to) technologies that are actually useful. GPS navigation devices, for instance, can seem like a wish come true; who hasn't gotten lost or been forced off a familiar route and wished for an omniscient at-hand giver of accurate directions? But I've never owned one. So this morning, during a twelve-mile walk through an unfamiliar trail network in a state forest, which I was navigating using the sun and an analog watch, the one time I crossed a paved road, a driver pulled over and asked for directions because their GPS navigation device had led them there for some unknown reason. (Due to being unfamiliar with the area, I wasn't able to direct them to their destination, but I was able to tell them what road they were on, which direction they were going, and where up ahead they could get further assistance.)<br><br>Similarly, my wife and I resisted using cell phones. When we're apart we coordinate by sharing a plan in advance, having long-established backup plans (e.g. how long either of us will wait if the other is delayed and doesn't show up as expected), and trusting in one another to make choices that make sense when confronted with the unexpected. We don't need to know each other's exact status at every moment of the day, and we rather pity those who do seem to need that, via a constant stream of text messages and calls. "He/she will be so worried/confused/angry if I'm ten minutes late and I don't notify him/her of that in advance!" Wow, and you married them anyway?<br><br>We do now have cell phones while traveling, "for emergencies." This is at the insistence of older and younger relatives, who otherwise (they have assured us) would suffer unbearable anxiety at not knowing for certain we're not dead in a ditch somewhere, for up to hours at a time!<br><br>So those appear to be some of the costs of some of the most useful features of connectivity. Losing the ability to negotiate the world without the prosthetic device, and correspondingly, losing the ability to trust one another's ability to negotiate the world even with it.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c6933664270570299214 title="comment permalink">4/18/15, 4:54 PM</a><br><br>

A default or other governmental financial hiccup could jeopardize the ability to pay Medicare and Social Security. JMG has repeatedly discussed the ponzi nature of investments and their instability in a contracting economy. Retirement is part of the rentier class and subject to that volatility, and those investments are as subject to the market as any. I'd be interested in JMG'S take, but a financial crisis of the one we might be facing potentially could reorder the economy in favor of the young and able bodied by eliminating the government programs and investments that retirees depend. I'm not really looking at whether Social Security, pensions, or 401k's are earned or deserved or anything of that nature, because I'm not sure it will be relevant in the government or institution's ability to pay. I've talked to people who talk as if the status quo will continue, but I'm not so sure that a young, able bodied person won't be an important economic asset if we are facing a full on Depression or worse. If I were a retiree, I'd only consider my hard assets (property, possessions) as something I really have and can count on. Pensions and 401k's are probably in the worthless paper category JMG has discussed. Not far behind are government programs. Greece is probably a good idea of what we'll be facing shortly.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c6050557101471261327 title="comment permalink">4/19/15, 1:38 AM</a><br><br>

The household economy has been torn asunder; we have all these wonderful appliances and time savers, each house a full set, and so little time (it seems). The atomization of our culture has swept away any semblance of extended family (that’s for poor folks, you know) and any given Friday evening or Saturday morning, mowers operated by individual house owners or their employees can be heard manicuring totally useless lawns, all to mimic the landed gentry. It makes me laugh, but feel teary-eyed at the same time! <br><br>Notice I say house owners, not home owners; the two have vastly different meanings to me. Home is so much more than house, but you already know that!<br><br>We are older and retired. One adult child is temporarily living with us right now, but she has plans to move out at the end of summer. We are not “there yet” with any of the children (10 between us, second marriage) where there is a desire for combining households. What we are able to do is to invest in good tools and declare them “family” possessions; so far we have a “family” mower, extension ladder, smaller ladders, wood splitter and chainsaw, and assorted hand tools as well as some power tools. And I can’t forget the poultry plucker my husband built for chicken and duck harvesting. We live near enough to be able to share these freely. It helps that we bought a tow-behind trailer, and are able to get things back and forth.<br> <br>You live far enough away that our approach might not be practical…but are there something or many things that your elders can bring to the table when visiting... special talents or skills? I’m thinking something like, “Instead of buying so many things for the children, could you make memories with them sharing something you enjoy?” Perhaps baking, sewing, knitting, gardening or building infrastructure outdoors, or just lying on a blanket out under the stars sharing the awe and wonder of it all…you know what I’m getting at, but only you and your husband know them well enough to figure out how to approach this idea…it may be too much, but it could be amazing! Of course, this can also be reciprocal..."What can we do while visiting you?"<br><br>I am afraid we will have to wait for the moments when there can be openness to living together…loss of a job, poor health and/or mobility, some tragedy that makes it seem acceptable. We have just been trained to reject the whole idea, as good an idea as it may be.<br><br>Peace,<br><br>Gail<br><br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c5596073204807431847 title="comment permalink">4/19/15, 7:36 AM</a><br><br>

Why? What exactly do computers do better than the alternative? Now look at the big list you came up with, and cross off all the ones that are either pointless or impractical in a world without fossil fuels to throw around. What's left?<br><br>A major component of my college education has been learning to use Geographic Information Systems. Any city planner or warlord at any time in history would have killed for the sort of things you can do with a GIS, but without satellites providing us with up-to-date imagery, most of that utility vanishes. There are still measurements you can take on the ground, but without fossils fuel transportation to get your researchers all over the landscape, the process of data collection takes so much longer than the process of analyzing the data by hand that trying to speed up the latter process is pointless. You can throw out the whole infrastructure needed for any vestige of computer technology to remain and replace it with a single skilled cartographer. <br><br>The same can be said for most other exclusive uses for computers--we need computers to manage massive amounts of data, but we only have massive amounts of data because we have computers and fossil fuels. <br><br>Instant communication over distances is probably the one use that's really worth it, but as JMG has pointed out multiple times, that can be accomplished by much simpler radio technology. <br><br>Then there's internet culture. Let's just say that I'm not the only member of my generation to look back with disgust when we think about what we were exposed to as pre-teens with computers in our bedrooms. <br><br>I predict that the last internet meme will be uttered when my generation's children ask us what the internet was like and we reply, "Nothing of value was lost."<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c3507955903918398763 title="comment permalink">4/19/15, 1:21 PM</a><br><br>

We don't have to worry about predicaments going away. We can (and in my opinion should) worry about our knowledge and our data going away. So we need means of archiving and learning. Big time. And here I refer you to Myriad 6:17 PM. Do you know how many Joules you burn through to archive a word, say on good paper (while the civilization is falling apart around you)? And a computer?

It still counts!<br><br>John, ah, I see that you haven't been following this blog for long. I've discussed all these issues at quite some length over the last nine years. If you don't have time to read the archives -- admittedly that's quite a task at this point -- you might consider a keyword search or two before making sweeping assumptions about what has and hasn't been covered here.<br><br>Latefall, well, yes -- salvage is already a growing economic sector, and we can expect it to grow substantially. Much will depend on the working life of salvaged electronics components, but I've been assuming all along that there will be some in working order for a long time yet -- my novel <i>Star's Reach</i> had a handful of laboriously repaired computers still in working order in the year 2480, for what that's worth. <br><br>Donalfagan, exactly. The internet was the product of the last major boomtime of industrial society, and is poorly adapted to an age of economic contraction. I should do a post on that -- it'll be amusing to see the geekoisie flocking in to pretend that I haven't said anything about economics, so they can propose technical solutions to a relentlessly nontechnical problem. <br><br>ZZ, yes, I saw that. It'll be interesting to see how long that lasts. <br><br>Wizzard, that's a great example of the way that the benefits of technology decline as the costs rise. Your response is a good one, too. <br><br>Ed-M, if you have to have an iPhone, no doubt a protective sleeve is a good idea. Myself, I prefer to avoid being inconvenienced by a broken iPhone by not owning one at all. <br><br>Tyler, how many of them get apoplectic, vs. the number that get sullen? And do any of them actually get the point? <br><br>Glenn, again, it's a long game. As their ordinary lives stop working, my guess is that you'll see more interest. <br><br>Leo, thanks for the reminder -- I need to add hand bookbinding to a list of skills to recommend!<br><br>Patricia, fascinating. <br><br>Renaissance, both of those are classics. BTW, don't dismiss your own prose style -- the comment about Harper's government and reality is choice.<br><br>Nastarana, thank you.

Raising children to be ready for the future we're facing is a tremendous responsibility, and I'm pleased to see people taking it seriously. <br><br>Tracy, hmm! I don't think I've encountered the addressograph before -- many thanks. The cyclostyle, btw, was a Victorian copying machine: the knowledge lectures of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn were printed on one, which is how I know about them. There are still a few around, but I doubt I'll ever find one!<br><br>Daelach, thank you. I doubt you'll be surprised to hear that that's what every other qualified electronics engineer has told me. <br><br>Shane, no argument there. I should do a post one of these days on the likely fate of California. <br><br>Bacchus, I encourage you to go do the research yourself. That way you can plan for the future based on knowledge rather than on vague hopes. <br><br>Myriad, all of that makes sense to me, for whatever that's worth. I hope the Almagest appears in other stories of yours, btw! It's an intriguing idea. <br><br>Sven, maybe so. Be careful what you wish for, though; a viable insurgency here in the US could as well trigger a prolonged period of conflict, in which government forces and insurgents alike pay no attention to little things like the human rights of noncombatants, and what used to be the US comes to resemble a failed Third World state. Not all changes are for the better, even if the starting point is not good. <br><br>James, of course. Since the internet isn't going to go away overnight, once it starts to break down, there'll be a transition period in which print media can be ramped up and word of the ADR's new format can be communicated by various means. I really do need to do a post on how the internet will die, don't I? <br><br>Latefall, yes, economies are certainly possible. My question, though, would be whether -- in a declining economy beset by multiple crises -- it will make any kind of sense to use the resulting chips for consumer goods, or whether instead they'll mostly go to governments, militaries, and essential industries. I suspect the latter. Thanks for the links, btw. <br><br>Sven, that's very good news indeed. <br><br>Patricia, well, it wasn't too hard to take the situation in Weimar Germany, adjust to fit the current resource and energy situation, and go from there. I still think that's quite a plausible scenario, for whatever that's worth. <br><br>Otto, funny. A case could be made!<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c6494101365941428767 title="comment permalink">4/19/15, 9:53 PM</a><br><br>

It's quite nice here, aside from the whole drought thing... Well, and the wildfires. Um, and earthquakes... Well, OK, there are some nice people.... Actually, a few too many. Ah well, it was a thought... ;)<br><br>Caryn, yes, from what I understand intergenerational living is still the norm in many parts of the world, as it was here before we lost our collective senses some decades ago. Of course, among some social classes it still persists here, but is seem as somehow embarrassing by the mainstream. <br><br>My parents and four siblings (and their families) and I have lived in many different combinations as circumstances shifted over the years. Now, alas, they are all far away and the family I married into doesn't have the same sort of history. As others have commented, I expect this sort of situation to become normal again here as economics force it, but I wonder how long the stigma will last. In my opinion, notwithstanding the kind of compromise and accommodation that margrh rightly pointed out is necessary in sharing space and interaction (with anyone!), this is one aspect of LESS that I actually think is better and would like to voluntarily move toward. Of course there are awful, difficult family living situations, which are best dissolved ASAP, but in my opinion the model of one nuclear family per overlarge house is just asking for waste and loneliness. <br><br>Nastarana- a hectoring and holier-than-thou tone- I will certainly try to avoid that.

That's exactly the point: green wizardry is not an excuse for trying to get other people to do something, much less an opportunity for self-righteous display. It's simply a set of choices that, from my perspective, make sense and offer some hope for the future. <br><br>Tye, er, did you read my response to Luke, or are you just ignoring the points I raised? <br><br>Caryn, glad to hear it. A happy collapse to you and yours!<br><br>HalFiore, I'd be happier publishing this in a weekly paper, of the sort that existed in profusion before the internet. As it is, my choices are constrained by the available media. <br><br>Sean, delighted to hear it. I haven't been to Calgary since I was a child, but who knows? So long as the trains still run there, it's a possibility. <br><br>Other Tom, you're most welcome, and thank you!<br><br>Roger, yes, I've noticed the same thing. There's also the aspect that nobody mentions, which is that your place in America's caste system primarily depends on how much money your parents made, which is not a very good predictor of intelligence. <br><br>Ed-M, you're welcome. I plan my walking routes to avoid such intersections as a matter of course.<br><br>Dan, funny. Yes, that makes sense. <br><br>Myriad, that's a good point. It occurs to me that the rhetoric around iPhones these days has a lot in common with the rhetoric around LSD in the 1960s -- some of us still remember how that was going to transform the world, the way connectivity is supposed to do so these days. <br><br>Myriad (again), it depends on the degree of externalization. A printing press operated by hand does indeed save labor; one person's close attention to typesetting makes up for hundreds of people paying the same attention to pens and paper. Once you start using extrasomatic power, though, you've got major externalities, and they mount up very, very fast. <br><br>Jeremy, sounds like a plan. Joseph Greenstein, one of the last of the great old-time strongmen, used to fast every Thursday; that and plenty of plain clean water were the foundations of his health regime, and the guy got well past his 84th birthday, with a level of fitness that a lot of athletic 20-year-olds can't match. <br><br>Shane, got it in one.

A useful reminder that simple mechanical technologies can accomplish plenty, if given the chance. <br><br>MawKernewek, in the US, when a company offers classes on job skills, you can basically assume that the only thing the classes actually do is put money into the pocket of the outfit that offers them.

However, like radio, its preservation is dependent on a dispersed pool of people actively practicing and passing on production techniques. My sister is T1 diabetic so I also have a personal interest. This is the results of my research so far:<br><br>1. low tech refined, injectable animal insulin works ‘ok’ for many people, evidence is: (a) mean life expectancy of T1 diabetics at birth of 45yrs if born 1939-1945 and diagnosed around 10yrs old; (b) Eva Saxl and her husband (with no medical or chemistry experience, in WWII Japanese occupied Shanghai) kept several hundred diabetics alive (including Eva) for four years, refining animal insulin in a home lab using a 1921 recipe.<br> <br>2. current paradigm focuses on stabilising blood sugar at the lowest level possible to maximise long term health. Instead a focus on minimising required supplemental insulin may worsen blood sugar control but make insulin treatment feasible with severe resource constraints and may help retain limited beta cell function. ie, only enough glucose/insulin to maintain mucous secretions, sex hormones, avoid brain starvation and keep out of ketoacidosis, ketones (fat) can fuel everything else without insulin. Public T1 relevant research exists on: eating very low carb, avoiding common autoimmune food triggers, retention of limited beta cell function by some T1s, and herbs to protect organs and/or incrementally improve glucose utilisation.<br><br>3. imminent patent expiry on early insulin formulations – so domestic charitable or university linked labs could legally manufacture ‘no-frills’ insulin once supplies become restricted (as a sort of charity for the poor). If not, history from warzones and the third world indicate that likely alternatives in early stages of collapse include (expensive, dubious quality) black market generic insulin imported from third world manufacturers and domestic manufacture by existing drug gangs. Detailed recipes are available which appear to be involved but reasonably doable for someone with access to animal pancreases as well as a variety of basic chemistry equipment and consumables. Eg internet search: ‘Banting 1925 Noble lecture’, ‘On the Preparation of Insulin’ by Somogyi, Doisy and Shaffer 1924 and ‘Experiments on the chemical behaviour of insulin’ 1924 thesis by George Alles. <br><br>4. reuseable/sharpenable needles and reliable urine testing techniques are also important. Working out how to make the chemical reagents and consumables like filter paper (or simple substitutes) from local sources will be important to long-term preservation. <br><br>JMG always asks what people are doing themselves to prepare. I can’t ethically justify doing the necessary animal testing prior to any significant collapse. However, I’m learning herbal medicine as part of my collapse repertoire of tradeable skills and I plan to start practicing chemistry techniques for refining and purifying various substances within the next year.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c227627164634755819 title="comment permalink">4/20/15, 2:33 AM</a><br><br>

Will they physically get their hands on fragile computer hardware so they can drop it? It seems highly unlikely - you may remember One Laptop Per Child?

There is shortage of night vision, thermal vision, communication gear, organization, good optics, and spare parts. A US insurgency will be different in a couple of ways through. Initially there won't be a shortage of sensors. Also the combination of precision artillery (rounds) and drones (collapsed air force) will be very hard on anything suspicious outside urban environment. A very well trained Abrams crew took 6.2s for targets (1.6m x 1.9m) popping up somewhere between 800-2000m away (I believe while moving). In 1985. Night time will probably be significantly more in favor of tech. Drones should make this even harder on the grunt, and be relatively cost effective. At least you won't spend much fuel in pilot training. <br>France is one of the leaders for military integrated optics and runs on nuclear power. Also it'll probably have ample occasion to use drones.<br>Smartphone level tech is absolutely sufficient for drones (or small decentralized research labs - in case the drone is off-duty, and you have some more lower tech extensions). <br><br>Re consumers<br>I am in the early concept stage of a more resource efficient (perhaps appropriate) OLPC-style digital tech thing. That would share one audio device between 3 young people, hopefully be good for a decade at least (with local maintenance), perhaps significantly more. Ideally the cost would be stretched to make it beat the cost of centralized schools that require physical presence and make it pay for itself.

Computational uses can be further divided into two subcategories or levels of computation – intensive (e.g., weather forecasting and image processing) and light (e.g., accounting and basic math, mostly adding/subtracting, but some multiplying and dividing). By communication uses, I mean mainly the shuttling of bytes back and forth to run the phone system and the internet. And by text processing, I’m referring to mainly clerical uses (e.g., word processing and maybe rendering of web pages). I further posit that these three categories are in order of importance, with computation being the highest use and basic text processing the least.<br><br>I will argue when the time comes, push comes to shove due to costs, availability, etc., that we will see computers continue to be applied to only the highest uses, if at all. Forget about personal uses of computers, they will be one of the first uses to disappear as computers will once again become more expensive. Granted, salvaged and repurposed computers will muddle things for quite some time, but as the supply diminishes and computers get harder and more costlier to manufacture, only big time users like the military, government, and big business will have computers, which is exactly how it all began back in the 1940s and 1950s.<br><br>Others have mentioned that computers can indeed be built out of discrete components (transistors, capacitors, diodes, and resisters mainly), and that they will be big and bulky. Computers can even be built out of electromagnetic relays and transformers, which I argue will eventually be the primary form of those computers that survive beyond the scavenger and salvage eras. An electromechanical relay computer is one of the few forms of an electrical computer that can be made essentially entirely by hand, as long as one can forge metal ore into wires and bronze, brass, or steel parts. Another form of hand-produced computer is the analog computer in either its mechanical or electronic, particularly for questions requiring simultaneous mathematic solutions (such as with natural processes such as water flow and weather forecasting). It will be because of the slowness and cost that only a few uses will survive, and will certainly raise the question of whether computers are worth the expense. Computers will once again become more specialized in their use and design (as someone else has already mentioned) as one means to keep costs down, as specialized computers can potentially require fewer parts than a general-purpose computer.<br><br>When you look at the uses I listed first, it doesn’t take much to realize that all those uses are potentially expendable as far as computers being necessary to carry out the tasks. There will once again be substitute (or rediscovered) ways to do all the uses that will emerge for today’s computers, just as there were ways all were done (albeit not as fast or accurate) before the advent of the computer, which in modern form only really began in the 1930s just prior to WW II.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c6611740004245892899 title="comment permalink">4/20/15, 11:57 AM</a><br><br>

Lately we've been discussing communication, which got brought up when I wanted to let students know about a bike to campus event I was planning (to encourage people to use cars L.E.S.S.). Do they check facebook? No. Read email blasts from college administration or anyone else? No. Pay attention to online ads? No. Pay attention to texts from anyone they don't know? No. <br><br>So, I asked, how can I let you know about sustainability events I'm planning?<br><br>It comes down to word of mouth. Their recommendations: I can tell them (and give them paper handouts) and they'll tell their friends who will tell other friends; and I can let others such as faculty and counselors who interact with students know, and they tell the students during class or other meetings. With this decidedly retro method I have been able to increase interest and participation.<br><br>Is this an indication of the passing of the electronic connectedness fad? Perhaps. I also think that these students have an understandable distrust of much electronic communication and are skeptical of anything that appears to be marketing.<br><br>BTW, many community colleges offer reasonably priced classes for useful (green wizardly) skills that will come in handy now and in the future. They might be a good option for people with no older relatives or other experts around to show them things.

Perhaps some actionable information that lets them get into positions from which to collapse "with relative comfort"? I will probably have that conversation with my father soon. I think he started out meaning well (seriously wanted to become a homesteader in BC - but my mother did not). Last year he kind of surprisingly withdrew from the family pulling the carpet out from under most preparations of value me and my already thoroughly collapsed siblings had to look forward to. Bought another car, moved to the city and started to work for big pharma, and now seems to be waiting for cold fusion to bail us out. He has seen his new and perhaps only granddaughter once in real life. I am trying not to complain too bad here. Just trying to point out a few things one could avoid when collapsing (nod @Jo). Things could be a lot worse for me. We still have my inlaws (whom we kind of ran away from) partially because they, especially their boss (MIL) does not, "get it" - in the LEAST. After having made a career in the EPA equivalent. It is a difficult relationship but they are well meaning. I managed to get them to plant a tree on their lawn for their granddaughter. <br>Perhaps you could hand your sons a lightly annotated copy of Overshoot by Catton each (maybe with an ornate -not cheap- box to store it for future generations) and say: "Homework till XY! Drinks are on me." I'd like to avoid having to struggle through a long discussion before one starts to establish consensus and dissensus. Perhaps one could bring up your last will in that context as well.<br>Another thing is this 2-4-8 scheme for keeping population steady.

No one in their right mind would use a weed whacker for that job. It is not in any way an appropriate (even in its own milieu) tool for cutting tall grass in a flat, open field. You also wouldn't want to use that scythe with its fine peened edge around the side of a building, where the whacker excels.<br><br>A more appropriate contest would have been against a mower. Making the contest fair would require a bit of a judgement call, but for that little patch, the appropriate size mower would probably be a reel-type push mower or a non-self-propelled power mower, say about an 18" blade in my opinion. I think the scythe would probably have still beat the reel mower (they're lousy on tall grass like that), and it would be a close call against the power mower. But then, and this is the part I would bold if I weren't too lazy to relearn how to do that, you would also have to account for the time spent earning the money to buy the mower and the fuel. That's assuming the cost of those items accounts for all of the externalities involved in their production. I think here, the scythe most likely still wins.<br><br>Now, if you have a larger and more realistic area to mow, say an acre or two, and it includes hard edges or soft things you're worried about damaging, it would require a different calculation. I'm pretty sure my 5' finish mower could trounce the scythe head-to-head, but then you have to count the cost of the tractor, mower, and diesel. Which would have to be apportioned according to all of the other jobs the tractor does on the farm.<br><br>I buy all of my equipment used, but one friend suggested I am the one person who should buy new because I'm such a lousy mechanic.<br><br>I'd say there's probably less down time with a scythe than with antique farm equipment, but then one does spend a lot of time peening and honing, it seems.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c6619625826743568497 title="comment permalink">4/20/15, 5:06 PM</a><br><br>

As I'm sure you're well aware, Harvard professors and other respectable people aren't allowed to say the kind of things I get away with saying.

I field a lot of flak about the fact that I publish these essays on the internet, so mistook your comment for more of that. <br><br>Tracy, many thanks! I doubt you'll find a cyclostyle -- there are still apparently some in circulation, but not many -- but an addressograph would be very cool. I've added the multigraph to the list of devices to look for -- that would be as good as a mimeograph for printing a weekly Archdruid Report newsletter. <br><br>Bacchus, you're quite correct that I wasn't being patronizing. I meant it quite seriously: most of the people who claim that the internet can, or must, or might survive the collapse of the current industrial economy have done little or no personal research on what would be involved, and so I make it a habit to encourage them to look things up for themselves. <br><br>FiftyNiner, yes, that's a likely scenario.

That's a bitter possibility, and it's even more bitter to recognize that their cheers won't be unjustified. This country has made such a mess of things!<br><br>Jonathan, I really have no idea what to say.

I might have a small advantage as my wife and I were very aware of PO and the various other related issues we face while our children were growing up. They've heard the talk many times, and sort of know it; but it hasn't really "soaked in" yet.<br><br>Key I think is not framing this a generational thing ("your generation used up all the XYZ stuff before we could use some of it"). Rather it is to re-examine what a person and family needs to be happy and prosperous. <br><br>The past generation or two has swallowed, hook line and sinker, the Madison Ave message that to be happy you need more and newer stuff. All the time. That has driven much of the resource use and associated problems that we now are starting to recognize. <br><br>Rather than blaming a generation for being greedy (which in hindsight we probably were) it would be far more constructive if the upcoming generations could look at this lie we believed and fix that. <br><br>More new stuff all the time did not make us happy. Probably wouldn't make the next generation happy either, if there were still enough stuff to let them have a go at it too. <br><br>Instead, might be a more useful conversation to examine what people really need to be happy (and not just blindly accept Madison Ave's view on it). <br><br>Having this latter conversation can be very difficult, regardless of which generations are involved.

Probably. Is it a personal failing of theirs that makes them particularly evil? Idk. I think it all goes back to what JMG has said about the hard and fast limits to human thinking and behavior and the even more constrained limits to collective behavior and thought. I'm not sure that any group of people presented with the extravagance of postwar America, and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the Western world, would have behaved any differently. Certainly, JMG has discussed the futility of presenting an ideal behavior/society and demanding people live up to it as an effective method of change. He has presented the alternative that was abandoned in 1980, and it was the greatest, silents, and boomers who collectively controlled the levers of power at that time. For whatever reason, society collectively recoiled in horror at LESS. Perhaps this is why it is nearly universal that religions warn against gluttony and pursuit of wealth and personal gain. Perhaps it is a truism that it is corrupting.

I was 14 when Reagan came to power. To say he was considered a hero at that time is an understatement. (Even today, he is considered a hero to nearly every Republican, given how constantly they still invoke his name. IDK what the Dems today think about him.)<br><br>At that time, he was seen as saving American its "face", its power/prestige in the world, its ability to win wars and have a booming economy, etc. I really don't think most people were just plain greedy. They wanted that vision back.<br><br>To understand a culture, you have to look at their myths. A huge myth in America has always been the Western cowboy. Tough, independent, not afraid of a fight, not gonna take any crap, with a fair amount of swagger and a bandana thrown in for good measure. <br><br>That mindset is still stamped all over this country. I don't think it's any accident that Reagan, who often played a cowboy as an actor, ended up as a two-term president. <br><br>Americans wanted (and still want) to be the cowboy, telling (&amp; showing) the rest of the world how it's done and bugger you if you don't agree with us. That's what I remember what Reagan seemed to be offering, and what so many people believed - and loved.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c3551922088505625036 title="comment permalink">4/22/15, 4:09 PM</a><br><br>

"There are four occupations where we frequently see psychopaths:" he told me. "Politicians, top business executives, policemen, and criminals. It is mostly the resources available to them that determines who ends up in what position. The outlook and the behaviours are the same."<br><br>This was alarming news to me, so I pressed for more information. "Could there be such a thing as a well-intentioned psychopath? Maybe someone who is a politician that does not care about individuals, but at least wants society to work better and is interested in doing the right thing?" I was thinking about the tyrant, Lord Vetinari, in Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels.<br><br>"No," said my friend flatly. "Psychopaths view people as objects, no different from, say, a piece of firewood. There is limited evidence that a few psychopaths may have minor feelings for members of their own family, but mostly not even that."<br>"So you wonder," he continued, "who benefits when our psychopath politician goes to meet with the psychopath politician running another country--Probably not you and me."<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c6546409069518371999 title="comment permalink">4/23/15, 6:44 AM</a><br><br>

It really isn't that difficlult to figure out.<br>Renewables will only delay the inevitable and will only benefit the wealthy and take means away from the most important change that needs to be made, and that is how we produce our food. Currently our 'farming' practices consist of turning fossil fuels into food. People always go straight to energy when they think about the decline of FF availability. They forget that food will also disappear as we know it, and best of all, all the crappy food that is processed. However, people unknowingly are making the decision that having electricity or transportation should be maintianed (renewables) and that food will just have to be sacraficed. Apparently we can eat electricity and oil.<br>This is why there will be massive famine.<br>The other thing I would like to stress to those currently growing or planning to grow their own food is the importance of perrenials (and Permaculture). Perennials require nearly zero maintenance and zero soil disturbance. I am planning my permaculture system around perennials and consider annuals to be summer/fall bonus to diversify my diet.<br>Investigate your climates growing potential for perennial vegetables, fruits and nuts.<br>Perennials require <b>less water</b> as well.<br><br><a href=the-retro-future.html#c2543369235717047819 title="comment permalink">4/26/15, 3:22 PM</a><br><br>
