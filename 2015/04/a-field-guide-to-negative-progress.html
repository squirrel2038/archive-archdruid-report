<div class=MsoNormal>
I've commented before in these posts that writing is always partly a social activity. What Mortimer Adler used to call the Great Conversation, the dance of ideas down the corridors of the centuries, shapes every word in a writer’s toolkit; you can hardly write a page in English without drawing on a shade of meaning that Geoffrey Chaucer, say, or William Shakespeare, or Jane Austen first put into the language. That said, there’s also a more immediate sense in which any writer who interacts with his or her readers is part of a social activity, and one of the benefits came my way just after last week’s post. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That post began with a discussion of the increasingly surreal quality of America’s collective life these days, and one of my readers—tip of the archdruidical hat to Anton Mett—had a fine example to offer. He’d listened to an economic report on the media, and the talking heads were going on and on about the US economy’s current condition of, ahem, “negative growth.” Negative growth? Why yes, that’s the opposite of growth, and it’s apparently quite a common bit of jargon in economics just now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of course the English language, as used by the authors named earlier among many others, has no shortage of perfectly clear words for the opposite of growth. “Decline” comes to mind; so does “decrease,” and so does “contraction.” Would it have been so very hard for the talking heads in that program, or their many equivalents in our economic life generally, to draw in a deep breath and actually come right out and say “The US economy has contracted,” or “GDP has decreased,” or even “we’re currently in a state of economic decline”? Come on, economists, you can do it!</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
But of course they can’t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Economists in general are supposed to provide, shall we say, negative clarity when discussing certain aspects of contemporary American economic life, and talking heads in the media are even more subject to this rule than most of their peers. Among the things about which they’re supposed to be negatively clear, two are particularly relevant here; the first is that economic contraction happens, and the second is that that letting too much of the national wealth end up in too few hands is a very effective way to cause economic contraction. The logic here is uncomfortably straightforward—an economy that depends on consumer expenditures only prospers if consumers have plenty of money to spend—but talking about that equation would cast an unwelcome light on the culture of mindless kleptocracy entrenched these days at the upper end of the US socioeconomic ladder. So we get to witness the mass production of negative clarity about one of the main causes of negative growth.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s entrancing to think of other uses for this convenient mode of putting things. I can readily see it finding a role in health care—“I’m sorry, ma’am,” the doctor says, “but your husband is negatively alive;” in sports—“Well, Joe, unless the Orioles can cut down that negative lead of theirs, they’re likely headed for a negative win;” and in the news—“The situation in Yemen is shaping up to be yet another negative triumph for US foreign policy.” For that matter, it’s time to update one of the more useful proverbs of recent years: what do you call an economist who makes a prediction? Negatively right. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Come to think of it, we might as well borrow the same turn of phrase for the subject of last week’s post, the deliberate adoption of older, simpler, more independent technologies in place of today’s newer, more complex, and more interconnected ones. I’ve been talking about that project so far under the negatively mealy-mouthed label “intentional technological regress,” but hey, why not be cool and adopt the latest fashion? For this week, at least, we’ll therefore redefine our terms a bit, and describe the same thing as “negative progress.” Since negative growth sounds like just another kind of growth, negative progress ought to pass for another kind of progress, right? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With this in mind, I’d like to talk about some of the reasons that individuals, families, organizations, and communities, as they wend their way through today’s cafeteria of technological choices, might want to consider loading up their plates with a good hearty helping of negative progress.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s start by returning to one of the central points raised here in earlier posts, the relationship between progress and the production of externalities. By and large, the more recent a technology is, the more of its costs aren’t paid by the makers or the users of the technology, but are pushed off onto someone else. As I pointed out <a href=../../2015/02/the-externality-trap-or-how-progress.html>a post two months ago</a>, this isn’t accidental; quite the contrary, as noted in the post just cited, it’s hardwired into the relationship between progress and market economics, and bids fair to play a central role in the unraveling of the entire project of industrial civilization. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same process of increasing externalities, though, has another face when seen from the point of view of the individual user of any given technology. When you externalize any cost of a technology, you become dependent on whoever or whatever picks up the cost you’re not paying. What’s more, you become dependent on the system that does the externalizing, and on whoever controls that system. Those dependencies aren’t always obvious, but they impose costs of their own, some financial and some less tangible. What’s more, unlike the externalized costs, a great many of these secondary costs land directly on the user of the technology. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s interesting, and may not be entirely accidental, that there’s no commonly used term for the entire structure of externalities and dependencies that stand behind any technology. Such a term is necessary here, so for the present purpose,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>we’ll call the structure just named the technology’s <i>externality system</i>. Given that turn of phrase, we can restate the point about progress made above: by and large, the more recent a technology is, the larger the externality system on which it depends. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
An example will be useful here, so let’s compare the respective externality systems of a bicycle and an automobile. Like most externality systems, these divide up more or less naturally into three categories: manufacture, maintenance, and use. Everything that goes into fabricating steel parts, for instance, all the way back to the iron ore in the mine, is an externality of manufacture; everything that goes into making lubricating oil, all the way back to drilling for the oil well, is an externality of maintenance; everything that goes into building roads suitable for bikes and cars is an externality of use. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Both externality systems are complex, and include a great many things that aren’t obvious at first glance. The point I want to make here, though, is that the car’s externality system is far and away the more complex of the two. In fact, the bike’s externality system is a subset of the car’s, and this reflects the specific historical order in which the two technologies were developed. When the technologies that were needed for a bicycle’s externality system came into use, the first bicycles appeared; when all the additional technologies needed for a car’s externality system were added onto that foundation, the first cars followed. That sort of incremental addition of externality-generating technologies is far and away the most common way that technology progresses. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We can thus restate the pattern just analyzed in a way that brings out some of its less visible and more troublesome aspects: by and large, each new generation of technology imposes more dependencies on its users than the generation it replaces. Again, a comparison between bicycles and automobiles will help make that clear. If you want to ride a bike, you’ve committed yourself to dependence on all the technical, economic, and social systems that go into manufacturing, maintaining, and using the bike; you can’t own, maintain, and ride a bike without the steel mills that produce the frame, the chemical plants that produce the oil you squirt on the gears, the gravel pits that provide raw material for roads and bike paths, and so on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On the other hand, you’re not dependent on a galaxy of other systems that provide the externality system for your neighbor who drives. You don’t depend on the immense network of pipelines, tanker trucks, and gas stations that provide him with fuel; you don’t depend on the interstate highway system or the immense infrastructure that supports it; if you did the sensible thing and bought a bike that was made by a local craftsperson, your dependence on vast multinational corporations and all of their infrastructure, from sweatshop labor in Third World countries to financial shenanigans on Wall Street, is considerably smaller than that of your driving neighbor. Every dependency you have, your neighbor also has, but not vice versa. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Whether or not these dependencies matter is a complex thing. Obviously there’s a personal equation—some people like to be independent, others are fine with being just one more cog in the megamachine—but there’s also a historical factor to consider. In an age of economic expansion, the benefits of dependency very often outweigh the costs; standards of living are rising, opportunities abound, and it’s easy to offset the costs of any given dependency. In a stable economy, one that’s neither growing nor contracting, the benefits and costs of any given dependency need to be weighed carefully on a case by case basis, as one dependency may be worth accepting while another costs more than it’s worth. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On the other hand, in an age of contraction and decline—or, shall we say, negative expansion?—most dependencies are problematic, and some are lethal. In a contracting economy, as everyone scrambles to hold onto as much as possible of the lifestyles of a more prosperous age, your profit is by definition someone else’s loss, and dependency is just another weapon in the Hobbesian war of all against all. By many measures, the US economy has been contracting since before the bursting of the housing bubble in 2008; by some—in particular, the median and modal standards of living—it’s been contracting since the 1970s, and the unmistakable hissing sound as air leaks out of the fracking bubble just now should be considered fair warning that another round of contraction is on its way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With that in mind, it’s time to talk about the downsides of dependency. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
First of all, <b>dependency is expensive</b>. In the struggle for shares of a shrinking pie in a contracting economy, turning any available dependency into a cash cow is an obvious strategy, and one that’s already very much in play. Consider the conversion of freeways into toll roads, an increasingly popular strategy in large parts of the United States. Consider, for that matter, the soaring price of health care in the US, which hasn’t been accompanied by any noticeable increase in quality of care or treatment outcomes. In the dog-eat-dog world of economic contraction, commuters and sick people are just two of many captive populations whose dependencies make them vulnerable to exploitation. As the spiral of decline continues, it’s safe to assume that any dependency that can be exploited will be exploited, and the more dependencies you have, the more likely you are to be squeezed dry. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same principle applies to power as well as money; thus, <b>whoever owns the systems on which you depend, owns you</b>. In the United States, again, laws meant to protect employees from abusive behavior on the part of employers are increasingly ignored; as the number of the permanently unemployed keeps climbing year after year, employers know that those who still have jobs are desperate to keep them, and will put up with almost anything in order to keep that paycheck coming in. The old adage about the inadvisability of trying to fight City Hall has its roots in this same phenomenon; no matter what rights you have on paper, you’re not likely to get far with them when the other side can stop picking up your garbage and then fine you for creating a public nuisance, or engage in some other equally creative use of their official prerogatives. As decline accelerates, expect to see dependencies increasingly used as levers for exerting various kinds of economic, political, and social power at your expense. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finally, and crucially, if you’re dependent on a failing system, <b>when the system goes down, so do you</b>. That’s not just an issue for the future; it’s a huge if still largely unmentioned reality of life in today’s America, and in most other corners of the industrial world as well. Most of today’s permanently unemployed got that way because the job on which they depended for their livelihood got offshored or automated out of existence; much of the rising tide of poverty across the United States is a direct result of the collapse of political and social systems that once countered the free market’s innate tendency to drive the gap between rich and poor to Dickensian extremes. For that matter, how many people who never learned how to read a road map are already finding themselves in random places far from help because something went wrong with their GPS units? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s very popular among those who recognize the problem with being shackled to a collapsing system to insist that it’s a problem for the future, not the present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They grant that dependency is going to be a losing bet someday, but everything’s fine for now, so why not enjoy the latest technological gimmickry while it’s here? Of course that presupposes that you enjoy the latest technological gimmicry, which <a href=../../2015/02/the-butlerian-carnival.html>isn’t necessarily a safe bet</a>, and it also ignores the first two difficulties with dependency outlined above, which are very much present and accounted for right now. We’ll let both those issues pass for the moment, though, because there’s another factor that needs to be included in the calculation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A practical example, again, will be useful here. In my experience, it takes around five years of hard work, study, and learning from your mistakes to become a competent vegetable gardener. If you’re transitioning from buying all your vegetables at the grocery store to growing them in your backyard, in other words, you need to start gardening about five years before your last trip to the grocery store. The skill and hard work that goes into growing vegetables is one of many things that most people in the world’s industrial nations externalize, and those things don’t just pop back to you when you leave the produce section of the store for the last time. There’s a learning curve that has to be undergone. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Not that long ago, there used to be a subset of preppers who grasped the fact that a stash of cartridges and canned wieners in a locked box at their favorite deer camp cabin wasn’t going to get them through the downfall of industrial civilization, but hadn’t factored in the learning curve. Businesses targeting the prepper market thus used to sell these garden-in-a-box kits, which had seed packets for vegetables, a few tools, and a little manual on how to grow a garden. It’s a good thing that Y2K, 2012, and all those other dates when doom was supposed to arrive turned out to be wrong, because I met a fair number of people who thought that having one of those kits would save them even though they last grew a plant from seed in fourth grade. If the apocalypse had actually arrived, survivors a few years later would have gotten used to a landscape scattered with empty garden-in-a-box kits, overgrown garden patches, and the skeletal remains of preppers who starved to death because the learning curve lasted just that much longer than they did. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same principle applies to every other set of skills that has been externalized by people in today’s industrial society, and will be coming back home to roost as economic contraction starts to cut into the viability of our externality systems. You can adopt them now, when you have time to get through the learning curve while there’s still an industrial society around to make up for the mistakes and failures that are inseparable from learning, or you can try to adopt them later, when those same inevitable mistakes and failures could very well land you in a world of hurt. You can also adopt them now, when your dependencies haven’t yet been used to empty your wallet and control your behavior, or you can try to adopt them later, when a much larger fraction of the resources and autonomy you might have used for the purpose will have been extracted from you by way of those same dependencies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is a point I’ve made <a href=../../2011/05/downside-of-dependence.html>in previous posts here</a>, but it applies with particular force to negative progress—that is, to the deliberate adoption of older, simpler, more independent technologies in place of the latest, dependency-laden offerings from the corporate machine. As decline—or, shall we say, negative growth—becomes an inescapable fact of life in postprogress America, decreasing your dependence on sprawling externality systems is going to be an essential tactic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those who become early adopters of the retro future, to use an edgy term from last week’s post, will have at least two, and potentially three, significant advantages. The first, as already noted, is that they’ll be much further along the learning curve by the time rising costs, increasing instabilities, and cascading systems failures either put the complex technosystems out of reach or push the relationship between costs and benefits well over into losing-proposition territory. The second is that as more people catch onto the advantages of older, simpler, more sustainable technologies, surviving examples will become harder to find and more expensive to buy; in this case as in many others, collapsing first ahead of the rush is, among other things, the more affordable option. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The third advantage? Depending on exactly which old technologies you happen to adopt, and whether or not you have any talent for basement-workshop manufacture and the like, you may find yourself on the way to a viable new career as most other people will be losing their jobs—and their shirts. As the global economy comes unraveled and people in the United States lose their current access to shoddy imports from Third World sweatshops, there will be a demand for a wide range of tools and simple technologies that still make sense in a deindustrializing world. Those who already know how to use such technologies will be prepared to teach others how to use them; those who know how to repair, recondition, or manufacture those technologies will be prepared to barter, or to use whatever form of currency happens to replace today’s mostly hallucinatory forms of money, to good advantage. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
My guess, for what it’s worth, is that salvage trades will be among the few growth industries in the 21st century, and the crafts involved in turning scrap metal and antique machinery into tools and machines that people need for their homes and workplaces will be an important part of that economic sector. To understand how that will work, though, it’s probably going to be necessary to get a clearer sense of the way that today’s complex technostructures are likely to come apart. Next week, with that in mind, we’ll spend some time thinking about the unthinkable—the impending death of the internet.</div>

I had read all of 2009 initially, choosing that as probably containing some very appropriate words on the failing US economy. Of course any year of late is no doubt subject to countless PhD dissertations in the economic faculties of our most august institutions. I would bet, though, that they are filled with more of the useless double talk that you point out in this weeks post.<br>Oh so easy to get an advanced degree when you understand the kind of smoke that a particular derriere requires!<br><br>As we go along I am impressed by the way you are narrowing the focus of collapse from the general to the specifics of what people are likely to actually have to do to survive. Your writings have given me the confidence that I have the knowledge and abilities to make a pretty good go of it.<br><br>Half of my lifetime ago(1980s) I educated myself completely in organic gardening, from Rudolph Steiner to Albert Howard on through to John Jeavons. the Nearings, etc. I had a couple of years of prodigiously productive gardens before I answered the call to take a job which had me working upwards of 60 hours per week and the gardening came to a complete halt. Looking back, I would have been better off to pass on the job and expand my garden to a small organic farm, but at the time no one around here know what 'organic' meant!<br><br>Oh BTW the seed kit 'gardens in a box' that you reference are still available on the internet and I chuckle each time I see them. But I also realize that in the interim my gardening skills have atrophied just as have my writing skills and will require close attention to detail to be back up to speed.<br><br>I plan in the next couple of weeks to order my non-GMO heirloom garden seeds that if I am serious and attentive I should not have to order again!<br><br>Additionally, I have been making a point of sounding people out as I make the obligatory trips to shop for the provisions that we still seem to require so much of. It is beginning to amaze me at the number of people who have a sense of impending cataclysm--but of course in this part of the world it's all Obama's fault--and I don't have the heart to tell them that he doesn't have a clue!<br><br><a href=#c1406365561868834972 title="comment permalink">4/22/15, 7:10 PM</a><br><br>

It also reminds me of the news out of Germany about negative interest rates on bonds, which is a way of describing (with negative clarity) the act of paying the German government to borrow your money. Nice work if you can get it.<br><br>The discussion of declining living standards and doublespeak is apropos this week as well, as the politicians and corporate media are trying to spin the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal to be somehow good for the US middle class and environmental protections. It's almost as though they're trying to distract people from the obvious results of every trade deal that's been signed in the last 20 years by shouting loudly that this time it's different. <br><br>It's no longer surprising to me, but on issue after issue I can't help thinking you're on to something with your hypothesis that all the propagandists from the former USSR have, like the German scientists from 50 years before them, taken up their old occupations here in the USA.<br><br><a href=#c1902113563493539439 title="comment permalink">4/22/15, 7:14 PM</a><br><br>

Having geckos means needing reliable electricity for heating. Using heat lamps means having to keep buying bulbs which seem to be designed to die very quickly. I also have assorted temporary warmth-producing items in case of power failures, and fluorescent lights for the live plants in their tanks. One of my geckos refuses to eat anything other than crickets, which means I'm buying live crickets for him at least every other week. It's a good thing I work at a pet store. He won't eat woodlice I catch, won't eat the mealworms I breed at home. If they were diurnal geckos I'd also have to worry about having special UVB lighting for them. <br><br>I think that this type of dependency on things few people need is going to hit the reptile hobby hard here in Canada when things fall much further apart. At least with tropical fish you aren't needing to visit the store every week or two for basic food, or replace the heater every few months. There are a lot more people that keep fish, too, so supplies are likely to be easier to find for longer. Out of all the major groups of animal pets, reptiles and amphibians were the last to really catch on and I think this dependency issue is a good portion of the reason (along with the fact that relatively few people love reptiles).<br><br><a href=#c3433250287021622070 title="comment permalink">4/22/15, 7:35 PM</a><br><br>

First of all, opening a new patch of ground is a lot of work. I was pleased with my results, but I had a lot of things that didn't do well, and just some mistakes that were rather small, like not knowing that some vegetables are ready very quickly, (radishes, cilantro) and almost missing harvesting them. I didn't realize how huge certain plants become, and so my garden was a mess that I could hardly walk around. Some things like peas, if you don't provide a climbing structure for them, will not produce much and some items absolutely must be weeded, like onions, or they disappear. This year, I am much more organized and much more determined to mulch properly. I have serious tomato cages. This year, I have a much better idea how many pounds of potatoes to plant. Also, I am improving the soil as I go, and it should improve each year.<br><br>We've got a local family around here who are a goldmine of information and they are making their livelihood from farming and teaching. Bob Gregory of Berea Gardens (.com) has a website worth checking out. He does week long training seminars monthly, but also has a 6 CD set, each is about 90 minutes long and he discusses more than you might ever have thought of, involving growing things. For example, my nearest neighbor has been vegetable farming for over 40 years and got an award from the farmer's market, yet he took Bob's course and bought the CD set and goes to Bob for advice regularly. If you've got a few bucks to spend, or if you can go in together with some others, consider getting that CD set. Because of him I started my garden with a soil analysis from a competent lab and knew what minerals it was missing and how to calculate what to add. He's a 7th Day Adventist, and once or twice says something of a religious nature, but its pretty low key. <br><br>There are other learning curves, such as building community. Chickens are a learning curve. I'm still in the process of figuring out which breeds I want. All that I bought last year are not it. <br>Oh, and another learning curve for me is seed saving. I saved quite a few seeds, but some things I just haven't figured out how to do it, or they didn't go to seed, or you collect it the second year and I didn't know that.<br><br><a href=#c7474038813616878055 title="comment permalink">4/22/15, 8:29 PM</a><br><br>

I am reminded of some of my pioneering ancestors who in the late 18th century carved out sustainable communities along the Ohio River, just west of where you live in Cumberland, Md. As they moved west, they had to be very discriminating about which tools and technologies among the growing number available in that era would really make their lives better without burdening them economically or compromising their independence--like durable rifles and wagons that could be repaired locally.

I've been brainstorming for a better phrase than "externality system" and have a few suggestions. Naming the concept will give it a firm reality in the minds of your audience.<br><br>But first, I'd like to point out how funny I find it that the spell checker in your comments section doesn't recognize "externality" as a word. That pretty much encapsulates the flaws of modern thinking, doesn't it? Anyways, onto my suggestions:<br><br><b>The Externet</b> - I think the term should imply just how dependent we are upon it, and how this externality system is really another element of our "infrastructure" in a broad sense. The externet is to industrial processes what the internet is to information processes in modern civilization. It suggests pervasiveness, interconnectedness, and is decently catchy.<br><br><b>The Rust Dump</b> - The rust dump is the counterpart to the old rust belt; it's the filthy funnel or chemical-laden waste site that pours the unwanted crap out of sight and out of mind. Rust pipe works too.<br><br><b>The Waste Grid</b> - a networked, essential, integral system upon which our modern technologies depend (just like the electrical grid) for their functioning. The four letter alternative for "waste" works as well and sounds better, but this is a PG blog after all.<br><br>There's all sorts of fun words we can create for this! For instance, we could call the problems that come from the externet "dilutionitis." The supposed solution to pollution is dilution, until it becomes pervasive and leads to worldwide inflammation. If left untreated, it can lead to pollutionosis, chemical maldependency, or even crudabolic collapse.<br><br>Come on, everybody, join in and create your own! Perhaps JMG will take a liking to it and it'll become the next Green Wizardry!<br><br><a href=#c4891736416823502373 title="comment permalink">4/22/15, 10:32 PM</a><br><br>

Church's blog: https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/ <br><br>Basically, his thesis is that startups are the Disney-preneur version of starting a new business. Rich kids have their future settled, but they need to be "seen to earn it" in order to keep up with the US meme of rugged individualists. So they go to California and use their intangible family connections to get access to the Venture Capitalist cabal there.<br><br>So, the whole experience is fabricated, superficially looking like the real thing but with every possibility of failure removed from the equation. Burned through your investor's money to push an idea with no head and no feet? No problem, they knew there was risk involved. Go take this well paying job at your buddy's startup, gain some more experience and try again in a year or two.<br><br>And where do the return for investors come, then? Well, this is a sort of arbitrage. The Venture Capitalists of SV take advantage of the fact that old fashioned Corporations do not want to pay for their own R&amp;D anymore, so they take the few viable companies that are produced by their sausage factory, hype those to High Kingdom, and sell both the intellectual property and the engineers who created it (Acqui-hire is the term) for was much as their clueless customers are willing to pay.<br><br>For some reason, the executives of Corporations seem unable to grasp the fact that you may attempt to do something and *fail* despite doing everything right. So they'd rather pay much more money for a technology/user_base combo that already exist than what it would cost to fund the in house development of something similar. Somehow I think this has to do with the senility of our civilization's so called leadership.<br><br><a href=#c1317929807476021437 title="comment permalink">4/22/15, 10:36 PM</a><br><br>

Much of this involves the very internal and reflect view of managing expectations. I used the computer for playing games and socializing with my high school friends from around the country. However, I don't rely on my computer for anything other than some social stimulation. My wife and I have a car but we both are less than a quarter mile from where we work. I germinate and grow and herb garden and some vines out on our porch and am looking for a farmer to pay a reasonable fee too in order to start and summer garden. The far and away most important thing is i don't expect car culture, computers, and easy access to manufactured goods to last and am adjusting accordingly. Far an away the most important thing for the collapse now is preventative healthcare in the form of excellent diet and exercise. lifestyle will be the new health insurance.<br><br>People seem to think collapse now means drop everything and homestead in the country. However, I think the smarter strategy is to collapse a bit faster than the world around you, as long as you stay ahead of the curve your fine.

It's been the standard euphemism in business reporting over here in the UK for - I'd say - 20 years. Usually the term is preceded by the word 'temporary', thus reinforcing the inevitability of permanent economic expansion. I could be wrong but I think it was the BBC's craven business reporters who first coined that term.<br><br>As for growing vegetables, I'll have to admit that I'm not a big fan of doing so. I grow a few tomato plants, some potatoes and peas and maybe a few beetroots every year, but usually the slugs and rabbits and other beasties make a mockery of my efforts. <br><br>Which is why I'm instead growing an edible forest and orchard. Okay, so the lead times are probably longer, but I'm planting up so many fruit and nut trees, vines and perennials that I aim to have a surplus to trade with some of my friends and neighbours - many of whom are very much into vegetable gardening. I'm even experimenting with growing such exotics as olives, oranges, lemons and avocados as I imagine these things will fetch a premium should regular supply lines fail. <br><br>What's more, I have my first order for local charcoal this year - 100 bags of it (cooked up in an old oil drum).<br><br>Anyway, thanks for this week's post - I'm always negatively despondent to see it.<br><br><a href=#c5144666857796178668 title="comment permalink">4/23/15, 12:57 AM</a><br><br>

My knowledge of formal linguistics is shaky, but... "Growth" means "to get bigger, to expand" and that is *still what it means* regardless of whatever words you put around it. Adding an adjective means you're making a description of "growth" itself; so taken as read, "negative growth" is "growth with a negative quality", eg "the negative growth in carbon emissions/unemployment/child poverty..." To change the meaning you would have to modify the word itself (ungrowth, degrowth etc), if you were determined not to use one of the handy antonyms for "growth" already in existence, such as "contraction".<br><br>(The confusion might come from words like "correlation", but a correlation simply means there's a relationship - that's why you have to specify whether it's positive or negative.)<br><br>Therefore a) what the talking heads are actually saying is not what they're trying to say which is the thing they don't want to say (contraction) and b) they've done so by using the word "negative", which is practically taboo in politics and certainly in discussions of growth (growth is good, don't cha know?) so I fail to see how they think it's any better.<br><br>In terms of getting ahead of the curve, and as a Millennial - a few of us have recently been trying to convert the rest of our friends to knitting, with various degrees of success, though we are all put to shame by the friend who spins her own yarn (the old old way - with a spindle and distaff). Gardening is a bit tricky in university accommodation, as are woodworking and some other things I'd quite like to learn; unfortunately, the closest uni comes to teaching practical skills is lectures in PowerPoint presentations. Of course it does, because it's set up to prepare people for the world everybody is still convinced we're going to have - something I wasn't brave enough to challenge at eighteen when, being somewhat clever, it was assumed I would get a degree and subsequent "good job". The joke is, studying archaeology gives you a much better understanding of the depth and cycles of time than most people seem to have, and a couple of books about collapse and breakdown even make it onto the reading list, though nobody in the field ever seems to make the connection to our own society. So I've learned useful things over the past few years, but they're not the ones anybody was trying to teach me. I do know how to knap flint and the principles of constructing a smelting furnace, to prove that my degree is not *entirely* useless...<br><br><a href=#c2744521307779048770 title="comment permalink">4/23/15, 2:17 AM</a><br><br>

A few more facets could be added. From a thermodynamic perspective, abusing externalities is the fuel of growth - normally, not the only one. But with "genuine" life-supporting resources on decline, reliance on externalities starts to dominate. Like a stuttering old machine, the system starts to ingest the resources more hungrily and leave more waste. Intensity of externality abuse increased manifold in the last few decades, even if at first that looked like a political choice. Say, the liberal left talked a lot about externalities during the W Bush years - noticing particularly how corporations are increasingly granted freedom from externalities costs. By now it is clear that it was not a political bug but a transformational feature.<br><br><a href=#c8756232042944942910 title="comment permalink">4/23/15, 2:39 AM</a><br><br>

I've recently been mulling over ideas for my 3015 tale, and thought I was breaking some new ground, and here you are already raking it to a fine tilth ;-)<br><br>I think the main purpose of the 'negative growth' terminology is not so much squeamishness in actually naming decline or contraction, but rather to maintain control of the framing of the discussion. Even if it's termed 'negative', keeping 'growth' in the phrase serves to keep economic discussion within the 'growth is normal' frame. In a way they are trying to artificially create an 'economic arrow' in the same sense that thermodynamics creates 'time's arrow'. Even though even the attempt qualifies as organic fertiliser of bovine origin...<br><br>I must admit, I was expecting you to coin 'externality suite' as a mirror and complement to the 'technology suite' concept you floated a few posts back. It struck me as I was reading that the much vaunted term 'infrastructure' (which we must 'invest' in for the future's sake) is effectively just the sum of a technology suite and its matching externality suite (or system). By and large, I suspect that the big danger here is that failing technology suites can leave us tied to the externalities without the benefits - the worst of both worlds.<br><br>Talking of two worlds, particularly the trick that many of us here are trying to pull off, that of keeping a foot in each. What if they're not worlds, but ships? Trying to keep a foot on each of two ships can leave you in a world of hurt once the swell picks up. Gotta choose your time to leap to the lifeboat.

It would be nice though if people weren't using that term in a serious manner. It is worth remembering that 1929 which was just prior to the Great Depression was a gilded age for economists where their supposed expertise was employed as spruikers for corporations whose sole purpose was to purchase shares in other companies and thereby charge even more for their own shares in turn (the most positive explanation would be goodwill, whereas a lesser explanation would be a Ponzi scheme). The economists have failed to have such a good track record on predictions even in recent years. I wouldn't trust an economist to look after the chickens here for even one day.<br><br>Externalities, yes too true. Whoever controls the debt controls the asset. I am quite disturbed at the extent of parasitic gaming that is going on down here. It is breathtaking to behold and the false narratives that are being told are even more mind bogglingly dishonest - they don't even stand up to much observation and investigation at all.<br><br>Gardening. I hear you man. I've been at that activity for years and it is an incremental learning experience. Actually, chance situations aside, I reckon the knowledge of that experience can keep a person safe in the worst of times. I could certainly hand the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse a cold one and they'd enjoy it too! We'd be fast friends and I reckon they'd extract a cheaper level of overall costs too.<br><br>In your forthcoming discussion about the Internet, it might be worth considering what a monster some of the big name players in the internet industry actually are. They gobble up every bit of pre internet infrastructure before them down under. And it is worthwhile mentioning that they pay very little or next to no taxes down under – they don’t even charge goods and services tax on their services despite supplying them in Australia. How can the local advertising and newspaper services compete with behemoths that aren't playing on a level playing field? They operate like a giant wealth pump. Some of them have even managed to wangle the very same status as a small business despite having truly stupendous revenues, so that means that they are exempted from even the most basic reporting requirements. The problem is that they have forgotten that such parasites can eventually kill the host. I can't help but think that such activities appear to be an enforced foreign policy? There doesn't seem to be any other plausible explanation. Certainly it appears to be making people in Singapore and Switzerland quite wealthy, whilst paying dividends to shareholders in the US. It is quite ugly.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: I've got a new blog entry up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Hen's teeth</a> where I finally sourced some second hand and very durable galvanised iron sheeting for the new wood shed - but it is getting much harder to find.

Dmitry Orlov has written extensively on this (Communities That Abide).<br><br>This doesn't eliminate the need to learn hard skills, but knowing your neighbors and having trust - can you imagine living without those things? My own experience in upstate NY was that if you didn't pitch in and share, called the local constable at every opportunity ('get your dog off my lawn!'), treated tradespeople you hired horribly - when something went haywire, you were last on the list to be helped if at all. However, if you loaned tools (and returned them when you borrowed them), let people use your laundry room or garage for winter storage, invited people to share the bounty of a garden and so on, you were far more likely to get help when things got a bit rough (i.e., during a winter storm). <br><br>Some of the more 'prepper' oriented folks have also brought up things that are also long term projects - like getting in decent physical condition, and changing your diet. Quitting smoking is another, if you have that tough-to-break habit.<br><br>There's a (Turkish?) saying, "No matter how far you have gone on the wrong road, turn back." You can start by trading in the smart phone for a dumb phone; start biking when you can; getting to know your neighbors; shopping at Good Will. William Church mentioned 'learning new skills' - absolutely yes! That's the first part of my main guideline of 'Invest in yourself, invest in your community." <br><br>This all seems so obvious, but implementation is the tough one.<br><br>It is a true pleasure to read the comments here, while the Internet still works this easily.<br><br>JMG, the 'Death of the Internet' - that's going to be an interesting essay for sure.

I first planted a garden two years ago, so this is my third spring. The first year, I had some stunning successes (40 lbs. of potatoes) and some epic failures (indeterminate tomatoes that grew too far unsupported, squash plants devastated by vine borers, etc.). Last year, the potato crop wasn't so impressive and squash was so infested with borers that I harvested narry a fruit. But my tomatoes produced heavily - so much so that I ended up canning about 8 quarts for the winter. This year is bang on. Potatoes are growing like weeds and I've got 32 tomato plants in a 12' x 8' box that are blossoming and fruiting like crazy (from 40 seeds planted - a 100% germination rate, same as last year; I ended up giving away 8 plants to friends). But a whole row of watermelon failed to germinate and a row of giant cucumber melons is off to a sorry start. As I have learned, the time to learn how to grow food is before your life depends on it.<br><br>Your reference to old tools and repurposing also struck a chord with me. One of my wife's contributions to our marriage was an old Singer sewing machine from the 1800's that her great grandmother used. We've had it stuck in a corner of our bedroom gathering dust for 15 years and during a spring cleaning a couple years ago, I decided it was too unsightly and had to go. What use did we have for an ancient foot-operated sewing machine anyway? My wife insisted and we had a strong argument, but the machine stayed. Now that my eyes are open to the coming collapse, I see that machine as one of the truly useful tools we will have post-collapse. Just need to put a belt from the treadle to the machine and it's good to go. No electricity needed.<br><br>Great post as usual!<br><br><a href=#c4489275042188598820 title="comment permalink">4/23/15, 5:27 AM</a><br><br>

I agree that in that time you can become quite competent in the basics of growing food plants. But it takes longer I think to learn how to grow at scale, to manage soil fertility for the long haul, to deal with pests and disease, and to work with the supplemental systems that can make a home-grown diet interesting - chickens, rabbits, brewing, preserving the harvest so that you have some calories year-round, etc. <br><br>That said I'm not an advocate of self-sufficiency at all, and would love to see these and other sorts of home productivity skills widely spread across a productive community, with people helping each other out. But that will only happen fruitfully in places where basic skills and infrastructure are already in place. That seems to be another reason to get started with the attitudinal and preparatory changes as early as possible - more interesting possibilities will accrue for individuals and communities that have already put the foundations in place when the time comes to get serious about dealing with reality.<br><br><a href=#c2932323279804490862 title="comment permalink">4/23/15, 6:38 AM</a><br><br>

Screws of all types are manufactured in places far from North America. Nails are similarly shipped from cheap labor pools, as are bolts and nuts. Hardware will be a very intense recycling business, from where I am sitting.<br><br>I purchased two chinese-fabbed window locks for the windows we made last week. BOTH failed on the second latching - the brads were too inane and they simply fell apart. We had to re-brad them correctly to make them work. These were $3 each, and things like this are no longer made in North America. Even the 'proudly made in the USA' stamp is baloney because the parts are made elsewhere...<br><br>You will find that recycling or fixing things like door locks or any electric motor is problematic with the newer foreign made stuff - it is minimally designed, and designed for a life expectancy of only a few years. Throwaway stuff does not re-tool easily - one winds up trying to fix really bad design issues.<br><br>If you take a spin through the fastener department at Lowes or Home Depot, you will get an idea of how few common fasteners are used in assembly today - most fasteners are minimal or proprietary or troublesome to find - designed that way purposefully to force you back into the 'repair system' or just to outright purchase new instead of fixing it yourself.<br><br>Our generator actually had a set of 'dummy bolts' on the cowling that attached to nothing, and we had to purchase a set of torx sockets to disassemble the thing to repair it. In addition, it used both SAE and metric nuts and bolts, as the generator was metric and the motor was SAE - then the crazy torx cowling and carb attachments. Took 3 sets of tools to repair the (LARGE and FOUL expletive) thing.

Although regression removes some of the fantastical elements inherent in today's "advanced" technology, things as simple as sewing machines require use, knowledge, confidence, and care that an unpracticed person simply does not possess. The same applies to bikes, push mowers, wood stoves, garden tools, etc. Just because it comes from the 19th century or earlier, does not mean that you will be able to use, fix or manufacture such technology, in whole or in part, especially now that the west has externalized most of the dependency systems which supported such technologies. Also, we as a society, have allowed the visceral connection with our tools to atrophy, much like we have with our food production. As is the case with gardening that you so accurately expound upon J.M.G, expect a long, dirty, and sometimes painful learning curve if you plan to journey down the road of regression voluntarily. For me, long and dirty is much better than dead, however, so bring on the grease!<br><br><a href=#c3942508859112406047 title="comment permalink">4/23/15, 7:10 AM</a><br><br>

In the last few years I have been redirecting my long honed skills in metalworking in to bike building. I am always thinking of which items that I use in building a frame and an entire bike that I will be able to get in a collapsing future. This is an important question as the single most fragile, destructive, energy consuming and important to the current economic regime is the automobile. I beleive that the only realistic option that we will have ( beyond walking) when things really decline is bikes in many forms.<br> Fortunetly much can be done by refitting and repairing the millions of bikes that are collecting dust in suburban garages. The ones that are not up to daily use can be a source of what will become hard to get parts in the future.<br> But when this is not enough, what parts will still be availible, or can be made on a small scale when the range of technological suites availible to us is far narrower. Unfortunetly the bicycle component manufacturing base in the U.S. has been gutted and is down to a few small makers of high end components that are very high quality but expensive. I have tried to experiment with making as many parts as I can, but this is fairly limited. but possible for things like hubs or crank arms. Making bikes from salvaged materials is also possible, and the best work being done in this realm is in the "freak bike" community. "freak bikes" are bicycle oddities such as tall bikes, bizzare tandems, and low riders. Luckily the ethos in the this community is to be respected you must build your own "ride". This has led to a great number of freak bikes being built from plumbing, conduit, and joined with primative welding. Not pretty but passable when transportation becomes more important than style. The two things that I think may be too technically complex to make from scratch or scrap in the future will be gearing systems ( buy and store a nice three speed hub for your future bike JMG) and tires/tubes. Bike tires and tubes are also no longer made in the U.S. and are absolutely critical to a functioning bike. They also require a moderately advanced technological suite. So anyone who has a bent toward collecting usefull items that will have great value in the future you can't go wrong with bicycle tires and tubes.<br><br><a href=#c7643266454209929157 title="comment permalink">4/23/15, 9:35 AM</a><br><br>

I guess I am feeling negative this morning from a little too much wine last night, but the 'News' these days doesn't provide much hope for positive change any time soon. <br><br>Unless you already have a solid foundation of skills, land, and preps in place I would think it would be best to face the future being aware that big changes seem inevitable, and not just launch off. Perhaps it would be enough to get rid of debt, move to decent neighbourhood, and embrace living differently. By differently I mean walking, using the library, cooking at home, and enjoying friends. It is never too late to get in shape and relish being fit.<br><br>My wife and I have been doing the homestead lifestyle for quite awhile now, and it is a lot of work. I turn 60 this year and have discovered aches and pains I never dreamed existed. Instead of being able to bang in a solid 10 hour day I am finding 6 hours of physical work is about as much as I want to do.<br><br>Anyway, the greenhouses are planted, most of the garden is in, firewood is in the sheds, and a new crop of broilers are all of two days old and under a heat lamp. Yesterday, I planted 1/4 acre of potatoes with Russian fingerlings left to plant. The list is so much longer than this because along the way I have built a house and renovated another, plus plus plus. We quit our jobs 1.5 years ago so this was all done while we were working full time. <br><br>The last ten years I have been dealing with my mom failing slowly from Alzheimers. Luckily, we live in Canada where health problems don't wipe out families financially. However, my mother-in-law is now in the dementia line up, and lately a few neighbours have developed cancer. I am also a cancer survivor. This list sounds terrible, but actually it has been very positive for us. First of all, we have been able to deal with these challenges and are stronger for it. In addition, we realize and accept just how fleeting and precious our lives and health has been, and now try and enjoy each task and day to the best of our ability. I hope this points back to my first point about it maybe being too late to simply chuck in BAU and launch off expecting imminent collapse. It is important, while embracing deliberate changes in lifestyle and attitude, to also appreciate what we have right now. (I don't even take a hot shower for granted).

I love how you boiled this big problem down into such a digestible phrase. I have tried to become less dependent on the industrial system and the extent to which many people will find themselves high and dry when it falls apart fills me with some sadness. I'm not there totally myself, but I keep taking steps.<br><br>I can't find anywhere to repair my broken stereo speaker, so I will buy a new one. But when we buy a home and I have space for a workroom I would certainly build my own. If I do it well enough perhaps I could turn it into a small business. As a musician have thought of making acoustic instruments. As a librarian I would also like to get into printing when I have the time and space. For now I still have one foot in each world. But, one thing at a time.<br><br>I have already loaded my plate up with the stay-at-home dad blog and more small household projects. I plan to have the first blog out in about 2 weeks. I actually copied part of the comment guidelines from this blog and hope that is ok. <br><br>As for gardening, I have had some similar experience. I kept a garden for 3 years in long island, this is my second year doing it in the hudson valley. There was a gap in time where I lived in Brooklyn. We will probably move in a year and while it won't be a change in region, I will have to build the soil up again even if I can transfer some from my current garden and compost piles.<br><br>Back to dependency, it does seem that many people still see the problem as down the road. My family and friends in southern California certainly feel this way. I read Cherokee's thoughts on living in dry climates with great interest a few weeks ago. With all do respect to the folk I know in SoCal, I think many there are too dependent on the industrial system to take a lot of the steps he mentioned.

There may be less to go around in a world of negative growth, but big corporations are dependent on such stupidly complex supply chains and, as you note, externalities that they will likely collapse before I do. (Side note, spell check doesn't recognize the word "externalities".) What I see coming after the next wave of collapse is a thriving greyish-black market for essential goods produced by real people for their neighbors, family and friends.

Growing more exotic crops is risky in Britain. Carol Deppe’s sound advice is to focus on what grows best in your area first. I’m getting rid of our Limonella (small lemon) tree which has produced a few fruits but has failed to thrive in the conservatory or outdoors. If it takes 5 years to achieve some success with vegetables, it takes longer with trees. I’ve tried about 10 varieties of cultivated hazel and there are only 2 I would confidently recommend for growing in Herefordshire (Webb’s Prize Cob and Cosford Cob). If you read “requires careful cultivation” in a catalogue (e.g. Cox’s Orange Pippin in the case of apples), don’t risk it unless you have plenty of land.<br>On charcoal making (which Jason also mentioned) I’m very impressed by this rocket stove charcoal maker, which seems far less polluting than the traditional method. <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txSD9i0R1Hs<br><br><br><a href=#c2449635352424147926 title="comment permalink">4/23/15, 12:50 PM</a><br><br>

Gaining competency in these core tasks requires enormous amounts of time, ultimately approaching the point at which no time exists for making a living in the current economy. If you can coordinate new skills with others (i.e. friend/neighbor x learns leather tanning while neighbor y learns shoe making, and neighbor z picks up fiber processing) you'll be much further ahead.

I have thre points to make. First of all, the basis of your post was predated by about a decade by a computer game, railroad tycoon. It strongly featured a capitalist element to its gameplay, but it always took the standard maxims with a pinch of salt. "Economists proclaim perpetual growth" and "economists proclaim period of negative expansion " being an obvious parody. What you've seen is nothing new,. <br><br>Secondly, can I point you in the direction of two texts? The first and most readily available is called "The World Without Us". It's forward points to an Amazonian family, thousands of men les from any big city, who's lives have been transformed by the automobile's need for rubber. The second is called "Red Rubber" and comes from almost a century earlier. The demand for bicycles, and therefore for rubber created the conditions for atrocities in what was then known as The Belgian Congo. The result of a billion people going from cars to bikes might be an improvement, but it might not be all that pretty. The story of Edmund Morel might be both new to you, and informative.<br><br>Thirdly, teaching is a skill in itself. If you know how to teach, then with some training, you can teach anything. As a teacher of a skill that will become of diminishing importance in the years to come, I am looking out for pathways into the future. Currently, none spring out, but I am teaching myself (and making expensive mistakes) how to make backgammon boards. By working this out, in a precise and organised way, I can pass it on. Perhaps someone will teach me something in return.<br><br><a href=#c2488928914324973307 title="comment permalink">4/23/15, 6:03 PM</a><br><br>

Ideally, it would be something that one can be uniquely qualified for, to provide a product or service that won't soon be undercut by someone else's effort. That could mean something that takes a lot of skill (such as, say, portrait painting), or something that also takes a substantial capital investment (such as mechanical sock-knitting machine, or electronic test equipment for radio development/repair). Some trades can be learned in the household (like knitting), but others require some level of industrial work-space (blacksmithing). Ideally, you'd accumulate archaic "capital equipment" at salvage/junk prices, learn to use it while restoring it, and make it pay off when archaic technology becomes appropriate technology.<br><br>Capital equipment which requires little skill to operate might be attractive as a target of thieves.<br> <br>But we don't know whether conditions needed to revive old technology will be upon us within the lifetimes of any of us here, so it may turn out that we are simply preserving, rather than reviving, archaic ways. There's nothing wrong with equipping future generations for a slightly easier time in a much harsher world.<br><br>One fantasy occupation: keeper of a private non-circulating library, perhaps focused on DIY topics. Charge admission to the reading room, and charge more for the pen, ink, and paper for taking notes! Accumulate the books now.<br> <br>Another fantasy occupation: transcriber of radio-broadcast news for the locally-produced newspaper.

It's an enormous service to us readers and I have personally benefited in so many ways from this knowledge. Story time: last night, the theoretical physicist Michio Kaku came to my university to give a speech called "The Future of the Mind". I was intrigued by the premise of the speech, which was supposed to dispel naive notions of what the future should contain (according to pop culture and advertising). <br><br>Maybe I should have seen this coming, then: He arrived and proceeded to spend an hour enthusiastically talking up digitization as the way forward for the human mind. Yes! Instead of scaling back on our dependence on gadgetry, he argued that in the decades to come, we should all look forward to such things as driverless cars, electronic/smart paper, interactive wallpapers with smart functions e.g. e-doctors and lawyers. The audience around me was clearly enraptured by this gushing of techno-utopianism - they seemed really eager to bury themselves under even more abstractions and gadgets. <br><br>Then he finally got around to talking about the "future of the mind." What he actually meant by that was, you guessed it, more digital abstraction. He spoke magniloquently of photographing dreams, implanting memories (so one could fondly remember the vacation they've never taken), unlocking the secrets of our unconscious. And memorization would be a thing of the past, as inventions like Google Glass or smart contact lenses feed us constant streams of information about reality. How do they not realize the cognitive loss this would imply? <br><br>A year ago, I would have been as enthusiastic as the rest of the people in the audience about this vision of progress. I like to think I know better now, I'm 23, and it's a good time as any to have gotten off the ride. I'm steadily weaning myself off the mindset of convenience I've been taking for granted.

That income will be replaced -- with a raise -- by early social security this fall, freeing me up to work on the farm and start seriously learning new skills. Just in time, a hospital tech had to stop working in the lab (glove sensitivities) and has been consigned to paperwork until her doctor ok's her return, helping to ensure that I get enough work there to get me through the summer. "Your profit is by definition someone else’s loss," or in this case, 2 tandem games of musical chairs and just as I gave up one chair, another one freed up "over there." I even scored a week's vacation from the p/t job, and was freed of the exit interview, when they called and told me not to come back this week. (It helps to have legitimate, provable complaints against management, yet to tough it out and give 2 week's notice. Apparently one or two managers in particular decided it would be prudent to be generous!)<br><br>So this week has been spent recuperating, reading, thinking, working hard at restoring my severely damaged pasture, and ground training for the horse's in the barn aisle, with a focus on desensitization.

That's within reach in five years for most people, given the necessary investment of work and study. <br><br>Kathleen, you're welcome! One of the nastier features of contemporary popular culture is that it insists that everyone ought to be an instant expert. That's one of the many ways our society uses shame to enforce conformity. To get past that, and remember that anything worth doing requires time and sweat to learn, is a potent source of freedom. <br><br>Tony, "externality suite" is good -- I'd likely have used it if I thought of it. <br><br>Cherokee, that's interesting to hear about the internet companies. Most of them get tax breaks here, too -- which is of course just another form of government subsidy. I'll have to look at the profitability of the big internet firms, and see how likely they'd be to make money if they had to compete on a level playing field.<br><br>Denys, while I don't think it was just a matter of talk shows, laws and social customs encouraging divorce will have been attractive to the marketing industry for the same reason that breaking up extended families was -- the more households, the more consumption.<br><br>Peakfuture, true enough -- and implementation is always the hard part. I'm not sure if "talk is cheap" is a Turkish proverb, but it's a useful one. <br><br>Lawfish, exactly -- you now know quite a bit more about gardening than you did, and the most important thing you know is how much more you've got to learn.

Any suggestions where to start?"<br><br>Ha, ha, as a city-bound apartment dweller, I suppose I could very well ask you why don't you make and mend clothes yourself? But since moving to the country and embarking on a homesteading lifestyle, I have come to realize that women's work is really a blessing, most often quite preferable to men's work. The stuff I do that tires me out is negligible compared to what my husband does. Maybe what happened with all the women's lib angst of the past few decades had to do with a reaction to the lack of respect and power over their lives (not letting women vote!) but then got confused into rejecting all the traditional roles. In a nondindustrial life, women can hardly survive without men's strength. Before we moved here, I used to eat out all the time because we had such great places available. My husband stayed home and cooked pork chops. Before we moved here, we came up to work on the place on a monthly basis for a few years. There are no restaurants worth eating at for at least 25 miles, more like 50. I noticed that we fell into traditional roles real quick. Yes, he could cook, and clean the kitchen, but I found that what he was doing, building a shed, digging trenches, felling trees, shaving them of bark and making them into posts, mixing and pouring cement, lifting heavy bricks, MINING for rocks - you get the picture - all things that I very much wanted done, made me all too glad to provide him with hearty meals and free up as much of his time as I could. <br><br>In fact, there is so much heavy work to be done on a homestead, that I have come to the conclusion that polyandry might be a very practical lifestyle.<br><br><a href=#c5842634948050099573 title="comment permalink">4/23/15, 9:18 PM</a><br><br>

First, very few of them can imagine doing so -- the idea that the economy is a tool that can be changed or replaced, rather than just the way things are, is very hard for most people to grasp. Second, of course, the entire structure of governmental and economic power depends on people doing what they're told, and legal and extralegal force gets deployed against those who are too obviously not doing what they're told. <br><br>Fudoshin, excellent.

It raises several issues I’ve been mulling over lately. Not only does it take a few years to learn how to grow veg, but the seeds you can buy from the garden centre aren’t necessarily the ones you need to provide “serious food”. I’m still building up my stock of “peasant” seed.<br>In Britain vegetables are mostly considered to be an optional addition to a meat meal. If you want to provide the bulk of your food from vegetables you need to grow peas and beans. However most people grow peas as a sweet addition to the meat meal, but the peas themselves don’t have much food value, nor can they be kept through the winter without a freezer. For food value it’s better to grow a more starchy pea like a marrowfat. These are grown on a farm scale, but the seed is not generally sold at garden centres. Fortunately the dried peas sold in supermarkets are cheap and are easily grown, usually as self supporting dwarf pea plants. However if you wish to grow a greater quantity per unit area it’s hard to find a tall marrowfat pea or other good drying pea. Dan Jason of Salt Spring Seeds has found that some tall snap and mangetout peas make good drying peas. I have obtained Latvian peas from the (British) Garden Organic Heritage Seed Library. These grow tall and produce prolific crops of starchy peas good for “mushy peas”.<br>I have obtained beans from the HSL which grow well for me too. Beans intended to be grown as French or snap beans are the ones you can buy from garden centres, but it’s the mature (shell or dry) beans you need for food value. Borlotti beans can be bought from garden centres but I have found that they don’t always mature in time in Herefordshire. I’ve had much better results with a heritage borlotti bean “Gramma Walters”. Beans from central and Eastern Europe work very well for me, and I now grow ones from Romania, Georgia, and Ukraine; all countries where people relied on beans as a main source of food. One of the hardiest and most productive is from the Cherokee, the”Cherokee Trail of Tears”.<br>I’ll also repeat the recommendation of other people after previous posts to read Carol Deppe in “The Resilient Gardener”. She describes in great detail how to save potatoes for seed year after year avoiding their serious disease problems. <br>Of course it's far cheaper to buy dried beans or peas, but the home grown ones taste far better.<br><br><a href=#c4950097681022476801 title="comment permalink">4/23/15, 11:35 PM</a><br><br>

One city council planned to install LED street lighting that would cut the city's power bill, but was told the lines company would increase their charges to compensate for the loss of income. Power consumption here has levelled off in the last few years, and an aluminium smelter that currently uses 15% of the country's power is likely to shut down in the next decade. It makes me wonder what unforeseen consequences we might see when a significant amount of people take steps to reduce their dependency on the various systems discussed in this blog. The point was made that as more consumers switch to solar, it may push up the bills for those who don't as the power companies try to recoup the costs of expensive infrastructure. The lesson might be to collapse early, as the longer you are stuck in the system, the more it will cost you.<br><br><a href=#c9113411006253034979 title="comment permalink">4/24/15, 12:28 AM</a><br><br>

I do large sewing projects such as tents where pretty or neat is not so much of an issue as with clothes.<br>Meanwhile, my wife has tapped into all kinds of discarded clothes streams. One recycling organization has even given her group a once a month dumpster diving pass where members go to the recycling center and rummage through discarded items and bring home anything they want. I don't usually sew when the group meets but will sometimes cook for the gang. But I do observe and see what my wife does and pick up some ideas related to the manufacture of clothes, alteration techniques, fitting, etc. We also have a garage full of clothes and fabric that form the starting point of many of the sewing projects. Most recently my wife made two rugs from upholstery samples. My contribution was to consult on the design. <br>My wife also hosted a class recently on traditional Japanese clothes mending techniques which she used on an old dress while we were camping. She sat and mended while I read to her in the shade of a creosote bush out in the Mojave desert. Quite a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. <br>My wife has also taken up haircutting and mustache trimming and works on me whenever she deems it necessary. <br>And on it goes. We do not need to be experts to start on something, but we can become competent in the process of doing it.<br><br><a href=#c355403878304526447 title="comment permalink">4/24/15, 7:53 AM</a><br><br>

The bike items I would save would be; chains, tubes, tires, spokes, brake pads, cables,freewheels, and various rear sprockets. The problem with other things like front cranks etc is that they are specialized and don't intermix well, unless you plan to have spares for a specific bike.<br><br>@jmg, The answer to operating a bike without shiftable gears as found with a derailer or internal geared hub can be found by looking in to the past just as you recommned with other technologies. In the old days bikes were frequently build with several sprockets on the rear wheel and crank so that the rider would just get off and move the chain from one gear ratio to a different one when entering or leaving a hilly area. It is a modern extravagance to be able to constantly change gears for every tiny change in grade. Such a setup can be easily cobbled together by a competent bike mechanic out of salvaged parts also.<br><br><a href=#c5661915464595479687 title="comment permalink">4/24/15, 8:45 AM</a><br><br>

I first came across the term 'negative growth' 30 years ago (!) in economics class; the same class where I noted that our current economic theories &amp; policies have no way of dealing with the fact that our planet is finite and therefore, ultimately, limited, to which the official answer was -- is -- 'yes, but that [problem] is a long way off'. If Growth is the only doctrine by which a functioning economy can be imagined, then everything must be seen and described in terms of growth. Seems I intuitively understood Edward Abbey &amp; Wendell Barry before I ever heard of them.<br><br>I must thank you for making me feel much better about collapse and what it entails. Somehow, I had to shake off the miserable memory of existing in abject poverty in the midst of plenty, a very, very depression-inducing situation, indeed. I'll be as independent of external systems as possible, but that still leaves me very dependent. But less than most, I'll wager.<br><br>Collapse, according to you, involves using less energy &amp; resources, as little as possible right now. Thus, I have reduced the energy footprint of my paid-off house by 65% since I moved in. There is yet still lots of insulating work to do and I am still dependent on the natural gas system for heating and must be for the forseeable future.<br><br>I bake my own bread (mostly because I'm cheap - a 10Kg bag costs the same as 4 commercial loaves); it's ridiculously easy and because it tastes so much better (even though sourdough starter smells like turpentine &amp; looks like toxic waste). <br>Still, I'm dependent on the systems that bring that bag of flour to me and the electricity for the oven. The same goes for homemade beer &amp; wine.<br><br>I learned how to forge metal, make castings, weld, &amp; use a lathe. (not expert, but well enough.) Right now, it's purely for fun, because it's far, far cheaper to just buy screws &amp;c from the hardware store. Even so, I'm dependent on propane and welding gasses and electricity for the grinders, not being able to make charcoal &amp;c. in the city.<br><br>I produce some nice pieces of leatherwork, know how to make saddles (western ones) and will eventually figure out how to make harness leather, boots, &amp; other specialty items. Even so, I'm dependent on the leather wholesaler for the materials, threads, and other fixings.<br><br>After 10 years, I can be quite confidently certain that, as a gardiner, I am an utter failure, having produced in toto something less than a basket of tomatoes and a few salad greens. However... it seems I do have a talent for producing superior compost from yard &amp; kitchen waste and with help from my horse. (Yeah, go ahead... insert 'full-of...' joke here). Though this, I contribute to my friends luscious vegetable gardens, who, in turn, invite me over for dinners. But I'll keep trying. Maybe I'll get it right someday.<br>...<br><br><a href=#c4907259914359282654 title="comment permalink">4/24/15, 11:58 AM</a><br><br>

Quite well. I know how to train them, how to work with them, and how to own them. Not enough to work professionally, mind, but better than most. Maybe I can use that, someday, when the economic landscape changes. I'm looking forward to the day when there are no more motor vehicles roaring along the roads, but until then, I'm still dependent on my truck for all things horse. I'm dependent on the farrier, the vet, and whoever grows the hay for the barn. (I do ride my bicycle around the city rather than drive, whenver possible.) But... I need my city job to pay for my country hobbies, because they aren't economical, at least not yet, even though I no longer work overtime shifts, ever. (I do find notions of working only as much as needed, i.e. cost of owning car discussion, previously, to be utterly laughable. Whoever got hired to work only as many hours as the employee needed? One contracts to the employers needs and employers need regular, predictable service, even in pre-industrial, pre-monetized economies.)<br><br>I don't know how far this constitutes 'collapse', as I still feel a bit as if I'm trapped on the tracks with a train coming, surrounded and held in place by a crowd of oblivious people, especially when I consider what might happen to the supply chains on which I depend, but as I've fared much better during the past two economic crashes than most around me, I'm thinking maybe my future isn't as dark as it might be. Your writings seem to confirm that I'm on the right track.

Some people to whom bikes might be useful see cycling as either a recreational activity indulged in by rich folks or an undesirable mode of transportation necessitated by extreme poverty. So they avoid biking since they don't want to be associated with either social category, particularly the latter. Meanwhile, said affluent people often wouldn't consider biking for transit, thus embodying the stereotype.

I'm willing to reconsider that, of course.<br><br>Squizzler, hmm. I'll look into it. <br><br>George, got it in one. The US academic industry is a machine for turning young people into lifelong debt slaves with the active connivance of the banks and the federal government. Learning? Talk to a professor sometime about how much the administration cares about that. <br><br>Brian, I thought some of those points sounded a bit familiar! ;-)<br><br>Thomas, true enough -- but I hope you're planting trees anyway, for your descendants if not for yourself. <br><br>Sean, I grew up with a clear sense of what was happening to the natural world -- that was tolerably common in the 1960s and 1970s; the one thing that differentiated me from much of my generation is that I didn't drink the koolaid when Reagan took office. So it's a familiar thing, and I learned long ago that meaningful action is the one reliable cure for despair. <br><br>Patricia, excellent! You get tonight's gold star for noticing that. I actually used 1930s customs rather than 1940s, to get the sense of pervasive economic depression, but other than that, spot on.<br><br><a href=#c8482661660133114883 title="comment permalink">4/24/15, 6:17 PM</a><br><br>

What will be going out of existence is integrated circuits. That said, you're right that most of the technologies you've named will go the way of the brontosaur once integrated circuits price themselves out of availability. For what it's worth, my guess is that the first drop will be to something like 1950s technology, with the jolt downward to the 1920s further down the road. More on this soon!<br><br>Wizzard, that's certainly a strategy, though a lot depends on how much land you have. Those of us (such as myself) with urban backyard gardens generally need to pursue more intensive approaches. <br><br>Tina, I bet -- and a lot of negative knowledge being circulated, I'm sure!<br><br>Lew, I saw that. It sounds like a good idea to me, though I'd encourage those who want to imitate the action to avoid the legal penalty by using a long-handled sledgehammer instead. Back when I was involved in the Society for the Eradication of Television, that, a good set of gloves, and the sort of transparent face shield that kids in high school metal shop used to wear, were the standard tools, and there's something profoundly soul-satisfying in applying your own muscles to the task of reducing a TV (or, equally, a computer) to mangled fragments.

Yay! <br><br>Now, see, Just from the sound of it, I would have thought "negative progress" would be what the mainstream is rolling blindly on with - like those K-cup coffee makers -more expensive, less coffee, less taste, tiny cups, more trash, no control over your precious cuppa! - newer &amp; shinier but worse. Whereas "positive regression" sounds to me like Green-Wizardry: less bells and whistles to go wrong, more control, easier access, less expensive, total control for your specific personal likes. As an extra plus: far less externalities dumped onto other people and coffee grounds to make makeup with or put into your compost. Win win!<br><br>On the dark side of my own 'positive regression': I think I've just killed my pineapple tree.The food thing not going well this week. It wasn't growing straight, then another shoot came up from the roots and the tiny pineapple just stopped growing. I thought it needed to be replanted to a bigger pot, but when I tried it just broke off like a dead twig. UGH!!! I've always had a brown thumb and I'm not sure this apt.-terrace-potted-plant gardening is working out for me. I'll need to seek out local help, unless someone here has any advice on tropical plantings. (?) <br><br>On the urination thing: Human waste / night-soil has a LONG established history here in Asia. Apparently solid waste/feces is far better as fertilizer than urine though. Wars were fought in Ancient Edo, (Tokyo) over the price and control of human night-soil. Edo in the 1600's had a sustainable population of over 1 million people and this practice was instrumental in keeping the crops from the countryside coming in, as well as keeping the city sanitary and habitable, (so now we know why Japan has developed the rep. for being so pristinely clean). There are a number of articles, (use the google now while it lasts!) about the history as well as current practices in rural China. Too many for me to choose one to link, (&amp; I think I've just been 'Great-Firewalled', a lot of stuff is not coming through or coming through only in Chinese).<br><br>I'm really lucky collapsing here in China, there's a huge swath of the population that got left behind/never caught up with 'modern convenience' and still know loads of how-to's of LESS living and reusing/recycling EVERYTHING, both rural and urban. They're teaching me tones and I don't feel like a freak following their leads, (although I know I look like one to my fellow expats - the biggest hurdle to overcome is to not care!). <br> I won't ever be able to totally feed myself from my tiny terrace garden, just the occasional treat of a homegrown tomato, sour baby orange, pomelo, hopefully eventually another pineapple, but not enough to rely on for sustenance. The only thing we've grown and can rely on is Aloe Vera for mozzies, cuts and burns &amp; shampoo. <br><br>In this rambling: I would venture to my fellow urbanites: No, we probably won't be able to grow all of our own food in our bathtubs or on balconies - But that's OK. We can still make it. Urbanites have never done this and yet they have survived. JGM, I know you have said this in past posts, &amp; I get that, that we will/are developing tradable skills and products to buy or barter for foods. I'm looking into making soaps and cleaning products from easier to find and less toxic sources, (Aloe? haha). Whatever it is - I agree - we can learn best by looking to history and how people in our situation in previous cultures did it. Look to the folks in our own communities who are already at the bottom of the economic food chain and learn how they do certain things. &amp; yes, look to other cultures, especially if you're in the USA, as Americans, HAVE indeed been hood-winked out of a genuine DIY mentality. <br><br><br><a href=#c4225991576946415163 title="comment permalink">4/24/15, 8:26 PM</a><br><br>

We need to sit down over a glass of wine and chat! Or barring that due to geographical barrier I'd welcome a virtual connection (while it lasts): If you are on Facebook, can you 'friend' me? Caryn Banker. There are a number of sewing. quilting and crafting groups that share tips, info and ideas. I've also been sewing since I can remember, on a machine since I was about 6 and formally educated in clothing and textiles. BC, (before children),I was a professional costume designer for theatre and film, then fashion designer… In short: I've spent many years of my working life paying the rent as a seamstress, tailor, draper, dyer, &amp; costume craftsperson. There's always great info and tips to share. I'd love to hear from you if you are amenable. <br><br>Lastly - (apologies in advance) sticking my nose in to the bicycle discussion - I don't know, guys. I'm dubious: I've visited a rubber plantation in Thailand and from what we saw and were told: one tree can produce about 1 rubber-band's worth of rubber in a few weeks. The gruesome history of the Congo, (and Malaysia and Burma/Myanmar as well) doesn't surprise me in the least as it's a highly useful/desirable product but fairly labour intensive and it would take a whole forest to make 2 bicycle tires, let alone 4 auto tires. They're made from petroleum products nowadays aren't they? I don't know how they could be produced in any quantities post petroleum.

It's a silly thing; probably other similar-sized items would work as well. It's maybe 5-6 inches in diameter, and maybe three feet long or a little less; long enough and wide enough to support your whole spine -- but Not your shoulders. You lie down on it, feet flat on floor, with the shoulders falling off each side, and arms on the floor. Relaxes the tendons in the shoulder and all down the arms. A physical therapist sold mine to me a few years ago for rotator cuff problems, but it also does wonders for my carpal tunnel syndrome.<br><br> 2. Herb tea. Specifically lemon balm and oat straw, for anxiety. My favorite combination is lemon balm with dried raspberries and ginger, with oat straw added when the lemon balm isn't enough to do the trick. Lemon balm grows like a weed around here, so it's easy to dry a lot for winter. You can dry it by tying the stems together and hanging it upside down somewhere, like the kitchen. If there are some type of flavorful, soft berries available growing wild in your climate -- blackberries are invasive in mine -- or you can grow or trade for raspberries, perhaps you could gather and dry them? Maybe a dehydrator could be found on freecycle, or second-hand.<br>As for self-support, might you be able to grow and sell fresh herbs, or dried herb teas, or herb/vegetable starts, or some such thing not overly labor intensive? I doubt it would make a full living, but it might help eke things out. I recently read a little book titled "Profits from your backyard herb garden," and was considering whether I might be able to use some of the suggestions in it; perhaps it would also be useful to you.<br><br><a href=#c7679271826789258145 title="comment permalink">4/24/15, 9:43 PM</a><br><br>

We're paying for all these apparently free Internet services which we all enjoy, but it is not paying for them as we know it. :-)!<br><br>What was with the actor William Shatner apparently not attending the funeral of his fellow actor Leonard Nimoy anyway? I watched an interview with the two captains of the Starship Enterprise which was hosted with Whoopi Goldberg - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9G5ciMqFNM" rel=nofollow>Star Trek Captains Summit</a> - and it appeared that the actor William Shatner, from my inexperienced perspective, struggled reading basic social cues and Leonard Nimoy understood that lack and helped him along as best as he could.

It has always meant something that is combustible. The confusion has arisen very recently in response to efforts to avoid confusion.<br><br>The two words 'inflammable' and 'flammable' have slightly different etymologies, and slightly different meanings as commonly used now and in the past. Both words come originally from the Latin 'flammo' (present transitive case) meaning 'I burn', I set on fire', 'I excite'. However the prefix in- was not the 'in-' meaning not or indicating negative (eg inattention, invariable etc) but came from the prefix en- meaning “to cause (a person or thing) to be in” the place, condition, or state named by the stem" (e.g. as in such words as enshrine, encourage, enliven). In this case the en- quickly turned into in- to give 'in-flame' and 'in-flammable' etc. It was not only applied to combustion but also to human passions (to arouse anger etc). We also get the word 'inflammation' from it.<br><br>On the other hand, the word 'flammable' is a much more recent invention, first being used around the early 19th century. It seems to have been used exclusively to refer to combustion. It never entered common usage and was considered dead soon after. However much more recently it was decided that the word 'inflammable' to denote highly combustible fuels, could be confusing, particularly for those with poor English language skills. As a result the word has been reinvented and is normally used only to indicate combustible fuels.<br><br>Unfortunately the reason for its resurrection seems to have been self-fulfilling with many assuming that since 'flammable' means combustible then 'inflammable' should mean the opposite, without learning its true meaning. It might not cause confusion when on the back of a fuel tanker but it certainly has resulted in confusion in many other situations.<br><br>An interesting note is that the French word for non-combustible is 'ininflammable'.<br><br>Andrew<br><br><a href=#c2046691877278993718 title="comment permalink">4/25/15, 6:42 AM</a><br><br>

Many of the intelligentsia are also prone to take offense if you suggest they do some menial task - even though these often help kicking up useful ideas. <br>Very high end composite work (think fighter jets and rockets) are extremely closely related to precise textile work and baking complicated layer-cakes.

I’ll tie them both to Ham Radio and older ways of doing things. <br><br>I’m a Volunteer Examiner (VE) for Ham Radio licenses, at our test session this last weekend there was a man in his late 20’s who came to take the Technician license test. He said that he had a reading disability and it would probably take him longer and asked if we could accommodate him. He’d been studying very hard and wanted to take the test. We offered to help him and it was clear that he probably didn’t read or write at more than a 3rd or 4th grade level. He took about twice as long as the other applicants but he ended up passing with a quite respectable score. After the session, I talked with him for a while and he said that he’d discovered Ham Radio while looking for ways to learn basic electronics and felt that this was a good way to get a decent education without spending major money on a college education. He was VERY motivated, and it was obvious that he didn’t have a lot of money. I’m sure that this is going to help his reading ability also!<br><br>For anybody who wants to learn about basic electricity and electronics, studying for and getting a Ham license is a very good path to take. It’s not just valuable for communications!<br><br>I’ve been putting together a large library of How-To books covering a large variety of subjects covering gardening and growing food, water conservation and rainwater collection, diy solar heating, cooking and PV, house and shed construction, etc. Of course I also have many, many older books on electricity, electronics and radio. I especially value the books that tell how to do things in earlier times.<br><br>I find that using modern electronic and radio test equipment with microprocessors that do everything for you often prevent you from getting a real understanding of what you’re working with. I really like using older basic test instruments such as analog voltmeters, simple oscilloscopes, basic signal generators. Then there are the classic lab instruments for measuring components; the Wheatstone Bridge for resistors and the fancier LCR bridges for capacitors and inductors. Here’s a <a href=http://www.greenwizardsradio.org/Images/LCR%20Bridges.jpg rel=nofollow>picture</a> of three old LCR bridges I have, made by General Radio and Heathkit. The older GR Bridge on the left was made from 1933 through 1959, the Heathkit one in the middle was a clone of the GR. The GR Bridge on the right was introduced in 1960. All use the same basic circuit. All will measure components to about 1%, in fact the standards in all of these are still good and they still meet factory specifications.<br><br>I suspect these will still be good 100 years from now. Can you say that about your fancy meter of today? When using one of these you end up understanding what you are measuring. If you get an old <a href=http://www.greenwizardsradio.org/Images/Shallcross.jpg rel=nofollow>Shallcross Wheatstone Bridge</a> like I plan on doing, you can measure resistors to 4 significant figures, that’s between 0.1% and 0.01%. Often these are available in good shape for around $50.<br><br>Oh, and all of this stuff is easily repairable too.<br><br>I’m hoping that anybody in the Pacific Northwest of the US who is interested in learning about Radio or Electronics will contact me, I’ll be happy to help you get whatever learning material or equipment you might need. There’s a lot out there for cheap if you know where to look. Salvage is GOOD! I’m going to write a post on this on the Green Wizards forum.<br><br><a href=#c7017997681437351570 title="comment permalink">4/25/15, 10:59 AM</a><br><br>

Is this your way of telling us JMG that you're taking next week off ;). If so, enjoy your vacation...<br><br>In mulling over your posts the past few weeks, I keep coming back to how very much tied into the whole system the concept of externalities really is, often in ways that were not considered initially. Whether you are trying to shove something off on others or you are trying to do the opposite.<br> <br>A simple example is recycling clothing. Personally I have been doing this for decades, and it sounds like quite a few other posters here are doing it as well. I think it is a great idea: reduces waste, puts a greater life into already spent resources, reduces out of pocket costs, and more. One of the great win-wins that those of us living at the edge of Western civilization can make use of. But if we were to take the broader systems view, we would see several ways this activity is dependent upon the very system and wastes that we recyclers are attempting to avoid, and how it may have other effects as well.<br> <br>It is only because we live among a very affluent people, who have way more clothing than they need and keep buying more, that there is a steady stream of functional used clothing for us to scavenge. Also, as those who have been doing this a while have likely noticed, the quality level of used clothing has been going down for years; finding a high quality Pendleton shirt on the used racks is a rarity now a days.<br><br>Like it or not, this activity is tied in many ways to mainstream society. If the mainstream starts accepting cheap, shoddy clothing, well that's what we will have to choose from. If they suddenly were to stop their addiction to buying even more clothes, our supply of used apparel dries up. <br><br>Please don't take this the wrong way, recycling clothing is great. For now, it represents a good way of extending the use of resources and many other worthy things. At the same time, it only is an option as long as the majority of society is being wasteful and gluttonous about clothing. Perhaps when that ends, there will be more incentive for more of us to learn spinning, weaving, tailoring and the other crafts that go into making our own clothing. Until then, it keeps many of us from spending the extra time to learn and practice these skills. <br><br>So there is co-dependence at several levels back to the society at large. And perhaps an unexpected tie, in that the supply of cheap used clothes keeps many from learning skills that would make them more independent in obtaining their clothing.<br><br>It is very much the same for the other side of externalities as well (however the large corporations and gov'ts do have an advantage in that they can play on and profit from the arbitrage, in the short term at least). We all are tied into "the system," often in ways and with consequences we may not fully appreciate.<br><br>Perhaps it is just another example of "it's hard to see water if you're a fish."<br><br><br><br><a href=#c3941740179368501944 title="comment permalink">4/25/15, 3:13 PM</a><br><br>

Tucked into the "fine print" was the comment "May result in negative equity".<br><br>Doing some investigation I found this can means two things, first we all know that cars lose value as soon as you drive off the lot. That is a $30K car becomes a $25K car as soon as it is sold.<br><br>Also, the way they set up the payment schedule on loans now, you front pay your interest. Your first month's payment may be 90% interest and 10% equity, your last month's reversed, 10% interest and 90% equity.<br><br>Most home loans are the same, the lender wants to be able to recoup their "vig" as soon as possible.<br><br>So while you may have been paying 2-3 years on that loan, the car is still worth less that what you owe. If you use it as a trade-in, the dealer rolls that difference into your new loan.<br><br>I've also heard that some car loans are now done for more money that the car is worth. A $30K car gets a loan to repay back $35K.<br><br>What this lets the lender do is make the monthly payments lower. And since most people only worry if they can afford the payments each month, not how much they pay over the life of the loan, then it sounds like a great deal.<br><br>The elite just keep finding ways to skim an increasingly thin share of the total wealth into their bank accounts.<br><br>Green Wizard lesson 101, don't go into debt, lol.<br><br>Me I just bought a second car, a nice little truck for $3K pulled from savings.

Though our products are 100% fish, I was shocked to learn that it may be only 8% of what ends up in the can. Apparently peas and beans make up a lot of the bulk there. Pricewise, though, commercial pet food will only get more expensive because, believe it or not, humans are increasingly in competition for more of what used to be the waste stream from food processing. We used to get paid to take away fish scraps, then we got it free for the collecting, now we pay for it and struggle to source supplies, as more and more is being mushed back into the higher value human food chain (though prob at the lower value end of that). <br><br>These are global trends as far as I know, they might help frame your thinking on this. For what it's worth, our own dogs thrive on our scraps, always have, despite severe warnings about this practice.

My wife was recently at a water utility convention with several high level water utility managers from California. They seemed to be rather oblivious to the big picture consequences of the drought. But instead were focused on the financial effects, which is that when the product you are selling is water, then when you have less of it to sell your revenue goes down so that you can no longer pay off the debt you used to build the system for all the present and future ratepayers. An obvious consequence of a market based economic system meeting " negative growth". One short term way to stave this off is to charge more per unit above a minimum use, to in effect tax water wasters, and rich users such as golf courses and beverly hills swimming pool owners. But this week in California a state court ruled this type of pricing illegal.

There are not enough resources for each individual to own one. OTOH, each one weighs at least 3000 lbs (a little less than 1.5 Metric Tonnes), while an average single person bike weighs about 30 pounds (My own bike, a 1991 Bridgestone CB-1 with a chrome-moly steel frame, good but not fancy high tech) or a little under 14 KG. So a bike uses two orders of magnitude less than (1/100th of) the materials used in a car. Converting the world's cars to bikes (example purely to demonstrate resource use) could provide a bicycle for every single person in the world, with almost 400 pounds (180 KG) of material, mostly steel, per person left over.<br><br>The obvious benefits in the undeveloped world are staggering, and would greatly outweigh the inconvenience in the richest industrialized world.<br><br>That being said, humanity lived for hundreds of thousands of years without any vehicles, and civilizations have existed for thousands of years without wheels, much less cars or bikes. JMG is not sure even bicycles can be made or maintained in a post collapse society.<br><br>So why do I bring this up? Why is it so important? I think our host may be wrong, but I certainly wouldn't bet on it. No, it's important because the first world in general, and the U.S. in great particular has built it's infrastructure around the automobile, and we can't afford to change that very much during prolonged economic contraction and industrial collapse.

Right now, salvage is an effective strategy, because there's so much waste to be put to good uses, but it's crucial not to let salvage become the be-all and end-all, because sooner or later it'll run out. Thus the approach I've suggested here, which is to have everyone choose a few areas in which to concentrate your energies on all-out do-it-yourself, and get by in other areas via salvage and similar gimmicks.

Thanks for the reply. My reference to swords and guns was rhetorical. The bottleneck into which we are about to squeeze would be much less distressing without all the arms and armories of empires which represent not only a great opportunity cost but will add immensely to the anguish of our passage through the gauntlet. And make no mistake, the individuals out there who are most well armed and mostly likely to use them share nothing of our earthly values. My shotgun that I discharge twice a year for deer meat wouldn't provide much protection in a truly dystopian setting. And if it really comes to that I don't think there is any territory that will be worth defending. This mix of guns and cars, the tensions between mobility and territoriality is the source of much of our current mess. It would be great but probably extremely naive to think we'll not take the mess with us into the great gauntlet.<br><br><a href=#c6853591877307024842 title="comment permalink">4/27/15, 4:04 AM</a><br><br>

Interestingly insect activity is waking up much closer to its usual pace, hardly can anyone agree that they are even a week early.<br><br>Personally I am happy to say that most of my fundimental needs are disconnected from the externality system (using this phrase!), save the over strong binds that hold my farm lords to it. If the externalities glitch too strongly the micro kingdom where I am the lone serf could staggar, and I'd be in the soup! I have weakened a couple of these connections, and strengthened the back up systems. But I feel kin to the warriors of Valhalla seeing those jaws scratching sky and earth turning toward them from the horizion and under breath I sometimes observe to my fellows "we are too few". Too few for the many externalities that have to be hemmed in. Too green still for the task, and lacking capable masters and teachers; save a few Druids and Wizards reached through the most externalized of all bridges; how this way of communicating reminds me of a way of communicating over distance I read about just last night, in a book written before the internet was dreamt, who knows what forces look in on each communication, and what ways of looking into hearts they might possess? Some externalities cannot be touched until certain key rings of power are set away for good, so be it the back up systems can be prepared in the shadows reguardless. May our green house be retrofitted to be passive, that a power outaged not have the power to destroy the season in an evening or an ice storm; may our irregation ditches be dug so that by sweat of brow and grease of elbow the crops could be sustained through a broken pump; may the wind breaks grow swiftly so that our crops need not live at the mercy of providers of agricultural fabric.<br><br>A group of good friends are working on putting together a communal living arrangment, I will not jump to join, but if they have the courage to face likely failure (I stressed courage over hope) then I say very well, the chance of modest success would be a lovely neighbor to my life, and failure would be a maturing source of wisdom, provided that backups are strong enough to protect people. Alarmingly most of them cannot imagine porperty prices in Fort Collins falling, and imaging that if things went that pear shaped that it surely would not matter, imagination is under practiced, or more likely its censorship too well practiced.<br><br>Thank you all, as always, for this the Last Formly Fourm.<br><br><a href=#c6605905191138892955 title="comment permalink">4/27/15, 9:20 AM</a><br><br>

On the other side are maintenance and long-term use, for which I have no aggregate figures, but consider: it costs several thousand US dollars a year to run a car. My mid-price 2004 hybrid bike (tough tires and frame, built for urban situations) costs about $150.00 a year to run, mainly because the local bike shop does my maintenance for me and I do buy parts or accessories such as a helmet and front and rear lights from time to time. I do not expect to buy a replacement bike any time soon, if ever. <br><br>In terms of fuel, er, food, cyclists who have gardens and cook at home using mostly non-industrially-processed ingredients also lessen fossil fuel and industrial supply chain dependence. Plus saving money.<br><br>Bike salvage collectives such as Working Bikes in Chicago offer free maintenance lessons and also are a good place to get used bikes. <br><br>Then there are the health benefits of the regular cardiovascular exercise. I feel that part of collapsing includes staying as healthy as possible, which includes, if able, regular physical exercise. Obviously, people with physical jobs/livelihoods such as homesteaders don't have to worry about this, but many of us in urban and suburban areas could do with more fitness--even walking.<br><br>In coming years I expect to see more cargo bikes in use as their economic benefits become more evident.<br><br>Clearly, as JMG points out, bikes may not ultimately be a long term solution, but should be more in the mix now. I do use the family car when unavoidable. Still, I'm often surprised at the number of environmentally conscious people or regular folks who <i>don't</i> use bikes when nothing--not poor weather, not busy roads, not physical disability--prevents them. On the other hand I know some right old codgers, male and female, who cycle in all weathers and on all occasions.<br><br><a href=#c4411529873136271213 title="comment permalink">4/27/15, 11:02 AM</a><br><br>

You know, you have often accused me of simplifying complex matters and that is a fair criticism, but this one is big!<br><br>Whilst we are all waiting for those thoughts, I thought I'd share a choice John Kenneth Galbraith (who is actually a very serious economist) comment from his book The Great Crash 1929:<br><br>"As an instrument of economic policy, incantation does not permit of minor doubts or scruples".<br><br>Also, I believe this comment to be central to one of the core objectives of this blog:<br><br>"Preventative incantation required that as many important people as possible repeat as firmly as they could that it wouldn't happen (referring to the denizens of Wall Street and an economic downturn just prior to the Great Depression). This they did. They explained how the stock market was merely the froth and that the real substance of economic life rested in production, employment, and spending, all of which would remain unaffected. No one knew for sure that this was so."<br><br>Prescient words. It is a real shame that few heed those words today - although to be honest I do understand how it all came about and am under no delusions about the situation.<br><br>Do you know what annoys me though? The whole industry that has arisen surrounding the superannuation industry (i.e. legislated retirement funds) takes 9.5% of an employees daily earnings and invests (sic) those funds into what appears to me to be a form of speculative gambling: e.g. the property market and the share market. Those funds cannot be used either for consumption or the day to day operations of a business - which would actually improve the economy.<br><br>The full implications of this policy hit me today and I’m left with the realisation that what started off with such great promise ended up in what appears to me to be a bowl of ashes. Speculation does not produce anything of any substance in the long run.<br><br>The funds from the superannuation guarantee legislation could have possibly been put to better use by allowing the average Joe/Jane to simply spend them and thus boosted employment and consumption and ensured some sort of future. But instead it appears that the funds were ploughed into investment (sic) vehicles such as anticipated gains in both the property and share markets. All of which produce what appears to be a whole lot of hot air and yet so many people rely on that capital growth and dividends to fund their retirements it just isn’t funny at all. I would suggest that the descent into speculation has possibly cost us our futures.<br><br>I ache to witness such a great heist at play and the knowledge of those activities steels me to further efforts at disassociating myself from the inevitable fallout.<br><br>The perverse incentives to gut the real world economy of goods and services in order to produce what appears to be a hallucinatory wealth is just staggering to behold.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c4788270733136513064 title="comment permalink">4/28/15, 5:12 AM</a><br><br>

He's always finding ways to accomplish something without buying anything, thus the rock mining and bark stripping. We get a huge kick out of our chickens, and are hopeful for the 3rd time that we'll get Chinese red golden pheasant chicks this year. On a summer evening at dusk, he goes and lies in a hammock strung between two trees and looks up at "the 3D world." He has taught me to stop everything at about 8 or 8:30 pm and and listen to the "moment of silence," a brief time between the daytime noisemakers and the nighttime noisemakers, when the air becomes still...we have discovered Datura, a big, white night blooming flower that literally pops open at about that time.

If we take 1990-2010 or so as "peak" (roughly, some things might have peaked before, others will peak in 2020) it seems that the 1950s (or maybe 1930s) levels in the Western World or probably today's standards and structures of many the former Eastern bloc states and developing countries would be a decent guide to which techs and structures are feasible.

Watch this space.<br><br>The push for workers contributions (and I speaking from a Down Under experience) into speculative enterprises appears to leave the workers with less money to spend on goods and / or services. That may then lead them to chase lower prices. It might be worth considering the very real issue that consumers don't in fact set prices - businesses do that by charging whatever the market can bear. I would suggest that this legislated push into speculative spending (which is sold as an investment for the future) appears to be a tax of sorts and it is a drain on the real economy of goods and services - which actually produces real wealth.

I thought the story funny and my thought was that this principle makes it hard to keep power over the world, even for the most powerfull naval force on the planet. I thought the article might be of interest, I have posted a link to it below. Maybe there were many similar stories regarding the decline of earlier super powers.<br><br>How a Malaysian Playboy Controlled the Most Powerful Naval Force on the Planet, Fat Leonard’s hookers and cash seduced the U.S. Seventh Fleet … and soaked taxpayers for millions.<br><br>https://medium.com/war-is-boring/how-a-malaysian-playboy-controlled-the-most-powerful-naval-force-on-the-planet-eddb7d7fbf48<br><br>Maybe a short presentation about me is appropriate since I have never posted here earlier. My name is Milos and I am 31 year old guy from Stockholm, Sweden. I have been working 5 years with maintenance of the state owned nuclear power plants in Sweden and now I’m working with setting up the maintenance organization on probably the largest biomass combined heat and power plant in the world. It is being built in Stockholm to diversify away from coal as a fuel for central heating. Apart from that I´m a board member in the Swedish Maintenance Society.<br><br>In short I see that people around me hasn’t grasped how dependent the society is on depleting resources. Maybe I haven’t really grasped it my self, more comprehensive and profound strategies would be needed for a proper response to our predicament.

I usually don't go in for new year's resolutions, but in 2010 I decided I wouldn't read or post comments anymore as I found they left me with a poor impression of humanity. It's a shame because I feel like comments should, like a conversation, allow for growth, perspective, and even conflict in a way that is useful to writers and thinkers both. So this is the one place on the whole internet that I break my rule. Thank you JMG for providing a place where people can be thoughtful and keeping trolls at bay, and thanks to all the commenters that leave such neat ideas on a regular basis.<br><br><a href=#c1481794907363349363 title="comment permalink">4/29/15, 3:28 PM</a><br><br>

My awesome Professor William Crandall from National University directed me here. I will be visiting here more often to engage in the contemporary matters and concerns which you lay on the table. In your post on "The era of Impact" I chuckled at what you said because it is so true. ie. "The problem with trying to predict the trigger that will bring our current situation to a sudden stop is that we’re in such a target-rich environment. Looking over the potential candidates for the sudden shock that will stick a fork in the well-roasted corpse of business as usual." So enlightening and so true...<br><br>Nadine Taylor<br><br><a href=#c8340776935919500309 title="comment permalink">5/23/15, 4:34 AM</a><br><br>
