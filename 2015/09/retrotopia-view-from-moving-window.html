This is the second installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Readers who haven’t been following <i>The Archdruid Report </i>for long may find it useful to remember that not everything seen along the way has a simple explanation. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
From the window beside me, the Steubenville station looked like a scene out of an old Bogart vid. The platform closest to the train I was riding was full of people in outdated clothes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Most of them wore long raincoats that didn’t look a bit like bioplastic, and all of the men and most of the women had hats on. Up above was a roof of glass and ironwork that reminded me irresistibly of the Victorian era, and let daylight down onto everything. The oddest thing about it all, though, is that I didn’t see security troops anywhere. On the other side of the border, anywhere you saw this many people together there’d be at least a squad in digital camo and flak jackets, pointing assault guns ostentatiously at the sidewalk. I remembered the guards at the border, with their clipboards, holstered revolvers, and old-fashioned uniforms, and wondered how on earth the Lakeland Republic got away with that kind of carelessness. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The train finally rolled to a stop, and doors opened. The conductor had warned us that plenty of people would be coming aboard, and he wasn’t kidding: it took better than five minutes for everyone to file onto the car where I was sitting, and by the time they’d finished coming aboard, nearly every seat was taken. The aisle seat next to me wasn’t one of the empty ones; a family with three children settled in right behind me, one child next to the mother, the second next to the father, and then Mom came up to me and asked if I minded having the oldest child sit next to me. I gestured and said, “Sure,” and a boy of maybe ten plopped into the seat. “Now you mind your manners,” the woman told him, and he rolled his eyes, sighed loudly, and said, “Yeah, Mom.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That wasn’t too promising, but he had a book with him, and as soon as he was settled in his seat, he opened it and didn’t make another sound . I was curious enough to give the book a sidelong glance; it was called <i>Treasure Island</i>, and it was by somebody I’d never heard of named Robert Louis Stevenson; I made a mental note to look up the name and see if he was somebody new I should check out. He wasn’t the only kid in the car who was doing something quiet, either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Up three rows there was a girl in a blue checked dress and a bonnet who was reading something, too, and behind me, the two kids in the immigrant family were watching everything and not saying a word, though they didn’t look quite as scared as when they boarded. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A couple of solid jolts shook the car. A moment later, I heard the voice of the conductor outside calling out, “Last call for Train Twenty to Toledo via Canton and Sandusky. All aboard!” Doors clattered, the locomotive up ahead sounded its whistle, and with another jolt the train started on its way again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The station slid away, and I got a street-level view of half a dozen blocks of downtown Steubenville. The sense of having landed on the set of an old Bogart vid was just as strong. To judge by the couple of clocks the train passed—my veepad was still giving me a dark field and the words <i>no signal—</i>it was right around time for the morning commute, but there wasn’t a car to be seen anywhere; the sidewalks bustled with people, and a couple of streetcars rolled past with bells clanging and standing room only on board. The train picked up speed and left the downtown behind, but further out was more of the same: streets full of comfortable-looking houses and apartment buildings, with people walking to work or waiting at streetcar stops. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Further on the houses spread out, and big gardens sprouted all over the place, with the last fall crops visible in patches separated by stubble and brown earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A little further, and Steubenville blended smoothly into the same sort of farm country I’d seen since shortly after the train crossed into the Lakeland Republic. The farmhouses and barns looked well-tended, windmills spun and solar water heater panels on the roofs soaked up what sunlight came through the broken clouds, and the roads I saw were unpaved but had fresh gravel on them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A little further, and the train passed a work gang out in one of the fields. That wasn’t surprising—back on the other side of the border, you saw prison work gangs doing labor on corporate farms all the time—but these didn’t have the slouch and the least-possible-effort sort of movement you see in convicts. They were working their way across a field, digging up turnips as energetically as if they wanted to be there, and others came behind them just as methodically and carried the turnips away in bushel baskets. It was when I noticed where they were taking the turnips that my mouth dropped open. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Just past the field was a wagon with two draft horses hitched up to it. I wondered for a moment if this was an Amish farm—we’ve got Amish in our country, quite a few of them in what used to be the state of Pennsylvania before Partition, and they’re among the few people who’ve really done well in the postwar era—but the wagon had been painted in colors that, though they’d faded, had obviously once been bright. The people in the work gang weren’t dressed in any sort of Amish kit I’d ever seen, either. I shook my head as the work gang and the wagon slipped out of sight behind the train, wondering what kind of weird place I was visiting. This was the twenty-first century, after all, not the nineteenth!</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And yet it was like that all the way to Canton—or, to be more precise, it was some variation on the same theme of outdated technology and inefficient land use. All the farms were absurdly small, one to two hundred acres divided up into the sort of mixed farming that modern agriculture discarded most of a century ago, and I didn’t see any trace of modern agricultural machinery: no harvesting drones, no nitrogen injection systems, no quadruple-wide megacombines, nothing. What I did see left me baffled, not least because there didn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason to it. In one place I’d see trucks driving down paved roads and tractors in the fields, and twenty or thirty miles later it would be draft horses and wagons doing the same jobs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The train passed through I don’t know how many little towns, and those were the same way: in one I’d see paved streets and a few cars and trucks, in the next the streets were paved with brick and streetcars shared space with horsedrawn carriages, and then there were a few that had brick streets and no streetcars at all. The thing that puzzled me most, though, was that all of the towns, like nearly all the farms, seemed to be thriving. Every scrap of theory I’d learned in business school argued that small towns, like small farms, were hopelessly inefficient and couldn’t possibly support themselves in a modern economy. I’d guessed earlier in the trip that there must be subsidies involved, but this far into Lakeland Republic territory, that explanation wouldn’t wash. I reached for my veepad reflexively to make a note, remembered as I got it out of my pocket that it wouldn’t get a signal, and put it away, feeling a rush of annoyance at the metanet’s absence. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We got to Canton a little ahead of schedule, or so the conductor announced cheerfully, and stopped in the switching yard east of town to lose some freight cars, gain others, and add three more passenger cars and a dining car to the back end of the train. That went quickly, though it involved a lot of jolts and thumps, and before long we were rolling ahead into the city. Canton was a fairly big town; according to what I’d read while researching this trip, it had plenty of factories until the offshoring fad of the late twentieth century scrapped the United States’ manufacturing capacity and left the nation at the mercy of rival powers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’d seen the gutted hulks of old factories outside Pittsburgh and a dozen other cities on our side of the border, and assumed that I’d see the same thing here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I didn’t. What I saw instead, as the train rolled through the outlying districts of Canton, were what looked very much like warehouses and factories open for business. There weren’t many smokestacks to be seen, but the buildings had recent coats of paint on them, boxcars were being pushed down sidings by switching engines, and a mix of trucks and big horsedrawn wagons were lumbering past on the streets. Further in, the train passed the same mix of of office buildings, apartment blocks, and stores I’d seen in Steubenville, and then we slowed and stopped at the Canton station. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That had me remembering Bogart vids again. From my window I could see at least eight platforms to one side of the train I was riding, and through the windows on the other side of the car I was pretty sure I could make out two more. Signs on the platforms noted destinations all over the Lakeland Republic—Morgantown, Bowling Green, Cairo, Madison, Sault Ste. Marie—and the place fairly bustled with passengers heading for this or that train. Some of the passengers from the car I was sitting in got their luggage and headed out into the crowds, and some others came on board, stowed their luggage, and sat down; and the weirdest thing of all was that everyone seemed perfectly comfortable doing without security troops to protect them or modern technology to take care of their needs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The train finally got under way again, and I got more views of Canton as the track headed northwest through town. About the time the houses started to spread out and the gardens got bigger, the conductor came through the door behind me and said, “Ladies and gentlemen, breakfast service is now open in the dining car, and since so many of the people in this car have been with us since Pittsburgh, you’re first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>If you’d like to head back four cars, the dining car staff will be happy to serve you.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Just about everyone in the car got up and filed back through the door. I didn’t. I’m one of those people who doesn’t do breakfast; if I eat anything before lunch I end up with stomach trouble. The kid next to me went with his family, and the mother of the immigrant family took her two kids back to the dining car right after them. The father of the immigrant family, though, didn’t join them. After a few minutes he and I were practically alone in the car. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I half turned in my seat, gave him what I hoped would come across as a friendly smile. “Not into breakfast?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Too keyed up,” he said, smiling in response. “If I ate now I’d get sick to my stomach.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded. “I couldn’t help hearing the border guard say that you’re immigrating. That sounds pretty drastic. If you don’t mind my asking, what made you do that?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
His smile vanished, replaced by a wary look. “The wife has family in Ann Arbor,” he said. “They’re sponsoring us, and I got a job offer when we visited this summer. It seems like a good move.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Even though you have to give up modern technology?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The wary look gave way to something that looked uncomfortably like contempt. “Technology? Like what?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Well, veepads and the metanet, to start with.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By this point it was definitely contempt. “Big loss. I can’t afford any of that keech anyway.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Why not? You’ve got as much chance as anyone. Work hard, and—”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
His expression said “whatever” more clearly than words, and he turned toward the window and away from me. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No,” I said. “Seriously. I want to understand.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He turned back to face me. “Yeah? Did you hear my wife start crying there at the border, once they checked our papers?” I nodded, and he went on. “You know why she started crying? Because she’s been working three different jobs, sixty hours a week plus, to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table—and before you start thinking something stupid, mister, I’ve been working more hours than her since before we got married. This is the first time she’s had anything to look forward to but that kind of schedule or worse for the rest of her life, until one of us gets too sick to work and we get chucked onto the street or into the burbs.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And you think you’ll be that much better off here?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He gave me a baffled look, and then laughed a short hard laugh. “You haven’t been here before.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No, I haven’t.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Then open your eyes and take a good plutting look around.” He turned back to the window, and I knew better than to try to continue the conversation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The landscape rolled by. We were in farm country again, the same patchwork landscape of little farms and little towns, with the same weird incongruities between one place and another. I was paying more attention this time, so I noticed some of the other differences: paved roads, gravel roads, and dirt roads; in some places, streetcars and local rail service, and none of these things in others; towns that had streetlights and others that didn’t. At one point west of Canton, as the train rattled across a bridge, I looked down and honest to God, there were canal boats going both ways on a canal, each one with a mule pulling the towrope as though it was two hundred years ago and the Erie Canal was still in working order. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With my veepad useless, I didn’t have anything to do but watch the landscape roll by. The people who’d gone to breakfast trickled back a few at a time, and the conversation I’d just had with the immigrant replayed over and over again in my mind. Of course I knew perfectly well that things were pretty hard for the poor back home, and the statistics that got churned out quarter after quarter showing steady economic improvement were strictly public relations maneuvers—there been a modest upturn after the Treaty of Richmond was signed and the last closed borders between the North American republics opened up, but the consequences of the Second Civil War and the debt crisis that followed it still weighed down hard on everybody. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s one thing to have some more or less abstract idea that times are tough, though, and something else to hear it in the voice of someone who’d been on the losing end of the economy all his life. I started to reach for my veepad to look up honest stats on the job market back home—those weren’t easy to find if you didn’t have connections, but that wasn’t a problem for me—and caught the motion just before my hand reached my pocket. What did people do in the Lakeland Republic, I wondered irritably, when they wanted to make a note of something or look up a fact? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I stared out the window, and after a while—the train was most of the way to Sandusky by then—noticed something that made the crazy quilt pattern of old technologies on the landscape a little clearer and a lot more puzzling. The train had slowed a little, and crossed a road at an angle. The road was paved on one side and dirt on the other; I could see tractors in the middle distance off to the left, where the paved road started, and draft horses closer by on the right. Just where the pavement began was a sign that read <i>Welcome to Huron County</i>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That got me thinking back over the landscape the train had crossed since the border, and yes, the breaks between one set of technology and another worked out to something like county-line distances. That made me shake my head. Had the Lakeland Republic somehow divvied up the available technology by county, so that some counties got the equivalent of twentieth century infrastructure and others got stuck with the nineteenth-century equivalent? That sounded like political suicide, unless the Republic was a lot more autocratic than the briefing papers I’d read made it sound. Then, of course, there was the fact that the farmhouses and farm towns in the nineteenth-century counties looked just as prosperous, all things considered, as their equivalents in the twentieth-century counties, and that made no sense at all. The farmers with more technology should have outproduced the others, undercut them in price, and driven them out of business in no time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Huron County slid past the window. Farmland dotted with little towns gave way to a midsized town, which I guessed was the county seat, and then to farmland and little towns again. After a while, the conductor stepped through the door behind me and called out, “Next stop, Sandusky.” A few minutes later, the train swung around a wide curve to the left, and ran just back of the shores of Lake Erie. Off in the distance, at a steep angle ahead, Sandusky’s buildings could be seen rising up above the flat line of the landscape, but that wasn’t what caught my gaze and held it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Out maybe a quarter mile from shore was a big schooner with three masts, white sails bellying out ahead of the wind. It wasn’t anybody’s luxury yacht, that was for sure; from stem to stern, it looked every inch a working boat. From the direction it was headed, I guessed it must have left Sandusky harbor not long before, and was headed east toward the locks around Niagara Falls, or just possibly toward Erie or Buffalo—since the Treaty of Richmond, I knew, we’d been importing agricultural products from the Lakeland Republic, though I’d never bothered to find out how they got to us. I sat there and watched the ship as it swept past, wondering why they hadn’t done the obvious thing and entrusted their shipping to modern freighters instead. What kind of strange things had been going on here during the years when the Lakeland Republic was locked away behind closed borders?</div>

Part of the revival is the tube mill, which has been running full blast spinning drill pipe for fracking, but there are other signs of hope.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c307217294351298373 title="comment permalink">9/2/15, 6:24 PM</a><br><br>

His horror movies were both good in their genre, and dealt with the constraints of their genre with some sort of self-reflecting humor. But he died at a time when it would be hard for a horror movie to outdo reality, either in horror or in dark humour.<br> Here in wealthy Europe, we face three alternatives : watching the horrible news (in Iraq, on our lands...) in morbid fascination, completely shuttering it out to try to keep on living daily life, or trying bravely to walk off the beaten tracks away from conventional visions that are now proving their limits and inanity in the face of challenge more than ever. I guess it's pretty much the same for the denizens of the USA right now.<br> As I commented here on your previous post, I find your piece of fiction touching, well-written, and well constructed... but not very convincing from the perspective of where I live, outside the US. Yet you do deserve credit for trying the third of the three alternatives, and since it goes off the well-trodden tracks, there are as many ways to do it as there are individuals. Your attitude is very inspiring, especially at a time when inspiration comes in rather short supply.<br><br>I need not point out that, even when it has to feature news which will probably be remembered as some of the Horrors of the 21st century, the Reuters website still links to pieces like this one :<br>http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/2015/09/02/why-oil-investors-are-so-behind-the-curve/<br>You should go and beat up some of those journalists on the head with your wisdom stick if you have one.

If so, then that would imply that any capital generated during that time would stay within the local economy to accumulate &amp; grow and would not be siphoned out of the Republic to Wall Street and its kin.

As for hitting journalists with a wisdom stick, I could wear out a forest worth of them without the least effect -- wasn't it Upton Sinclair who pointed out that you can't make somebody understand something if his job depends on not understanding it? The media is in the business of selling products, using, ahem, "infotainment" as a lure to get you to watch the ads. That's their job, and it depends on not understanding the gap between advertising and reality. <br><br>Ben and Jonathan, thank you!<br><br>Trog, I find Brin highly entertaining; he apparently finds me highly annoying. I hope we have a public conversation someday; it'll probably be worth watching. <br><br>Jbucks, given the way Europe is headed, those may be very useful skills indeed!<br><br>Unknown Deborah, if I weren't so dedicated an oddball, I probably wouldn't know what novels people were reading or what they were using to take notes on, either. As it happened, they'd likely be reading Alexandre Dumas, James Fenimore Cooper and Walter Scott, who were popular with American readers just then, and they'd take notes in a little leatherbound notebook with blank pages, which many people carried with them everywhere for exactly that purpose. <br><br>Kevin, good. Very good. You're paying attention. <br><br>Bob, whether or not small countries are doing that in our time, the Lakeland Republic has certainly done so. Stay tuned!<br><br>RepubAnon, technological advances are meaningless unless you have the cheap energy and resources to make them function, and we're running out of both. That's the heart of our present predicament, and the inability of so many people to grasp that is one of the most fruitful causes of the acquired cluelessness that's driving the world's industrial economies straight into the ground. Automation only makes sense if energy and resources are cheaper than human labor, and that's already no longer true in some countries -- why do you think so many corporations are outsourcing their factories to Third World countries where so much more of the work is done by hand, at low wages? <br><br>Greg, exactly. One of the core themes of this narrative is the conflict between current technofantasies and the increasingly bleak realities that those fantasies produce when applied in action. Another is the unexpected range of possibilities that open up once you realize that technofantasies of the "everything will be automated" sort are recognized as the outdated relics that they are, and a range of policies are adapted to the new reality of a postabundance world.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c5724180565626966902 title="comment permalink">9/2/15, 10:29 PM</a><br><br>

We lived on a 10-acre grape farm on the outskirts of Cape Town in the 1950s. The milkman and the dustman came in horse-drawn carts; a subcontractor came with a horse and plough to till between the vines; I walked down a dirt road to catch the electric trolleybus which ran all the way to the center of town; we rode our bicycles everywhere; and there was no crime to speak of. Water was from rainwater and a borehole, and sewage went into a septic tank.<br><br>Our table grapes were exported to London. They had to be perfect. This required my dad to keep shooting the flocks of starlings which would peck the berries. It was very labor-intensive. The vineyards needed cultivating, trimming, pruning, and dusting with vine sulfur. The ripening bunches were trimmed on the vine. After picking they were thinned out and shaped, any green or small berries cut out, the bunches wrapped in tissue paper and packed in wood wool in boxes. The crates were nailed together on site from piles of fresh-cut planks. As kids, our hero was a worker who could knock in a nail with one blow rather than going tap-tap-tap-BANG-BANG. As a special treat we kids were allowed to paste the labels on the boxes.<br><br>When the workers were forced to move from the area under apartheid legislation, farm labor became expensive. We tried prison labor for a while. My father, who worked as a lawyer, sold bits of the farm off to keep going. The trolleybuses were replaced with diesels because the overhead wiring was too expensive to maintain and extend, and in any case looked unsightly. We got municipal water after my mother found a rat in the rainwater tank. Farms got subdivided and houses built. Crime rose. We became a suburb.<br><br>I'm interested in the mixed landscape of Lakeland. Why are some areas 1950s, and other areas 1850s technology? All will be revealed, no doubt.<br><br>So far no mention of currency. In SF novels it's always the usefully vague "credits". Will it be the Lakeland dollar, or a US version of the Euro (not that the Euro is working out so well)?<br><br>Incidentally, on our trains at meal times the conductor or chief steward used to come around with a xylophone and play a little tune. Bing-bong-bing-bing-bong-bong. "First sitting" or "Second sitting" he'd sing out. (We were told beforehand which sitting we were allocated.)<br><br>BTW, how do you pronounce "plut"? "Ploot" would be my guess, based on the derivation.<br><br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c5174547234299694532 title="comment permalink">9/3/15, 2:21 AM</a><br><br>

Being a Scotsman I was particularly impressed by the use of the word “keech”. This is word which I am very familiar with, and was used in the right context.

Urban elites are obsessed with imported consumer technology and ideals of non-stop economic growth, meanwhile the rural farmer's lifestyle isn't really that different from that of his great grandfather. Unfortunately a lot of farmers have been swindled into accepting loans to buy Monsanto products and end up broke, having to sell their land to the big companies and thus the suicide rate is skyrocketing. Industrialization is in full swing, but so many urban dwellers are depressed, to say nothing of the heavy police presence everywhere (machine gun nests in the subway), meanwhile traditional rural communities are fine if left alone.

I wonder if folks there, during and immediately after the default, reasoned that since the 1940s was the time of good prosperity, perhaps returning to not only the technology but also the customs of that era would bring back good times. The irony is that in this particular case, the cargo cult idea works, and the people are able to thrive.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c1712748555858712663 title="comment permalink">9/3/15, 5:15 AM</a><br><br>

For my childrens sake I hope that some areas of the country will turn out as good as the Lakeland Republic. We actually moved two years ago from the suburbs of Baltimore to an old mill town (Auburn, Maine) that at it's peak in the 50's boasted the largest population in Maine with a whopping 120,000. It has shrunk to about 20,000 but is very promising in many of the ways you speak. I can easily see many a displaced Portland or Boston business coming to snatch up the abundant, reasonably priced, river access, and high elevation warehouse space.

I feel it parallels a lot with our current situation. The Lakeland Republic is similar to the growing movements of people and communities who are trying to break away from this modern lifestyle. And if enough people continue practicing those older, more sustainable technologies, a place like Lakeland Republic could be a possibility in the future. The immigrants on the train are a wonderful symbol for those who are trying to escape this modern lifestyle. At beginning of the train ride they were incredibly nervous, unsure if things would work out. But once they crossed the border, everything became easier and there was more certainty, just as with those who practice green wizardry skills. The beginning can be nerve wracking but once you get past the beginning, things will move smoothly. Mr. Carr is an excellent symbol of those of us who are afraid to let go of technologies, but by virtue of being along for the ride he is being forced to learn a thing or two. And thus far, the entire story taking place upon a train ride provides such a great symbol of the journey we will all make as we go down the Post-Peak train ride. <br><br>We are all faced with a choice of which journey we will make. Hopefully we won't choice to be the ignorant Mr. Carr, who didn't even bother to fully investigate the area he would be traveling through. Odds are, since he's an avid user of technology and can't figure out to take notes, he'll probably forget all the important things he has noticed.<br><br>I also want to thank you JMG, because this sort of narrative fiction makes it easier to the swallow the pill of what our choices are leading us into. I've followed this blog for the better part of its existence, but I have never felt more called to action, no better realized the consequences of my actions for myself and those who will follow me till now.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c513414644304839406 title="comment permalink">9/3/15, 7:41 AM</a><br><br>

Usually after a war, the line of demarcation follows landscape, around old defensive positions, like the way the East German border did. I guess the peace treaty chose to keep the old line, but I notice that leaves some bits straggling oddly out of place where rivers bend, the way Flag Island, Oak Island, and Young's bay in the Lake of the Woods in Minnesota has since the 1800s.<br>I would have thought, given Mr. Carr's mental conditioning, that he would have described the houses around Steubenville in far more disparaging terms, and was surprised he did not use the words 'obsolete' or 'ancient' or 'old fashioned' in the usual snide tone of adherents of the Civil Religion of Progress.<br>Moreover, I would have thought he'd described people waiting at streetcar stops as somehow unfortunate, e.g. instead of, "...with people walking to work or waiting at streetcar stops." I'd expect, "...the poor people having to walk or waiting to stuff themselves into the public streetcars."<br>I guess he's more open minded and charitable about such things than your average citizen who, as far as I can tell, takes the 20th Century American view that building highways is 'infrastructure' but public transit is 'subsidizing poor people' according to one Mayor in Southern Ontario in the 1980s. (To be fair, this particular Mayor later admitted this was a very bad mistake. This very argument has been quite animated in Toronto in recent years, although the gist of it is less cars vs. transit, but more what <i>kind</i> of transit, the kind that interferes with cars or the kind that goes underground.)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c3233619794726100666 title="comment permalink">9/3/15, 7:52 AM</a><br><br>

You can run a diesel on just about anything, but the electrical complexities of the traction motors on each axle have bothered me when contemplating the post-industrial railroad scene.

I have used these for years, and understand that they have a history dating back to the 19th century, and would have been in general use by 1846.<br><br>Of course, in 1846 readers would more likely have been reading "The Crater" than "The Spy," and that is interesting in an ironic sense in that it is an analogy of the U.S., and conveys Coopers' doomer state of mind.

The fact that it could be an ancient book is inconceivable to him.<br><br>It reminds me of my latest library work frustration. This past week my manager sent a memo informing us of a new rule for books put on display above shelves: they now have to be books published in the last 3 years. I find this is completely ridiculous and will disobey the rule. Up until now, I had enjoyed prominently displaying some older but high-quality books remaining in our collection that patrons may not be familiar with. I find most of the new children's literature coming in to be of very poor quality.<br><br>Libraries like mine celebrate Banned Books Week and like to stress their values of anti-censorship. Yet, I see a tremendous bias against older books. The number of books pulled off some library shelf because they are objectionable pales in comparison to the number of books that are weeded just because they are old and no longer well-known.<br><br>Related to older books and also post-petroleum fiction: Several years ago I had asked you if you knew of any children's books with post-petroleum themes and you didn't. I recently learned of one: Henry's Quest by Graham Oakley. I couldn't find it at my library so I had to order a used copy. It's a King Arthur tale with a post-petroleum twist. I thought the writing could have been better, but the pictures are what really stand out to me: A old gas station that is now a cow barn. Flatbeds with sails traveling on old ruins of highways. A repurposed old airplane, etc. More info here:<br>http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/04/05/319933/-Life-after-oil-151-A-children-s-book-review#<br><br>Several people have encouraged me to write/illustrate a post-petroleum children's book.

A couple of observations: <br><br>"Treasure Island" was a nice touch. If we lost our ubiquitous electronic media we would also lose much of our pop culture, and it makes sense that stories from earlier eras might see a revival -- not just because they were more likely to be preserved in physical books, but because the stories themselves would feel relevant again. <br><br>Today’s CGI-based films are written to distract an audience with many electronic devices and a short attention span, filled with characters just like the audience. Older novels, written for a slower and vaster world, would seem more likely to resonate with Lakeland inhabitants. <br><br>Several fiction genres popular today might well survive, though –Westerns and pseudo-medieval fantasies, for example, or the Amish romance novels so popular with American evangelicals. I could also see some of today’s most popular stories remaining relevant in new forms – Star Wars, for example, passed down as a barbarian saga with its space-ship setting forgotten. <br><br>In the same way, I would expect the people of Lakeland to be more likely to know who Humphrey Bogart is than your narrator. I know few people today, raised on internet-based pop culture, who are familiar with classic films, and I would expect even fewer people to in 2065. Films from that era, though, showed a world of less technology and lower energy use, and might find a ready audience in Lakeland. For example, I could see people there -- if they reserve electricity for any entertainment -- gathering in the local pub and watching a Buster Keaton film projected onto a sheet, just as audiences might have a century ago.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c878044734359575158 title="comment permalink">9/3/15, 8:13 AM</a><br><br>

They are quite elegant, but have you considered the implications of nylon stockings (unsustainable) and girdles? (ditto, and blasted uncomfortable, but the clothing was designed to be worn with them.) Interestingly enough, several of the younger authors - by which I mean Millennials - at this past weekend's Bubonicon looked very 1940s, and were stunning in the modern variations on that theme. Livia Blackburne and Cat Valente, to name two. So perhaps your Lakelanders are wearing more comfortable adaptations of the style?<br><br>BTW, the corseting (and boned 18th C waistcoats for men) so universal in the early and middle modern period which does make excellent back support, as any re-enactor or Steampunk fan knows, depended entirely on the availability of whalebone. Oops - Mam Gaia gonna GIT y'all for slaughtering Her sea creatures for that purpose! <br><br>Sorry - women do notice and are concerned with such things. Though the 1940s style also included Katherine Hepburn's slacks and Marlene Dietrich's tuxedos - also sensible and practical. And dungarees, like Rosie the Riveter.

First, you have to take off the hat when entering a car, at least since cars became lower. Second, for walking some meters from a house to a car and vice versa, hats are superfluous. So it's kind of logical that the demise of the car will see the rebirth of hats.<br><br>The walking distance to a bus/tram stop or train station is longer than for car drivers, and the headroom in public transport allows easily for hats. I don't own a car, which is why I use headgear; though not a hat, but a traditional, artisinally manufactured woollen basque beret, even made in France. (: The civil one, not the military variant.

Oxymoronic?<br><br>I'm enjoying the train ride. As a midwestern woman, I know people who grew up on small mixed farms and still bemoan their loss. I do travel by train through Illinois fairly frequently and have often wished I could see the sights you describe. It would be nice to see the small towns vital and prosperous again.<br><br>Somewhat off topic but part of worldbuilding?: Even though Chicago won't be part of your story, and I don’t expect answers, I still can't help thinking about what its relations with Lakeland might be, since I live here and all. Would Lakeland make goods for production and trade them in Chicago for other goods? Would Lakeland sell its grain through Chicago markets? Would Chicago's wily, amoral politicians somehow help insure Lakeland's safety and ability to function as retrotopia? Would iron ore from Minnesota and scrap metal from the salvage trade come down to Chicago to get smelted and either turned into implements for Lakeland farmers or get traded for grain? Is there a thriving commercial fishery for Asian carp? Would young, rebellious Lakelanders (Lakelandians?) run away from their happy homes to test their mettle in the streets or ship out on a big sail-powered ship to see more of the world? Or young rebellious Chicagoans leave for the country (or out of favor politicians get exiled there)?<br><br>Even now, to paint with a very--extremely--broad brush, plenty of rural and suburban Illinoisans regard Chicago as something akin to "the great Satan" that they'd be better off without. (State politicians exploit this attitude for their own gain.) Yet all that corn and soy from the country gets traded through Chicago markets, helping maintain rural folks' livelihoods. So I do believe Chicago would cast some kind of influence over much of the region.

Frankly I’m worried what will happen when the inevitable consequences start showing up here more forcefully than they have done so far.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c8201731507743095468 title="comment permalink">9/3/15, 10:15 AM</a><br><br>

My family joined the crowd from Connecticut that settled the Western Reserve right after the War of 1812. I used to spend my summers in a family compound in Huron until the wicked people of Sandusky (according to my mother) started to dump their sewage and industrial chemicals into Lake Erie. The family scattered to the winds. A cousin and I always dreamed of returning to buy one of those farms whose fields slope right down to the shore but we never did do that and he died a couple of years ago. <br>My brother and I used to row a little pram down Cranberry Creek - a fresh water estuary - that wound through corn fields buzzing with life and smelling like summer. One of my dear relatives turned that lovely place into a marina for power boats. That fact has always kept me humble because I loved that relative. He was not an evil person but he did a terrible thing. I could never feel proud of who I was or what my family was and I felt I could not really expect better of others. <br>I am glad that Sandusky has survived but I have two questions: first, what do they do with their wastes in 2065 and second, what happened to Cedar Point?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c1255880011061170172 title="comment permalink">9/3/15, 12:25 PM</a><br><br>

I especially like his astonishment that a country that defaulted on its debts 32 years ago would have enough scratch, or in the words of the immigrant, "keech", to put themselves back together into a (partial) recovery. Now where does "keech" come from? Has it something to do with the upscale delicacy known as quiche?<br><br>Although I do have a quibble with different counties having different suites of retro technologies with the changes right at the county line. To my mind, the differentiation would be more finely-grained, i.e., farms, industries, businesses and even households with early or mid Twentieth Century technologies right next to those with Nineteenth Century tech. Well, the households would group together by technology, methinks.<br><br>@RepubAnon, Ah! So the country would have a social system known as "fascist feudalism," eh? (Not fascist, nor feudalist but having the disadvantages of both and the advantages of neither.) Well Lakeland seems to be prospering in some form of a free enterprise system instead. Of course the businesses may be workers' self-directed enterprises, where the workers run the businesses and not some greedy upper-management team appointed by capitalists, which leads into my next comment directed at Gordon Cutler.<br><br>@Gordon Cutler, No business schools, no corporations, no school of economics, I like it! Although a case could be said that the old fashioned version of business school (i.e., secretarial school) and schools having curricula on how to run a small business would be there, and corporations only if they're small businesses with workers having a say in how they're run (see my comment to RepubAnon above) not the ginormous combines we have now. And economics? Well I'd have a heavy dosage of Marxian theory in any economics curriculum because Marx really did have good insights in how Capitalism progresses on the way to collapse and exhaustion.

So many features of modern life; plastics, aluminum (a major consumer of electric power), aviation -- could actually be beneficial if kept to a small scale. Even the heavy industry implied by the existence of 1950's style railroads, could be beneficial if kept as small as possible rather than grown to be as large as possible. But the growth paradigm will remain a stubborn case, I fear. At least that's what my reading in economics (which began for me in law school) has taught me. And I, too, like the tall ships. Wind power is a "natural" for moving stuff across oceans. The canal system was to have extended far beyond the Erie Canal. There are remnants of a canal system along the Maumee near Toledo and as far down into central Ohio as Celina and St. Marys. It was the railroads that killed them off, I think.

Perhaps you've been on a train that passed through? The train station there is tucked into an attractive location near the Huron River. When I last visited in 2004, I was fortunate enough to spend some time walking the trail at Furstenburg Park, on the Huron River and not far from the train station. Hard to say what the civil wars might have brought to the area before the story takes place, but it's got good bones and I can easily see it in 2065 with some streetcars - it's the right size for that - to carry folks around the city and with small, productive farms in the countryside beyond.<br><br>I am noticing the flow of the story as well, checking my guesses about how things may have taken shape and what Carr will find with what you've written in the story and your comments. I am also curious as to how "plut" is pronounced. As a chemist I know plutonium is pronounced with a long u like Pluto. When I heard plut pronounced in my head I heard it as a short u, as in the word puff. I would choose to spell the swear word as plute, pronounced like flute, to make the connection to plutonium clear. But that's a chemist's quibble.

Most clothes I wear have to be compatible with bike riding, gardening and other active pursuits, and practical for hot summers and cold winters.

One is that they have access to the net, but just don't have public wireless. The infrastructure required to blanket the countryside with wireless is not cheap, and likely wouldn't be a priority for them as a society, whereas it would be a big priority for the authorities back east, where the powers that be would want to make sure everyone has easy, continual access to government-approved propa-tainment, not to mention location-tracking of all citizens... for their safety, of course. <br><br>Possibly there is a way to access the net or something like it in Lakeland too, but maybe just not with a wireless device on a train. It was not all that long ago that if you wanted to get online you had to do it with a dialup modem and desktop computer. So-- assuming Lakeland still has landline telephony, which I suppose is entirely possible that it may not-- perhaps Mr. Carr can find a way to get online.<br><br>Then again, more likely they have decided to spurn the net altogether. That seems to me like a reasonable thing to do, if an objective cost/benefit analysis of the net is done. For all the talk that the net promotes healthy exchange of culture and ideas, etc, it seems to me that, in practice, the net's effect on culture is more deleterious than healthy. Rather than exchanging ideas, denizens of the net by and large tend to seek out echo-chambers of like-minded people who will reinforce, rather than challenge, their already-extant ideas (or else they seek out the numbing effect of overstimulating entertainment). And even where the net is not actively harmful, what little good it does do in the real world just does not justify its enormous cost in resources and labor (talking about the whole cost of the internet's infrastructure, not just a user's monthly access fee). <br><br>Presumably the fictional "metanet" works similarly, though probably a bit more tightly controlled and monitored by the authorities. <br><br>And that raises the question of whether the metanet is actually something different from the internet, or is it just the same old thing, repackaged and hyped up with a futuristic name?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c1210841299283639696 title="comment permalink">9/3/15, 2:47 PM</a><br><br>

If you don't have much electricity, and all your clothes aren't being manufactured in China, well, skirts and capes are much easier to whip up on your treadle sewing machine than coats and trousers. As technology gets simpler, so do clothes. With only a loom to play with, we would be back to robes made out of a rectangular piece of cloth. <br><br>And with less modification of climate (heat, cooling, cars), headgear becomes necessary, and bonnets are practical because you can tie them on. Also, no factories churning out sunscreen, plus global warming = bonnets, hats, or skin cancer. Although I have had some success recently experimenting with home made sunscreen. Did you know that carrot oil and rosehip oil both have quite high SPF values?<br><br>As for books, I don't know what the reasoning is there, but I can guess - once you start looking back to the past as a way to inform your future, you might find all sorts of goodies there - including its literature. This is how the ancient Greek classics became such a part of the canon of 'great' literature.

In Mr Carr's country, the reality of the end of global capitalism favouring the USA and peak oil etc. means that it is economically constrained. As such only a very small proportion of its citizens afford the benefits of high technological civilization. In that case how can it maintain the whole technological infrastructure that supports the 'veepad' and the mechanized agriculture etc.? <br>The problem with infrastructure in a declining economy, is that many kinds of it still have the same fixed running and maintenance costs however many people use it or not. This is particularly true of the Internet, which I understand is your argument as to why it will not continue to exist in the long run. So what I wonder if how in Mr. Carr's country it does, as far out as 2065, especially given the various dislocations that have happened in this story universe. Evidently mobile internet is widespread enough in his country for Mr. Carr to be surprised by its absence. <br>The economics of the build-out of Internet service, social media, is that it was very favourable for companies to invest in providing it to users, while numbers were rapidly growing, and its utility grew because of the network effect making it more useful the more people were on it. Those same economics could also work in reverse, with a death-spiral resulting from the same underlying infrastructure costs needing to be supported by a declining user base, and the rising costs driving ever more users away.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c5835441911658566052 title="comment permalink">9/3/15, 4:54 PM</a><br><br>

That is the single biggest reason that the United States is in such deep 'doodah' around the world--we just can't seem to understand why everyone on the planet does not accept our view of reality and our way of running the world.<br>And Scott Walker wants to build a wall between us and Canada!

The currency in the Lakeland Republic is the Lakeland dollar, symbol L$ -- as far as I know, all the republics in the former US have their own dollars, though the exchange rates can be pretty wild.

After Partition, UN peacekeeping troops were stationed in some parts of the former US for a while, and there were a couple of regiments from the Scottish Republic stationed in what's now Pennsylvania; some of their slang caught on with the locals.

It's only when that doesn't do the job that they start looking for anything more serious -- that, or just amp up the bluster. Carr's a smart man, and will get past the bluster in due time.<br><br>Peakfuture, I don't happen to know what the Republic of New England and the Maritimes is like in the fictive universe of the story -- my efforts are focused right now on figuring out the Lakeland Republic and the broader international context in which it functions. <br><br>Kate, the Amish are going to be a minor theme through much of the story -- they're important to part of the backstory, in particular. As for repairing soil, it's actually not that difficult using organic methods -- a couple of years of fallow with nitrogen-fixing weedy cover crops plowed under at the end of each season, and all the manure (human and otherwise) you can get composted, spread, and plowed in, will make a remarkable difference. (I've done this repeatedly on a very small scale with hideously depleted soil, and gotten excellent results every time.) That's not to say that the Lakeland Republic didn't have some hard and hungry times, but those are fading into memory as this story opens. <br><br>Tom, thank you -- the sense of baffled confusion is exactly what I'm trying to convey, since that's what the viewpoint character is feeling. All will be made clear in good time!<br><br>Zaphod, I take the train whenever I travel, so the descriptions are based on recent personal experience. Glad you enjoyed them!<br><br>Prizm, thank you. That's exactly what this narrative project is intended to do, and it's good to know that it's succeeding in at least your case. <br><br>Renaissance, Carr is from 2065 rather than 2015, and a lot of today's attitudes have bitten the dust in a fairly spectacular way. He's used to seeing people walk to work because he lives fifty years further down Hubbert's curve, and cars are for the rich; he doesn't disparage the houses because a lot of what well-to-do people live in is just as old. (In the older parts of the US, living in an old house is already a status symbol in many circles.) More on this as we proceed!<br><br>Architrains, the Lakeland Republic has the capacity to build electric traction motors, and a variety of other high-tech-for-1950 gear. They use diesel rather than steam partly because of the fuel efficiency, and partly because they've got plenty of farmland but their coal mines were exhausted in the early 21st century, before Partition, so vegetable oil is readily available but coal is not. As for hats, I wear a cap whenever I'm outside, so it comes naturally!<br><br>Zaphod, I read a few Cooper books when I was a kid but never really got into him -- my tastes tended toward science fiction and fantasy, the gaudier the better. Still, in 1846 he was a huge presence in pop culture. <br><br>Beneath, <b>write and illustrate your book</b>. Please. The kids who are about to learn how to read now desperately need something that will help them orient themselves to the real world -- that is to say, the world of limits, economic contraction, and collapsing infrastructure that we're actually living in -- as distinct from the unreal world of perpetual progress the media keeps on insisting is real. By all means don't make it didactic; make it a lively romp if you like -- but there are countless eager eyes and grubby fingers waiting to turn those pages.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c1698959470063160881 title="comment permalink">9/3/15, 6:40 PM</a><br><br>

My laptop and ‘old’ flip phone do not need internet connectivity for me to write notes. What am I missing here?</i><br><br>Hi<br> Perhaps I may have a different slant on that one. JMG is only extrapolating from current trends here. If you have a computer, then your operating system and its programs work inside the computer itself where they are all installed. Now there is a trend to make more and more of the computers operations work out on the 'Cloud' i.e. a bunch of servers located gawd knows where.<br> Thus the idea is that eventually all your files will be stored on the Cloud and not on your computer itself (where you may be eventually charged for storage) and your programs like your browser and office programs will do all their processing on the cloud and you will only see the results of the program displayed on your screen. This later bit fits in with a trend where you no longer buy such programs but rent them each on an annual subscription basis and will be locked out of your own files if you do not pay.<br> If your internet goes out then at least you can do some work on your computer or play a few games, right? Well, there is also a trend to have the operating system on the Cloud as well and not actually installed on your computer. This is what they use to call in the old days a "dumb terminal" where all you had was a keyboard and monitor hooked into some central computer. What this can mean is that if you have one of these computers and your internet is interrupted, your computer then becomes a desk paperweight and this is what is happening to Carr's veepad. Hope this answer helps.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c1514361688121321365 title="comment permalink">9/3/15, 9:27 PM</a><br><br>

I'll be talking about that as we proceed. <br><br>Patricia, no, I've just mentioned hats and raincoats, also blue checked dresses and bonnets, which might suggest a rather older date for certain styles! Stay tuned; clothing's going to be discussed in an upcoming episode. <br><br>Leo, I suspect it was a mix of fuels. You can process steel with any number of heat sources -- and of course they had ample amounts of steel for salvage, what with all those skyscrapers to take down. <br><br>Dammerung, does the internet actually promote noetic diversity? Not in any way I've seen. People in America, for example, had more diverse political views and were by and large better informed about current events before the internet than they are today. It's rarely noticed by the tech-obsessed that the internet is simply a way of doing various things that everybody did by other means before it was invented -- and if you don't have the cheap abundant energy and resources to spend on server farms and the like, you're better off using those other means, which are by and large less complex and more affordable. <br><br>Aron, glad to hear it. List some of 'em when you get a chance!<br><br>Adrian, I'm pretty sure that during the years when the Lakeland Republic was subject to an international embargo (and at least three attempts at regime change), Chicago handled a lot of surreptitious trade, smuggling Lakeland agricultural products to the dryland republics of the west and lumber, iron, and oil back across the border into Lakeland territory. Even though the borders are open now, Chicago still handles a lot of trade, and the Lakelanders see it as a necessary, convenient, and occasionally very desirable evil. Exactly how things will work out now that the borders are open is an interesting question. Yes, by the way, Asian carp are much eaten in Chicago and elsewhere around the lakes these days; there's a carp sandwich that's become one of the classic Chicago dishes. <br><br>Flagg, I don't know of any movement heading in that direction; you might consider starting one, since it's a good idea. <br><br>BoysMom, good. It's more complex than that, as I hinted in the intro, but we'll get to that. <br><br>Keystonekabes, ha! I think that that's the first time anybody's quoted William Jennings Bryan on this blog. <br><br>Sven, I know the feeling. The combination of cluelessness and a cancerously overdeveloped sense of entitlement promises to work out very, very badly here as well. <br><br>Hubertus, yes, we'll be discussing the military dimension at quite some length. Since Partition, the Lakelanders have had to deal with three attempts at regime change, one invasion, and a threat of nuclear bonbardment from the Republic of Texas, and you can expect detailed information about how those turned out. <br><br>William, well, in a sense...<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c4352102838162013484 title="comment permalink">9/3/15, 9:42 PM</a><br><br>

For what it's worth, though, I'd rate <i>The Golden Compass</i> on the level of toilet paper compared to <i>Treasure Island</i>. <br><br>Lynn, human and animal manure are far too valuable to waste in 2065 -- in Sandusky, as in most towns and cities, they go into municipal composting facilities, and are sold to local gardeners and farmers in the surrounding region. Urine is equally valuable as fertilizer. Graywater has various practical uses. Nothing just gets dumped into the lake. As for Cedar Point, as I noted in response to a question above, it was chopped up for scrap during the years when the Lakeland Republic was under an international embargo; now that steel is easier to come by, it's possible that somebody will rebuild the roller coasters, but we'll see. <br><br>Ed-M, "keech" is a Scottish term for excrement, and as I noted in response to a Scottish reader above, it got into common use in that end of North America because a couple of regiments from the Scottish Republic were stationed there as UN peacekeeping troops after Partition. As for the differences in technology, don't assume that Carr's out-the-window assessment tells you everything you need to know!<br><br>RPC, that's the one. Federal troops tried to blow up the tunnel during the retreat from western Pennsylvania, but didn't manage it. <br><br>John, all in good time!<br><br>Pantagruel, growth for its own sake works as long as you have an expanding supply of energy and resources. When that goes away, growth for its own sake becomes a self-defeating strategy, and eventually the economists will figure that out, too. As for the canals, one of the crucial factors there is that railroads, and then the interstate, received immense government subsidies with which canal shipping couldn't compete. We'll be discussing that as things proceed. <br><br>SLClaire, as noted in an earlier comment, different people pronounce it differently. I've heard "plutonium" pronounced with a short "u", almost a schwa, as well as lengthened out into a long "plooo." <br><br>Troy, the metanet is a more centralized, less flexible, more tightly controlled version of the internet -- it compares to today's internet roughtly the way that broadcast radio compares to amateur radio. They don't have it at all in the Lakeland Republic, for reasons that will be discussed in detail. <br><br>Sven, no, it wasn't unnecessarily harsh -- and dealing with Goldeman Sachs is enough to make anybody ready to condemn the human race wholesale!<br><br>William, good. None of it is accidental. <br><br>PatriciaT, nah, the problem is that veepads are entirely based on the so-called "cloud" -- all their programs, data files, etc. are on server farms, not on the veepad itself. It literally can't do anything but access the metanet, and requires that access to have any functionality at all. We're not there yet, but as you've probably noticed, a lot of computer types want us to head there.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c9152060323400287412 title="comment permalink">9/3/15, 10:09 PM</a><br><br>

Even in the 1950's and 60's, it wasn't common (in my experience) for women to wash their hair everyday, partly because it took so long to dry (unless you had a very short haircut). Blowdryers helped change that. There are probably no blow dryers or electric curling irons in Lakeland. <br><br>Re: corporations - the corporate form was created to limit the liability of investors for the debts and obligations of the enterprise. The limited liability encouraged entrepreneurs to take risks and allowed them to raise money from people who didn't want to risk anything more the amount spent on their stock shares. In the 18th century there wasn't another legal form that permitted this limitation of liability (altho some prototype corporations had other labels). Today we also have the limited liability partnership and its variations for the same purpose. The limitation of liability was such a foreign concept that statutes were needed to authorize the corporate form.<br><br>The corporate form and limitation of liability are not bad things in and of themselves. Like a lot of things in life, it depends on how they are used. Whether they exist in Lakeland will, I suspect, depend on whether there is a need for them.

For me, "loose" has an entirely different vowel sound that "lewd," and there is even a minimal pair: "loo" versus "Lew." But many other varieties of American English wipe the signifying difference out entirely, favoring the one or the other. I would expect that "plut," like "plutonium" and "Pluto," could be pronounced either way.

I concede that <i>Treasure Island</i> is better written (though my memory of the prose is rather hazy in both cases) and more exciting on the page-by-page level, but in its full sweeping arc His Dark Materials (if not <i>The Golden Compass</i> as a stand-alone book) has vastly more for the imagination to work with, including things that few other books have at all. (I suspect that our difference on this point has a lot to do with my having been a child when I read it- besides introducing me to several worlds of imagination, it was also one of the first really melancholy endings that I ever read. I also was too young to react strongly to the negative depiction of religion.)<br><br>While we're on the subject, where would you rate <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>, if you've read it?

I always assumed that collapse would take the shape of an Asterix comics : a few brave Gaulois tribes doing their own affairs in the forest under the nose of a giant but harmlessly stupid Roman occupier. Instead of cartoon characters and nice colors, here is what we turn out to have : blurring the lines across the political landscape, and the distinction between good and evil. Unarmed but ever powerful human tides, questionning every national identity. Disagreement between countries in the face of unprecedented stresses. Jobs disappearing progressively, and always the most disastrous policies for our economy. Monsters in the middle-East, but monsters of our nation's own making, coming back to attack our cultural sentiments.<br><br>The displacement of populations is happening in our countries right now, it just isn't very widely distributed yet. Like the future, kind of. Reality is pretty messy, it is here... We only manage to impose narratives upon it, afterwards, in retrospect, sort of. Countries have gone to war for less than all of this, and I feel rather queasy. Unlike the USA, Europe can deal with energy shortages, but it faces a lot of geopolitical problems : looming conflicts, populations displaced, epidemics...<br><br>2015 has been horrible in France so far, and the news these days view like dystopian science-fiction. Always, this feeling of both disbelief and abandonment, like I can see a great danger ahead but nobody has a credible solution and it's so easy to bury my head in the sand. And also, I wonder : if noone believes in the statu quo anymore, we will have to believe in something, but what are we going to choose to believe in ?<br><br>Whatever choices we take now, we WILL face traumatic disasters and harsh events. John Michael, for the journey to Retrotopia, you are quite right to skip straight to the sunny side of History, because the stormy side that will precede it can no longer be avoided right now.<br><br>@RepubAnon, Greg Belvedere : a society will not survive very long if it tries to develop around technological automation. The supposed damage inflicted upon society by automation destroying jobs is pretty absurd : if automation is so awesome, so powerful... what good has it done to help deal with the stresses inflicted upon the Western world over the course of this year ? Have the hoardes of drones solved the ISIS crisis ? For a long time to come, societies around the world will be subject to stresses even stronger than the ones we face right now. Just now the failures of automation are harsh, but think of what those failures would like 50 years from now !<br><br>So we all agree here that the future of work is human labour. The idea of a minimum wage supposes the framework of a nation-state. For a lot of people, that framework won't be available right away, and the biggest question will not be how much to be paid, or to be paid a minimum wage, but just to ensure a minimum usefulness of their labour to the people who matter most to them.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c1052562589634132180 title="comment permalink">9/4/15, 4:43 PM</a><br><br>

Maybe it's just a variation of <i>"all that glitters is not gold."</i><br><br>I'm licking my chops for the chapters when the protagonist arrives at his destination &amp; sees life on the other side up close &amp; personal.

Will have to make sure she's handy with a clipboard and revolver ...<br><br>As a Canadian it's amazing how wealthy this city/region was and how far it has fallen. The architectural beauty of the churches, schools, older houses shows that this was once a great place to live. It'll be fun to think of the tow-path as being restored to its former use as I walk it the next time we're over that way.<br><br>I've lived in a few parts of the US: South Eastern Louisiana, Central Connecticut and North East Ohio. What is always amazing is how rich the rich are and how poor the poor are. Truly mind-blowing to see the mansions and the shacks that people live in America. I think it's hard for outsiders to understand until you live amongst it yourself and see how a half dozen miles can separate incredible crime/poverty and wealth.<br><br>If I could make one suggestion would be the add a 'No Top Down Solutions to be Proposed' disclaimer on your comments sections. The way you divided up the counties was a stroke of genius, and anyone proposing a solution to America's troubles beyond the county level should be summarily ignored. I think Canadians are probably as guilty as anyone of running off lists of how America's problems could be solved in top-down manner. I think this is because historically that's how we have solved our problems.

That's what's going on east of the border, too: because everyone knows that sooner or later progress and economic growth has to resume, we've got to have metanet service all over, right? Even if we have to take out huge loans from foreign bankers, run the country into the ground financially, and sell off assets to satisfy the IMF, it will pay for itself eventually...won't it? <br><br>Ladybug/Ward, it takes a special kind of courage to stand there and fight for something you believe in when all the evidence suggests you're losing; thank you for doing that. For what it's worth, I think the nihilism is a temporary phenomenon. The same thing was pervasive in the US after the First World War, and then imploded in the face of the Great Depression. I expect a replay of that in the years and decades immediately ahead. <br><br>MigrantWorker, I mentioned that in last week's comments. The Federal government took to using plutonium-jacketed artillery shells in the last couple of years of the Second Civil War as a terror weapon -- a bunch of people were hanged as war criminals for that once Washington DC fell -- and street slang for the shells was "pluts." From that came "to plut" as a verb meaning, basically, to terminate with extreme prejudice, and then "plut" as a general expletive. <br><br>FLwolverine, curiously enough, we'll be seeing some interesting twists on corporation law as things proceed. <br><br>Tony, it's certainly no surprise to me.

I'm also looking forward to seeing where Carr alights, who he meets, what he is doing there, (&amp; BTW, what is HE wearing?).<br><br>As a former Costume Designer: ubiquitous hat-wearing waned and went out throughout the 60's, (apart from those outrageously fabulous zoot-suit and 'Shaft'-inspired "pimp-hats" complete with loooong quail feather, but they were really decorative only and came later as a reaction to the reaction). It probably WAS afforded by the auto-culture's lack of necessity and the mass availability of home blow-dryers, but it was also an acceptance of the social and sexual revolutions of the 60's, the move visually to more look (appear to BE) casual or "more real". A full rejection of the detested repressed, buttoned down Eisenhower 50's. I remember as a kid and teen in the 70's, we'd wash our hair on Sunday evenings only. Even this, my depression-era Grandmother thought was a bit of excessive luxury. As has been discussed here so often: There is always a peer pressure for folks to keep up, to be 'modern', (Progress!) or be seen as hopelessly left behind. In the early 70's, I remember that affecting the way people dressed themselves very acutely. Very few people under the age of 60 resisted.<br><br>You can never underestimate the pressures of 'fashion'. Some people in any given society definitely wear things that are impractical for the sake of looking good, (or what they perceive to be looking good). This has always been true, throughout human history. The desire to visually adorn and express ourselves has always been with us.<br><br><br>That said: In terms of the historical costumery, I think your imaginings are probably right on target. We often look to past eras for fashion inspiration and at some time those pioneer/prairie fashions WILL come back, (much to my chagrin) complete with gingham. Yikes. Not by far, my favorite period. The Bogart &amp; Bacall 1940's OTOH, YES!! I'm guessing those in retro-1940's are the trend-setters? The City-Mice? Wonder if the ladies draw their stocking seams on, up the backs of their legs as well? :) <br><br> I love hats and yup, working or walking outside they're at the very least extremely useful. Bonnets are hideous, IMHO, but they also are super functional as they don't take up any room on the side of your head that a broad brimmed hat does and the ugly chin-tie keeps it on in hard winds. (Is it really windy in the Lakeland Republic?) I'd hope my 2065 bonnet was at least something like toddlers' Ozzie-Cozzie flap-doodles. No, forget it. I'd still wear a nice moderately brimmed straw hat with a string tie. Bonnets are just too dowdy to be bourne. <br><br>I have to admit, (don't ask how I know this!) that long dirndl skirts are actually more comfortable to move around in, even if one is working in the fields than trousers, in addition to being far easier and fabric efficient to make, and so basic, it can be designed/adorned in countless styles. It has 'legs', longevity.<br><br>So, if this becomes a movie or play, can I costume it! ;)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c2492911090506340402 title="comment permalink">9/4/15, 9:04 PM</a><br><br>

The role of the household economy in national wealth will be coming in for some discussion as we proceed. <br><br>Sylvia, not at this point, though that was doubtless the case in the first decade or so after Partition. That said, there are a lot of plain, simple, comfortable dresses, not to mention blouses, skirts, shirts, trousers, etc., made of locally grown cotton and hemp, under those raincoats. <br><br>Pantagruel, hmm! I'll have to put that on the get-to list. I haven't read it. <br><br>BoysMom, <i>The Phantom Toolbooth</i>! I don't think I've heard anybody mention that book in decades, but it was a major fave of mine, not least because it contains more rancid puns per square inch of page than any other book I've ever read. Thanks for the blast from the past... <br><br>Cathy, of course they can say that straight-faced. Telling outright lies with a straight face is the essential job skill for corporate flacks. <br><br>Patricia, thank you!<br><br>Greg, I have real doubts about a guaranteed minimum income -- it sounds great on paper, but so did the social-welfare programs of the Sixties, which promptly turned into an Orwellian social-control system that has done immense damage to communities across the country. I'm also far from sure that it makes any kind of sense to subsidize the abolition of jobs, which is what that amounts to, at a time when going back from automation to human labor is arguably a necessary step. More on this as we proceed!<br><br>Robert, true enough! I've had fun noticing, for example, how the words "poor," "pour," and "pore" are pronounced in different parts of the US; where I grew up, they're pronounced exactly the same, but that's not the case in a lot of other areas. <br><br>Shane, er, you do know that I'm the head of a religious organization, don't you? I'd encourage you to be a little more careful about equating sexism, homophobia and racism with involvement in a religious tradition; that may be true of some religions but it's emphatically not true of all. <br><br>Peakfuture, the sea level rise in <i>Star's Reach</i> is 50 meters. You might also consider putting in the new national borders: Meriga extends from the Appalachians to the Missouri River; Nuwinga is the current New England; Genda is Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritimes; the Coastal Allegiancies extend down the eastern seaboard from Maryland south to where Florida used to be, up to the Appalachian crest; the Meycan empire has expanded into California, Texas, and those other parts of the Southwest that aren't completely uninhabited; there's an empty zone extending between the Rockies and the Sierras and Cascade ranges, which is as dry as the Sahara and a lot more polluted, and nobody lives there; and then there's the Neeonjin country, which runs along the coast from far northern California up to the Alaskan panhandle, and is inhabited by the descendents of Japanese boat people. I may be generating a map of that for an upcoming project, in which case you can certainly post it.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c3063119475492642108 title="comment permalink">9/4/15, 10:24 PM</a><br><br>

I didn't encounter Pullman's fiction until I was adult, of course, and I also encountered it after running across Pullman in another context, and that may well have prejudiced me against the novels -- I don't have a lot of patience with the pompous-jerk end of the atheist scene. Still, if the book made a difference to you when you were young, that's something in its favor. As for <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>, I did indeed read it -- it was published the year after I was born, and was hugely popular for the next decade or so. I liked it a great deal at the time, and still enjoy it -- also the three children's novels of Joan North, also popular around that time, which have similar themes but English settings and a less overtly Christian flavor. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, Europe's close to the cutting edge of things right now. I don't envy you the experience! I suspect, though, that Act II of the tragedy will be set more on this side of the Atlantic. <br><br>RCW, good. I expect to keep Carr well and truly flummoxed for a while yet, until he starts figuring out what's actually going on in the Lakeland Republic -- and then the fun really begins. <br><br>Stuart, thank you. I don't get a lot of people proposing top-down solutions these days, and when I do, they're usually helpful targets for criticism in a forthcoming post, so I don't want to chase them off quite so completely!<br><br>Caryn, there's a fair amount of wind in the Lakeland Republic, especially close to the lakeshore -- Chicago isn't called "the Windy City" for nothing. The dividing lines between quasi-1940s clothes and the gingham-dress-and-bonnet look are among the things that are more complex than they look -- stay tuned! -- but yes, you could probably costume this story very creditably if it ever becomes a movie, which it won't.

Two elements I see as particulary influencial. Thats both unfullfilled love and overhelming fear. With such do religions work all the time and quite substancially.<br>So shrines and temples with leaders will be found on every corner, if not in every house. What I see in particular about religion, is, that it adresses these two essential human needs with twisted turns more often (symbols, rituals, magic, etc.), instead of adressing it straightforward. I recognize that being due to the twisted nature of our emotions, mental turnmoils and social turbulences, in order to deliver a frame for stabilicing and relaxation.<br>Also I guess, that both intermingling and aparthaid will take place and form the evolving future religions.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c3929513708698248289 title="comment permalink">9/4/15, 11:05 PM</a><br><br>

It literally can't do anything but access the metanet, and requires that access to have any functionality at all. We're not there yet, but as you've probably noticed, a lot of computer types want us to head there.”<br><br>Hi John,<br><br>Down here at the edge of the world (Australia) the “computer types” I know, rather than pushing it, are getting a near hysterical attack of the conspiracy theories about the whole cloud thing.<br><br>And once they explain to the heads of the businesses they service that the “cloud” is not some magical, eternal place where their data will be safe and accessible for ever but rather just another set of servers, but carefully hidden so that (one guesses) there is no legal comeback if it all evaporates, the managers become rather nervous about the whole thing.<br><br>In fact, I have just spent about 3 weeks hard work trying to find away around the efforts of the supplier of our accounting software to force us into said “cloud” and onto the treadmill of two yearly $1k or $2k “upgrades”. Incidentally, I kind of wonder what these “upgrades” are supposed to do as software 4 generations out of date still does everything we want it to do.<br><br>Mind you, I can see why the software suppliers are wildly enthusiastic about the whole cloud thing: With their customers vital business records “on the cloud” that they control, their customers are, what’s the term, that’s it, “trapped like rats”.<br><br>There is also the even more serious question of what happens if something (war, national disaster, sabotage, EMP or whatever) happens to those servers or anywhere on the links between them and us. From what I know about loss of records of even single firms, I would guess that the loss of access to financial records for any reasonable amount of time by tens of thousands of Australian businesses would plunge Australia deeply into National Disaster territory.<br><br>To quote one of my Susan’s favorite pieces of wisdom “Efficiency is the enemy of resilience”.<br><br>Stephen Heyer<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c8221860673778086644 title="comment permalink">9/5/15, 6:05 AM</a><br><br>

No boys. Two generations of girls have been delighted by Patricia Coombs Dorrie series. If you are an Evangelical Christian, please allow me to point out that Dorrie and her friends are practitioners of white magic only. Also very good, and much enjoyed by my family have been the Magic Schoolbus series. The original books only; that travesty put out by PBS is to be avoided.<br><br>Some libraries and bookstores do still have collections of Newberry award winners. The middle years of the 20thC seem to have been a sort of minor golden age of historical fiction for juniors. Adam of the Road was the first "chapter book" I ever read, and it sparked a lifelong interest in history. Also of great merit is The Trumpeter of Crakow, and there were many others. Alas, school libraries of the kind into which I used to bury myself, are no more. There is no place left now for unpopular kids to hide. Boys might like the boy with dog in the wilderness tales of Jack Kjelguard. As for Walter Farley's Black Stallion series, I am afraid that horrible recent movie version rather put me off them.<br><br>Mr. Geer, might I respectfully suggest replacing cotton with linen when you get around to describing clothing. The mallow which produces cotton is, I believe, a swamp plant in origin, rather like celery. Ancient Egyptians grew it in the Nile Delta. It requires copious amounts of water, not to mention an unbelievable array of chemicals when grown in commercial quantities. Linen fabric is far more comfortable and durable than all but the finest cotton. The flax stems do need to be retted, by all accounts a nasty job, but one which could be shared by all, or some sort of pounding equipment ought not to be beyond the technology of your Lakelanders. I believe flax does not deplete soil like cotton does, and flax has a myriad of uses. For work clothes, do not forget hemp, wears like iron and, judging from the samples I have seen, would breath like linen. <br><br>Dear Caryn, I agree about the comfort and practical nature of long skirts, though they need not be dirndl. I also am intrigued by the medieval ladies costume of a shift, a sort of combination of lightweight slip and blouse, over which skirts, vests, coats etc. can be tied or buttoned. Bonnets need not be made from chintz; there are some rather nice ones shown in the most recent BBC Pride and Prejudice made in plain colors and substantial fabrics.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c5989242166150066863 title="comment permalink">9/5/15, 8:29 AM</a><br><br>

Much like Mr. Carr, many of the people I have met who had the good fortune to live affluently are completely clueless how the majority working class lives. Also, a variant of the same "immigration" is happening today, with people deliberately collapsing from middle class aspirations, giving up the desperate hanging on of middle class status so they have time to live like human beings. Some counties or towns are more amenable to dropping out than others, so these are the places where people like the immigrant family are going now. It makes me laugh when the mainstream media puzzles over why so many have quit looking for jobs, because the pay of most jobs is so miniscule that in adapting to that, a culture of refugees from the mainstream economy has grown, at least in my area. <br>Perhaps an early symptom of societal decline is when maintaining middle class life becomes so all absorbing of time and thought that people become inaccessible to one another.<br>@Doctor Westchester. I agree with Alex about the novels of Erich Maria Remarque, specifically A Time to Love and a Time to Die. Although it does not describe the rise of fascism, it follows the life of a German soldier on leave from the Russian front. More than anything I have ever read, this put me in the shoes of someone trapped in a truly fascist society. He and his contemporaries are all doomed, and they know it, and the book traces out the interior lives of people with no future. I read this several years ago and have been haunted by it ever since.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c7338817283790327179 title="comment permalink">9/5/15, 9:38 AM</a><br><br>

That said, the identity of some of the religious and para-religious communities in the Lakeland Republic, and elsewhere in 2065 North America, may startle some readers!<br><br>Stephen, in my experience bicycles appeal powerfully to a minority of adults and not so much to the rest of us. I don't doubt there are bikes wheeling down the roads in at least some parts of the Lakeland Republic, but the incessant attempts by bikophile readers to insist that bicycles ought to be all over all my imagined futures have made me a bit grumpy on the subject. Do you recall the people who insisted that I absolutely, positively had to put bicycles into <i>Star's Reach</i>? <br><br>As for moral superiority, er, when we still lived in Seattle, my wife worked in a neighborhood through which a lot of bicyclists rode. She was constantly being harassed and, in no small number of cases, almost struck by bicyclists who were infuriated that she would cross at the crosswalk, with the light, when they wanted to blow on through. I had similar experiences, though I tended to stay away from the main bike corridors when walking. I'd be a bit more sympathetic about bicyclists asking cars to share the road if bicyclists themselves were a little better about sharing it with pedestrians. <br><br>With regard to the lack of enthusiasm about the "cloud," though, I'm delighted to hear that. The whole "cloud" business strikes me as almost indescribably idiotic, and I'd assumed on that basis that of course the geekoisie would embrace it with squeals of delight. <br><br>Patricia, see my grumble to Stephen above, and my earlier grumble to Max Paris. I'd doubtless be more sympathetic to bicycles if so many of their devotees didn't push them on me with all the enthusiasm of Jehovah's Witnesses canvassing for converts. <br><br>Nastarana, I suspect there'll be a fair amount of cotton in the Lakeland Republic, if only because climate change will be rolling the cotton belt northwards, and there are a lot of people in the US who know how to grow it. It can be grown organically, by the way. Linen's an interesting possibility, though -- I'll have to look into its cultivation requirements -- and I know that one mother of a lot of hemp is grown there as a fiber crop. <br><br>Other Tom, I know enough people who think like Carr that it was really easy to figure out how what he'd say and do.

In my neck of the woods, there are two kinds of people who ride bicycles. One is in street clothes and street shoes, and is carrying bags or a backpack or has something in the basket, and is as likely to minority-poor, and students.

All decked out in bright-colored spandex and special shoes and expensive helmets and hunched over expensive bicycles - like the two I passed on a local street that was built as a residential street back in the day but became a local thoroughfare still with the same two-cars-passing, no-white-line design. Stopped at an intersection side by side as if they owned the road. Riding in a straight line past the parked cars without swerving no matter what was coming up behind them or towards them. Second in annoyance only to the Urban Commando vehicles I call "vehicles on steroids" on the same streets, hogging a lane and a half becuse they are the big dogs and the rest of us are mere pups. <br><br>But my reason, and that of a lot of others, I might guess, for missing them on the downside of Hubbard's Curve is that historically they were of great importance on the way up, in the US and in Britain - very, VERY much in Britain, can't speak for the Continent - and still are in many a partly or non-industrialized nation.

Historically here the windmills were used for pumping water, whilst rivers provided the more reliable energy for grinding/milling grains.

Fast flowing motion is one of the more effective ways people entrance themselves, and bicycles provide that sort of motion in spades.<br><br>Living near a college, I meet up with bicycles everywhere, and a good third of the people who I see riding them are clearly in some sort of trance or "zone." These "zoned" cyclists go much faster than cars are allowed to go.

While wooden frames are undoubtedly practical, given the right types of wood, the actual issue is the drive trains and the tires. The bicycle chain was a late 19th, early 20th century invention that requires some decent metallurgy and that wears out under constant use. Rubber can be grown using “Russian Dandelion,” in the climates common in the Lakeland Republic, and was apparently grown during WW II with a yield of 110 liters per hectare (sorry about not translating them to US terms). The Russians claimed 200 liters per hectare.<br><br>The more important issue is: why bother? Bicycles require decent roads unless you want your back teeth shaken out; they require a supply chain and similar. If you use them for work and shopping, they require parking space. There’s no reason that appropriate counties in the Lakeland Republic couldn’t manufacture bicycles, the real question is: why bother? I get the impression that there are some very smart people in the Lakeland Republic that think about the repercussions of various technologies that they might introduce.<br><br>On a different subject: as far as the cloud goes, there is a similar concern in the U.S. as well, although not as advanced.

Sorry, Apologies, but I'm doubled over with laughter at your response re: Bicyclists! I share your sentiments, at least here in Hong Kong. Maybe in a more wide open sane city it would be a good idea, but we're a VERY bike-UN-friendly city: gridlocked auto, bus and pedestrian traffic in town, and here on the south side: tiny twisty roads, HUGE buses that literally cannot fit onto their side of the road, lots of traffic and still more pedestrians. The cyclists here are all young adult, (Gweilo) serious looking fitness cyclists kitted out like Lance Armstrong. And yes, they get on people's nerves because they do ride aggressively. Although one can agree or disagree with the attitude, (I understand it at least), I just cannot for the life of me wrap my head around challenging a 3-5 ton BUS!! Regardless of one's attitude, if you zip quickly in front a bus, you're going to die! Must be something in the air pollution that disables one's sense of spatial awareness? Self preservation instinct? I don't know. It's a real noggin-scratcher.<br><br>Now OTOH: Those big Dutch Granny-Trikes with a basket or crate on the back for schlepping heavy stuff would be very handy in the country lanes of the LLR.<br><br>On another note: I certainly hope your predictions are wrong about the future / wasteland between the Rockies and the Sierras. That's our beloved homestead in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Maybe wishful thinking, but it has been home to largish populations of Shoshone, Bannock and Crow people for centuries. Then fur trappers, Tie-hacks and German WW1 POW's who decided to stay and make it their home after the war. Very fortuitously, the Fracking explorations have not found enough potential gas to bother with us. They did come through about 5 years ago, caused a big uproar, even set up 1 lonely rusted oil pump. It sits off a dirt track, up in the mountains, with it's head down, like a giant, forlorn mechanical crow, completely still and silent. (Incidentally, I did a few days of internet sleuthing to find out who owned that well and found it was a NYC hedge-fund group that was selling shares of it as the next big oil boom to suckers, er, clients. So, when you talk about a 'fracking-bubble, I know exactly why it's going to pop). But then they left. They found nothing. There WILL likely be a wasteland on the other side of our southern mountains, The Wind River Mountains heading into Pavilion and Pinedale. Whether or not my own family can get back there before the manure hits the fan, I hope it survives and thrives. People there have never really been 'un-collapsed'. But hey if the folks Back East think it's a wasteland, all the better; Keeps the riffraff out. :)<br><br>Nastarana: It's not the chintz that bothers me about bonnets. It's the shape that infantilizes a grown woman's head. They look adorable on babies, IMHO, not so much on grown-ups. Conceding it's a superficial style issue for me. :)<br><br>Greedily looking forward to next week's installment!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c60800109326297974 title="comment permalink">9/5/15, 6:24 PM</a><br><br>

The main difference is that when a bicyclist is a frackhole, he has only the power of his own legs to make that attitude become reality while a motorist has 2 tons mass and 150HP under his command. But as a matter of fact, it is the motorists who are more careless; the accident statistics for Germany show that in the vast majority of car/bicycle accidents, it was the car driver's fault. Same for car/motorcycles, by the way.<br><br>A practical problem will show up with the drive train, yes. No way without heavy industry. It bears worth remembering that the reason why bicycles were invented in the early 19th century was the bad harvest in 1816, caused by the eruption of the Tambora vulcan in 1815. Horses could not be fed. So why not just using horses which breed themselves without industry? It has already been mentioned that a bicycle is worthless without decent roads, so the road maintenance has to be added to the drive train problem. Externality?<br><br>Plus that there are really few people who will use the bicycle in bad weather, let alone winter, so the whole other transportation system has to be dimensioned to take up the bicyclists anyway. Or the city has to be planned in a way that eliminates the need for traveling longer distances ("city of short ways"). In that case, bicycles would not be a necessary component of the transportation system, but a nice-weather add-on, i.e. a kind of luxury.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c6584478341085760672 title="comment permalink">9/6/15, 1:19 AM</a><br><br>

From spring to autumn, it isn't cold here, but when it's raining, then it is usually also rather windy, which makes an umbrella pretty useless.<br><br>It was incredible, most of the trench coats available have a high plastics percentage and make annoying sounds. Disgusting. I did find one of pure cotton, but at 300 EUR, and the care label read "don't wash". What a bummer for a piece of clothing designed for dirt weather.<br><br>I ended up in an army store where they had US trenchcoats from the 1950s/60s at 50 EUR, including the removable woollen thermo liner. A friendly green, not olive drab, fine for civil use. The quality of that thing is stunning, they don't make something like that anymore. I had to think of an earlier JMG article with things becoming a little shoddier each year, and that becomes frighteningly obvious with such a huge time gap.<br><br>Another garment I'd expect to see in Lakeland are woollen ponchos. Easy to make out of a rectangular blanket with a slit for the head and a reinforcing collar. I've made such a thing for myself. With a belt aorund the waist, that's quite comfortable. In cold weather, long and narrow (140cm x 10cm or so) pieces of wool ends to wrap around the underarms plus a scarf do the trick.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c4223232208186805067 title="comment permalink">9/6/15, 1:28 AM</a><br><br>

Carr has been sent as a minor member of the clueless elite in an attempt to understand why people are so keen to move, because loss of the working poor will cripple the eastern economy. The endgame is likely an expansion of the LLR east, either wholesale by integration, or as an effective facsimile.<br><br>Re: Guaranteed Minimum Wage (or Universal Basic Income, whatever label you like), I agree with JMG that what is effectively a wage subsidy may not be long term a stable solution; however in our current (broken) economic arrangement it can make a lot of sense. Local produce and crafts are generally labour intensive and thus expensive in a high wage economy, struggling to compete with oil subsidised mass production. Now one can either remove the oil subsidy (by taxation for example, hitting the poor even harder), or one can subsidise wages. In trials of UBI there is generally a flourishing of local small business, because the constraints allowing a subsistence wage economy are removed.<br><br>Finally, on bicycles and why the LLR doesn't have many. The need for a significant number of bicycles is based on the transport premise of a suburban city structure - moving people large distances regularly. Thus the thought is that if cars are removed then bicycles must replace them. A true urban/rural structure, which it seems has developed in LLR, generally requires drastically less mobility as everything one needs on a daily basis is within walking distance (or serviced by public transport that the greater urban density can support). Hence the use case for bicycles is much weaker - short trips one walks, and longer trips, perhaps to the city, imply a purpose and movement of luggage or goods (shopping) for which bicycles are not suitable.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c585526906635860274 title="comment permalink">9/6/15, 3:50 AM</a><br><br>

If cycling is to work as a form of transport - such that it is used en masse by ordinary people - it seems to require dedicated infrastructure such as that seen in the Netherlands.<br><br>It’s also worth noting that one of the reasons reason road surfaces were improved early on were due to campaigns by cyclists - for example in late 19th Century Chicago, streetcar tracks were paved over with large boulevards for the exclusive use by bicycles!<br><br>http://www.roadswerenotbuiltforcars.com/chicago1897/ <br><br>It is possible that the decline in the status of the motor vehicle (which currently affords owners with privilege over lowly cyclists and pedestrians) may mean that such infrastructure may be desirable in the future but in a post-peak decline any investment in the same may simply not be available (and using the Netherlands as a reference may no longer be possible later this century due to sea level rise).<br><br>Even if a dramatic reduction in the presence of motor vehicles meant that existing roads could be used by cyclists without being killed, the surface of brick roads may make for an uncomfortable enough ride that a horse would be preferable.

'tis possible, but I would like to advance a different hypothesis. Who is running you down, in Seattle or Hong Kong? Parents with their children strapped to the back? Professionally-dressed women on the way to the office? Or men in brightly-coloured spandex and Lycra?<br><br>I'm willing to bet your picture of a cyclist is that last one -- he, the big-C Cyclist, does often behave as described. Much like the automotive-enthusiast gearhead, he gets a thill out of speed and an intellectual enjoyment of the technology. And when the built environment is as terrible for cyclists as it is in much of North America (and apparently Hong Kong, by the description), he's the only one willing to risk life-and-limb for the sake of a bike ride. <br><br>As an aside, more than just the built environment is set to discourage everyone else; a great deal of influence has been spent convincing the public in this country and elsewhere that the bicycle is a toy for children, not actually a tool of transportation; you unconsciously echoed this when you referred to most adults being disinterested. Being asked at stop signs why you lost your licence, having passers-bye ask how many DUIs you've accumulated, or speculate otherwise why you might be too stupid or incompetent to learn to drive. (This is apparently becoming prevalent in Asia as well, but the attitude seems well-nigh universal in North America.) <br><br>Now, let's go elsewhere. Somewhere where the culture treats the bicycle as a tool like any other, and where the built environment does not discourage it. Let us go, not to Seattle or Hong Kong, but to Copenhagen. About the same percentage of the population is the big-C Cyclist, wearing Lycra and riding aggressively. The rest of the population is comparatively indifferent; those are the parents with kids in the back, the professionals in suits, and everyone else. They, by and large, ride quite slowly, conservatively, and are not, in general, a threat to pedestrians. Exactly how in North America most people aren't aggressive-driving, hot-rodding gearheads, but still default to the car as a means of basic transportation, even if they would otherwise be uninterested in it. <br><br>Finally I should point out observation bias, something we regularly encounter as well: we overwhelmingly notice the cyclists you are forced to interact with, and especially remember the altercations. So in our memories, the wearers of Lycra find their numbers swelled beyond all proportion, because the more reasonable commuters have no reason to stick in our memory. In my town, I very rarely see a bicycle on the sidewalk; certainly less than one-in-ten. Even fewer cyclists are foolhardy enough to run red lights at major intersections. And yet, when there is public discussion, that's all most people seem to remember: one time I was almost ran over; one time I almost hit a guy. The bike-commuters they pass twice daily without incident? Most people deny they exist, because they have no reason to remember them, and, indeed, probably never noticed us in the first place.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c72524247800858263 title="comment permalink">9/6/15, 7:43 AM</a><br><br>

I've talked with young men who call themselves extreme drivers or maximum drivers, where the whole point of being on the highway is to hone your reflexes to the point where you can survive risky moves that would guarantee the death of most of their fellow young drivers.

After the bicycle it jumped to eight miles.<br><br> Bicycles were only possible because of advances in machining technology, specifically grinders, from coal chemistry. Drilling, cutting, milling, etc. we're all well known for at least a century before coal chemistry developed a hard enough shapible material for precision grinding. The precision machining from bicycles paved the way for cars and airplanes. (Arreys and Warr, or just Arreys, or just Warr, technological cycles or revolutions or something, Arreys and Warr do first rate work on energy and economic development. After William Stanley Jevon's they are the best energy economists that I know of and I read their earlier work and then forgot who wrote it.)<br> <br> Personal anecdotes: I worked in retail for 15 years and I noticed that people who biked to work had kick stands and bike locks and people who biked as an activity didn't. When I asked why they didn't have a kickstand or bike lock the answer was always "because of the weight." Now, if you are in the Tour de France I can understand that reasoning, but if your not it makes much less sense.<br><br> Bicycles are an Indisptutably efficient technology, and elegant technology, but their biggest champions are indisputably inelegant at conveying it to the rest of the world. Bicycles are efficient, low tech, reparable machines that have great utility and precision grinding and vulcanized rubber should be around for the long haul (the i cans had vi aniseed rubber 2,000 years ago from morning glories) . <br><br> Sorry about all aspects of the grammar and punctuation in this post. I'm writing from an iPad without a keyboard or muse and I can't correct things easily including the autocorrect which turns Incans into I cans and vulcanized into vi aniseed)<br><br>I'm currently living in Hangzhou, China and there are huge number of bikes. Most of them are functional. I only see spandex and no kickstands on the bikes of westerners. Hangzhou has a great bike rental system where people can check out a bike like one might check out a library book. When western bike enthusiast tell me that I need a bike and I mention the bike checkout they are always disappointed. <br><br> There is definitely some pathology going on with bike enthusiast, but don't let that get in the way of the excellent characteristics. Of bicycles as a technology.bicyles meet most of JMG's criteria for technologies the are useful and will last, but they fail in much the same way that the environmental movement failed in that they are popularized by shallow clueless jerks. <br><br> YES, I MEAN THAT. IF YOUR BIKE DOESN'T HAVE A KICKSTAND OR A BIKE LOCK THEN YoU ARE NOT HELPING YOU ARE HURTING.<br><br> My old boss was a bike enthusiast and he never once biked to work. Several other employees who were concerned about the environment or their personal health did bike to work. The boss would drive 50, 100, 200 miles to go on a nice bike ride, but he couldn't/wouldn't bike to work.<br><br> Again,I appolgized for the poor formatting, grammar, spelling, and structure of this post.

Also significant was the decline of the classic gent's or lady's bicycle in favour of the mountain bike, as the bicycle became less about utility and more orientated towards leisure.<br><br>I used to cycle to work on an old 3-speed gent's bike for practical reasons - it meant I didn't have to buy a car, but almost everyone else who cycled in was doing it to "get fit" or "do my bit for the environment". This was at a company that made diesel engines! Apart from the masochistic aspect, there's also the fact that bicycles are less regulated and systematized than automobiles, so you can get away with bad behaviour more easily e.g. taking short cuts, riding while drunk, endangering pedestrians etc.<br><br>I think bicycles nowadays are basically cars for people who need to express various anti-social behaviours - masochism, self-righteousness, risk-taking - that are no longer possible in actual cars.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c4008311292154553094 title="comment permalink">9/6/15, 10:43 AM</a><br><br>

I wonder if bikes will be more successful in places that already have a culture and infrastructure that supports them. I have lived in Copenhagen for 13 years and almost all bicyclists are regular people in regular clothes on street (as opposed to racing) bikes. We have dedicated bike lanes that are curbed both to the street and the sidewalk, and have their own lights at intersections. Most of us who are commuting, or grocery shopping, or transporting our children, are not very pleased by the speed and aggression of those who are charging by on racing bikes in their fancy gear - it's the equivalent of someone trying to drive freeway speeds in a crowded city and then getting upset with everyone else for being in the way. This lifestyle/fitness cyclist seems to be more evident when I've been in the U.S. and Germany. I would be surprised if bicycling died out right away here, but not in the U.S. - how many adults in the U.S. have a bike? Here I can count dedicated non-bike-owners, out of everyone I know, on the fingers of one hand. <br><br>As an aside, I too am interested in the clothing aspect, and have enjoyed reading the other (women's) comments on experiences with historic skirt lengths and such. I'm not an expert on historic clothing but I do sew, and I think when considering the idea of working people's clothes (as opposed to the upper classes), they were often designed to provide ease of movement in woven fabrics which would not have as much give as the knitwear and stretch fabrics we are used to today (and which would be difficult to sew by hand or with only a straight stitch on a treadle machine). From what I can understand, women of the working class wore corsets or bodices that were nowhere near as tight or shaping as those of upper class ladies; these allowed for a greater range of motion while providing a smooth line under clothing, supporting the trunk and back, as well as providing support to heavy skirts. Those with more knowledge on the subject please do correct me if I'm wrong, and if anyone can recommend some reading on the subject I would be grateful. I doubt that modern brassieres will make it down the slope, what with their techno power fabrics and elastic and metal wires. Interesting to see what takes their place...<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c8829383380338699640 title="comment permalink">9/6/15, 11:23 AM</a><br><br>

On these paths, in contrast to city streets, it is the cyclists who can and do inflict serious damage on the walkers, but are not at much risk of being killed themselves. <br><br>And, just as there are frackhole drivers who target cyclists, but many, many more drivers who are so entranced by the road or distracted that they don't even notice cyclists, so on these joint-use paths there are a few frackhole cyclists who seem to target walkers (as if the paths ought to be for them alone) but many, many others who seem so entranced by their fluid, fast movement that they barely notice walkers, or notice them only at the very last minute. Many of these cyclists have wonderful, high-tech cycles that are almost completely silent in their running, and also hardly ever seem to have even a small bell or a horn to warn walkers of their approach from behind.<br><br>So (for me) it's not primarily an issue of cyclists versus motorists, as daelach framed it. It's also -- and for me, it's primarily -- a question of entranced people on wheels and the ease with which fast, fluid wheeled transportation (either car or bicycle) can put a person in a "zone" or trance. That's what makes both things -- motorized vehicles and bicycles -- so obnoxious and problematic to me.<br><br>As a man in his 70s, now somewhat deaf and not capable of rapid evasive movement, I simply can't use these walking/cycling paths safely any longer. So I'm really tickled off at those cyclists who fly down the paths in near silence at the greatest speed they can manage, oblivious to us walkers. And, I am very sorry to say, they are close to 75% of all the cyclists I encounterd on those paths when I was a bit younger and could still walk on them safely. In my own experience, the percent of frackhole drivers I encounter on the roads is far lower than that 75% of cyclists.<br><br>Even though the bicycle is far superior to the automobile in terms of its impact on the environment, in my own limited experience it seems a very toxic technology in its effects on the psyche of cyclists. (To be fair, commuter cyclists are rare here. Most of our roads in RI are so hideously narrow and convoluted that commuter cycling is quite risky even on relatively untravelled roads. In my much younger days when I cycled to work, I was nearly killed several times by cars, always on little-traveled roads.)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c7781630611664978186 title="comment permalink">9/6/15, 12:53 PM</a><br><br>

The geekoisie word gave me a good belly laugh.<br><br>I also chuckled while reading about cyclists. I myself enjoy riding bikes and would love to be able to cimmute by bike. Still, I've seen the exact negative behaviors mentioned here. <br>Riding swiftly along does feel empowering. Maybe many cyclist take this feeling too far and get over confident. Also, articles written to cyclist encourage them to hold their space on the road to keep auto drivers aware of cyclists having space. That accounts for some of the behavior, I think. Last, people are frequently selfish while driving cars OR bikes. They will cut off and dangerously pass slower people. So, I think they behave similar to aggressive car drivers and choose to disobey what slows them down, yet uphold laws against bigger vehicles. <br>The spandex clad road bike riders are called roadies by commuter cyclist and mountain bikers. There is some overlap of a biker being involved in more than one type of cycling, but more often people stick with one type of style. Roadies don't even wave at commuters sometimes. To be sure, there are commuters in street clothes that act like they own the road too. Especially the fashionable not helmet wearing types that feel too beautiful for a helmet. They're daring and they ride daringly. <br><br>As for tech questions, tires do require rubber and wheels require precision ball bearings.

If you want to travel on a bike, conservation of momentum is your friend. Urban traffic controls (stop signs and traffic lights at short intervals) are designed for cars and are intensely frustrating for cyclists. It's almost as if they were deliberately placed to make bicycle transport as difficult as possible.I understand the temptation to blow through those stops.<br><br>Some towns here have been putting together a flatland path for muscle powered town transport (pedestrians and cyclists) and already the pathway is not big enough for the both of them. They are proposing to put in bumps and kinks to slow down the bikes. The obvious remedy of segregation has not occurred to them, I suspect because the planners neither walk nor cycle.<br><br>We also have a heated struggle over recreational trails in the parks. The mountain bikers want to be allowed on all the trails and they want to go fast. The equestrians and hikers share trails amicably, but cyclists run down the hikers or force them off the trails; they spook the horses and cause serious accidents. The walkers and horse riders are calling for law enforcement on the trails, as if we had the money for such a thing.<br><br>I agree completely with Mike that mass bicycle transportation works better with dedicated roadways just for the bicycles. I'm for that though I don't ride myself. It's hard to retrofit a city built for automobiles; you have to remove street parking or ban private autos from the route, and the merchants don't like that.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c3116114776238399895 title="comment permalink">9/6/15, 2:14 PM</a><br><br>

Until recently I used a folding bike to be less obtrusive on the morning train, but I eventually found that my older full size bike is much kinder to my knees. Now I take light rail so early that there is plenty of room, and ride all the way home in the afternoon. None of my bikes have kickstands so I usually lean them against the wall or stow them under my desk. I do feel a rush from cycling (which I think is from endorphins, not pheromones) and look forward to the ten mile ride. I only wear spandex in cold weather - under my trousers - but I used to wear it for weekend rides in Central PA.<br><br>There are a lot of jerks on the road, and some of them ride bikes. I have noticed what I call the dick move. If I am riding slowly for some reason, some fellow will overtake me then coast right next to me with pawls ratcheting. This has happened often enough that it can't be accidental. I used to say 'Hi' when I passed other cyclists, but some took that as a challenge, so now I just ignore them.<br><br>A recent issue of Streetsblog points out that one failure of American bike planning is that it is dominated by men with expensive bikes. Recreational riders want separate bike paths, but women are vulnerable on isolated paths, and everywhere I want to go is on the regular streets.<br><br>I've offended a few people by noting that auto drivers in the wealthier neighborhoods to the East of I-83 are far more territorial than the poor people to the West. But they are. So I ride through mostly black neighborhoods. <br><br>Road bikes do require pavement for fast riding, but I have ridden the dirt paths of the C&amp;O canal on a 3 speed Raleigh with 1 1/4" tires. That was before mountain bikes were popular. So I don't think the decline of roads will kill off cycling right away. Recreational cycling will likely take a hit for a lot of reasons, one being exposure to assault and theft, which is already happening here in Charm City.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c1383632394928803286 title="comment permalink">9/6/15, 2:32 PM</a><br><br>

No way without heavy industry. It bears worth remembering that the reason why bicycles were invented in the early 19th century was the bad harvest in 1816, caused by the eruption of the Tambora vulcan in 1815. Horses could not be fed. So why not just using horses which breed themselves without industry? It has already been mentioned that a bicycle is worthless without decent roads, so the road maintenance has to be added to the drive train problem. Externality?”<br><br>Actually, there is a much bigger problem, one that modern people completely disregard: Horses take a huge amount of land to support, especially away from the temperate rich soil lands, and a lot of time each day brushing, fitting and removing harnesses or other gear, looking after hooves and such like.<br><br>Only those of us who have both small properties and horses realize this. Our 3½ acre fairly fertile creek flat property can about support one horse or a large family of humans working it Chinese style, not both.<br><br>I used to wonder why the upper middle classes in the great cities traded their horses for the early buggy type cars as soon as they became reliable (about 1907, see footnote). It is only after we got horses that I realized just how expensive it would have been to feed, house and care for a horse, in, say, the London of 1907. Then there is a whole weary process of harnessing it into the buggy every time you want to go out and the opposite when you come home, plus all the other care.<br><br>It’s so much easier and cheaper to just crank over your little horseless buggy’s engine and off you go.<br><br>I suspect that there will be more motor vehicles than we suppose in the future, but they will be small, light, simple, extremely fuel efficient machines designed to move competently but slowly (by our standards) over roads we would scarcely acknowledge as such.<br><br>FOOTNOTE: These days most people just don’t realize how good the cars of 1907 were on the roads they were built for. It’s well worth while looking up the 1907 Peking to Paris Race or better yet watch the 2006 TV series from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reconstructing it.

Certainly the technical requirements are no more insurmountable than those for modern automatic, military gunsmithing, and those are today made in small workshops all over the world. Simple hand tools such as good vises, lathes, cutting bits, and files are all that is needed, along with accurate and precise measurement instruments. Salvage should take care of the metal needs for some time out. <br><br>As far as road requirements are concerned, even if limited mostly to well-developed areas, they would have invaluable uses. I believe it was George Bernard Shaw who complained about the modern young urbanites in his time jetting about on their bicycles.<br><br>Given the resource conditions under which they were operating, I daresay bicycles probably saw very useful, maybe even decisive, service during the civil wars after dissolution, and it would not be surprising at all if some of those workhorses were still in use or at least enjoying collector's status during Mr. Carr's visit. Ask any Vietnamese.<br><br>JMG, one of the things I value most about train travel is the ability to move about and get into very interesting conversations with fellow passengers.

Bicycles are <i>currently</i> very popular here, and quite visible on weekends. In fact the area has become a mecca for road biking and mountain biking. <br><br>But there's a catch: Almost 100% of the bicycling is by wealthy weekenders for entertainment purposes. <br><br>Now, admittedly, motorcycles are still feasible in 2015, and that's actually one of the two most common forms of practical transportation. But here again there's a catch: 90% plus of the motorcyclists are young men under 35 years old.<br><br>Since most of the local residents can't afford automobiles, the common form of transportation is the bus, locally called the "coletivo". And the local nickname explains why: Local culture is much more community oriented ("collective") than late industrial US culture, so the solution for transportation in a scarce context is to use a collective community vehicle. As a result, bus service in this fairly poor rural community is far superior to that available in the wealthy part of Oakland, CA where I was staying just a few years ago. <br><br>Sometimes, in a time of scarcity, the best way to achieve a goal (such as transportation) is to come together as a community and do it as a collective, rather than trying to do it on your own.<br><br>So back to bicycles: In a way, bicycling is the most solitary form of transportation available. Even motorcycles here are <i>often</i> ridden by two people (and occasionally, dangerously, by entire families). But bicycles are always ridden alone.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c8806642988972525758 title="comment permalink">9/7/15, 5:08 PM</a><br><br>

It's usually safer (because one can often avoid the paved traffic lanes entirely), it's more weather-resilient, and there's less equipment and hence less expense and less risk of breakdowns or theft.

He's going on invitation, and intends to ask a lot of questions - that seems to be a major raison d'etre for his trip. He has 'connections', and access to raw/pre-sanitised data. The border guards knew he was coming, implying they knew who he was - evidently he has a high enough profile to be recognised. I wonder if 'immigrant dad' knew him (by reputation) also, adding an edge to his antagonism over Carr's cluelessness?<br><br>My gut feel is some kind of journalist or media presenter. This ties into the privileged access to informations and 'contacts', as I'm guessing his home country is authoritarian enough for the media to be a branch of the State (in practice if not in name). Ditto maybe for some kind of academic in the social sciences, or less likely, a freelance author of some kind.<br><br>However, the dark horse in the race is that he may be an emissary or ambassador for the incoming Montrose administration (staff level rather than politico level) making first overtures for some adjustment to the diplomatic relations as previously practiced by the Barfield regime. <br><br>As for the question of religion which has been hinted at above, I look around at all the self-reliance going on and can't help but wonder if the western border of the republic extends as far as Utah? Or perhaps some mass migration from that far west due to war, drought, persecution, or some combination of the three, a Great Trek Back East, maybe???<br><br>Whilst it's fun to speculate, I'm confident it will be more fun letting the tale unfold in due course...<br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c2437848668278413763 title="comment permalink">9/8/15, 1:39 PM</a><br><br>

Not seen much any more, but they introduced me to ancient British and Roman history. What is more important for the theme of this blog - they introduced me to the idea of an Empire in decline. Much of Sutcliff's work examines the moments when part of the Empire is failing, and this fascinated me as a child. I was a survivalist from a very young age, always planning what I would do when the government fell, and the barbarian hordes swarmed in:) They also showed me how to balance historical voices, because there are also stories from the viewpoint of the barbarian hordes.<br><br>Sutcliff's novels are good reads even for adults; her historical voice is flawless. I would particularly recommend The Capricorn Bracelet to introduce the idea of a failing Empire to children (maybe 10+). It consists of 7 short stories set over the period of AD61 to AD383 in Roman Britain, linked by a Roman legionary bracelet, handed down over the generations. <br><br>Now, back to the bicycles..<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c8490757146212085676 title="comment permalink">9/8/15, 7:54 PM</a><br><br>

I said it wasn't economic to do so on any regular basis. That's the difference between a hobbyist and someone who does the same craft as a means of making a living - the hobbyist can afford to put more effort into something than it's actually worth.<br><br>To expand on that: a typical bicycle chain has over a hundred pieces of four different kinds. Where do you get them? Do you start by smelting the iron ore and tempering it into the actual alloys you need, or do you get sheet metal, rods and two different sizes of tubing, all of the required quality, from a supplier and then cut them to size? If it's the latter, those production facilities already exist and have markets that make it worth while to fabricate the supplies. If it's worth while to fabricate the supplies, and there's a demand, it's going to be worth while to set up some kind of mass production facility for the final product - especially since the basic technology - the chain itself - is used rather heavily in mechanical systems to transfer energy.<br><br>This is the supply chain thing that JMG talks about. It's not as easy to work out the details as it looks on the surface. It's not just bicycles. Consider letter-press printing. I suspect that everyone who does it orders their type from a foundry rather than creating the dies for each character and then casting the type themselves.<br><br>I'm looking forward to see how deep JMG goes into the various technological suites.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-view-from-moving-window.html#c4548853714677907066 title="comment permalink">9/9/15, 6:46 AM</a><br><br>
