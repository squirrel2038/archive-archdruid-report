<div class=MsoNormal>
I went back to the hotel for lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The wind had picked up further and was tossing stray randrops at anything in its path; my clothing was waterproof but not particularly warm, and I frankly envied the passersby their hats. For that matter, I wasn’t happy about the way that my bioplastic clothes made everyone give me startled looks. Still, it was only a block and a half, and then I ducked back inside the lobby, went to the glass doors to the restaurant, stepped inside. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Maybe a minute later I was settling into a chair in a comfortable corner, and the greeter was on his way back to the door, having promised the imminent arrival of a waitress. Stray notes of piano music rippled through the air, resolved themselves into an unobtrusive jazz number.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It took me a moment to notice that the piano was actually there in the restaurant, tucked over in a nook to one side. The player was a skinny kid in his twenties, Italian-American by the look of him, and he was really pretty good. Some musicians play jazz laid-back because the fire’s gone out or they never had any in the first place, but now and again you hear one who’s got the fire and keeps it under perfect control while playing soft and low, and it’s like watching somebody take a leisurely stroll on a tightrope strung between skyscrapers. This kid was one of those. I wondered what he’d sound like with a bunch of other musicians and a room full of people who wanted to dance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As it was, I leaned back in the chair, read the menu and enjoyed the music and the absence of the wind. The waitress showed up as prophesied, and I ordered my usual, soup and sandwich and a cup of chicory coffee—you can get that anywhere in the post-US republics, just one more legacy of the debt crisis and the hard years that followed. I know plenty of people in Philadelphia who won’t touch the stuff any more, but I got to like it and it still goes down easier than straight coffee. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Lunch was good, the music was good, and I’d missed the lunch rush so the service was better than good; I charged the meal to my room but left a tip well on the upside of enough. Then it was back outside into the wind as the kid at the piano launched into a take on “Ruby, My Dear” that wouldn’t have embarrassed a young Thelonious Monk. I had plenty of questions about the Lakeland Republic, some things that I’d been asked to look into and some that were more or less a matter of my own curiosity, and sitting in a hotel restaurant wasn’t going to get me any closer to the answers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Outside there were still plenty of people on the sidewalks, but not so many as earlier; I gathered that lunch hour was over and everyone who worked ordinary hours, whatever those were here, was back on the job. I went around the block the hotel was on, noting landmarks, and then started wandering, lookng for shops, restaurants, and other places that might be useful during my stay: something I like to do in any unfamiliar city when I have the chance. There were plenty of retail businesses—the ground floor of every building I passed had as many as would fit—but none of them were big, and none of them had the sort of generic logo-look that tells you you’re looking at a chain outlet. Everything I knew about business said that little mom-and-pop stores like that were hopelessly inefficient, but I could imagine what the banker I’d talked with would say in response to that, and I didn’t want to go there. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The other thing that startled me as I wandered the streets was how little advertising there was. Don’t get me wrong, most of the stores had signage in the windows advertising this or that product or doing the 10% OFF THIS DAY ONLY routine; what was missing was the sort of corporate display advertising you see on every available surface in most cities. I’d figured already that there wouldn’t be digital billboards, but there weren’t any billboards at all; the shelters at the streetcar stops didn’t have display ads all over them, and neither did the streetcars; I thought back to the morning’s trip, and realized that I basically hadn’t seen any ads at all since the train crossed the border. I shook my head, wondered how the Lakeland Republic managed that, and then remembered the notebook in my pocket and put my first note into it:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Why no ads? Ask.</i></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I was maybe six blocks from the hotel, by then, looping back after I’d checked out the streets on the west side of the capitol district, and that’s when I tore my shoe. It was my own fault, really. There was a cluster of moms with kids in strollers heading down the sidewalk, going the same direction I was but not as fast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I veered over to the curb to get around them, misjudged my step, and a sharp bit of curbing caught the side of my shoe as I stumbled and ripped the bioplastic wide open. Fortunately it didn’t rip me, but I hadn’t brought a spare pair—these were good shoes, the sort that usually last for a couple of months before you have to throw them out. So there I was, looking at the shredded side of the shoe, and then I looked up and the first store I saw was a shoe store, I kid you not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I managed to keep the ripped shoe on my foot long enough to get in the door. The clerk, a middle-aged guy whose hair was that pink color you get when a flaming redhead starts to go gray, spotted me and started into the “Hi, how can I help you?” routine right as what was left of the shoe flopped right off my foot. He started laughing, and so did I; I picked the thing up, and he said, “Well, I don’t need to ask that, do I? Let’s get you measured and put something a little less flimsy on your feet.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I take a men’s medium-large,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He nodded, and gave me the kind of look you give to someone who really doesn’t get it. “We like to be a little more precise here. Go ahead and have a seat.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So I sat down; he took the remains of the shoe and threw it away, and then proceeded to use this odd metal device with sliding bits on it to measure both my feet. “9D,” he said, “with a high arch. I bet your feet ache right in the middle when you’re on ‘em too long.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yeah,” I said. “I take pills for that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“A good pair of shoes will do a better job. Let’s see, now—that’s business wear, isn’t it? You expect to do a lot of walking? Any formal or semi-formal events coming up?” I nodded yes to each, and he said, “Okay, I got just the thing for you.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He went away, came back with a box, and extracted a pair of dark brown leather shoes from it. “This brown’ll match the putty color of those clothes of yours pretty well, and these won’t take any breaking in. Let’s give it a try.” The shoes went on. “There you go. Walk around a bit, see how they feel on you.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I got up and walked around the store. My feet felt remarkably odd. It took me a moment to realize that this was because the shoes actually fit them. “These are pretty good,” I told him. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Beat the pants off the things you were wearing, don’t they?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“True enough,” I admitted. He rang up the sale on some kind of old-fashioned mechanical cash register and wrote out a bill of sale by hand; I paid up and headed out the door. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Half a block down the same street was a store selling men’s clothes. I went in, and came out something like an hour later dressed like one of the locals—wool jacket, slacks and vest, button-up cotton shirt, and tie, with a long raincoat over the top, and my ordinary clothes in a shopping bag. I’d already more than half decided to pick up something less conspicuous to wear before my shoe got torn, and money wasn’t a problem, so I bought enough to keep me for the duration of my stay, and had everything else sent back to the hotel; the bill was large enough that the clerk checked my ID and then called the bank to make sure I had enough in my account to cover it. Still, that was the only hitch, and quickly past. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
From the clothes store I headed back the way I’d come, turned a corner and went three blocks into a neighborhood of narrow little shops with hand-written signs in the windows. The sign I was looking for, on the recommendation of the clothes store clerk, was barely visible on the glass of a door: S. EHRENSTEIN HABERDASHER. I went in; the space inside was only about twice as wide as the door, with shelves packed with boxes on both walls and a little counter and cash register at the far end. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
S. Ehrenstein turned out to be a short wiry man with hair the color of steel wool and a nose like a hawk’s beak. “Good afternoon,” he said, and then considered me for a moment. “You’re from outside—Atlantic Republic, or maybe Upper Canada. Not Qu<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>é</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">bec or New England. Am I right?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Atlantic,” I said. “How’d you know?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Your clothes and your shoes are brand new—I’d be surprised if you told me you’ve been in ‘em for as much as an hour. That says you just came from outside—that and no hat, and five o’clock shadow this early in the day; I don’t know why it is, but nobody outside seems to know how to get a proper shave. The rest, well, I pay attention to lots of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>little things. How’d you hear about my shop?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">I told him the name of the clothing store, and he nodded, pleased. “Well, there you are. That’s Fred Hayakawa’s store; his family’s been in the business since half an hour before Eve bit the apple, and his clerks know a good hat, which is more than I could say for some. So are you in business, or—”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Politics,” I said. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Then I have just the hat for you. Let’s get your head measured.” A measuring tape came out of his pocket and looped around my head. “Okay, good. Seven and a quarter, I should have in stock.” He ducked past me, clambered onto a stepladder, pulled down a box. “Try it on. The mirror’s there.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">With the hat on, my resemblance to a minor character from a Bogart vid was complete. “Absolutely classic,” the haberdasher said from behind me. “Fedoras, homburgs, sure, they’re fine, but a porkpie like this, you can wear it anywhere and look real classy.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“I like it,” I agreed. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Well, there you are. Let me show you something.” He took the hat, slipped a cord out from under the ribbon. “In windy weather you put this loop over your coat button, so you don’t lose it if it blows off. If I were you I’d do that before I set one foot outside that door.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">I paid up, accepted the business card he pressed on me, and got the loop in place before I went back outside. The wind had died down, so the hat stayed comfortably in place—and the adverb’s deliberate; it kept my head warm, and the rest of the clothes were pleasant in a way that bioplastic just isn’t. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">You know what it’s like when some annoying noise is so much part of the background that you don’t notice it at all, until it stops, and then all of a sudden you realize just how much it irritated you? Getting out of bioplastic was the same sort of thing. In most countries these days, everything from clothes to sheets to curtains is bioplastic, because it’s so cheap to make and turn into products that the big corporations that sell it drove everything else off the market years ago. It’s waterproof, it’s easy to clean—there’s quite a litany, and of course it was all over the metanet and the other media back when you could still buy anything else. Of course the ads didn’t mention that it’s flimsy and slippery, and feels clammy pretty much all the time, but that’s the way it goes; what’s in the stores depends on what makes the biggest profit for the big dogs in industry, and the rest of us just have to learn to live with it. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">The Lakeland Republic apparently didn’t play by the same rules, though. The embargo had something to do with it, I guessed, but apparently they weren’t letting the multinationals compete with local producers. The clothes I’d bought were a lot more expensive than bioplastic equivalents would have been, and I figured it would take trade barriers to keep them on the market. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">I kept walking. Two blocks later, about the time I caught sight of the capitol dome again, I passed a barbershop and happened to notice a sign in the window advertising a shave and trim. I thought about what S. Ehrenstein had said about a proper shave, laughed, and decided to give it a try.</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">The barber was a big balding guy with a ready grin. “What can I do for you?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Shave and trim, please.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Your timing’s good. Another half hour and you’d have to wait a bit, but as it is—” He waved me to the coatrack and the empty chair. “Get yourself comfy and have a seat.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">I shed my coat, hat, and jacket,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>and sat down. He covered me up with the same loose poncho thing that barbers use everywhere, tied something snug around my neck, and went to work. “New in town?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Just visiting, from Philadelphia.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“No kidding. Welcome to Toledo. Here on business?” Instead of the buzz of an electric trimmer, the clicking of scissors sounded back behind my right ear. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“More or less. I’ll try to talk to some people up at the Capitol, make some contacts, ask some questions about the way you do things here.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Might have to wait a day or two, according to the papers. Did you hear about this latest thing?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Just that there’s some kind of crisis.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">The scissor-sound moved around the back of my head from right to left. “Well, sort of. Tempest in a teapot is more like it. Something in the budget bill for next year set off the all-out Restos, and so one of the parties that’s had Meeker’s back says they’ll bolt unless whatever it is gets taken out.”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Restos?” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“You don’t have those out your way, do you? Here the two political blocs are Conservatives and Restorationists; Conservatives want to keep things pretty much the way they are, Restos want to take things back to the way they used to be. Okay, lay your head back.” I did, and he draped a hot damp towel over the lower half of my face, then went back to trimming. “Used to be about half and half, but these days the Restos have the bigger half—all the rural counties going to lower tiers, and so on.”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Hmm?” I managed to say. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Oh, that’s right. You probably don’t know about the tiers.”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Mm-mh.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“It works like this. There are five tiers, and counties vote on what tier they want to be in. The lower the tier, the lower your taxes, but the less you get in terms of infrastructure and stuff. Toledo’s tier five—we got electricity, we got phones in every house, good paving on the streets so you can drive a car if you can afford one, but we pay for it through the nose when it comes to tax time.”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Mm-hmm.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">He took off the towel, started brushing hot lather onto my face. “So tier five has a base date of 1950—that means we got about the same sort of services they had here that year. The other tiers go down from there—tier four’s base date<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>is 1920, for tier three it’s 1890, tier two’s 1860, and tier one’s 1830. You live in a tier one county, you got police, you got dirt roads, not a lot else. Of course your taxes are way, way down, too.” He put away the brush, snapped open an old-fashioned straight razor, and went to work on my stubble. “That’s the thing. Nobody’s technology gets a subsidy—that’s in the constitution. You want it, you pay all the costs, cradle to grave. You don’t get to dump ‘em on anybody else. That’s what the Restos are all up in arms about. They think something in the budget is a hidden subsidy for I forget what high-tier technology, and that’s a red line for them.”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Mm-hmm,” I said again. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>“They’ll get it worked out. Go like this.” He drew his lips to one side, and I imitated the movement. “Meeker’s handled that sort of thing more’n a dozen times already—he’s good. If we let our presidents have second terms he’d get one. Now go like this.” I moved my lips the other way. “So they’ll drop whatever it is out of the budget, or put in a user fee, or come up with some other gimmick so that everybody’s happy. It’s not a big deal. Nothing like the fight over the treaty, or the time ten years ago when Mary Chenkin was president, when the Restos wanted to get rid of tier five, just like that. That was a real donnybrook. This close to the Capitol, you better believe I got to hear all sides of it.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">He finished shaving, washed the last bits of soap off my face with another hot wet towel, then splashed on sone kind of bay-scented aftershave that stung a bit. A brush darted around my shoulders, and then he took off the neckcloth and the poncho thing. “There you go.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">I got up, checked the trim in the big mirror on the wall, ran my fingers across my cheek; it was astonishingly smooth. “Very nice,” I said. While I got out my wallet, I asked the barber, “Do you think Toledo’s ever going to go to a lower tier?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
“People are talking about it,” he said. “I mean, it’s nice to have some of the services, but then tax time comes around and everyone says ‘Ouch.’ Me, I could live with tier four easy, and my business—” He gestured at the shop. “Other than the lights, might as well be tier one. A lot of businesses run things that way—it just makes more sense.” He handed me my change with a grin. “And more money.”</div>

For some years I have been beginning to practice Green Wizard skills - gardening, preserving, cooking real food from local sources. Your 'Green Wizardry' book was a catalyst for me - for some time I had been uneasy about the impact of my own modern life on the planet, and for social justice reasons. Your book, plus your wonderful 'Butlerian Carnival' helped me to sit up and say, "Hang on, I can live my life any way I want."<br><br>So over the past year or so I have been quietly downshifting. I cannot say that I have worked my way down any of those tiers yet, but that is certainly my intention. I have mostly stopped buying new stuff, and when I do, I buy from exactly the little Mom-and-Pop stores that Mr Carr patronised this week. I stopped using the tumble dryer and the dishwasher, and next am planning to sell my lawn mower and get a push mower instead. I am walking a lot more. My family watch so little television that if I got rid of it, they might not even notice. We have reintroduced board games and reading aloud for entertainment and my teenagers are loving it. By Christmas I will be a proud chicken-owner, and I plan to learn to sew this year. I am nearly finished my first ever crochet project, a large granny-square blanket, a craft that I got my mum to teach me and my daughters this year, and which was mostly made with left-over scraps of wool from friends and garage-sales.<br><br>And I have never been happier or more content with my life. I just wanted to let you know that your posts and books are not just academic for me, that I treat them as a weekly DIY-life-manual. Retrotopia is not a pipe-dream, it's a way of life we can all quietly insist on. This week I am annoying the tax department by jumping through all of the considerable hoops they have set up to discourage people like me from lodging an actual paper tax return, instead of doing it on-line, and will be sending in my tax forms by mail, with actual stamps. <br><br>We all have choices that we make every day. Some are convenient, but lead to a life that we mostly don't actually even want, some require more thought, planning and effort, but take us to a place we would really rather be..<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c5519820561616490969 title="comment permalink">9/30/15, 7:02 PM</a><br><br>

My Midwestern great-grandmother, born 1900, used a woodstove for all cooking and heating in town until the late 1970's and regularly burnt trash in a dedicated metal barrel.

I grow chicory here and consume it as a summer salad green (the bees enjoy the flowers too), but haven't quite yet decided to experiment with the dried chicory roots as a coffee substitute which was done back in the day. But then as you may be aware, I've recently cracked the secret to growing a single tea camellia - which is a tropical plant - outside of a green-house in this cooler southern mountain climate. I'm feeling pretty smug about that win too. ;-)! Mind you, a very hot summer may come along and destroy that possibility. The tea camellia is producing lots of new growth right now. I suspect with a bit of global warming, you may be able to grow it in the future in areas that receive only a very light frost in the US. The plant doesn't like any frost at all, as it is a bit of a light weight compared to the flowering camellia's here which put up with heat, frost, drought...<br><br>So, our protagonist has been asked to look into some things - you never quite mentioned by whom though? No, please keep your plot secrets - although I do suspect that he is also a part time spy or an old school style intelligence gatherer.<br><br>I hear you as I'm very dubious about expenditure on advertising. I read somewhere recently that down here we suffer from the highest per capita expenditure on advertising in the world, but then I avoid it like the plague.<br><br>Yes, I'm sure he takes pills for that ache - you'd be surprised just how often I note that people actually do think like that now, when the actual long term solution requires adaption to circumstances and a holistic approach, rather than just popping a pill.<br><br>Just for your interest, I gave up buying and wearing synthetic garments years ago. Wool and cotton are my mainstays, but the editor also enjoys silk, cashmere and alpaca. The funny thing is that people are grasping for the latest stuff - which is usually cheap, synthetic and disposable, and they don't realise just how good and cheap the natural materials actually are. In all seriousness, those materials should be well out of my price range, but they are way under-valued due to the mysterious workings of the invisible hand of the market.<br><br>Haha! Too funny. What a great idea those tiers are. Very clever indeed. Is that your original idea? Excellent work. I deliberately chose to live in a tier 2 zone here (the dirt roads are actually maintained by the council once or twice per year when there are just way too many potholes). There are very little services provided here at all and I love that because it means I can't get scammed by the centralised service vultures (the local council property rates / taxes are exorbitant though). Even then, sometimes a centralised vulture will levy a charge on the property here and the annual water rates that I have to pay makes me furious because they do not contribute one single service to this property.

My maternal grandparents used Luzianne RT Coffee with Chicory(red can or bag) all their lives. I fondly remember eating breakfasts that my grandmother cooked on the big wood cook stove and the wonderful aroma of the strong coffee that I learned to drink black and truly enjoy! To this day, I will only drink coffee with absolutely nothing added to it. (I know you grew up in the Northwest, but I have never understood what Starbucks does to something so pure as coffee.)<br>I did not learn until I went to school that chicory coffee was looked down on as something that poor people drank. This was a holdover from the Civil War when people substituted many things for coffee, which became virtually unavailable during the blockade of the southern ports. Apparently as soon as people could go back to coffee they shied away from anything that revealed that they could not afford pure coffee.<br>The irony of all this, however, is that during my lifetime anyway, the coffee with chicory has never been cheaper than regular coffee. Indeed, the coffee my grandparents used was somewhat higher than the national brands. The J T Riley Coffee Company of New Orleans is the purveyor of Luzianne RT Coffee and I do not know how far from NO it is sold. We still have it in some stores here.<br><br>If it is true that "clothes make the man," I think our protagonist is about to be "re-made".<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c3240740599031468584 title="comment permalink">9/30/15, 9:52 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c7045157611320327933></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/04668008998392414263 rel=nofollow>Joe Roberts</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>The obvious fact occurred to me when reading this installment that some of these people would actually be alive <i>today</i>. If S. Ehrenstein were 65 in 2065, he'd of course be 15 years old now. I picture him as a high-school sophomore at the end of September 2015, let's say in an upper-middle-class suburb of Toledo, playing Call of Duty on his PlayStation 4 and aurfing Wikipedia for homework hints on his his Apple 32GB ipod touch 5th generation with retina display, while simultaneously FaceTiming on his iPad with a friend visiting Orlando and texting with an insomniac former exchange student who's back home in Belgium. How does a kid who grows up like that -- a spring-break trip to Spain with his Spanish class, trying different types of sushi at the local 24-hour Kroger, a 3,400-square-foot home with lawn service, an Amazon Prime subscription so he can order nearly anything that fits into a box and have it within two days (and if that all seems too affluent, pick and choose from the list or tone it down one notch) -- how does a kid like that grow up to be content as a <i>haberdasher</i> (when does he even learn the word <i>haberdasher</i>?), talking about fedoras and hamburgs as if he were in a high-school production of <i>Our Town</i>? <br><br>I hope you get my drift. In no way do I mean to suggest that I think progress is an upward arrow (I read your blog because I mostly agree with your premises), but I wonder at how people who have lived in this world, as awful as much of it is -- even the goodly majority that doesn't have anything like what my hypothetical young Ehrenstein has -- I wonder at how contented they really would find themselves with 1950 (let alone 1830) levels of technology and lifestyle. Because everyone in your story seems so <i>happy</i>.<br><br>I also wonder what going back to 1950 means for (to use that much-used phrase) social issues. I'd be curious if there's been regression in LGBT rights in the Lakeland Republic, or what the status of abortion is. I know I'm probably overthinking this, but I wonder if Carr's observation of Ehrenstein's "nose like a hawk's beak" -- as though someone from 2065 Philadelphia would find such a nose the least bit noteworthy -- has a sinister overtone vis-a-vis events in some of these republics, in terms of Jews, the scapegoats during so many other of history's economic rough spots.<br><br>And this is too long already, but <i>that</i> got me to thinking about how 50 years really has had the potential to mark an incredible societal break, more so than the 1965 vs. 2015 Toeldo differences I mused on in an earlier comment. Think of a well-off, largely secular Jewish family in the eastern part of Berlin just before the First World War -- 1913, let's say -- whose family members have known and do know various degrees of casual anti-Semitism but basically live a great, comfortable, integrated German life, speaking German obviously, entrenched in commerce and the cultured life of the city. Fifty years later, in 1963, and the family members and their descendants who are alive, if any of them are and very possibly none of them are, will be living in the US, Israel, or maybe the UK, totally dissipated, speaking other languages, with completely different mindsets. Their former neighborhood, now part of East Berlin, is full of ugly tower blocks that look nothing like the houses of 1913, behind an uncrossable <i>wall</i> in a divided city, in a puppet state of the Soviets -- not one bit of which would be imaginable in 1913. So, that's one real-life fifty-year trajectory.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c7045157611320327933 title="comment permalink">9/30/15, 10:05 PM</a><br><br>

I've been wondering how the technology could be uniform throughout an entire county.

That's exactly the point, of course. <br><br>Ray, I do indeed. <br><br>Siliconguy, that is to say, you weren't paying attention. What tier you're on doesn't determine what technology you're allowed to have -- that's up to you. It determines what kind of infrastructure is paid for out of public funds, i.e., your tax dollars. If you're in tiers five or four, you can have as modern a refrigerator as you like, since both tiers have electricity. Below that, you can still have it, as long as you're up to generating your own electricity. A bit clearer? <br><br>MindfulEcologist, the Lovecraftian tale is in the publisher's squamous, rugose hands even as I speak, and -- ahem -- the sequel's on the upside of 20,000 words. I'll post when there's news. <br><br>John, heh heh heh. Stay tuned...<br><br>Jo, thank you. It's comments like yours that make it easy to keep hammering on the keyboard week after week. <br><br>Hawkcreek, our entire society is riddled with overt and covert subsidies -- that's the brontosaur in the room, the thing that nobody wants to talk about that defines modern American life, and I've come to think that it's also a primary reason why so many wildly uneconomical activities retain a veneer of plausibility. More on this as we proceed!<br><br>Eric, glad to hear it. <br><br>Howard, that was part of the hard times and economic crisis Carr mentions offhand over and over again. After Partition, the formerly United States discovered that they had to learn how to produce goods and services again. As for trade barriers, the US used trade barriers to build its own industrial economy -- why do you think we discourage all other countries from doing the same thing? <br><br>MayHawk, here again, your tier level just determines what services are provided by public utilities, not what technology you can bring it. By 2065, btw, antibiotics no longer work because bacterial resistance is universal; sorry. <br><br>Stacy, true enough. Wool is good for clothing; plastic isn't. <br><br>Misty, glad you liked that. You're right that I probably should have mentioned socks -- no doubt he'll ditch the bioplastic socks and underwear promptly enough. <br><br>Eric, good. It's based on my experience with nylon, polyester, etc., which I find loathsome. <br><br>Dan, of course -- and we'll be discussing that. Even the all-out Restos who live in tier one counties and wear poke bonnets and straw hats end up bringing in bits of sustainable technology; what's evolving in the Lakeland Republic is not a return of the past but a bricolage of technologies from many different eras.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c1528904393839936961 title="comment permalink">9/30/15, 11:11 PM</a><br><br>

As for what date the Restos want to return to, that depends on the Resto -- that's why there are five Restorationist and three Conservative parties in the legislature. The rest, why, stay tuned...<br><br>Unknown, or any number of great jazz pianists in their early years. I'm partial to Fats Waller and Thelonious Monk myself. <br><br>Myosotis, you're welcome. It's only because of the absurd amount of energy we waste in today's America that people can allow themselves to forget why good clothing matters. <br><br>Mister R., heh heh heh. Stay tuned!<br><br>Usedkey, you're welcome and thank you!<br><br>Dan, not at all. Dark age communities had some form of local policing (the local baron and his warband) and dirt roads; tier 1 has local policing and dirt roads. The technologies used by individuals were different but the infrastructure was the same. No, "tier zero" will come up for discussion later on...<br><br>Cherokee, yes, the tiers are as far as I know original to me. More generally, the role of public subsidies for technology hasn't gotten anything like the exploration it deserves -- most of the really toxic technologies we have today exist only because they receive gargantuan direct and indirect subsidies, and of course the wealth that goes into those subsidies is no longer available for other, more productive uses. Nobody notices the connection; that should change. Yes, I'd meant to congratulate you on the camellia -- hurrah for tea! -- and trust that you've got plenty of cool beverages on hand for the heat wave. Here it's 60 degrees F. and raining, with a cat-3 hurricane due to hit Monday; I'd send you some rain if I could!<br><br>Patricia, we'll be hearing more from the piano player. As for war, no argument there; things could get very ugly very fast. <br><br>Joseph, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Caryn, why, yes, he'll be visiting a bar sometime soon. He doesn't drink before five in the afternoon. As for shoddy clothing and shoes, it's that bad for the poor in the US; it hasn't yet metastasized up to Carr's income level, but it will. <br><br>Jim, as already noted, sure -- the tier level just determines what services your tax money provides via public utilities. Of course most people who live in tier one counties aren't interested in mesh networks, you know. <br><br>Notes, well, there you are. Me, I'd probably go for tier 3 or 4, for similar reasons, but I know a growing number of people for whom off-grid, low-tech living is a lot more appealing. As for polio, we'll get to health care down the road a bit. <br><br>FiftyNiner, don't blame me for Starbucks! Coffee gives me migraines, so I'm not a fan regardless, but the sticky overpriced goo that Starbucks sells would appall me even if I liked coffee. As for chicory, good -- it's grown as a significant crop in 2065 in the Lakeland Republic, as well as the Confederacy and most of the other former US republics, precisely because the collapse of the old economy left most people unable to afford coffee beans, and the habit stayed in many places. I like roasted chicory brew a great deal, also roasted dandelion root tea, and hey, it's my utopia! ;-)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c1396442500610237460 title="comment permalink">9/30/15, 11:35 PM</a><br><br>

Sam Ehrenstein would indeed be alive today, and about fifteen; there are still family-run haberdashery shops in quite a number of cities today, and they've gotten a new lease on life in recent years with the popularity of hats among the hipster contingent. So Sam may be wasting time with the vapid electronic gizmos you've named, and daydreaming of going into some exciting career in vaporware rather than following his dad into the hat trade -- but let's look at the future ahead of him. The economy's gone to bits by the time he graduates from high school; the higher-ed bubble has collapsed by then, too, and so college is out for everyone but the rich; in 2021 the US digital infrastructure gets shredded by Chinese hackers, and never really recovers; in 2024 the Second Civil War begins, and he's either drafted into the US Army or he joins one of the ragtag rebel groups that eventually become the Alliance. Four brutal years later, the war is over, the surviving members of his family are living in a refugee camp in Ontario or in makeshift shelters in northern Michigan because Toledo got bombed hard during the fighting, and the Midwest is in ruins. Then there's Partition, followed by the debt crisis, followed by an economic crisis at least as bad as the Great Depression -- and because natural gas and other heating fuels basically aren't available any more, lots of people want hats again. Is Sam going to help his father get the old haberdashery business going again, learn the trade, and become one of the fixtures of the Toledo hat trade? You bet he is, because reality has intervened. <br><br>As for social issues, I've been trying to lay down a trail of bread crumbs to point in the direction this is going: a brown-skinned woman on the border guard, an African-American banker, an Italian-American jazz pianist, and so on. <i>Older technologies do not require older social mores</i> -- much less older prejudices. Carr noticed Sam Ehrenstein's nose the same way he noticed the shoe salesman's pink hair (notice how this tags the guy's ethnic roots) or Melissa Berger's height -- he's a guy who notices things, and in the highly multiethnic post-US North America of 2065, if you're in politics, you notice ethnicities among many other things, because it's no longer "important white guys" vs. "everyone else;" the different ethnic communities have clout, and paying attention to who's who is essential for successful politics in a multipolar society. More on this as we proceed!<br><br>Tony, when your colleague from Armenia starts coming back from trips home with good sturdy shoes to sell here, let me know!<br><br>Toro, er, do you know who Thelonious Monk was? If not, and you like jazz, look him up and prepare to have your mind blown. <br><br>Claire, exactly. The last thing the Lakeland Republic (or anyone else) needs is an overgrown homeowner's association enforcing rules on what technology you can have. It's both easier and fairer to limit the tier system to infrastructure and public services, and link that to the tax code, so that those who use the least pay the least.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c8565158226456920164 title="comment permalink">9/30/15, 11:59 PM</a><br><br>

In any novel or short story written now, whenever or wherever that was, so much is taken for granted, by ancient romans, shakespearean English, midwesterners in 1920s. I find it al so unnatural writi g 'out of present time', backwards or forwards' as the whole point of storytelling is character development, which isuniversal, eternal. Technological state of society is just paper wrapping around true substance of what it means to be human. That said, as life is moving so quickly, that wrapping changes color and shape so quickly it needs some paying attention to. You do this well. This is written crisply, reminds me of Harry Potter books. Tech, worldview takes up lots of space, people are superficially described. The haberdasher is terribly like the magic wand salesman. <br><br>I wonder how difficult it would be for me to write a deeply felt short story which lasts the test of time, you know people watch a film and see the hair style, car types, etc. and know immediately steretypical social types and problenms ofthe era and adjust or turn away. Maybe it has to do with being half poet. Hamlet is still most seen play globally. Once tier one is universal perhaps my complaint here will be superfluous as technological choice will be unknown and character study will be all that matters in a relatively static world. Even then climate change will destroy civilizational basis so maybe my hope of middle ages or ancient type basic tech at iron age agricultural level with written stories and large settlements is wishful thinking. Perhaps oral story telling memorized by blind musicians will suffice. <br><br>Children's books make bestsellers when they're on a roll, you might try your hand, if you want to make ready money.I bet a trilogy for preteens to early teens would roll off your pen easily.

I am a first time commentator but long haul reader of your blog and books. I came here via J.H. Kunstler. Unfortunately his latest opinions seem to have more to do with reactionary bad temper than any basic truth or logic. Maybe he is becoming a grumpy old man. I'm glad we have your blog for a more civil discussion.<br><br>I wonder if there are certain elements in the resto's who would like to see social mores and prejudice go back to pre-1950 as well as tech subsidies? Hopefully a minority only. <br><br>Since reading your stories I've wanted to write future fiction for my own part of the world in the UK. But it can be hard to imagine the future. At first I started by imagining a future and then trying to shoehorn events into the intervening time that would explain said future, but this may be putting the cart before the horse. <br><br>In my house we have been trying out your ideas about retro living and they are a success. We scour the car-boot-sales and charity shops(you would call them something else in America maybe)for retro 2nd hand items that have stood the test of decades and even centuries.

If you want to know how reversion from today's high-tech world feels like, try retiring on an inadequate pension. You adapt and make the best of it. I'm drinking a coffee/chicory mix and wearing a knitted cap as I write this. Later I'll walk down to the shops (no car) and buy fresh veggies (no freezer or microwave). Tomorrow I'll hand wash my laundry (no washing machine). It keeps me healthy and my weight in check.<br><br>On shoes: I would have gone for a stout pair of lace-up boots like gentlemen in Edwardian photos wear, given the unpaved roads. But maybe lounge shoes are <i>de rigueur</i> for civil servants and the like.<br><br>On shaving: In the 1970s I got beaten up in Scotland (long story). With my eyes swollen shut I wasn't confident enough to shave around the stitches on my face, so I went to the local barber. He was an older guy and said I was lucky, most of the newer barbers didn't know how to shave customers, and he gave me a decent shave, meticulously leaving the stitches untouched. <br><br>I'm interested in where Lakeland gets its power from. So far, no mention of wind turbines or solar panels. 1950s power was mostly coal-fired, but no mention of the characteristic cooling towers either. I can imagine the Tier 1s getting income by charging the Tier 5s for the transmission lines across their county, or renting out marginal land for wind turbines. (I'm guessing that if you can have diesel-electric locomotives, you can have wind turbines. Similar technology.)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c1759681518580698784 title="comment permalink">10/1/15, 2:05 AM</a><br><br>

You just cannot say evict a tenant for falling behind on the electricity bills if the tenant himself produces any electricity that he uses! And so by extension losing access to (self-produced) electricity does not imply a risk of losing access to heating, water, shelter etc. People might still look down on you, and I imagine in Lakeland Republic they do, but this does not amount to a cascading catastrophic failure of all living arrangements.<br><br>Second, high taxes in top tiers would act to push some of the businesses out to lower tier areas - or, from those lower tiers' perspective, to pull those same businesses towards them. I wonder if for some counties the choice of lower tiers is not, among other ways, a way of saying: "let's live with less so that this tractor parts factory opens in <i>our</i> county".<br><br>MigrantWorker<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c5168102352258601281 title="comment permalink">10/1/15, 2:36 AM</a><br><br>

When my daughter went to daycare as a two-year old, the teachers all commented on her apparently unusual awareness of how to walk on a public street, e.g., stay on the sidewalk, don't push in front of people, etc. In a pre-1950 world, I think there would be relatively few strollers out and about unless you had a serious baby boom in full swing.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c1899894562322693515 title="comment permalink">10/1/15, 6:06 AM</a><br><br>

Memory lane and all.<br><br>Having been raised in "tier 5," I remember a lot of those shops. Each had its own look, and its own SMELL. Shoe stores really smelled like leather and polish. Barber shops like the aftershave and the hair tonics they used. Even haberdashers had a smell... I'm not sure what it was, but it was distinctive. I would know I was in Bill's Hat Shop blindfolded! <br><br>The largest store in a tier 5 paradigm would be a local department store. Somewhere there would have to be wholesalers, and entire workforce mostly known today by its absence. They would be 3 or even 4 stories, and they had elevators with "starters." Those were folks who drove the elevator, and announced the floor and what departments were on each. The more prosperous departments stores had escalators... much fun for a young lad. <br><br>Even in the 50's there were horse &amp; buggy delivery wagons, and carriages. Of course, municipal codes required the horse to have a bag on its rear end to minimize waste removal. Some waste still managed to fall out, so there were street cleaners. Our town was one of the first to have electric street lights, and even the lower middle class neighborhood we lived in was lit up by lamps which had lids but no glass enclosure - just the bare bulb. It was picturesque in winter during snow storms as the snow piled up on the top of them.<br><br>To me, most of the memories do involve smells. Coal powered steam engines in particular had a sulpherous smell, reminiscent of gun powder.<br><br>As you can see, I am enjoying the tour of Lakeland.

Anyway, a very entertaining episode as well as being thought provoking. I do have two questions though.<br> Does the Lakeland Republic still retain States as an intermediate level of governmental administration or does it go direct from County to the Republic. The reason that I ask is that sometimes someone here in Australia suggests that we should abolish the States and just have Local Councils to Federal Government. Trouble is no-one trusts that the Government would not try to impose a one-size-fit-all Council model over a continent-size country.<br> Second question is that I understand the Tier system and how that does not limit the amount of technology that any citizen chooses to pay for personally. However, how do taxes for the Republic come into the equation. Even having a 1950s army does not come cheap and taxes would have to be somehow levied evenly across all Counties. A Goods and Services Tax could not work due to the differing technological standards among the five Tiers of Counties so how does this work?<br> After being a long time follower of the Archdruid Report website, I find that my thinking has changed so that I am thinking more in terms of whether more 'advanced' actually means more 'effective' as well as the principle of making sure that technology is actually suited to purpose. I saw a video clip on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjlCVW_ouL8 which illustrates these principles. Yes, I know that it is from an old sci-fi television series but nonetheless the points illustrated seem valid here.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c9106538865768418697 title="comment permalink">10/1/15, 7:23 AM</a><br><br>

But today you really cracked me up wit Mr Carr remarks on his good shoes ... being myself from a line of shoemakers by my father side, when I read his remark on his good shoes lasting a couple of months I just thought to myself "That guy never seen , even more wore, a pair of good shoes in his life" ;) . <br><br>That said, let me drop some quibbles:<br><br>- My own experience, being from more warn climates than yours, points out other issues with "bioplastic" clothes: normal plastic fibers suffer photolysis under strong solar light, so you can't really expect them to last more than a couple of years ( if that much ) in Mediterranean climates or sunnier ( I've seen that a lot of times: the fibers literally start breaking apart ). Natural fibers also suffer from that, OFC, but due to their slightly diferent chemistry, they tend to last longer. Other issue is that plastic fibers could be made to have similar properties to the natural ones, but that would need both more work and money, so, the manufacturers run from that. <br><br>( Continues ... )<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c5536095203855846801 title="comment permalink">10/1/15, 9:33 AM</a><br><br>

Continued )<br><br>- On your side point about antibiotics ... well ( I'm speaking as a biochemist here, so you'll see a lot of ranting about the medical and agriculture industries usage of antibiotics. Caveat emptor ;) ), the whole antibiotic crisis is pretty much a scam. <br><br>Sure, antibiotics lose potence as "natural" selection kicks in, but antibiotics were never meant to be used as a kill'em all solution to be delivered at blind at every infection, or worse delivered in bulk or sprayed in top of our food productions. What is waning in efficience is that, and not actual antibiotic usage IF done in case by case basis and after careful analysis. OTOH most of the antibiotics are poison to pretty much every life form ( say, stuff like tetracicloamides or even the granddaddy of the antibiotics, the sulfamides ), so they will always work simply due to the fact you're bigger than a microbe and you need more of the stuff to get killed by it. Note that is pretty much the same principle than current chemotherapy and has the same drawbacks: has to be custom tailored for every patient ( thus requiring actual medical skills and work , gasp ) and is a dreadful experience for the patient.<br><br>That said, there are other aproaches to bug killing, like using custom phagocytes ( basically bacteria that eat other bacteria ) on bacterial diseases, as it is done extensively in the ex-Soviet Union countries since the 70's of the last century, that don't suffer so much of the natural selection issues bulk usage of antibiotics have. But they all require actual diagnosis, custom tailored solutions and most of the times doctors preparing ( or in case of a new disease, developing ) their own medicines is situ. And I really don't need to tell you how both the education and medical industries feel about teaching doctors to be competent, careful in their diagnosis and able to develop and prepare medicines on their own :P<br><br>In other words, this whole antibiotic crisis IMHO is pretty much the industry bemoaning the inevitable fact that easy usage of bulk antibiotics, that should had never been implemented in the first place is going out of the window ...and bemoaning even more that this fact spells the end of easy profits by the sell of bulk "junk medicines" due to the inevitable return of in situ medicine preparation ( in other words, local competition . Ugh ;) ). I expect fully that in 2065 antibiotics will still be in general usage, just in far smaller fashion, in far more targeted treatments with heavier dosages and being just one minor tool on the local doctor arsenal, along side with some out of the Petri dish phagocytes or the good ol'herbal infusions for minor stuff like colds or minor infections ... and this even in the fractured US of yours ;)<br><br>- I'm feeling that someone from the Atlantic seaboard of what is currently the USA would know and talk more about the rest of the world ( atleast from the North Atlantic area, that is easily acessible even without fuel-powered devices ), especially in the case where there is a state of all but closed borders to the interior of the continent. It should be easier and cheaper to bring anything from Europe or South America to there than from Lakeland republic or more interior areas and I can easily see thriving enterprises of small sail ships bringing stuff like Cuban cigars, Jamaican Rum or even Spanish or Portuguese olive oil or French wine to the Atlantic states, especially if those stuff are forbidden or highly priced there ;). Lakeland Republic surelly will not do that, OFC ...<br><br>I surely would like to see more of Mr Carr adventures. In fact , I just wonder how such a open minded individual actually suceeded in Politics :P<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c8354419035033525017 title="comment permalink">10/1/15, 9:39 AM</a><br><br>

It seems like in the wake of a crisis of the sort that the Lakelanders endured in the 30s, decentralization of public infrastructure to the county level like that would be a basic, common sense decision since it would prevent a major interruption in supply chains or infrastructure from being a nationwide catastrophe, but I'm curious as to whether you got the idea from something that's been done before.<br><br>More on topic for last week, but still relevant to the story, I'm wondering if you've noticed the way that bringing back the 1932 banking act the way that the Lakeland Republic did has been popping up with some frequency in this presidential campaign.

I have long felt that part of the problem with public policy is that there is no real connection in the public mind between taxes collected and government funds spent. Even self-proclaimed budget hawks will usually object to this or that government program because it "costs too much", but what is "too much" is in most contexts a matter of opinion. (And often, objections to government programs costing "too much" are a stalking-horse for ideological objections to particular programs anyway).<br><br>If things were set up such that everyone knew that we have Program X because we pay Tax Y-- i.e., non-fungible funds-- then debates about the government's budget would be more sensible. You want to expand Program X? Then you will need to increase Tax Y and/or create a new Tax Z to pay for it. Instead, today, the public demands that Program X be expanded and Tax Y eliminated at the same time. And so the government does what the people want by issuing bonds and/or printing money, but that's not a sustainable practice in the long term.<br><br>The tier system sounds good because there is an easily understood link between the spending and the taxes. You want streetcars and 24/7 electricity? Vote to raise the county's tax tier and there you go. You want low taxes? Do without public infrastructure. None of this, let's have government services today and leave the bill, plus interest, to our grandchildren.<br><br>One potential problem with the county-based system though is that, like most any tax code, it can still be gamed. For example, assuming the tax you pay is based on where you live (e.g., property tax), you could live very near the county line between a low-tier county and a high-tier one, on the low-tier side (so, lower taxes), but work and shop and spend all your leisure time on the high-tier side (thus enjoying many of their services essentially for free). People do basically that in the real world today and it's part of the reason for suburban sprawl, and for cities going broke while the suburbs around them are rolling in money (relatively speaking, at least). Super-long daily commutes are not going to be possible in 2065, but I could see people placing their homes and/or businesses as close as possible to the county line to take advantage of differing tax climates. I suppose a simple partial fix would be a national law that says you must live in the same county in which you work, have a bank account, and/or own a business.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c2425417645132008865 title="comment permalink">10/1/15, 1:18 PM</a><br><br>

You've written in the past about how Civilizations in decline tend to start looking to the fashions and values of other cultures for inspiration, which has already been happening for a while and I imagine will only increase by 2065 when the myth of progress speaks to an ever smaller percentage of the population. So, I'm surprised that there hasn't been any mention (at least so far) of Hispanic, Oriental, African, or even American Indian influences on the clothing, architecture, music etc. of Lakeland, or any new synthesis between the retro American culture and other influences.<br><br>There's lots more possibilities that could be created from a 1950s level of technology (or 1830s for that matter) than what was popular in America at that time. Respect for the classics is good, but I'd expect there to be enough cultural difference in a society that has come to terms with the limits of nature and the end of the American empire from the mindset of growth-oriented pre-1950s America that there would be plenty of niches for new cultural forms. Even given the exact same technologies, an era of decline would have many differences than one of growth. If your prediction from a couple of years back of the rise of the new religious sensibility holds true, that will make a huge difference in culture between 2065 and 1830-1950. A good chunk of the past clothing styles, for instance, had not just to do with available technology but also Victorian-era sensibilities, and if the sensibilities of 2065 are pretty different, I'd think there would be a difference in the clothing styles as well.<br><br>I'd hope that the retro traditions in Lakeland take a path like folk music has in the current era, where the classics are valued but there's also room for new synthesis that speaks to the issues of the present.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c5847408011694222446 title="comment permalink">10/1/15, 2:09 PM</a><br><br>

I'm thinking that there would end up being a few issues that would come up as well, specifically in the relations between the counties.<br><br>I'd imagine the edge of a lower tiered county next to a higher one would attract quite a bit of attention. The taxes would be lower but the infrastructure of the higher tiered county would be close by. I'm thinking in particular of roads. People could live in the counties with dirt roads right at the edge of the paved road system of a higher tiered county and have their cars but lower taxes. Businesses could also locate themselves in this zone, still accessible by paved road but lower taxes. This would hurt the higher tiered county due to diminished tax revenue. I suppose they could block off roads near the border if the problem got too extreme.<br><br>I also wonder what differences in real estate values, wages and costs of living would develop between the different tiers. The costs of living would be obviously higher in the higher tiers, but if the real estate values and wages were higher as well, then the lower tiered counties would face the same situation as poorer parts of America do today, an influx of wealthier people from the higher tiered counties buying up the best land, pricing out the locals and bringing at least a portion of their more expensive, more complex technology with them. That would surely breed tension and resentment.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c3786185380363769455 title="comment permalink">10/1/15, 2:49 PM</a><br><br>

It consisted of an ankle length A-line walking skirt in a dark color, a matching hip length fitted jacket, a white blouse with cuffs and a high neck or a peter pan collar, a dark menswear style necktie, optional vest/waistcoat tailored to the female figure, buttoned boots or shoes, and long hair put up in a loose and simple style.<br><br>I've only seen pictures of this, not the actual clothing, but this outfit appears to have many of the virtues of the modern male business suit, such as being dignified but not overly constricting, adjustable to some range of temperatures by removing the jacket, looking all right on a variety of figure types, and not requiring many decisions when getting dressed in the morning. <br><br>I'm a fan of 1905 clothing, art and architecture; not so much their racial attitudes.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c7252881243554688110 title="comment permalink">10/1/15, 6:18 PM</a><br><br>

The vast majority of children's book authors make next to nothing, though -- it's badly paid even by the standards of other kinds of writing, very few of which make much money. Fiction generally is very hard work for very little pay, unless you happen to get absurdly lucky -- mind you, I'm willing to take a chance now and then, and there are also stories that demand to be written. <br><br>Allexis, there are some minority religious groups in the Lakeland Republic that have an assortment of old-fashioned prejudices, but there are constitutional protections in place. We'll get to that in due time. <br><br>Scotlyn, if people in one county try dumping waste into the next county, they're going to face an exceedingly unfriendly response -- there are laws about that, and triple damages plus punitive damages plus court costs are about the lightest penalty they'd face. (We won't even talk about less formal or legal forms of retribution.) Yes, there's a dark green flavor of Resto, also a religious conservative flavor, and several others -- it's a disparate movement. <br><br>Unknown Eagle Eye, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Johannes, you can still get tolerably well made clothes of old-fashioned styles here in the US, too -- with any luck, as the sort of thing I'm satirizing with Carr's bioplastic drops out of use, those will become more widely available. <br><br>MigrantWorker, good! Yes, both of those are among the positive effects. Once you set up an institutional framework that both allows and rewards living with less, all kinds of advantages unfold.<br><br>Thomas, well, that's why there are tier five counties; a significant number of people share your opinion and your willingness to foot the bill. <br><br>Alex, ding! We have a winner. ;-) Yes, exactly. <br><br>Jim, fair enough. The Lakeland Republic has an interesting philosophy when it comes to monopolies. If something's a natural monopoly -- say, the sewer system -- it's owned by the people via local government. If it's not, it had better not try to become an unnatural monopoly -- there are laws, and they're enforced, for reasons we'll be discussing down the line a bit. So you'd be able to string wire to your neighbor's house without running afoul of the laws. <br><br>Michael, hah! Okay, we have our first suitably rancid Lakeland pun. ;-)<br><br>Shane, many thanks. The same road atlas that I used to map Trey sunna Gwen's travels around Meriga lists county names, fortunately!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c4409727793628048920 title="comment permalink">10/1/15, 6:23 PM</a><br><br>

For a variety of reasons, the Lakeland Republic's gone for a very decentralized approach to public services, and above the county level there's regulation (from the national government) but not much interconnection or coordination. <br><br>Shane, indeed we are. One of the people Carr's already met is gay; it's not a big deal (in many parts of the US, it's already not a big deal) and so I didn't see any reason to point that out. Things will be a bit more obvious further on.<br><br>Denys, we'll be visiting two schools, a sectarian school in Toledo and a rural schoolhouse in a tier one county south a ways. As for the rest, stay tuned! <br><br>Carol, I figure they were mothers with very small babies, and yes, there's been a bit of a baby boom, since the end of the embargo and the signing of the Treaty of Richmond has caused a loosening of some of the tight economic conditions. We'll be seeing plenty of kids on their own feet as the story proceeds. <br><br>Grim, I'm not sure how many times I'll have to repeat this before everybody actually notices it, but <i><b>the only thing the tier system determines is what public services are paid for by tax dollars</b></i>. It doesn't determine what other technologies people choose to have -- only what public services they can expect to support their technological choices. It doesn't take particularly advanced technology to produce saline solution, by the way...<br><br>Patricia, Phyllis would go to a mom-and-pop women's clothing store unless she wanted something really fancy or had unusual measurements, in which case a women's tailor would be called for. ("Dressmaker" isn't used much since dresses are far from the only option.) I don't know a great deal yet about the women's clothing styles that are in fashion in the Lakeland Republic, although I do know that Phyllis could certainly look like a lady, if that's her preferred option, without freezing: Melissa Berger, whom we've already met, favors wool skirts (below-the-knee length) and jackets of a very understated, professional cut, severe blouses, broad-brimmed hats, sensible shoes (no heels, please), and trench coat style raincoats. Pants are also an option -- Marlene Dietrich and Katharine Hepburn both wore them in the 1930s, and I challenge you to find anything unladylike in either one's appearance. <br><br>Somewhatstunned, hah! I like that. <br><br>John, in which case they'd be used very sparingly, to prevent the same problem from emerging again. <br><br>Zaphod, it will indeed be available in print -- I personally don't like e-books, so I always make sure my books are for sale in print form. <br><br>Kevin, good. There are no states; it's the Republic, the counties, and then township, town, and city goverments within each county. National taxation -- well, we'll be getting to that; it's handled very differently from the way nations these days do it. <br><br>Felix, thank you! If you weren't able to read this on the internet, you could read it the way people in the Lakeland Republic do -- as an article in a weekly magazine or newspaper. Carr will be visiting a newsstand shortly...<br><br>Jonathan, we'll be talking later on about how the Lakeland Republic managed their reskilling program!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c7494144350348932523 title="comment permalink">10/1/15, 7:01 PM</a><br><br>

It was the Marlene Dietrich style pants I had in mind. Very elegant! Melissa's outfit sounds fine, though I think boots might be practical with calf-length skirts, and I know they're very attractive for those who can wear them. <br><br>I wear what I can only call women's dress loafers, bought decades ago and still good,with my navy wool (tropical weight? Fine-woven, lightweight, good for all seasons but the hottest days, doesn't itch.... courtesy of the Animal Humane Thrift Store) trouser suit for dress wear. <br><br>I keep getting the feeling that women in Lakeland wear their hair longer than the Atlantic (Atlantean?) women do. Some styles call for longer hair than the length I wear it at, but it's better to dress for your face and let the sort of style follow naturally. <br><br>Which reminds me - I need to acquire a simple felt hat of a style and size that doesn't overshadow my face.

I repeat it here, where I intended to put it. Feel free to delete either one. Or both--hey, it's your blog after all.)<br><br>I can only imagine how lovely the fabric stores in the Lakeland Republic must be. My grandmother worked as a seamstress in the men's suits department of a local store and saved money by sewing her own and her children's clothes; I know how to sew, but can't afford to sew most of my clothes because fabric is so cheap (in quality) and expensive (in price) these days. Evidently fabric is now a craft supply rather than a necessary home good. The other day I bought a little plain, unbleached cotton muslin--$13 a yard! If you can even find plain cotton jersey amongst the wall-to-wall rolls of polyester at your local big box fabric store, it will make for one expensive t-shirt in a guaranteed-to-be-ugly color. <br><br>Meanwhile, my flimsy plastic sewing machine outlived its intended demise, lasting me something like a decade with light use. I took it to the repair shop where the owner told me that most of these modern machines can't really be fixed because the internal gears are also made of plastic and wear down. (Who thought that was a good idea? Oh, right...) On the other hand, I'm still using my mom's 52-year-old hand mixer in the kitchen and it runs like a top. And I used a 1940s Singer at a friend's house--it too worked perfectly. Light bulb! My next sewing machine is going to be a vintage model, 50 years or older. Hunting down vintage, appropriate-technology replacements for my planned-obsolescent trash is my new hobby. I thank JMG and the commenters on this blog for the inspiration!<br><br>Meanwhile, JMG, I am really enjoying this series. I have always wondered what it was like to read serialized fiction, like it would have been for the original Sherlock Holmes readers. It's fun, but surprisingly suspenseful. I find myself getting quite impatient by the time Tuesday rolls around.

I also garden and make most of our food, including a great deal of preserving. <br>It is not at all slow paced or convenient, especially during harvest season, when I'm canning, freezing, drying, cooking, etc., before and after work and on the weekends, and still trying to find time to work in the garden, which needs harvesting, weeding, planting for winter, etc.. It is a lot of very hard work, and I'm sometimes tired and stressed, and frustrated by the never-ending list of things to get done, and the list of things that have to be let go, because there just aren't enough hours in the day. Friends and family think I'm nuts for working so hard. But that's the price of doing things for oneself, in this particular society, especially if you work full-time. They like the food...<br> And I'm gradually nudging more of them into doing at least a little of their own preserving and gardening.<br>This is all good, satisfying work; I like doing it, and can't imagine choosing not to. But sometimes it's hard, and that's an important truth, too.<br>Haven't tried chicory coffee, but late last winter I dug up a lot of large dandelion roots that had grown in the garden over the winter, scrubbed them clean, ground them up, and roasted them in the oven. They make a very nice tea/coffee substitute; full-bodied and a little bitter, very nice with homemade filbert milk creamer (also with cream, if you are a milk drinker). Though, it has not persuaded me to give up drinking chocolate.<br>@ Patricia Mathews, yes, breed makes a huge difference in whether the wool itches. Depends on what the sheep were bred for.

Down the road, I'd like to be able to afford clothes of good quality!<br><br>James, each county sets its own tax rates based on its actual expenses -- if county A has more miles of paved road to keep maintained, for example, it's going to have somewhat higher taxes than county B, which has fewer roads. Still, yes, it works out to something vaguely along those lines. <br><br>Patricia, thank you. It's quite intentional -- one of the things that's central to the fiction is that the Lakeland Republic became what it is out of massive crisis. <br><br>Peter, the only way I know of to successfully lure someone away from high-tech gimmickry is to have much more fun without it. Fortunately, this isn't hard. <br><br>Sylvia, the population's somewhat lower in 2065 than it is today -- a brutal civil war followed by a long economic depression will do that -- and yes, the Lakeland Republic's Department of Public Health has effective tuberculosis treatments, though there again resistant microbes are a challenge. (Resistant TB is a major issue today, though the media doesn't say much about it.) <br><br>Ricardo, exactly! Carr has never seen good manufactured goods in his life, because his life has been spent in a country that's held hostage to the logic of the globalized economy: the cheapest, shoddiest, most disposable products make more money for shareholders, so that's what the stores carry. I agree that bioplastic has many negative features beyond the ones Carr has noted -- there'll be more later on. As for antibiotic resistance, though, there I think you're mistaken. Two members of my family have been made severely ill by two different resistant microbes; one of them, my father, was nearly killed twice by resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, which he got via a heart operation in an infected hospital, and his health has never recovered. It's not just a matter of not being able to keep on using antibiotics in the present way; people are being harmed and killed, right now, because microbes that used to be killed by antibiotics are shrugging them off. <br><br>As for the Atlantic seaboard, the oceans are rising, and so a lot of port facilities in the Atlantic Republic are no longer functional. More on this as we proceed!<br><br>MayHawk, exactly. You're also quite correct that "buy now, pay later" isn't the way the Lakeland Republic does things; instead, people save up money to buy things. I suspect we'll be visiting a post office down the road a bit, and see signs talking about Christmas Club accounts -- do you recall those? <br><br>Raven, ironically enough, I favor driving caps. No, there's no statues of me in the Lakeland Republic or, I hope, anywhere else in 2065. I'll be talking in more detail as we proceed about just what happened to convince an independent Midwest to do the sensible thing and chuck the mythology of progress into the nearest recycle bin.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c1020085154150956468 title="comment permalink">10/1/15, 11:22 PM</a><br><br>

One of the consequences of the internet, and presumably also of the metanet, is that it encourages the fragmentation of culture; you meet plenty of people who know a fantastic amount about a few narrow subjects and not a thing about anything else. Carr is like that. He's fond of a number of kinds of music, and he likes old movies and history programs; he knows a bunch about those things, and has huge gaps in his knowledge elsewhere. I don't know of any equivalent to the tier system, no -- and yes, it's intrigued me to see Glass-Steagall brought up again and again. Not because there's anything strange about reenacting a law that successfully stopped the abuses that wrecked the banking system in the 1920s and early 1930s, and are doing exactly the same thing now; what's intriguing is that in a society that seems incapable of learning the lessons of repeated failure, this one lesson does finally seem to be sinking in.<br><br>Varun, my evil work is done. Bwahahahaha!<br><br>Librarian, yep. As I noted to Ricardo, the downsides of bioplastic go beyond what Carr has noticed so far.<br><br>Aias, depends on how county councils get along. It's far from uncommon, if a lot of people who live in a lower-tier county shop, work, etc. in a higher-tier county, for there to be out-of-county fees they have to pay when they do things in the higher-tier county, to cover the cost of the services they use. <br><br>RPC, Carr's an old-music fan, and belongs to that subculture (and surfs those sites on the metanet when he's at home). As for Cleveland, I thought I'd answered you earlier. Cleveland is a thriving port city and manufacturing center, just as it was until the Rust Belt went bust; some of the schooners Carr saw in episode 2 were heading there. It's tier 5, though there's some agitation for a referendum to go down to tier 4 for the sake of lower taxes.<br><br>Ed-M, the Restos are a very diverse lot. There are probably some who treasure Jim's collected writings, although I suspect the critiques of suburbia and bad architecture are at the top of their reading lists, rather than any of his more decline-and-fall writing. Others draw from other sources. <br><br>RPC, an astonishing number of people never do that kind of math, and there are also a lot of people who can only afford the cheap product because the up front cost of the better product is more than they can spend at any one time. <br><br>Daelach, it was already on the list, but I appreciated the reminder! ;-)<br><br>Troy, that's not the way the Lakeland Republic does things -- laws requiring people to do X, Y and Z are not that common outside of the criminal code. Instead, what usually happens is that out-of-county fees get slapped on people who try to game the system that way. You work in a higher-tier county and live in a lower-tier one? There's a fee for county services deducted from your paycheck. You live on the edge of a car-free county and drive in a tier 4 or 5 county? Your license fees go *way* up. By and large, when Lakeland governments want to discourage something, they don't prohibit it unless it's something that really has to be prohibited; instead, they slap it with taxes and fees that make it unattractive, and not incidentally help keep tax rates low for those who play by the rules. <br><br>Pygmycory, again, the tiers just determine what kind of public utilities your tax dollars pay for. Medical care isn't a public utility -- though you'll likely find the way that it's handled interesting.

As we'll see, the current culture of the Lakeland Republic was powerfully shaped by nostalgia for times when the Midwest was thriving, and still tends to copy styles and trends from those eras. As the Lakelanders become more confident, they may well draw from other sources of inspiration -- but in 2065, for example, the most successful theatrical production in the Republic was a musical comedy about the almost-war between Michigan and Ohio over the city of Toledo in 1835-6. The not-quite-a-battle scene at the end of the second act was practically a Busby Berkeley number. Did it play in Peoria? You bet; just about everybody in the Republic could be heard whistling the opening number "Toledo Strip" at some point during the summer. <br><br>Denys, I know. I use this medium because it's what's readily available, and will reach the largest possible audience, but it's the only thing even approximating social media that I use at all. <br><br>HalFiore, funny! I don't think so, alas. <br><br>Hubertus, one of the things about civil wars is that senile elites don't usually survive them with their power and wealth intact, and quite often don't survive them at all. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Ozark, yep; as already mentioned, that's why high-tier counties typically levy user fees on residents of low-tier counties who want to use their services without paying for them. You live on the edge of a tier 1 county, and want to drive on the roads of the tier 4 county next door? Sure you can, so long as you don't mind the extra license fees to pay for your share of the county road system, etc.! As for real estate values, the sharp difference in tax costs helps balance that -- if you want to live in the tier four county, your property taxes are going to be a lot higher, and since speculation in real estate (or anything else) faces steep taxes as well, there isn't that driver to overinflated real estate prices; for people in the Lakeland Republic, a home is a place you live, not an investment. <br><br>Jason, I've already discussed parts of it. Stay tuned for more!<br><br>Marian, as I mentioned to RPC, Cleveland's one of the Lakeland Republic's big cities, a thriving port and manufacturing center, tier five as of 2065. As for the nuclear power plants, those got shut down safely in the opening phases of the Second Civil War -- neither side wanted to be stuck with the mess after victory -- and the fate of the high-level waste will be mentioned later on. It's all out of the country at this point. <br><br>Donalfagan, funny! Or: <br><br>"The Maumee River delta was shining<br>Like a national guitar<br>I am following the lakeshore<br>On the railroad<br>Through the ruins of a civil war<br>I'm going to Lakeland, Lakeland<br>A startling sight to see<br>I'm going to Lakeland." <br><br>Patricia, I think hair length varies a good bit, but yes, a lot of women like to wear theirs fairly long -- again, the retro thing. I wonder if the Gibson Girl pompadour will come back in...<br><br>Alexandra, glad you're enjoying it! No question, a fabric store in Toledo or any of the other big cities would be a trip to Nirvana for a lot of people who like to sew -- good quality cloth from mills all over the Republic, pretty much anything you can make from wool, cotton, linen, or hemp. Even a small town store will sell you a good range of quality fabrics -- and then of course you go into tier 1 counties that have plenty of full-on Restos, and you start to see a lot of homespun dyed with butternut and other natural dyes; a lot of the extreme Restos won't sell but will gladly barter.

Many of them were early adopters of new technology. Some have doctorates, one was forced to abandon medical school in his final year due to long-term effects from a hazing incident. They found themselves "allergic" to modern society, but due largely to the civil religion of Progress JMG has described very well in prior posts, a mere mention of them is taboo. They are not supposed to exist. If they raise their voices too high, they are treated as "mentally ill."<br><br>They certainly miss a lot from their former lives. For one thing, most of them had to abandon their career. To the degree that they are able to find a place to recover their health (not easy these days) they don't fold up and feel sorry for themselves. To survive you have to be philosophical. Most realize their lives were being tied up with trivia, and that the most important things were escaping their attention. Some certainly continue to battle the demons-that-be of Progress; some do so angrily at the rank injustice, but others, happily, because it has given them a new purpose, where they may be able to help someone else. Others among the hypersensitive enjoy the freedom that got forced on them. Their stories are inspirational as we face a time of accelerating competition for the scraps of the "good life."

I long went along with this extinction message. However my insight has changed. The picture of elites nullification is either a illusion or misunderstanding. Elites are far from disappearing. Its as with all living beings alike. There is no extinction. Thats rather a myth. What I observe is a general transition.<br><br>Giving a contemporary example; In Germany one ancient form of elite is the nobility. Now, since our 2nd republic the nobility has formally lost their privileges.<br><br>Yet as representatives of the common citicens they consist 2000 % more than their actuall portion of the population. That is one single statistical evidence, to stretch my point. Elites are very persistent in upholding their status and privileged position. Thats just reflecting their place in society troughout the ages. Elites persevere. Banning them publicly is letting them disappear on the surface.

He does nothing really different from the average Russian dudes I know. They bare their chest to get some needed sunshine in summer. The mosquito bites are "good for the organism."<br><br>By making compromises with the oligarchs, he has started getting corruption under control in his country. There's still a long way to go on that. But he basically stopped the theft of Russia's natural resources, restored the economic system somewhat to where it functions better than before for the average citizen as a capitalist system, and he managed some humanitarian good deeds such as restoring pensions to seniors. In these ways, he defied the international vampire squids, and you must understand that this is the reason you hear so many unflattering assessments of him. There will always be people with gripes against him (some of them are my friends), but the more pressure comes to bear against him from the vampire squids, the higher and higher his popularity soars.

My guess is that the Ehrenstein in JMG's story would have had a much more modest upbringing, while your upper middle class kid's family would have been strung up or found the business end of a pitchfork during the Civil War, troubles/uprisings. If they were fortunate enough to have escaped that fate, they would've probably been sent into exile. If they managed to survive in place, I'd imagine that people of that class would be too frail to survive the dramatic drop in lifestyle, and would succumb to suicide, alcoholism, or drug abuse. People of lower classes/more modest means would be more resilient and would be the stock that our Ehrenstein is likely to come from. They'd be the ones kept down by today's senile elite that would thrive in a Lakeland.<br>Regarding hyphenated ethnicities, JMG, wouldn't people be "African-Lakelandian" and "Italian-Lakelandian" rather than "African-American" or "Italian-American", much the same way that people in Canada are African Canadian, Chinese Canadian, etc, or do people still think of themselves as American in Lakeland?<br>It may not be obvious someone is gay walking down the street, JMG, but when they're raising 4 kids in a home they share with their lawfully wedded husband or wife, it should be fairly obvious to anyone in the neighborhood.<br>Let me guess, the guy on the old cash register knows how to count change back the old fashioned way, counting forward, right?

But that was a expectable result and it was known to happen even before any one of us had come to this world ... that was a big reason why peniciline was so welcomed when discovered: the previous kill it all "wonder drug", the sulfamides, was being outgunned by "natural" selection in the same way our current Koch's bacillus are outgunning our current medicines against Tuberculosis. That is not to say that sulfamides stopped being used, it was just that the dosage needed to kill the bugs became so big that it started to be toxic for the human taking it and thus it's usage became very restricted to the cases where it was really needed.<br><br>That said, and not wanting to be too technical, there are two kinds of antibiotics: a class that tries to target metabolic paths that are exclusive to the bacteria causing the disease and ones that target more or less universal metabolic paths ( DNA replication, the Krebs cycle, protein synthesis ... all of them are pretty much done in the same way in all living things ), thus also harming the patient, but relying in the fact that you need more to kill a 70 kg human than some microscopic being. <br><br>Most of the current antibiotics fall in the first category and thus are rendered useless as soon as "natural" selection kicks in and rewards any bacteria that starts doing stuff diferently ( like having slightly diferent surface receptors, a typical evolution on Multi-resistant strains ), but like I said, any antibiotic of that kind comes with a expectable shelf live and if reasonable minds were behind their usage they would be dosed with parcimony, with a careful analysis of the active principle to use in each case, just to increase their usable time. But , as our world has been filled with not so rational minds, we have boxes of uniform dosage antibiotics being handed down by lazy or ill-prepared doctors like Oprah handling her audience, and more, we'be being spraying and feeding them by the bucketloads to our plants and livestock ( in the deranged belief that it will somehow prevent diseases on them , thus increasing profits ). As you can imagine, this is the exact thing that should not be done. OTOH, it is not that new antibiotics of this can't be created, but that requires research and money and will have the same shelf live issues, so it is not that profitable as that ...<br><br>( continues ... )<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c1055476355248528976 title="comment permalink">10/2/15, 5:42 AM</a><br><br>

Like I said in my other post, that kind of stuff works under the same basis as chemotherapy: it is poison both to you and to the bacteria , but they need less to die than you, and thus they are not that used today ( you need to be careful with the dosage, otherwise it will kill you too ...and it is normal that it will not leave you exactly healthy afterwards even if the treatment goes well ). A pretty extreme case are the organo-mercurates ( coumpounds that result of the reaction of mercury with organic molecules ): there is a reason why people started associating taking mercury in as a recipe for long life, as those coumpounds ( that are naturally created if you ingest mercury ) are potent full-spectrum antibiotics, but they also kill you if taken in excessive dosages and even if the dose is not excessive, you will suffer from it ( good ol'mercury poisoning ). Thus doctors tend to be very reluctant to give that kind of stuff out, as you understand ( and in the cynical side, they also don't want to deal with the lawsuits for poisoning a person to save them ... ).<br><br>Well, in resume: Current specific bacterial metabolic route antibiotics are probably going down the window, but then again they were never permanent to start with and we also did not act to extend their usage. Given enough time and money, we can most likely develop new ones, but even if that happens, they will again be rendered useless sooner or later ... OTOH the class of antibiotics that is universally usable will also poison you and has to be used in a very controlled fashion that is both time and money consuming .<br><br>That is why I said I beleived antibiotics usage would probably never die out, since that second class of medicines will still be in hand. OTOH, given their drawbacks, I do not expect that doctors use them in a so stupidly blind fashion as today. But that also means that the current model of business regarding antibiotics is pretty much dead in the water , and that is why you see so many people crying about that ... <br><br>( disclaimer: The feminine side of my close family of my mother side , including my mother and my sisters, are strongly allergic to penicillin related antibiotics and all of them already passed by atleast one near death experience due to some doctor giving out penicillin-related coumpounds to them blindly, sometimes even after knowing that they were allergic ( last time was 2 months ago ). Sometimes I just wonder how many people died so far due to doctors giving away antibiotics as candy to people that are allergic to them ... )<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c7155283910998419822 title="comment permalink">10/2/15, 5:44 AM</a><br><br>

I made a vest out of an old army wool blanket, and it was scratchy. Here we go:<br><br>- get wool fat / wool wax. You get it in any drugstore where they use it as basic ingredient for making salves. Drugstores are usually overpriced, so you may prefer to get it over the internet while it lasts. Do not use lanoline, that is an emulsion of wool fat and water.<br>- get dish detergent.<br>- make half a litre of water boil.<br>- put a tea spoon of dish detergent in (less if your detergent is a concentrated one). It makes the wool fat soluble in water.<br>- put heaped a tea spoon of wool wax in.<br>- stir the liquid until the wool wax has dissolved.<br>- fill a bucket full of luke warm water (around 30°C - must not feel hot), around 8 litres. 10 litre buckets are standard, that leaves a bit room for the garment's volume. If your bucket isn't metric, use somewhat equivalent values.<br>- put the boiling liquid from above into the bucket and stir.<br>- put your scratchy wool garment in. Do not agitate, wool doesn't like that. Just put it under the liquid surface.<br>- let it rest overnight.<br>- get the garment out. Do not rinse, do not wring, do not iron, do not tumble.<br>- put the garment between two big towels.<br>- press some of the remaining water out. Pressing, not wringing.<br>- put the garment flat onto some laundry rack. Do not hang it up, or else it may warp due to its own weight.<br>- it is normal that it feels a bit greasy at this point.<br>- let it dry.<br>- the greasy feeling should vanish, or else it will after some wear.<br>- now the wool should scratch much less.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c3182427388538187463 title="comment permalink">10/2/15, 5:56 AM</a><br><br>

His exact reassurance to me was: "Mom, you can never be a hipster because you are already what hipsters want to be when they grow up!" So relax, man ...

In many ways some of the 'reality' your protagonist is describing mirrors my own experience during my childhood and youth and to some extent on into my early adulthood. <br><br>I was born into a lower-middle-class family in 1936 and carry fond memories of growing up and living in the Pacific Northwest during a less complicated (i.e., less distracting) time. For example; when I was about three years old, my parents wisely purchased an acre of land on the edge of town that supported a small house and proceeded to create a mini-utopia over time that supplied much of our food for eight years or so. We had a huge garden, a small orchard, raised berries of various types, raised rabbits and ran a sizable chicken yard full of chickens - and we all (my three older siblings and myself) pitched in to keep it going (remember 'chores'?). <br><br>Initially, even though we did have electric power, we had an icebox and a root cellar of sorts and my mother and older sister canned any surplus produce we grew or could obtain. A big event in my young life was a trip with my father to the ice-house in town to pick up a block of ice or to retrieve something from the freezer locker we rented there.<br><br>Also early on (until I was six or seven years old) we made do with an outhouse - we had indoor plumbing but there was as yet no public sewer system to serve our area. And the 'central heating system' was just that, a wood-fired stove that occupied a spot on one side of the living room that was pretty 'central' to the entire house. The upstairs bedrooms were heated through vents above the stove that opened to a landing at the top of the stairs. <br><br>Later on we were blessed with a refrigerator and a sewer system, so the icebox and outhouse went away (but we kept renting the locker), and the wood-burner was replaced with an oil-burner (ugh!) that sported a fan-driven heat distribution system of sorts, but other than that things went along pretty much the same until we moved to another town when I was thirteen. Oh, and we didn't have a tv until after we moved - books, board games, cards, home-made music, the radio (a big, stand-up thing with a 'green eyeball' tuner on the dial), and an occasional movie were our primary sources of entertainment, not to mention fishing. As I recall, even though there were stresses, both outside and internal to the family, we lived pretty well and life was all-in-all pretty good.<br><br>After I left home and went on my own, I moved to the city (Portland), which at the time (mid-fifties to mid-sixties) was not unlike the Toledo your protagonist describes. I went to work in a bank downtown, which was full of smaller home-owned shops, restaurants and coffee-shops, sported two or three larger, locally-owned department stores and, right in the middle of it all, covering a half-block, there was a perpetual open-sided market with numerous permanent stalls selling fresh produce, fish, various meats and cheeses, breads and other goodies.<br><br> Most of that's gone now, replaced by a newer, more 'hip' culture and infrastructure. And I no longer live there, but I fondly carry memories of the time I did and my experiences as the place evolved and changed.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c1328081766138650130 title="comment permalink">10/2/15, 10:58 AM</a><br><br>

I have been enjoying your blog for some time but haven't posted. I also come from reading a lot of science fiction in the 1970's. The only thing I've seen even close to your tier system is the paid avoidance zones from John Brunner's <i>The Shockwave Rider</i>. After the Great Bay Quake devastated California, the expense of rebuilding the infrastructure was so great that the government offered instead to pay people to live in areas with reduced services. Some areas were little more than shanty towns, but others developed extremely sophisticated green technology. And most places would take credit cards, but they used the old-fashioned carbon paper machines to process them, which means it would take a day or two for the transaction to get into the network. That was extremely handy if you were on the lam, as you could be gone before the feds got there.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c4647429084687978424 title="comment permalink">10/2/15, 11:01 AM</a><br><br>

Google "Peppa Pig creators bank £47m each".<br><br>Zaphod's mention of smell reminded me of our local grocer in the 1950s. Run by the gloriously-named Toodles Noppe, whose husband ran the butchery next door, it served middle- and working-class customers. Walk in and you were immediately hit by the smell of paraffin (kerosene) and blue laundry soap. Want paraffin? Bring your own bottle and pump it out of the square paraffin tin with a paraffin pump. Want laundry soap? Break what you want off the long bars of soap. Want sugar? Toodles would put a paper bag on the scale, scoop the sugar from a burlap bag, and weigh out half a pound. Then grip the bag by the corners, a twirl and a tuck, and hand you had a neatly-sealed bag of sugar. <br><br>Of course we kids were most interested in the big glass jars of n**ger balls, marshmallow fish, bubble gum, sherbet, etc etc. Other kids would be running round outside pushing bicycle wheel rims using wire guiding rods.<br><br>The paraffin would be for the Primus stove.

It seems to me that part of what you are trying to do here is to reimagine the ecology movement without its heavy burden of hippie counterculture. If some Greens choose to adopt a hippie lifestyle that is not a problem, indeed it contributes to the creative diversity of the movement. But if hipster countercultural values become de rigueur, which was my experience of the British green movement of the nineties, it is a problem, because many potential supporters will be alienated because, though they want to live less unsustainably and more in harmony with nature, they don't smoke dope, believe in earth energies and the coming New Age, &amp;c. &amp;c.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c7638753920716508892 title="comment permalink">10/2/15, 2:54 PM</a><br><br>

For one of your characters in particular, the African-American banker, how do attitudes change over the years from say, his civil rights era great grandmother, for whom belief in the myth of progress meant progress towards equality, and for whom older technologies and fashions most definitely represent a return to older social mores of segregation, lynching, and worse, to your banker, who obviously has different ideas? Is it just repeated discomfirmation of old myths until they just can't be believed anymore? The failure of the federal government? I'm thinking it's like I was saying with the Confederacy, that old myths handed down by tired, old elites just don't describe reality anymore (How can the South at the same time be the most diverse, integrated region with the largest African-American &amp; Latino communities, with continued black and Latino inmigration while at the same time being the national scapegoat for racism and retrograde beliefs in general?) I'm just curious how you see those attitudes changing over generations with one group in particular in Lakeland.<br>"and in the highly multiethnic post-US North America of 2065, if you're in politics, you notice ethnicities among many other things, because it's no longer "important white guys" vs. 'everyone else;' the different ethnic communities have clout, and paying attention to who's who is essential for successful politics in a multipolar society. More on this as we proceed!"<br>So, are you saying that the trend over the last 200 years of "becoming white", of the term "white" expanding from just British/Anglo Saxon people to include more and more people, will reverse? I've heard/read that "white" is now expanding to include Latinos, multiracial people, and Asians, that is, that increasing numbers of these groups are now adopting the term "white" to describe themselves.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c6283618234669224679 title="comment permalink">10/2/15, 4:44 PM</a><br><br>

The reason : a lot of the recent stream of refugees from the Middle-East are educated people, who have developed ingenious solutions to build makeshift housing (shanties, but that word should no longer be used) from salvaged or recycled materials, solving basic problems such as ventilation, insulation...<br>- the biggest commercial airline in France is planning to cut pilot jobs<br>- a new fashionable idea : "good-enough innovation". No kidding...<br><br>(- I also have noticed nowadays you see a lot of ads for websites on TV... it feels really strange to me, because when I was a kid, TV was king, you even saw "Seen on TVs" stickers on toy packages)<br><br>(and the latest diplomatic summit on Ukraine took place in Paris... without the USA's head of states. I have started my pop-corn stash ! http://www.euronews.com/2015/10/02/cautious-optimism-on-ukraine-after-paris-summit/)<br><br>Basically, I get the feeling that the facts making the case for LLR's views are there and now slipping to the public attention, too loud to ignore, but the coherent set of ideas have not yet coalesced around those facts : Green wizardry, technology cutting jobs and still getting funded by the states, technology tiers for tax subsidies... It will still take bravery to articulate it publicly, even if the facts can no longer be ignored.<br><br>One of the reasons why the idea that technology is subsidized by the states does not get more discussion is pretty simple : blindness to whole systems. Once that blindness dissipates, the idea that states are funding technologies to create more unemployment, thus requiring more funding from tax payers... would just look pretty bad. It's not gonna end well, hmmm ? No wonder you haven't envisioned an exactly rosy historical path leading to your Retropia. Hopefully it takes less than that here to get there.<br><br>Another reason, and one of the pillars of the Internet economy, is the superstition of marketing. Because most of the Internet giants and startups are paying themselves on just advertising revenue... Superstition does seem to be a renewable resource. i am sure the LLR would feature plenty of it, but under different forms.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c1606671444914252809 title="comment permalink">10/2/15, 5:32 PM</a><br><br>

Back in the way-back days, (1990's) when I worked in costume design for theatre &amp; film, in several costume shops I got to use some of these and they are a DREEEEEAM to sew on! From the lightest, most delicate silks to heavy leather or felted wools (and it might not matter to you now, but with a ball-point needle, even synthetics/polyester/nylon/etc.) Fairly simple mechanics, easy enough to keep the tension properly adjusted, keep oiled and cleaned on your own. Needles and bobbins were pretty standard sizes. They just run forward, so you have to double stitch the beginning and ending of each seam, but that's easy enough to get used to. I can't recommend them highly enough. <br><br>@Patricia, RE: Phyllis's shopping: That caught my eye too! As a former costume designer, I'm also costuming this out in my head. :) IMHO, she would already have a few items from LLR, procured on the Atlantic Rep. black market, there is always such a market for things-you're not-supposed-to-have. Maybe just a simple tasteful woolen scarf or hat, but it would be her wardrobe 'passport' or street-cred on her trip to LLR. <br>The seamstresses/dressmakers/couturiers she visits, (also found through black market connections); I think not all, but many of them would work from their homes, designing and sewing in the evenings for fun and spare money. There has always been a market for fashion and there always will be. The impulse to adorn ourselves and express ourselves through outer appearance has been found present in every single human society, bar none. This also leads many of us to accept a certain measure if discomfort in our clothing, like wearing a smart dress, (stockinged legs) in winter, or putting up with a bit of scratchiness from woolens, even, if one doesn't know any better, perpetual clamminess from bioplastic, although that is really pushing the limits.<br><br>Even in economic hardship, I think some, like Phyllis -as you describe her - would feel a strong compulsion to prioritize this.<br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c8210231223638329287 title="comment permalink">10/2/15, 5:42 PM</a><br><br>

I think LLR would have to have a textile mill or two, dyers and industrial looms to provide a Tier-5 amount of textiles and clothing. I don't think hand-spinning, dyeing and weaving would provide enough for any haberdashery to keep off-the-rack clothes in stock. Maybe they've resurrected some old mills within their borders or traded for some of the last ones in the Confederacy. I was working for a garment mfgr. in 1997 when our supplier, one of the last hold-out mills in NC closed up in the face of NAFTA. My company closed up soon after.<br><br>As for the choice of the 1940's styles: (As a costume designer, I'd actually extend that both ways to a mix of 1930's, 40's even a bit of 1950's trends); A popular style often comes from the perception of who we want to be, so JGM, right on the money that Lakelanders would gravitate towards a look from their regional glory days as well as something that is smart or elegant and achievable. Today, women favoring cargo pants and tank-tops, looking like survivors from 'The Walking Dead' is good because they're not actually fighting any war. If/when they have to go through a real war, bloody and messy and PTSD- when it's over, they/we will probably find ourselves drawn again to clothing/an outer appearance of elegance and sophistication.<br>Additionally, those styles are currently a marginal part of the steam-punk oeuvre a la 'Bioshock'. It's a great look, always has been, I can see it raging back in a place like LLR, where it's again achievable. <br><br>Finally: Apart from wool-wax. A lot of vintage woolens were also lined with either silk, nylon or a thin woven cotton to keep the shape of the outer-garment additional warmth and to fend off scratchiness. If no lining, women wore slips and camisoles, men wore undershirts and boxers which did the trick. Sans synthetics, the stockings would have to be either (smuggled?)imported silks or cotton lisle, maybe even wool for the winter.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c3205233301364214602 title="comment permalink">10/2/15, 5:42 PM</a><br><br>

Who would shoulder the costs for the inter-county trade routes though? We've seen that agriculture takes place in the range of tiered counties, with the associated variety of technological suites in use. However, one might expect more productive farmland in a low tier county, and more land given over to industry and urban infrastructure in a Tier 5 locale. <br><br>If a high tier county has to draw on the resources of its low tier neighbor for its food, fiber and fuel needs, does it subsidize a road or canal across county lines into farm country so that Tier 1 farmers can get their ox-carts to barges and trucks? Or does the low-tier neighbor shoulder the cost of the trade route? <br><br>Put another way, is the land for food. fuel and fiber viewed as part of the infrastructure that makes up the county's tax level? (Do urban centers have to set growth boundaries, ensuring adequate land in its county to meet the basic needs of its constituents, and not require low-tier counties to produce a surplus?) Or is e.g. sheep ranching in tier 1 one country just profitable enough to justify paying road-use fees out of what are likely decent fleece prices at the woolen mills on the outskirts of Toledo? <br><br>Perhaps these issues are worked out more on the national level of taxation that we are eagerly awaiting to hear about. On the other hand I suppose one could see a formerly urban area that is a Tier 1 county in 2065, populated by proto-ruinmen using urbanite to build rough shelters. The beauty of the tier system would be that if sheep ranching were an important part of the local economy, the cost of the trade route could be part of the tax assessment given enough ranchers, and I guess it would be the truck and barge drivers working the usage fees and pollution taxes into their budgets. But I'm curious to see how the tier system plays out with the urban/rural divide.<br><br>Thanks for this journey!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c3243942843751861937 title="comment permalink">10/2/15, 5:53 PM</a><br><br>

Germany's situation is, if not quite an outlier, then by no means common, much less universal. A lot depends, of course, on how many people after the crisis consider the elites from before the crisis to have been responsible for the crisis...<br><br>Jo, well, there you are. Do you think there's any chance that Tasmania might someday become an independent republic? I can see putting a Tasmanian embassy in Toledo...<br><br>Ricardo, thank you for the clarification! I'm familiar with the use of mercury and arsenic compounds to treat STDs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries -- a slow and very delicate process due to the toxicity of the drugs -- but hadn't thought of the same principle more generally. So what you're suggesting is that in the future, toxic antibiotics will be a last resort for intractable cases? I could see that. <br><br>Daelach, thanks for this. American readers will want to know that here, wool fat is usually called lanolin. <br><br>Nastarana, thank you! <br><br>N Montesano, exactly -- but that helps explain why, in the Lakeland Republic of 2065, there are a lot of people whose dreams of a comfortable, secure, happy life lead them straight to tier 1.<br><br>MayHawk, your father was a smart man! <br><br>FLwolverine, we'll get to that. The thing to remember is that in 1830, all working class jobs had no pay and low benefits -- and this was one of the reasons why the economic history of 19th century America was a moonscape of booms and busts. As Henry Ford among others figured out thereafter, if your workers make enough money to buy the products they manufacture, things are going to go a lot better for everyone. <br><br>Bruno, no argument there! That's a useful way to think about synthetic fabrics, too -- basically, you're daubing yourself with crude oil. My wife likes to say that polyester fleece feels like exactly what it is: the slimy, decayed remnants of dead dinosaurs. <br><br>Donalfagan, there isn't much use of credit in the Lakeland Republic. The government at all levels is barred by the constitution from deficit spending; investment capital for business is available, but speculation is heavily taxed; mortgages are available from county banks, but for anything else, most people do the smart thing and save up in advance instead. Since the Republic was cut off from international credit markets for thirty years, those habits were pretty much inevitable, but they were also very productive, in ways we'll discuss. <br><br>Dfr2010, I'm not sure whether anyone thought of tarring and feathering, much less riding 'em out of town on a rail. During the Second Civil War and the troubled years immediately afterwards, for reasons we'll get to, it was not safe to be a former billionaire or corporate executive in most of North America, and some really regrettable things happened in rather too many cases. As for laws, in a sane society the laws are few, sensible, and strictly and uniformly enforced. I'll let you draw the logical conclusion about our society... ;-)<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c5592287019748372455 title="comment permalink">10/2/15, 6:20 PM</a><br><br>

One of the things that the Retrotopia project is meant to bring into focus is that right now, the past is a considerably more pleasant destination than the future toward which "progress" is headed -- so why not go there instead? <br><br>Jeff, thanks for the blast from the past! You're quite right, of course; it's been a very long time since I read that Brunner novel, and I'd forgotten about the paid-avoidance zones. Some dim memory thereof might have helped inspire the tier system. <br><br>James, stay tuned. Carr is going to want to see a tier 1 county -- he's convinced that he's going to find unremitting squalor. Is he in for a surprise...<br><br>Martin, I've used Primus stoves! Another blast from the past...<br><br>Bicosse, good. You get tonight's gold star for catching one of the bits of underlying strategy in this project! <br><br>Changeling, of course there are downsides, and we'll get to some of them as we proceed. <br><br>Shane, there's a lot of regional variation in how important the label "white" happens to be -- I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it's more important down South than, say, in the Midwest, and of course one of the points of the fiction is that different parts of the country are going their own way culturally and otherwise. What I see in large parts of the country is a transformation from the "melting pot" to a sort of tossed-salad effect, with different subcultures, ethnic and otherwise, that are learning to get along with one another in various ways. As for your earlier question, we'll get to that; the very short form is that, yes, the old myths finally imploded due to their failure to match lived experience. There's a rich irony in the banker's comment about history, since every generation creates its own history out of the raw materials of the past. <br><br>Tomxyza, nice! You might be interested to know that every big box clothing store in the Atlantic Republic has the same six or seven styles in the same three colors -- those change yearly, and marketers decide what are going to be the fashionable (that is to say, available) styles and colors. Ah, the wonders of limitless choice in the consumer's paradise...<br><br>Martin, as already noted, exactly. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, I probably need to do a nonfiction post on the way that direct and indirect subsidies make the entire notion of the free market a laughable fiction and guarantee idiotic consequences from allegedly objective economic decisions. <br><br>Caryn, the Lakeland Republic has rather more than a textile mill or two. Textiles are a major manufacturing sector; the woolen mills of Cleveland, the cotton mills of Paducah, the hemp mills of Milwaukee employ many thousands and contribute mightily to the Republic's economy. The spinning wheels and handlooms of the tier 1 counties are mostly a matter of families meeting their own needs, and it's fairly common except among the most hardcore Restos for homespun to go for everyday wear while store-bought fabric gets turned into Sunday go-to-meetin' clothing or what have you. As for the logic behind the broadly 1940s styles, exactly -- nostalgia for better days in the past is a powerful engine of human motivation, and tends to express itself in clothing among other things.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c3568435689676326994 title="comment permalink">10/2/15, 6:45 PM</a><br><br>

Railroads are privately owned though carefully regulated, and (since they're not a public utility) aren't subject to the tier system; even in a tier 1 county, odds are you've got a train stopping at least once daily at the county seat, and that means you can load your cargo into the appropriate rolling stock and have it anywhere in the Republic in a few days. (Note for the attentive: this is one of the reasons why locomotives carry their own fuel with them, rather than using electricity off a grid or the like.) Canals are public utilities, but canal technology is appropriate in any tier, so any county that has access to a canal is in good shape there also. (All the old canals either have been reopened by 2065 or are in process, and several new ones are being built; we'll discuss the funding mechanism down the road a bit.) Roads aren't much used for shipping freight except for very short distances -- say, from your sheep ranch to the county seat where there's a train system -- because, fuel being expensive and road systems no longer subsidized, it just doesn't make economic sense when train travel is so cheap. <br><br>Unknown Toni, glad to hear it! I've actually integrated climate change into this future scenario -- in 2065, for example, there's a lot of cotton grown in Kentucky and southern Illinois because the climate belts have shifted northward, and ports on the Great Lakes are thriving because the eastern seaports are having to cope with rising sea levels and are not doing too well at it.

But if we ever had to be actually self-supporting, I think we would have a good chance, because everyone grows veg, has chickens, fishes, hunts, has family with a farm or bit of land. There is lots of old infrastructure that would still be viable as well.

It amuses me to see neo-conservatives decrying this and that and yet at the same time they want government subsidies for road construction and maintenance. For them, confused and conflicted appears to be a lifestyle choice! Just sayin...<br><br>Now speaking of personal vehicles, and I do realise that you have about as much interest in them as perhaps you do in household powered climate control, but I was wondering whether you had taken note in the unfolding scandal over at the world's second biggest vehicle manufacturer VW? To cut a long story short it appears as if that manufacturer employed a dodgy software fix which appears to be able to run a second and more emissions friendly engine management program (in some diesel engine vehicles) - if the vehicles computer sensed that it was being tested in a laboratory. The other program was reserved for the real world. It would have been an easy check for the engine management computer too because if say a front wheel drive vehicle was in a laboratory on a dynamometer in operation, one set of wheels would be rolling, whilst the other was not. Easy.<br><br>The scandal in and of itself does not interest me, although the reputed number of diesel vehicle engines worldwide is apparently a huge number - truly massive, in fact quite impressive in scale. What does interest me in that scandal is that it perhaps indicates that a threshold has been reached and/or passed with vehicle engineering developments, whereby further decreases in emissions may be achieved, but the cost must be prohibitive. Diminishing returns in action! Why else would such a scandal take place? It is very alarming.<br><br>The funny thing is that if I diverted all of the solar photo-voltaic output here during the very depths of winter to the sort of electric vehicles being sold today, then I'd probably be able to drive perhaps about 20km (12.5 miles) in a day and not do much else. Oh well.<br><br>Thank you about the tea camellia. I'm going to try and replicate that win and double production (two plants! Don't laugh this is serious business!) over the next year and maybe chuck in a coffee plant for good measure too. You never know. Still chicory seems to be a whole lot easier.<br><br>Incidentally, the coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara) herb is going feral here at the moment and producing huge leaves and spreading out from its initial planting zone. I don't smoke anything and have never smoked, but I am aware that that particular herb is a major component of herbal cigarettes. I was wondering whether people in the Lakeland republic enjoyed the occasional smoke as I haven't noticed any references to it? No stress as I don't have a dog in that fight so if it is too controversial a subject no need to reply.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c1110138074509326773 title="comment permalink">10/3/15, 5:23 AM</a><br><br>

After ali, that includes the dust bowl era and many rampages of industrial logging.. J. Russel Smith among others in the early 20th century exposed how the soils had gotten badly depleted by the ahrucultural practices of the time. Much of the prosperity was driven by depletion of the land even before the chemical era began. Many hilly parts of the eastern half of the country lost the majority of thier topsoil before 1950. Some individuals were taking good care of their land, but I wouldn't call the culture at large sustainable.<br><br>Most of Lakeland does have more forgiving soils and climate than the rest of North America (regular moisture, mostly flat so fewer erosion issues), so there was less degradation going on there pre-1950s than many other places.

There are plenty of skills and technologies from then that are very valuable and worth revitalizing, I'm the last person to argue with that, but if any future North American society is going to have a sustainable relation with the land, I suspect it will have to include a mix and synthesis of influences from traditional America, other traditional societies, methods being figured out in the modern sustainability scene, and things that nobody has even thought of yet that will be figured out in the future.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c8391905117729724151 title="comment permalink">10/3/15, 11:34 AM</a><br><br>

That's why I had the prototypical Confederacy borrowing Mexico's racial founding myth, because the current one of the South as scapegoat for racism and poverty never served the South in the first place, and does not and will not match the reality of continued diversification, integration, and racial mixing, and I'm assuming that by the time the next Civil War begins, unity and harmony will be an even more pressing issue for the South than today.<br>"Shane, indeed we are.

It was meant for and did the most outstanding work on really heavy leather and felt or quadruple layers of denim; but I found it soooo easy to work on, I kept pushing it's limits with more delicate stuff like silk charmeuse and chiffons.

I'm quite sure NZ will still be around, and if they are smart they'll be doing something very similar to the Lakeland republic, mostly because it'll be forced onto them. Note that both NZ and Australia are very unlikely to descend into civil wars as there's much less regional differences and very different cultural history (eg, much more focus on being egalitarian; Australia required a living wage starting in 1907...sure right now it's looking very right wing but I think that's a temporary abberation), but when resources become tight, you never know.

I just realised that I wasn't thinking it through. Firstly, we already have the 19th century precedent of the clipper routes, which were to the UK but going to Montréal shouldn't be much different. Things Tasmania &amp; NZ can offer the Lakelanders include wine (they both have excellent terroirs that should survive global warming), out of season produce (different hemisphere and all that), meat (the first shipment of frozen NZ lamb was in 1882 so the tech definitely is doable), things that thrive in a Mediterranean climate (I could see Tasmanian olive oil being prized). I also wouldn't be surprised if both countries don't become prized coffee growers (climate change should actually help that). In return they get back manufactured goods (I'm assuming the industrial base will not get any better than today, which is to say minimal), prized lakeland cheese and culture: Books are prized when you live in tiny countries in the middle of the Pacific.<br><br>That said, small countries can't afford embassies everywhere.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c1731240863339990573 title="comment permalink">10/3/15, 8:24 PM</a><br><br>

My guess is that VW didn't get around to paying enough in bribes, is all. <br><br>Ozark, keep in mind that the Lakeland Republic has just spent thirty years under an embargo by most of the rest of the world, with three attempts at regime change and an outright invasion intended to force it back into line with the mid-21st century version of the global economy. Are they going to be enthusiastically open to all kinds of ideas from outside, given that history? Not yet. Give 'em twenty years and things may be different -- but the sort of angry affirmation of local values and local traditions that's very common in countries treated that way (consider Iran today) plays a significant role in giving plausibility to the transformations I'm chronicling. <br><br>As for new novels, music, etc., I take it you didn't read my earlier response to you. The musical I mentioned, "The Battle of Toledo," wasn't written in the early 20th century; it hasn't been written yet. It'll be written in 2063 by Joleen Williams, with music composed by Michael Wu -- by 2100, Williams &amp; Wu will be as famous in the history of the musical as Lerner &amp; Loewe, and very nearly as famous as Gilbert &amp; Sullivan -- and though it draws on the grand tradition of 20th century American musicals and takes its story from an event in local history, it's an original creation, part of the late 21st century revival of the theatrical musical as an art form.

Alchemists still use it -- in the Latin jargon of the art, it's called the <i>balneum Mariae</i> (Mary's or Miriam's Bath), and she's remembered by alchemists as Maria Prophetissa, "Mary (or Miriam) the Prophetess." <br><br>Alexandra, a lot depends on when something got built. In the decade or so right after Partition, getting plenty of housing and other necessary buildings up in a hurry was a priority, and a lot of very plain, undecorated buildings came out of that. More recently, as the Republic got its economy stabilized and thriving, fancy brickwork and carved stone came into fashion -- thus, among other things, the Capitol building with its white marble dome. As for herbalists, why, yes -- we'll be talking quite a bit about medicine as things proceed, and the shady practices that are used by the current medical and pharmaceutical industry to squeeze out competition from less expensive and intrusive modalities, where those are appropriate, have long since gone the way of the internet and the space program. <br><br>Shane, there's a lot of variation there. I'm thinking here of France after the Revolution, which abolished the old provinces and replaced them with small, compact, functional departments. The Lakeland Republic did much the same thing, and simply used counties as the smaller units. I'm quite sure the Confederacy has retained its states, and equally sure that some of the other new republics have abolished theirs. Texas may have divided itself up into sub-states just to be ornery!<br><br>Caryn, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Whomever, double posting is fine if you have more to contribute, as you do. Based on what you've said, I'm quite sure that sailing vessels carry freight from Tasmania and New Zealand to Montréal and whatever port on the lower Hudson River is replacing New York City now that the latter floods whenever there's a high tide and a strong onshore wind. In the absence of a formal embassy, by the way, small countries typically grant honorary consular status to a respectable citizen of theirs who lives in the country in question, and who then handles whatever minor duties happen to come up. The Tasmanian consul in Toledo is probably the person who runs the Lakeland office of a Tasmanian business that imports Lakeland machine parts, cheese, or what have you, and reports as necessary to the big Tasmanian embassy in Montréal. He's on a first name basis with second-string officials in the Lakeland Republic's State Department, and enjoys attending the occasional state function. <br><br>N Montesano, by all means talk to those housewives. You'll learn that a waterback on the woodstove plus a solar water heating system will give you the hot running water you want, and that there are refrigerators available that don't require grid electricity at all. Those are among the things that make lower-tier status attractive to a lot of people, housewives included.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c9094546555640186684 title="comment permalink">10/3/15, 11:31 PM</a><br><br>

The NW Coast was until recently home to Caterpillar Underground manufacturing, producing world class machinery. Businesses owned by the founder of that activity make world leading rail track maintenance equipment (Railmax) and specialist mine haulage trucks (Haulmax.)He has been a director of Caterpillar at the global level and his view is that the NW corner of Tasmania can compete easily in the manufacturing field. He has interests in a local company servicing wind generating towers and building specialist mine power supplies. Another local company exports oyster grading equipment globally and also manufactures a clever solution for using windmills to pump water from water sources deep down side valleys where the wind does blow using compressed air. Another builds huge mine flotation tanks that get shipped to the NW of Australia in bits and reassembled because they do it better and cheaper than the Asians who are closer. At the other end of the field we have a local vintage car enthusiast whose work in restoring old vehicles sees rich folks from all over the world sending their cars here for his magic touch which provides work for a number of skilled local artisans who do the upholstery and make the wooden spoked wheels and an old fashioned engineering shop in the small town of Smithton who do everything from replicating 1808 de Dion gearboxes to machining up a replica engine block from another car of the same era that no-one else in Australia would attempt. And the annual 4 day craft fair at Deloraine is as good as anything I have seen anywhere. On really important note, a Tasmanian whiskey recently won the title of worlds best, and yes the still was built here, quite possibly by that same Smithton engineering business as it would be far from the first they have built, having once set up a continuous process for turning sugar beets into alcohol based vehicle fuels. (it died courtesy of the oil companies who strong armed the government into refusing it a license)<br>The subcontractors that do most of the modern manufacturing are working together with the local University to create other products and (sadly) are about to turn their hands to military vehicles. We mine and process aluminium, Zinc, iron ore, and copper. Smelting steel is not done on island but there are casting works here whose products last longer and are much cheaper than the Krupp components they replace in the cement manufacturing plant. Mineralogically Tasmania is freakishly well endowed, we have an abundance of hydro-electric energy and wind power is under-utilised in terms of the potential from the Roaring Forties. We have a thriving marine manufacturing industry that produces both wooden and aluminium boats, including the holders of the transatlantic speed record and a world leading marine college training students from all over the world. Google Muir Winches, Incat Catamarans and The Hobart Wooden Boat festival. Also the annual Sydney to Hobart sailing race.Having worked with most of the players, big and small in service and sales roles, what holds this place back is not ability or capacity, but self confidence and an irritating communal ability to focus on the trivial while ignoring the obvious. If the effort spent avoiding having a real corruption watchdog was devoted to fixing the primary school education system and producing competent teachers who were actually allowed to teach the place would be impossible to beat. Great people, an awesome climate, lots of water, a sustainable energy supply, some excellent agricultural soils, and a 300 mile wide moat. That's why I made the decision to collapse voluntarily here over anywhere else on the planet. and yes JMG, it has a gate, and there is a view it might need to be shut in order to preserve what we have got before the wave of rich refugees sinks it. That conundrum is perhaps our biggest challenge in the future, balancing self preservation against an urge to support those fleeing hardship elsewhere. <br><br>eagle eye<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c8349170887984288274 title="comment permalink">10/4/15, 12:46 AM</a><br><br>

So Moses struck a rock with his rod and water gushed out. But while Miriam was alive, it was not necessary for Moses to do this. <br><br>Various teaching stories in the Talmud expand upon these Biblical passages to say that when the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness after escaping The Narrow Place (Egypt), they were sustained by manna through the merit of Moses, the guiding pillar of cloud by the merit of Aaron, and a miraculous traveling well by the merit of Miriam. According to what I read, the well is portrayed in a mural in the Dura Europus synagogue, which was destroyed in the third century CE, about a century before these well stories began to be written down. <br> <br>There is no logical reason why an Alexandrian alchemist would be called "prophetess" and I think she acquired it as a nickname because her namesake Miriam is one of the most well known women in the Bible and is associated with water.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c7632481611056440909 title="comment permalink">10/4/15, 1:40 AM</a><br><br>

I could securely hold my baby/child, wrapped in the open span of the sling's centre in the most suitable position with one hand, while using my other to secure and adjust the long strap into the rings. I've gone into detail because this design proved so easy to use, so versatile, and so movement friendly (we did almost all our international travel with one or another. child in my beautiful, simple sling) that we were never tempted to supplement it with a stroller.

The USA can be a great place despite what I read and hear in the daily news.<br><br>A good while back JMG hazarded in a comment to something that I wrote that UK would take the ‘world of hurt’ when ‘America went down’. That seemed to me very likely, but does not say it all. <br><br>Some comments these last few weeks suggest that going back to an earlier set of 'Americas' after the rubble had stopped bouncing might be salvation for some. <br><br>Some years ago I examined a similar comforting thought for us in UK. My wartime childhood (‘blood, sweat and tears’ and all) and even post-war grey rubble and rationing of food and clothing did not seem so bad. We had newly instated universal health care and we walked weekly to our public library and there were wonderful imaginative children’s programmes on radio. But, and here is the rub, even with constant ‘balance of trade’ difficulties – UK must import the majority of its calories and most raw materials – we still had coal: 700,000 miners to be exact. Mining families existed at about the economic level of miners in China today, and suffered the same overwhelming health hazards, of course. <br><br>My family lived in a comfortable lower middle class London suburb. OK, we had no car; dad cycled to work or got the train to London. He grew vegetables and a little fruit in the garden. Mum had no washing machine or refrigerator. As I said, we were tightly rationed for food and clothes, and our (relatively) expensive leather shoes needed sole and heels every few months. There was a cobbler and he was an important item of expenditure. Mum and dad worked pretty hard. <br><br>Our cooking was done with coal gas and our heating including hot water was by coke and coal. Our electricity was from coal-fired power stations. The country relied on a rail network (coal) and the electric London Underground and commuter rail again needed coal-fired power stations. Industry was fired and supplied and distributed by coal and to a much lesser extent by petroleum. We used a great deal of energy per capita.<br><br>This last point is worth rubbing in. Energy consumption per capita late 1940s and early ‘50s was not actually very different in UK from when my mum and dad were children before the First World War. OK, back in 1913 UK exported a third of its coal production, which helped pay for the imported food and the British Navy. Nowadays we are essentially mined-out of coal. There is no going back. What coal we use is imported for electric power. And for transport we overwhelmingly use petroleum. We rely heavily on Natural Gas for everything else, and that means increasingly we need imported NG. <br><br>The last time we fed ourselves was about 1850 when England’s population was under 20 millions. My guess is that we could survive a USA meltdown, but our world could easily shrink to ‘Europe’. It could get very tough if ‘Europe’ goes down. I personally cannot imagine for the UK any mixture of historical set-points that we could return to as the ‘energy pie’ and global trade shrinks. But I am open to ideas and appreciate the frugality of my mum and dad and our early childhood.

There is also the other problem for them that so many people would have been involved in the scam that sooner or later someone would spill the beans. It only takes one disgruntled ex-employee or even a disgruntled ex-spouse of a current employee to talk to the right people and spill the beans.<br><br>Of course you are totally correct in that it is most certainly not a public relation exercise and the problem cannot be handled that way because it is a problem on the material plane. You would think that they would understand that? What is also chilling to me is that someone, somewhere must have performed a cost-benefit analysis and decided that the cost of getting busted was cheaper than the cost of actually correcting the core problem. And what does that say? Hang onto your hat because we're in for a wild ride if those are the sorts of decisions that are getting made at the big end of town.<br><br>To be brutally honest, one of the main reasons for walking away from the big end of town was simply because I witnessed some very strange and often predatory practices going on up there. If they understood ecology a bit better, they would understand that predators are in business with their prey, but alas such understanding is not to be found there as they focus on the short term goal of domination instead.<br><br>PS: Stay safe in your cat3 Hurricane.

Like the shoe store, it just makes more sense and more money to stick with Tier 1 technology, when possible. <br><br>I am reminded that Ontario's industrial heartland was once far from its current southwestern seat, further north around the Ottawa Valley and its tributaries where the rivers come off the Canadian Shield. Hydroelectric power from Naigra changed all that, and produced the first dream of power 'too cheap to meter' and pushed the balance of power down to the old Loyalist regions of Upper Canada. I'm wondering now how far that nation extends -- the so-called "Golden Triangle", that peninsula of land surrounded on three sides by the Great Lakes, is really a territory unto itself. The rest of the province could and would gladly go a different way. Most of Northern Ontario is in a state of quiet resentment towards the South, but it's only at the level of muttering into ones beer. If divorce were in the air everywhere else, though? Don't draw the borders of Upper Canada further north than Georgian Bay. <br><br>I could easily see the northern Ottawa Valley, Temiskaming and the Lesser Clay Belt, along with the Mattawa, Monteal Rivers and associated tributaries flowing to and from Lake Nippising forming a hydraulic nation of their own, separate from the southern remnant of Ontario, with the French River providing a link to the North Channel of Georgian Bay. (Though the French alone is a tenuous link -- shipping across Lake Huron would, I am sure, keep Manitoulin and the Islands and North Shore of Georgian bay firmly in the orbit of Upper Canada, as they were historically.) The area I'm thinking would more easily see economic integration with Quebec, once you take cheap and easy highway transport out of the picture; indeed, the presence of a large Francophone minority might lead to annexation, if Quebec was feeling irredentist after Canada's partition. Could the capitol's shift to Montreal reflect a small westwards shift in the new nation's center of gravity? Here's a map for some geographic context of the area in question. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_River#/media/File:Ottawarivermap.png <br>The map doesn't show it, but Lake Temagimi drains into Lake Nippising, which drains into the Mattawa River, thence to the Ottawa and St. Laurence. Lake Abitibi to the north drains eventually into James Bay; that watershed was developed originally by steamships dragged across the Height of Land from the area under discussion. The Northwest is another matter altogether, and I'm not nearly as familiar with that area. Maybe a reader from the region could chime in?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c6589392993002299043 title="comment permalink">10/4/15, 10:12 AM</a><br><br>

That said, there's tracking "to the nearest tower", and there's tracking "by GPS" which can be much more precise (especially if you're in a rural area where towers are far apart). Theoretically, a system could be designed that didn't track phone locations, where each to-mobile call would send a region-wide paging message to "stand up to receive a call", but that would make the calls take longer to complete, and most customers wouldn't put up with that.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c2557009768719515223 title="comment permalink">10/4/15, 4:37 PM</a><br><br>

Suppose that, despite their best efforts, no one in the world has a diesel engine design that can meet the clean-air standards. (Technically, the problem is that the air itself is burning, not just the fuel, inside a high-compression/high-temperature engine. We all know that air is almost entirely nitrogen and oxygen, right? Under the right conditions, nitrogen and oxygen produce nitrogen-oxides, which are noxious pollutants.) The engineering team says "We can be clean or efficient, but not at the same time." So, the boss says "be clean when you need to be clean, for the emissions test, and be efficient when you need to be efficient, for the mileage test. Or, you can accept that your task is impossible, and look for another industry to work in." Maybe that's how we got where we are today.<br> <br>As JMG says from time to time, "just because you need it, doesn't mean that nature will provide it." There may be no way to meet the specification. <br><br>For the conspiracy-minded, one way to play this is to invest in electric cars. "But they can't compete against modern high-efficiency, internal-combustion (IC) engines!" you object. But if you have private knowledge that the performance claims of the IC vendors are pure fraud, which will make the electric more competitive, you have a chance.

There is very little geothermal and home grown biomass potential. I pulled together the thoughts of an online group of engineers back in 2008, which was published by a journal supported by the UK’s Open University (Ed. Professor Dave Elliot). The outline and numbers still stand, very roughly. If you are interested I can send you a Word copy. I am philsharris2zerozero2 at y..hoo ...uk<br><br>I am much less optimistic than appears from that document.<br><br>Calories sufficiency and agricultural history in the British Isles is a long story. We have about 10 times the population we had in England in 1750 and have seen both massive and early urbanisation and ‘demographic transition’. (http://www.clim-past.net/9/1161/2013/cp-9-1161-2013.pdf The other bits of the British Isles show a more complex history.) We have limited acreage for crop cultivation (plowable) and grain yields are poor in the much wetter western half dominated by the Atlantic. Elevation of even a few 100 feet also makes a very large difference, and uplands especially in Western Scotland are ‘something else’. Historically climate was easier in the Bronze Age but we were intermittently subject to risk of harvest failure across mediaeval and modern period - cooling trend to circa 1900. There were shortages and even famines, usually localised. Parts of Ireland were dominated by subsistence agriculture until mid 19th C (see also population increase in above pdf), which is a history in itself. ‘Commercialised farming’ and devotion to laissez faire economy (ideology) did not help millions of impoverished subsistence farmers in Ireland, but migration from rural to urban areas was inevitably a massive theme in 19th C across the whole industrialising world.<br><br>Just a note: Ireland generally is not suited to high yields of cereal but has something of the same West/East division as the mainland. Present policy focus of course is stuck with ‘adding value’ to supply chains for export of higher value products of dairy and meat farming in the globalised economy. <br><br>best<br>Phil H<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c8533424827657027052 title="comment permalink">10/5/15, 6:18 AM</a><br><br>

The current mess in the MENA countries is a fairly good example of it... so are the far-left and ecologist political currents here. And so used to be the far-right... before they started getting their worn-out arguments sexy. And that happened by clearing quite a few people away from the Front National.<br>@ donalfagan :<br>whatever angst is raging across the population, it is silent, like a forest fire which starts burning through the undergrowth before rising to flame through the most fiery oaks. I suspect, to echo Hubertus' comments, that it will mostly consumate the population of commoners itself.<br><br>Last Friday, I came back from that really quiet, upper-middle class, residential and office area. Back to the center of Paris, by metro. Opposite to me was sitting a guy in a suit, looking like your average executive... except that he started banging the floor violently, and shouting at me, accusing me of being spineless despite the nice expensive suit I was trying to wear. I showed him my woollen pullover, to get the point across that I was not one of the suits. Then he accused me of being scared, so I tried to put on my most relaxed composure. And then he went on about how the Chinese were eating our companies, how some civil servants at the station were just ruining our country... All the while two Maghreban young guys were smiling and watching, and I am not sure whom exactly they were making fun of. It may be a dumb thing to say, but I noticed that Maghreban people appear a lot better at relating with people and dealing with concrete situations in the moment, while the culture I have grown onto is mired in its own abstractions. They can deal with stuff like this... and if there is a revolution, I am not sure a lot of the proud French people would be able to fight instead of blindly marching on behind their daily routine.<br><br>Somehow I felt that the strange metro guy was just looking for both a culprit to agress, and someone to confy his angst to. If you are too scared, and wearing a nice suit, then you are the culprit. If on the other hand you can scare the guy more than he does you, then you are leading. If I were a psychopathic murderous failure at some vocation, I would start my reconversion as a charismatic leader now. One female politician is doing very well at that game just now... The funny thing is, on that same day I had received confirmation that my big client would have to more or less shed its IT department following a "merger" on rather unequal terms with a Swiss company. So deep inside me, I felt somewhere a vague sense of empathy with the shouting guy.<br><br>A pretty strange wind is blowing through our lands, and its stealthiness scares me even more than its potential power.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c252112502716281109 title="comment permalink">10/5/15, 4:49 PM</a><br><br>

That said, remember that this is <i>Retro</i>topia...<br><br>Phil, no question, Britain's going to have a very rough time as the industrial age ends, one way or another. So's the rest of the world, for that matter. <br><br>Cherokee, this week's post is going to take another brief vacation from Retrotopia to talk about that exact point, the widening gap between abstractions on various glass screens and facts on the ground. It's a massive issue, and the chasm between the two bids fair to grow wide enough that industrial civilization risks plummeting into it, never to be seen again. The hurricane seems to have given us a miss -- I'd encourage my readers in western Europe to keep an eye on it, though, because current models have it zooming your way. <br><br>Patricia, the book you want is <i>The Jewish Alchemists</i> by Raphael Patai -- well worth reading generally as a history of a neglected tradition in alchemy. It summarizes what's known of Maria Prophetissa in an early chapter. <br><br>Dfr2010, that sounds very Texan! <br><br>Ozark, this story is intended to stomp on a lot of sore toes and hit a whole range of emotional nerves. That sort of shock value is the only way I can think of to break through certain automatisms of contemporary thought. <br><br>Nastarana, in the Lakeland Republic slavery is forbidden by the constitution, and a capital crime in the national legal code. That would apply, for example, to a pimp who kept prostitutes locked up against their will, or a wealthy person who did the same thing to domestic help. <br><br>Patricia, that's a good point -- when I revise, I'll put logos all over the clothing of the immigrant family. Carr's status shows in the fact that there are no logos at all on his clammy, putty-colored clothes. <br><br>Aron, I wish you could tune into the Toledo AM stations! There are at least a dozen of them, with a great diversity of programming. <br><br>Tyler, my guess is that there's quite a bit of variation, depending on whether there are good hydropower sites available -- you need a decent vertical drop to get much power out of runnign water. Still, where the topography permits, yes, that would be a very economical way to run things, not least because direct-drive hydropower entails no smokestack taxes.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c2198630656597109562 title="comment permalink">10/5/15, 6:31 PM</a><br><br>

Again, remember that this is <i>Retro</i>topia. Perhaps we should have a little contest here, to design a flag for the Lakeland Republic that looks suitably retro -- like something a 19th or early 20th century designer might have come up with. It has to be something that could be made with colored cloth, scissors, and a needle and thread, by the way. <br><br>Donalfagan, or you need executives who recognize that their employees aren't disposable components, and a government that recognizes that its constituency isn't limited to the absurdly rich. <br><br>Hubertus, that conviction is the product of a study of history. You've presented one example -- Germany during the 20th century. I've pointed out that your rule doesn't hold good in other cases -- for example, Russia before vs. after 1917 -- and noted that, as a whole, the elite classes of failing civilizations tend to be first up against the wall when things go down. The descendants of the Roman senatorial class didn't rule the post-Roman world, to cite another example! I've discussed this at great length in earlier posts <a href=../../2014/09/dark-age-america-senility-of-elites.html rel=nofollow>such as this one</a>; if you disagree, that's certainly your right, and we'll just have to see whose prediction turns out to be more accurate. <br><br>RPC, understood, but it still required a lot of infrastructure investment. It's entirely possible that at some point down the line, some of the Lakeland Republic's railroads will electrify. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, in 2065, those supposedly unhygienic cheeses will be prized articles of trade, imported via Montréal and sold at good prices all through the North American republics. (Well, except for Texas, where the Anglos insist that Velveeta is the only cheese worth eating and the Hispanic majority is much more fond of Mexican and Mexican-style cheeses.) By then, fortunately, the horrors of 2015 will be a distant memory -- though I'm sorry to say they'll likely have been supplanted by more recent horrors...<br><br>Pygmycory, the Russians at least are ready for the possibility -- thus the antiaircraft systems they have in place around their base at Latakia, not to mention the flotilla of naval vessels from the Black Sea fleet (headed by the guided missile cruiser <i>Moskva</i>) sitting right off shore. The fundamentalist militias trying to overthrown Assad's government, it probably bears noting, have no air force or navy, so there's no question whose ships and planes the Russians want to deter! <br><br>Shane, it was partly a matter of getting out from under the immense debts run up by many state governments, and partly a decision to flatten out the topheavy governmental structure. I wonder if counties were combined in the former state of Kentucky -- do you think that would get popular approval, or are people attached to their small counties? <br><br>Jean-Vivien, a strange wind is rising all over, and I don't know that it's going to blow anybody any good.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c2501760375536391712 title="comment permalink">10/5/15, 6:56 PM</a><br><br>

I'll check with the UNM library. <br><br>Speaking of putty-colored. Over a year ago, with my brother coming to town, I ran out and got a bed-in-a-bag set from the nearest bog box store and put it on the futon (made comfortable by 5" foam pads under each half. Yes, this is relevant. The bottom sheet was deep enough to encompass both layers of mattress, and the comforter was both lightweight and warm, with a nice pattern on it. <br><br>Two weeks ago, having traded in Old Lumpy for something I could sleep on without outraging an arthritic hip, I hauled out the bed-in-a bag, since modern mattresses of such comfort are just as deep and for the same reason. Ay! It's all microfiber. It won't stay neat and it won't stay put, but moving around on it easily is not to be had. The pattern of the comforter and pillow shams are pretty. The rest has a dull but mildly varied pattern whose main color, like that of the other side of the reversible comforter, is --- putty.<br><br>Yes, indeed, I AM digging out the all cotton bedding, which certain mail order houses still sell, plus my good old shabby crazy quilt; and the bed-in-bag will go right to the Salvation Army, in hopes some homeless person will gain some benefit from it, if only from the price of its sale. <br><br>But back at the big box store looking for a bedspread, which can't be had for love nor money there (back to mail order, a house specializing in traditional products for old folks and retro types real and pseudo), let alone a lightweight, simple one, I saw most of the bedding there WAS microfiber.

A bit of trivia that ties into what you said about counties being kept small to make travel to the county seats more accessible to the populace: The county in which I reside is called a "Reconstruction" county precisely for that reason. The circuit judge who had to travel by horseback for weeks to visit all the communities to hold court appealed to the legislature to make a new county and the legislature agreed promptly. That was in 1868 and they named the county in honor of the judge making the request.<br>In my search I also learned that Texas has the most counties at 254.

From within! From the others! From "above"! Loosing it, its most horrid. Well, there I am. Jean-Vivien, talking about that drown car owners amd fury workers torning apart dresses from executives. Love? <br>Yes! That I do love myself is important for me individually. That I am been respected by society is moreover neccessary socially. <br><br>Well, a car is far more than a metallic transportation vehicle. I guess most people feel personally quite good, being a car-owner. That´s an important status symbol, isn´t it. Part of ones own personality. Even adored explicitely by some. It´s giving and bringing you respect. Soacked with love ... Therefore I understand well, that these people rushed for their PRECIOUS. Trying to secure them. Do full of fear to loose their beloved. An irobic twist of fate. But still it´s all about love ...!<br><br>Then that angry workers; Angry, anxious, fearful, panicstrikken, to loose so much. Their life income and prestigious employment. Earning respect in society and for them personally. Might be you don´t feel their horrors to become sacked and being jobless. They must be aghast, I believe so. Being unemployed, people don´t respect you anymore. Oneself looses its self-respect. Love evaporates. Their irrational fear is most reasonable. I feel with them as much, knowing so well that malady they are afraid of.<br><br>So you see; Either automobile or torn shirts. All about love! That´s all we want. That´s all we need. A pity, we have such unfortunate strategies to reach for our aim.<br><br>To conclude it comes together with our fear of the limits of growth and our addiction to comfy life. We are all connected by our urge for love and that fear to loose it. I see, that it does lead us both ways, either down into the abyss or towards the save haven.<br><br>To simplify the complexity lets make love and survive the nemesis. &lt;3<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c3263498143906389884 title="comment permalink">10/5/15, 8:26 PM</a><br><br>

I disagree with Putin (just another human being, stuck for now in the hot seat) for embracing capitalism as thoroughly as he does at this time.

Our P.U.D. in Jefferson County, WA gets all it's power from Bonneville Hydro. I have a problem with what that does to salmon runs; reducing electric use and building out wind turbines come to mind. The former is not particularly compatible with electric cars.<br><br>Secondly, stationary power plants don't have a problem with the weight of scrubbers and various anti-pollution devices; so even a coal fired grid electric car gets the equivalent of about 90 - 95 miles per gallon. There is still CO2, but much less than from a gas or diesel powered car of the same performance (about in proportion to the improved mileage). This is in part because Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) max out at about 25% effeciency; and when idling in traffic, the engine is still running. Hence the efficiency of hybrids; which is reduced compared to a low powered ICE under freeway conditions.<br><br>That being said, the embedded energy is still the same, and it's silly for every adult in the nation to have 3,000 to 6,000 pounds of iron, rubber and glass and nine parking spaces just to get around. In the early '20's IIRC, fewer than 10% of U.S. urban families had cars, while around 90% of rural families did.

He is very outspoken (and very frustrated), esentially saying that the Iraqis are "afraid as dogs" to fight the IS *despite massive U.S. bombardment of IS forces*, confirming that you can´t win a war with air attacks alone. He further states that the U.S. is gradually abandoning its operations in Iraq, concentrating on Syria instead. <br><br>But - here´s my point - who are the ground forces in Syria? The CIA-trained "Free Syrian Army" is relatively weak. The Syrian army of Assad is much stronger. Thus, the obvious victor in Syria seems to be Russia - they bomb from the air, and Assad´s troops (and perhaps the Kurds?) advance on the ground. If so, the U.S. has already lost, unless Obama and Kerry are secretly hoping for a Turkish ground invasion - not a good option, since northern Syria is controlled by the Kurds, and the IS probably export oil in secret to Turkey, making the Turks crypto-allies of the guys they are supposed to weed out. <br><br>As matters stand today, there seem to be only three options: the U.S. starts cooperating with Russia (highly unlikely), the U.S. leaves Syria to Russia (could happen - Obama wanted to attack Syria a few years ago, but was forced to back down) or a war between, ahem, the NATO member Turkey and Russia... Let´s hope that one *doesn´t* happen! <br><br>Frankly, the last couple of months haven´t been fun here in Old Europe, and it´s not getting any better, is it? :-( <br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c454812959879188242 title="comment permalink">10/6/15, 5:55 PM</a><br><br>

This is exactly what i'm saying - you suggest to a Russian that you know better what did occur in Russian history. Why are you so sure? Because what you have read is truth from enlightened democratic sources, and what I had - pure domestic propaganda, right? And yes, you mentioned Solzhenitsin as if it was impossible for him to lie. Why so? There are quite a lot of people pointing out that he indeed was lying and exaggerating. There are actual historians working with actual documents in actual archives who say that the picture is different. But that's in Russian and the political course is to get over that part of history, so their voices are muted.<br>On a personal experience, all my elder relatives had dufferent memories. It was difficult time, but not such a bloody tirany.<br><br>@donalfagan<br>That link is an account of a political struggle short time after the revolution by a political opponent who fled country, so some bias is expected. But even if you take everything as it is there - I would say that there is not much actual terror going on there. good chances this is like politics works right now.<br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-change-of-habit.html#c5131217390977908380 title="comment permalink">10/9/15, 9:27 AM</a><br><br>
