<div class=MsoNormal>
I don’t normally comment in these essays on the political affairs of other countries. As I’ve noted more than once here, the last thing the rest of the world needs is one more clueless American telling everyone else on the planet what to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What’s more, as the United States busies itself flailing blindly and ineffectually at the consequences that its own idiotically shortsighted decisions have brought down upon it, those of us who live here have our work cut out for us already.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That said, a sign I’ve been awaiting for quite some time has appeared on the horizon—the first rumble of a tectonic shift that will leave few things unchanged. Unsurprisingly, this didn’t happen in the United States, but I was somewhat startled to see where it did happen. That would be in Britain, where Jeremy Corbyn has just been elected head of Britain’s Labour Party. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who don’t follow British politics may not know just how spectacular a change Corbyn’s election marks. In the late1990s, under the leadership of Tony Blair, the Labour Party did what erstwhile left-wing parties were doing all over the industrial world: it ditched the egalitarian commitments that had guided it in prior decades, and instead embraced a set of policies that were indistinguishable from those of its conservative opponents—the same thing, for example, that the Democratic party did here in the US. As a result, voters going to the polls found that their supposed right to shape the destiny of their nations at the voting booth had been reduced to irrelevance, since every party with a shot at power embraced the same set of political and economic policies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That might have been bearable if the policies in question worked, but they didn’t, they don’t, and it’s becoming increasingly clear that they never will. Proponents of the neoliberal consensus—I probably have to explain that label, don’t I? It’s a source of wry amusement to anybody who knows the first thing about the history of political economy that the viewpoint considered “conservative” in today’s America is what used to be known as liberalism, and still has that label in economics. Unrestricted free trade, no government interference in business affairs, no government protections for the poor, and an expansionist and militaristic foreign policy: these were the trademarks of liberal political and economic thought all through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those same policies came back into fashion as neoliberal economics, and as “conservative” politics, in the late twentieth century. Since then, proponents of neoliberalism have insisted that deregulation for industry and finance, tax cuts and government handouts for the rich, a rising spiral of punitive austerity measures for the poor, and a violent and amoral foreign policy obsessed with dominating the Middle East by force, would bring economic stability and prosperity at home and maintain peace overseas. That was the sales pitch that was used to sell these policies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I think most people have begun to notice by now, though, that the policies in question have had precisely the opposite effect, not just once but wherever and whenever they’ve been tried. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I encourage my readers, especially those who favor the neoliberal policies just outlined, to stop and think about that for a moment. Around the globe, where businesses have been deregulated, taxes cut for the rich and government money poured into their hands, harsh austerity measures imposed on the poor, and foreign policy turned into a set of excuses for lobbing bombs at Middle Eastern countries, stability, prosperity, and peace have not been forthcoming—in fact, quite the contrary. At best, neoliberal policies bring a brief burst of relative prosperity, followed by a long slide into increasingly intractable crisis; at worst, you go straight into the crisis phase, and then things just keep getting worse. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Logically speaking, if the policies you propose don’t yield the results you expect, you change the policies. That’s not what’s happened so far in this case, though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Quite the contrary, the accelerating failures of neoliberalism have been met across the board by an increasingly angry insistence from the corridors of power that neoliberal policies are the only options there are. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What Jeremy Corbyn’s election shows is that that insistence has just passed its pull date. Corbyn’s an old-fashioned Labourite of the pre-Blair variety, and he’s made it clear for decades that he supports the opposite of the neoliberal consensus: more regulation of finance and industry, higher tax rates and fewer handouts to the rich, more benefits for the poor, and a less aggressive foreign policy. When he entered the race to head the Labour Party after Ed Milliband’s embarrassing electoral defeat earlier this year, party apparatchiks rolled their eyes and insisted that he didn’t have a chance. What they hadn’t noticed, and what the establishment across the industrial world has by and large never noticed either, is that the consensus is only a consensus among a privileged minority, and most people outside those rarefied and self-referential circles will vote against it if they’re given half a chance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s what happened in the Labour Party election. When the ballots were counted, Corbyn had staged a monumental upset, winning by a landslide on the first ballot with a total three times as large as his nearest rival’s. What’s more, since his election, people who’ve stayed out of party politics in Britain have been joining the Labour Party in droves, convinced that at long last they have the chance to have their voices heard. Until and unless he loses a general election or some other Labour Party figure mounts an effective challenge against him, Corbyn’s now the leader of Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition and the heir apparent to No. 10 Downing Street should Labour come out ahead in the next election. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Whether that’s a desirable outcome or not is not something I propose to discuss here, as that choice is up to the people of Great Britain and nobody else. Myself, I’m not a great fan of Corbyn’s variety of socialism, or for that matter most of the others; it seems to me that there are many better ways to run a society—though it’s only fair to say that the neoliberal consensus is not one of these. What makes Jeremy Corbyn’s meteoric rise important is that it shows just how fragile the neoliberal consensus actually is, and how readily it can be overturned by any politician who’s willing to break with it and start addressing the concerns of the eighty to ninety per cent of the population who don’t agree with it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That fragility need not lead to better things. Here in the United States, Donald Trump remains sky-high in the polls for exactly the same reason Jeremy Corbyn now heads the Labour Party: he’s willing to talk about things the political establishment refuses to discuss. In his case the unspeakable issue is the de facto policy, supported by both parties, of encouraging illegal immigration to the United States in order to drive down wages for the working classes and maintain a facade of prosperity for the privileged. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A great many Americans are concerned about that, and not unreasonably so. Whether allowing mass immigration to the United States is a good idea or not, it’s fair to say that sharply limiting the number of legal immigrants and then turning a blind eye to illegal immigration lands us in the worst of both worlds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The only people who benefit from it are the employers who get to pay substandard wages to illegal immigrants, and the privileged classes whose lifestyles are propped up thereby. Since the voices of the privileged are the only ones that have been let into our collective conversation about politics for the last three and a half decades, the concerns of the broader public haven’t been addressed; now Trump is addressing them, and he just might end up in the White House as a result. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He’s not the only one who’s riding that particular issue to the brink of power. Marine Le Pen, to name just one example, is more or less France’s Donald Trump—though, France being France, she has better fashion sense and a less absurd hairstyle. Europe’s privileged classes encourage unlimited immigration, just like their American equivalents, to force down wages and break the political power of the working classes, and Le Pen’s Front National has harnessed the resentment of all those French voters who have been on the losing end of those policies for decades. Nor is France the only European nation where that’s an explosive issue. The British politicians and pundits who are busy decrying Corbyn’s election just now might want to temper their rage and consider the alternatives: if Corbyn falls, Nigel Farage and the UKIP party are waiting in the wings to harness the public’s frustration with the abject failure of business as usual, and if Farage falls in his turn, what replaces him could be much, much worse. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The mere fact that a failed consensus is cracking at the seams, in other words, does not guarantee that what replaces it will be an improvement. All it means is that there’s an opening through which a range of alternative visions can enter the political conversation of our time, and perhaps find an audience among the disenfranchised and disillusioned. That some such window of opportunity was on its way comes as no surprise; as a student of history, I’ve long taken comfort in the fact that even the most thoroughly entrenched political and economic orthodoxies have finite life spans, and will eventually be hauled out with the trash. Much of what I’ve done over the last nine years on this blog has been a matter of getting ready for the opening of that window, putting certain ideas into circulation among those few who were ready to hear them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s a more important step than I think many people realize. In Germany in the early 1930s, when a failed consensus finally came apart, the only alternative visions that had any significant presence were the Leninist version of Marxian socialism, on the one hand, and a bubbling cauldron of racist fantasies and radical antirationalism on the other; the latter triumphed, and no doubt most of my readers are aware of what followed. In other places and times, less psychotic options have been available, and the results have generally been much better. The Zapatista rebels in southern Mexico a while back favored the slogan “another world is possible,” and of course they’re quite right—but a great deal depends on what kind of other world people are prepared to imagine. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is why, for example, the last three posts here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> have been devoted to a narrative describing a future very different from the one that most Americans like to imagine: a future in which the United States slams facefirst into a brick wall of unintended consequences, plunges into a bloody civil war, and fragments thereafter, and in which one of the fragments pursues a set of political and economic policies that go zooming off at right angles to the conventional wisdom of our time. I expect to resume that narrative next week, and to continue it with an assortment of interruptions thereafter, precisely because a less impoverished sense of the possible futures open to us is so crucial in facing the rising spiral of crises that defines our time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a source of some amusement to me that I’ve fielded a fair number of comments insisting that I have to reshape the narrative just mentioned to fit one or another version of the conventional wisdom. This blog’s focus being what it is, most of them have fixated on one or another aspect of what might as well be called the Ecotopian model—the last really imaginative vision of the future in this country, which was midwifed by Ernest Callenbach in his brilliant 1974 utopian fiction <i>Ecotopia</i>. If you know your way around today’s American Green scene, even if you haven’t read a word Callenbach wrote, you know his ideas, because they still shape an enormous amount of what passes for original thought today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s not a model I’m interested in rehashing. Partly that’s because not that many people outside the San Francisco Bay region find Callenbach’s vision especially appealing; partly it’s because some aspects of the model, notably the claim that solar and wind power can support something akin to modern middle class American lifestyles, haven’t held up well in the light of experience; but it’s also partly because other worlds are also possible. The Ecotopian conventional wisdom is not the only option. It’s an option toward which I have a nostalgic fondness—I was wildly enthusiastic about Callenbach’s book back in the day—but it’s not the only game in town, and all things considered, it’s not the option I would choose today. Thus <i>Retrotopia</i>, as the name suggests, is not going to be full of avid spandex-clad cyclists who dine on the produce of permacultured edible forests, or what have you. It’s heading in directions that are far more threatening to the status quo—including, by the way, the Ecotopian status quo. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The crying need for an abundance of alternative visions of the future, apart from the conventional wisdom of our time, has also driven another core project of this blog, and with that in mind, I’m delighted to announce the winners of <a href=../../2015/03/planet-of-space-bats.html>this year’s Space Bats challenge</a>. Those of my readers who are new to <i>The Archdruid Report</i> may not know that since 2011, this blog has hosted a series of contests in which readers have submitted short stories set in a variety of deindustrial futures—that is, futures in which industrial society as we know it is a thing of the past, our current complex technologies have faded into legend, and human beings are busy coping with the legacies of the industrial age and leading challenging, interesting, and maybe even appealing lives in that context. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first Space Bats challenge was a shot in the dark, and to my delighted surprise, it fielded a torrent of fine short stories, the best of which were duly published by Founders House Publishing as an anthology titled <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2012/10/on-sale-after-oil-sf-visions-of-post.html>After Oil: SF Visions of a Post-Petroleum Future</a>. A second contest duly followed in 2014, and produced two anthologies, <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2015/01/new-release-after-oil-2-years-of-crisis.html>After Oil 2: The Years of Crisis</a> and <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2015/04/new-release-after-oil-3-years-of-rebirth.html>After Oil 3: The Years of Rebirth</a>. The fourth contest was launched in March of this year; as before, I was deluged with an abundance of excellent stories, and had a hard time choosing among them; I owe thanks to everyone who submitted a story and made the choice so difficult; but the following stories will be included in the next anthology, <i>After Oil 4: The Future’s Distant Shores</i>:
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sail Away Home” by Alma Arri</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Finding Flotsam” by Bill Blondeau</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Alay” by Dau Branchazel</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Crow Turns Over a Rock” by Eric Farnsworth</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Notes for a Picnic” by Phil Harris</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The Remembrancer” by Wylie Harris<br>
“The Bald Eagle, the Lame Duck, and the Cooked Goose” by Jonah Harvey</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The Baby” by Nicky Jarman</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Northern Ghosts” by Gaianne Jenkins</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Caretaker Poinciana” by Troy Jones</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Scapegoat” by Cathy McGuire</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Flowering” by John W. Riley</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I trust you’ll join me in congratulating the authors and, more to the point, in reading their stories once those see print. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In its own small and idiosyncratic way, my experience with the Space Bats challenge parallels the political earthquake currently shaking the British landscape. All I did was ask readers to come up with stories that broke with the conventional wisdom concerning the future—to set aside the weary, dreary, endlessly rehashed Tomorrowland of spaceships, zap-guns, and linear technological expansion along the same lines we think we’re following today, and imagine something different—and as it turned out, that’s all I had to do. Given the opportunity to write about some less hackneyed future, scores of readers lunged for their keyboards and flooded each contest with quirky, thoughtful, interesting futures...you know, the kind of thing that science fiction used to feature all the time, back before it got sucked into the role of cheerleading for a suffocatingly narrow range of acceptable tomorrows. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There will be another Space Bats challenge, beginning in the spring of next year. I invite my readers to propose potential themes for that challenge—this fourth anthology consists entirely of stories set at least a thousand years in the future, and I’d like to have some equally offbeat focus or limitation on the next contest, in the hope that it will inspire an equally stellar collection of stories. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m also pleased to note that the <i>After Oil</i>
anthologies and my post-peak novel <i>Star’s Reach</i> are far from the only contributions to a growing genre. Founders House, for example, has also recently published Ralph Meima’s novel <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2015/07/new-release-inter-states-fossil-nation.html>Fossil Nation</a>, the first volume of a trilogy, which offers its own lively and readable glimpse at a future that cuts across the conventional wisdom of our time and heads off in new directions. Other projects are in the works, at Founders House and elsewhere. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At the same time, it’s worth remembering that the same process is under way on a much vaster scale, and with much more serious consequences. As the neoliberal consensus shatters and the failure of its policies becomes impossible to ignore any longer, another world is not merely possible, it’s inevitable. The question is purely what ideas, visions, dreams, hopes, and shuddering terrors will shape the world that will emerge from neoliberalism’s smoldering corpse—and that, dear reader, will be determined in part by what you yourself are willing to imagine, to work for, and to struggle for, during the difficult years ahead of us. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
*****</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One other note may be relevant in this context. Many of the readers of this blog will be familiar with my alternative-future novel <i>Star’s Reach</i>. Ever since it was published, I’ve fielded requests for more fiction set in the same imaginary future, and while I’m flattered by the requests, my fiction is heading in other directions at least for now. As a result, Founders House Publishing and I have been talking about the possibility of transforming the setting of <i>Star’s Reach</i> into a shared world to which many authors can contribute, and doing at least one anthology—and possibly more—of short stories set in 25th-century Meriga, or the wider future in which Trey sunna Gwen and his companions have their place. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Obviously that’s a project that would require a dozen enthusiastic authors at least. My question is whether anyone’s interested in writing stories for such an anthology. If this interests you, please post a comment here; if there’s enough interest, we can get the project rolling. </div>

I'm an expat Brit, left the UK for Canada in 2005, now about to return to the UK after 10 years in exile, and I too was astonished that Jeremy Corbyn had been elected Labour Party leader - in fact for a moment I thought I was having some sort of hallucination. I remember him well as a "fringe leftie" in the 1980s and 90s, always in the news for some outspoken, left-of-centre position, but having absolutely zero chance of being invited into the inner circle of people who made the real decisions. He used to have long(ish) red hair and a red beard, and it's a bit of a shock now to see him with short white hair and a white beard, but it does give him more gravitas.<br><br>I don't know American politics as well as you know British politics, but I can't think of any American equivalent to Corbyn.

To those inside they will stay invisible. Inside the bubble the only things seen are those things which fit onto the political continuum from left to right. One fun aspect of which is the curiosity that what passes for hard left now is Richard Nixon's domestic policies, and there is no hard right, just Conservative. At any rate today's 'hard left' is moldy old Socialism which for me and many has the vague emotional appeal of old fashioned liberal social values but nostalgia is not my game. As a practical matter socialism is as far removed from the real big issues confronting mankind as is the most reactionary Tea Party doyens expecting Jesus to descend soon somewhere near the Texas-Oklahoma border soon.<br><br>The parallels being Corbyn and Trump represent beginning of the reset or exhaustion of official political parties. With the kicker being they are coming from opposite sides of the old now outmoded continuum. In the big picture of course the old continuum is the road to nowhere.

The party has spent the past four years doing its best to shift to the centre in order to woo a few more votes with promises that they are not doing business as they once did and are a more palatable option to the general electorate. The capper on this particular shift has come in the form of a promise to only run balanced budgets during a four year term of government. So, austerity without saying as much.<br><br>Then yesterday in the midst of the 2015 Federal election campaign, Naomi Klein launched the Leap Manifesto alongside reps from labour unions, First Nations, environmental groups etc. Some of the traditional NDP support base. Obvious comparisons are being drawn in the media, though Klein insists the initiative is not in support of any one particular party.<br><br>Which raises an interesting point to which JMG alluded in his post. If one believes (based on reading JMG and others of his ilk) that "business as usual" is leading us down the road to ruin, and if major political formations are just slight variations on the business as usual model (neoliberalism), what is one to do when confronted with such limited options on the ballot? Is voting in these circumstances unimportant and irrelevant? At least in theory, there is more to the political process than voting day, and one of the points that Klein makes is that the idea behind the Manifesto is to raise the profile of these issues to the point that no matter who is elected, that person / party must take steps to answer the questions raised if sufficient noise is made. But insofar as the political process is highly controlled, manipulated and sanitized to prevent ideas outside of the narrowly defined set permitted, is it better to disregard elections that feature a lack of actual options and work instead outside the political process? Or be vigilent and look for opportunities created by the breaking of consensus which brought about the change in the UK Labour Party?<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c1543003105952317384 title="comment permalink">9/16/15, 6:15 PM</a><br><br>

In 1997 I was amazed to see a Labour prime minister, Tony Blair, invite the formerly despised political enemy, Mrs Thatcher, to visit 10 Downing Street. Gordon Brown did the same, shortly after he became prime minister. And in 2013 Mrs Thatcher / Baroness Thatcher died and was given a state funeral, no less - the first for a politician since that of Winston Churchill. Two years later, the leader of the Opposition, in this supposedly permanently Thatcherised Britain, is the sort of semi-Marxist whom Mrs T thought she had consigned to the dustbin of history. How times change. Still, I'm not particularly surprised.

The full-on onslaught of media vitriol being poured onto the slightest perceived flaw is testament to the way he has riled the 'establishment'. Whether or not one agrees with his full programme, there's no denying he is a very different kind of politician, and a breath of fresh air for that alone. It's sort of gratifying to see all the Blairite aparatchiks backing away. Goodness only knows how long it will last, but for now Labour has become a party of the Left again.<br><br>His first showing at PMQ (Prime Minister's Questions) was a real eye-opener. Instead of the usual charade of recent years, he fielded a list of questions from the PUBLIC! Oh, the humanity. More telling was that the public had sent in over 40,000 questions they wanted putting to the PM. It became POLITICS again - a discussion of policy - rather than the usual bad-tempered sniping from the massed ranks of spin-doctors and focus-groups and electoral strategists that had previously concocted the appropriate 'soundbite of the week' for the Opposition Leader to field.<br><br>It's hard to imagine where it's all going, but I think it will be a thrilling ride for a while - even if it's for nothing more than the thrill of seeing the Labour Party actually standing for something more than just just getting re-elected, which seems to be the only pre-occupation of the Blairite wing.

As long as our current prime minster John Key smiles, people keep voting for him, regardless of how dismally his policies are failing. To be fair though, the economic political situation is still in my view a few years from getting to anything like critical. For now our government can keep imposing spending cuts, selling of state owned assets and running up a bigger and bigger deficit, and in the short term, everything will at least superficially appear to be ok. At this stage even the greens, though trying to talk policy, have to do a considerable amount of neo-liberal window dressing.

I'll try to be very clear about what I'm looking for, if the project gets off the ground. The two main rules will be (a) every word of the published version of <i>Star's Reach</i> is canonical, and (b) don't try to drag Meriga back to today's conventional wisdom. What that latter means, if I may expand a bit, is that the core theme of the novel is that industrial society is over and will not be coming back, and stories that try to impose the mythology of progress on Meriga by any means -- industrial enclaves hiding out in some other corner of the world, heroic young technologists overcoming the burden of superstitious reverence for nature to get progress going again, et cetera, ad nauseam -- will be chucked in the shredder bin at once. Other than that, I'm open to pretty much any kind of story in any kind of style. Still, we can discuss this in more detail if the project gets under way. <br><br>Ice Torch, one of the comforts of history is that nobody's permanent revolution is ever actually permanent. Of course that's one of history's frustrations as well!<br><br>Travis, yes, I've seen the same sort of thing. There are some good ideas marketed under the Permaculture label, but there are also plenty of good ideas outside it -- a point that overenthusiastic followers of the movement -- would one call them Permians? -- tend to miss. <br><br>Isaac, one of the reasons I gradually lost interest in most science fiction after 1990 or so is that the sort of sweeping vision and relentless originality you find in Le Guin et al. got replaced by endless rehashes of the same images and ideas. I still read a lot of old SF and fantasy, but when I glance at the rack of new paperbacks at the local library, it's very much a matter of "Yeah, that was already old hat before I grew my first beard." <br><br>Cherokee, oh, granted! But the political inertia stands in the way of even trying to deal with the consequences of the geological and ecological predicament, and if that can be shoved aside, at least here and there, some useful things might be accomplished. <br><br>Tony, even from the other side of the pond, it's a spectacle worth watching. You should have put down the fiver!<br><br>ChaosAdventurer, thanks for the tip. So far, as far as I know, the <i>After Oil</i> anthologies have gotten zero press in the science fiction scene -- not surprising, all things considered. If that sort of story becomes more widely popular, the results might be interesting. <br><br>Tom, oh, granted, some nations are further along the curve than others. <br><br>Claire, I think a spandex-eating microbe was accidentally released from a lab in 2034 or something. <br><br>Architrains, interesting. I'll consider that. <br><br>Degringolade, okay, that's five votes in favor of the project. We'll see what happens when the big rush of comments hits tomorrow, but it's looking favorable so far.

Right now, some natural disaster happens, and, if it's first world, we get a technological response, and if it's third world, we get doleful tv anchors and panoramic shots.<br><br>But there have been natural disasters since before there was anything like man on this planet and there will continue to be. As long as there are people, we'll have to respond to them. There will be relatively minor disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires; huge disasters like the Cascadia Subduction Zone, the next Ice Age, and Yellowstone; slow disasters like droughts and fast disasters like floods. People have lived through all of those before, what about stories addressing how people face nature in the future? Not necessarily how they survive a volcanic eruption, but how do they live, what sort of mental structure do they come up with, that lets them deal with these events?<br>We consider them to be, well, disasters. Disruptions of the status quo, to be eliminated, papered over, ignored, and insured against as much as possible. People in the future might view them very differently, might even see what we regard as disaster as a sign of supernatural beneficence. Not '. . . and then they all die' stories: those to me always seem to encourage depressive profligacy.<br><br>Stories addressing how humans might humanely cope with nature's inhumanity.<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c4559921282472850048 title="comment permalink">9/16/15, 11:41 PM</a><br><br>

Of course that's one of history's frustrations as well!"<br>I am nooding in agreement. In my perspectiv history repeats itself. Again and again that old one in new cloth. Whilst changes just gradually get on a slightly new course. Due to the inevitable circumstances we get into an "abstinence for fittness" movement. Only to start form a reduced volume then the same old all over again. I see that´s the law of evolution. All revolting in itself with slight changes accumulating over time, but still letting life settle in the same niches again.<br>I look at history for a vivid example of that repercussion; As the roman empire collapsed, first followed by the so called dark ages, but afterwards emerged the frankonian empire. Thus acclaiming to be the romans empires successor. The final end of that succession of the roman empire was, when Napoleon declared the then "roman empire of german nation" to be finished. Well! So more than 1300 years passed by, before the roman empire passed away.<br>No, wait, what did Napoleon then do? Crown himseld the new emperor with Julius Cesars laurel wreath. Thus creating many functions and emblems of the roman empire. So at least after he deceasd the romaan empire was finish? No, I dont see that, as the "Greatest Nation in the World" appeared as the succesor of the not roman empire first, but the roman republic. While nowadays there is so much reverence of the (US) empires clory broadcasted frequently. So I see another 200 years of the roman empire has added.<br>My assumptions are: The fabric of the system repeats itself until maybe forever and ever. Whatever comes, no collapse will be permatent. Don´t let us fear, all is going to end. Instead, we´ll get the same procedure as every time. The king will die. The king will live!<br><br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c2215791881177282274 title="comment permalink">9/17/15, 12:57 AM</a><br><br>

It's been most revealing to see the 'Establishment' in the UK expose it's dark heart since the election of Corbyn. The attacks upon this decent and gentle man (whatever you think of his views) have been extraordinarily brutal and personal. Like many it's a rare experience to see a leader emerge whose policies are based on a 'where people matter' foundation. Something in the man has caught the imagination of the people, particularly the youth and I believe his policies and his practice are the basis for a re-connection of socialists of all stripes back into the wireboard of politics, fracturing the anti-human neo-liberal death cult. Socialism is a soup of many flavours and it's not going to satisfy all tastes but like we say to our kids at the table-just try it and see. <br>To be born in the 50's and to still be an optimist about politics means you are either a bit dim or relentlessly, intelligently-hopeful.<br><br>On the matter of the short stories, I think it's a great idea.<br><br>Thank you for your work.<br>Love and will in balance!<br><br>Tony Dougan<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c8475347843886619908 title="comment permalink">9/17/15, 1:24 AM</a><br><br>

I won’t pretend that it hasn’t been immensely gratifying and entertaining watching the press – the entire press, both those organisations that are ‘conservative’ and those that are ‘liberal’ – either squirm in discomfort or spew out torrents of bilious balderdash. Career politicians and talking heads have been sent scurrying to their bunkers squealing “He’ll be gone within a month” and the internet is buzzing with cruel but frankly very funny parodies of the neoliberal establishment. It feels like a real Wizard of Oz moment … but one wonders what is going to happen next. <br><br>Incidentally, Corbyn has indicated he would send Tony Blair to The Hague to stand trial for war crimes if he is elected. It’s a very popular promise for many people but also a dangerous game. The last few people who have made credible threats along those lines have ended up heading to the Great Beyond in mysterious circumstances (heart attacks, suicides etc.). I would advise Corbyn not to visit too many remote beauty spots or drive too fast (not hard as the man only owns a bicycle).<br><br>As for fiction, congratulations to those who have made it into After Oil 4 – I look forward to reading those stories. For those interested, I have been working on my own fictional story called <a href=http://seatofmars.blogspot.co.uk rel=nofollow>Seat of Mars</a>.

A touchstone, though not necessarily the entire plot, of each story would be to describe how one cultural or technological art was preserved from the Petroleum Age, how it materially impacts the future society at some future era of the writer's choice, and how it changes or expands the thinking of the people in that future society (or if they reject it, or if it causes wars etc.) Again, this need not be the whole point of the story -- a sketchy history mentioned in passing by a character would do; we shouldn't let tech get in the way of a good story and compelling characters -- but each story should include some mention of how the past breaks through into the future.<br><br>For example, here's some low-hanging fruit that contestants should be able to better with their own ideas: <br>* 80 years after the final collapse of the electric grid, a teenager discovers a buried vault full of rock-n-roll phonograph records, sheet music, and instruments -- and tries to put on an electrified concert to his peers who are accustomed to acoustic folk music. Hilarity ensues.<br>* 500 years from now, a cloak-and-dagger spy mission between two eco-technic countries leads to a sexy tale of seduction, paranoia, and emotional betrayal.

Railroads, politicians and assorted other commercial interests in the western states had been exhorting Americans to “See Europe if you will, but see America first” since 1906. Keen to get a piece of the $500 million Americans were spending each year in travel to the Old World, they promoted the unique natural wonders of the American west from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean in contrast to the inconveniences and expense of travel to Europe. Traveling towards the Pacific rather than across the Atlantic was advertised as a patriotic duty, a means to commune with the “Great Architect” through his greatest works.

Even the independent BBC tends to follow the same agenda as the rest of the press - they are scared of having further budget cuts if they would be seen to attack the Tory party in power. I would be surprised if Mr Corbyn lasts to even fight the next election - though he may do so if the stock market and economy dives. He is already facing the full hostility of the press and doesn't have the full backing of most of the MP's in his party. If he does last as Labour leader I would be stunned if he wins - in every election since 1979 the UK electorate have chosen the most sociopathic Prime Minister they can. I also don't really rate Mr Corbyn - I feel his mental map was fixed in the 1970's and he probably has no idea about the severely resource-constrained future that we are facing. If he were elected I fear that our future would most resemble that of Venezuela. The best chance of the labour party getting back in power would be if the Messiah currently over your side of the pond - the other Milliband i.e. David were to return as leader.<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c3522087553989082112 title="comment permalink">9/17/15, 5:23 AM</a><br><br>

In Britain, it happens to go to the left, in the United States to the right (a fake populist right). In Uzbekistan or Zambia, who knows?<br><br>In Sweden, the discontent goes to the right at the moment, with the Sweden Democrats getting 27% in a recent opinion poll - being in effect the largest party, larger than the Social Democrats, the party actually in government! The Sweden Democrats is the pariah party of Swedish politics, shunned by both leftists and neoliberal rightists alike, due to their nationalism and opposition to immigration/immigrants. They are represented in Parliament, but are blocked from real influence through a deal between the Social Democratic government and the neo-liberal opposition. <br><br>The recent success of the Sweden Democrats is arguably even more sensational than Trump and Corbyn!<br><br>Permit me some background information... <br><br>During the 1980´s, the Social Democrats habitually got around 45% of the votes in the national elections (the election turn-out was a staggering 90%), had been in power (with short breaks) for around 40 years, had a firm grip on the "working class vote" and the labor unions, and had a two-thirds majority in some local elections. <br><br>The Sweden Democrats, by contrast, were a small neo-fascist party which got virtually no votes at all. Many supporters were skinheads. The Sweden Democrats were so few, that one of their public meetings was trashed by anti-fascist activists from an even smaller pro-Albanian Stalinist group whose total membership can´t have exceeded 40 people! <br><br>Today, 30 years later, the Sweden Democrats get more sympathy in an opinion poll than the Social Democrats...<br><br>Imagine if Lyndon LaRouche would out-poll the Democrats! It´s that kind of crazy (even bearing in mind that the Sweden Democrats are more "realistic" today than back in the street fighting days, and has been so for quite some time). <br><br>If this will last is another matter entirely. A single opinion poll during the migrant crisis isn´t a general election, after all. The Social Democrats have been "down for counting" before, and always managed to stage a come back - Swedes like their welfare state (I admit that I vote Soc Dem myself). <br><br>But yes, it´s definitely one more sign that the decades-long period of political lethargy is coming to a close - for good or for worse. <br><br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c4004891762460306686 title="comment permalink">9/17/15, 5:29 AM</a><br><br>

Your take on the election in England was interesting. I am not sure he is that great a departure from status quo... time will tell.<br><br>My personal political philosophy is sort of a blend of Libertarian and Progressive. This from experience and observation since, as should be clear just from watching events, any 'pure' form of politic is easy to do in a novel, where you have control of everyone's actions, and not so easy when 'human nature' enters the scene, as it always does. <br><br>It seems to me that government should regulate as little as possible, yet it must provide a framework for peaceful trade, personal interactions, and of course transactions between citizens. When any group becomes harmful to the stability and peace of the land, the citizens would be able to enact regulatory (or criminal) laws to satisfy these requirements. <br><br>Again as a Libertarian, I worry at the government becoming repressive; Franklin and others call it "tyranny of the majority," and believed that true democracy would lead to such excesses. <br><br>As a Progressive, I worry that, left unregulated, bullies would terrorize the population, and greed would drive an untenable division into a few wealthy and mostly poor segments. As we see today.<br><br>This is the unfortunate reality that drives conflict; left unchecked either form has failed. I don't know if they can be successfully joined.

I suppose it depends on how far you can stretch "modern." I grew up (1956-1972) in a house where the 115V service entrance consisted of two 15 amp fuses, which is a whopping 7.5% of the capacity of a present-day 200A 240V service entrance. Despite that miserly budget, we had electric lights, a television and hi-fi, and an assortment of electric tools and kitchen appliances. (Of course my dad couldn't run the saw without checking that mom wasn't running the toaster, but it didn't seem to bother anyone.) And the electric utility seemed to be able to turn a profit supplying that measly amount of power from the little hydro plant on the pond south of town. Now, granted, that's not "solar and wind," but it certainly qualifies as "renewable!"<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c4810441819812571681 title="comment permalink">9/17/15, 7:34 AM</a><br><br>

At times, so much of what I see out there is so twisted and ugly that it takes your wavy, anti-consensus, Fun-House Mirror to counter the torque and present a clearer and un-distorted image.<br><br>I too have had several conversations with people who are just fine with either Bernie or The Donald. And I gotta say, I get it. I don't so much agree as understand. No great revelation here: both candidacies are fueled by dissatisfaction with the parties as usual. What I find interesting is that both men present themselves as canvases for the hopes, desires and temper tantrums for the alternatives to those stati quo arrangements as seen from substantially different points of view. I felt very much the same way about the Occupy movement and the very early Tea Party: two radically different approaches to addressing more or less the same set of problems. Back in those days, I desperately hoped that someone could have straddled the gap, before it became a cultural chasm, between the two movements. Those two powerful engines working, if not together then perhaps not at odds with each other, could have cracked open the current state of things earlier and provided more alternative visions for what else is out there. As individual candidates, I don't really see such a bridge possible between Bernie and The Donald. I certainly cannot see them sharing a ticket, but who knows.....<br><br>On a separate request: I'd love to see you continue on with your observational posts mid-week as you do now and leave open a Friday posting, on a semi-regular basis, for special projects like Retrotopia. I doubt you'll find much opposition in this space to the proposition that "we" double "your" workload.<br><br>Thanks again for all of your good work!<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c5916208068366411571 title="comment permalink">9/17/15, 9:14 AM</a><br><br>

In this country, if you're overenthusiastic about something, chances are you're not really serious about putting it into practice, just evangelizing it.<br><br>Now Bernie Sanders, I think he's the best of the lot considering he's the reactionary candidate who wishes to chuck neoliberalism (i.e., pseudo-Conservatism, neo-Conservatism, Republican policies adopted by Democrats, etc.) and restore the New Deal inasmuch as possible. Although he doesn't realize our true situation, Sanders would, if we vote in a cooperative Congress, would put in place policies and institutions that would help us ride out the decline; because as Orlov has reported, socialism tends to distribute the social stresses of the decline and even helps people prepare for the descent.<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c2968268761079208562 title="comment permalink">9/17/15, 9:17 AM</a><br><br>

The closest American parallel, it seems to me is the strong challenge of Hillary by Sanders. The left (particularly the youth) seem to to be saying if you wanna be left, go Left, young man! The rise of Trump seems to parallel the rise of the National Front in France and UKIP in the UK.<br><br>The consensus, as well as the opposition from the right and the left (although I lean hard left) seems to be worn out. We no longer have the energy, finance, or resources to support their programs. Will a third (or fourth) option come out of the blue. Possibly, but the propensity for political mischief and scapegoating is huge. The public was promised the moon. They got a litter-box.<br><br>Drat! Ray beat me to the punch. :) I always wondered about the Rocky Mountain region in the Star's Reach universe. They say, write about what you know. Well I was born and raised in CO and lived ten years in WY. A desertified Intermountain West makes sense. Even now, there are areas referred to as the Great American Desert. Except perhaps for the Northern Regions, it is not a lush paradise. Water is the currency of life. It will be even more so 400 years hence.<br><br>They fought wars over grazing and water rights (The Johnson County Cattle War). My Dad once told a story about a Mexican farmhand in the San Luis Valley in the early 20th century, who left the gate on the irrigation ditch open. The rancher was so angry he shot him dead. An all white jury acquitted him. The Judges stern warning was "Now, Sir, you gotta knock this stuff off!" <br><br>I think the fate of the Anasazi (Chaco Canyon, the Four Corners, Chimney Rock, etc) is informative as to what may have happened out there in those 400 years. I envision regression on a much more severe scale than the Midwest (Meriga), perhaps a nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyle based around herding. Maybe the people who live in valleys with microclimates that still allow some agriculture rediscover the Ancient Puebloan methods of dryland agriculture.<br><br>Perhaps the least populated state in the Union (WY) becomes rather a nomadic enclave.<br><br>I was able to piece together most of your place names (Meriga, Genda, Meyco) Neeonjin always confused me a bit.

I think a lot of people are looking for something different and that parts of the NPR crowd might appreciate hearing your perspectives. Of course a lot of them would pull out the usual thought stoppers etc., but at least it would make more people aware of some of the alternatives you address. While NPR often shows as much dedication to the myth of progress as other outlets, a time might come where you can squeeze in. I think people are hungry for it and that would be the least hostile place where you could address a larger audience. It would certainly be a welcome change from guests talking about self-driving cars and climate change.

The calling back comes from my family having been in the area since the 1880's settling the area immediately after the Utes were removed. I feel a calling to explore that history and the meaning of my families stewardship of the area for seven generations. Since that calling I have been trying to learn what I can about the native people's of the area; Ute, Deni, and Hopi mostly.<br><br>I would love to work together, at least figure out some of the setting details. I have been looking at the Toubou people since last night for inspiration about what desert mountain life shapes a people. After all their Mountains, Tibesti, are the 'Rocky Mountains' in their language. I see Colorado being abandoned outside of the cooling effects of the mountains. Where springs offer a source of water towns of a few hundred people might exist, as a general rule many miles from the next settlement. Some mesas and other high lands still offer grazing and pinon nut harvests. Maybe hunting too, what critters you figure would adapt to the changes, thing the big horns are likely to have any adapted decedents?<br><br>I doubt much technology remains, I suspect enough metallurgy to manufacture weapons on the order of a Girandoni rifle survives in a few towns, though the herders tend make do with a good sling.<br><br>Historically mountain peoples have been wary of visitors, I wonder how they would receive some explorers from Neeonjin territory?<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c6117372166262465005 title="comment permalink">9/17/15, 2:41 PM</a><br><br>

I think that it is likely to be a reversion towards pre-Harper behaviour. I think the Conservatives will lose their majority if they don't get kicked out, which would rein in their policy a bit. I really hope that they lose office. <br><br>The riding I'm in is very left-leaning, and not all that typical for Canada as a whole. It will probably go NDP, or maybe Green. At a recent debate I went to, the conservative candidate didn't bother to show up. I don't think the consensus on worldview has cracked much though; all three candidates present(NDP, Liberal and Green) kept agreeing with each other on almost everything, so even if the NDP were to get a majority I doubt it would get entirely out of neoliberal territory unless Canada/world economy goes into a true tailspin or there is a war with huge consequences to the West.

If you want to move Venus to Mars's orbit it requires, at an absolute minimum making impossibly optimistic assumptions, about 1.8 * 10^33 Joules of energy. If you spread that energy expenditure evenly over 100,000 years, you'd still need in each of those years about thirty million times the amount of energy all of humanity currently uses per year. (Which is about 6 * 10^20 Joules, not counting ambient insolation).<br><br>For comparison, consider getting the Starship Enterprise up to 1/10 the speed of light under impulse power, and then slowed down again. By Star Trek standards, that's kind of like pulling her out of the space garage and down the driveway. Using comparably madly optimistic assumptions about efficiency, that single maneuver requires "only" about a thousand times the amount of energy humanity currently uses per year.<br><br>From such figures, I gather that any kind of starship, even one without warp drive (which there's no particular reason to believe is physically possible) that would take decades to make a one-way trip to one of the very nearest stars, is not consistent with any ecotechnic vision I'm familiar with.

I imagine the book being being written from the perspective of 1,000 - 1,500 years in the future and concerning people who lived somewhere between the next great crisis and 300 years from now. This would be structured so every civilization is different and each hagiography serves as both a snapshot of a potential civilization, as well as a narrative and commentary. I deeply appreciated this complexity of perspective in <i>The Glass Bead Game</i> and would love the added layer of possibility explored by the differences of each imagined civilization in its springtime looking backwards.

I reckon the core underlying problem is that people attempt to outsource their individual community responsibilities in the current political system. Does it benefit them to attempt that feat? You betcha it does, look at all the freebies thrown at some classes of society down here and they know they're in good hands. Unfortunately many of the other classes - and I feel that the young are particularly vulnerable - are in the dark about their situation and are also completely clueless as to how to respond.<br><br>When they do respond, helpful people show up to enforce the present paradigm of consensus politics which isn't far off an attempt by a dog to bite its own tail.<br><br>Which brings me to: As a suggestion for your Retrotopia story, it might be an instructive experience for everyone here to have Mr Carr attend a meeting where he acts like people do today (as a further suggestion, he could even possibly even attempt to hijack the meeting with a minor furphy?) and have him treated like the moron that he is. Imagine having Mr Carr have his say and then sit down and keep quiet (an impossible thought).<br><br>Or, as another suggestion: How about walking Mr Carr through the basics of a working democracy?<br><br>Oh yeah, forgot to mention that I read something about Australia recently being made open to Japanese funds which are seeking yield? I honestly didn't believe they could pump the housing bubble up much further but that move is ingenious. What could possibly go wrong? Oh that's right, it looks like our next batch of submarines are possibly going to be built in Japan rather than at the ship yards in South Australia. Well done.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>Hi Marcu,<br><br>Don't hold your breath. The dude is from one of the wealthiest corners of our society. However, having said that when the GFC hit, he worked co-operatively with Mr Rudd and did you happen to notice any impacts of the GFC here? Nope. Mind you, he also presided over some of the great shifts in wealth inequality in our time and they're shutting down local car manufacturing which will put about 250k people out of work because they’re whingeing that it cost the government $1bn over the past 10 years. Did I mention that tax free giveaways to retired baby boomers are something in the order of $32bn over 3 years?

I'm delighted; I'll get a Blogger blogspace set up to function as online headquarters and clubhouse for the project, and announce the address here once it's up and running. Stay tuned for more. <br><br>Second, I'd like to thank every one of the people who submitted stories to the latest Space Bats challenge that didn't get chosen. It's always hard to look at a long list of readable stories and have to pick out a short list for an anthology; it's particularly hard when no small number of the authors are longtime readers and commenters. What's most remarkable to me is that everyone has been gracious about it all. That's rare in any writing contest; normally some of the people whose stories don't get picked do the sore-loser routine and make matters wretched for everybody. Having gotten plenty of rejection slips in my time, I know what it feels like to put everything you've got into a story and still have it turned down, and I want to thank each of you who ended up in that same situation for dealing with it gracefully and professionally. <br><br>If there were thirty-six hours in a day and ten days in a week, I'd solve the problem by launching a quarterly magazine of deindustrial SF, using print on demand technology so there wasn't an up front investment. Since I'm already doing as much as I have time to do, I'll simply put the idea out there: if any of my readers with editing and layout skills is interested in a second income that could add up to rather more than pizza money in time, and is willing to invest the time needed to make a quarterly magazine function, talk to me; I can set you up with a bunch of good stories, and advertise the magazine here so it gets plenty of initial subscribers. (Count me in for a subscription to start with!) <br><br>Okay, that said, on to the comments.<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c8384150152571124999 title="comment permalink">9/17/15, 5:17 PM</a><br><br>

BTW, if you'd like to resubmit your other comment with the profanity snipped out, I'd be happy to put it through. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, small-scale community radio is another venue that begs for green wizardly involvement; interesting that the Matreum has gotten into that. <br><br>BoysMom, hmm.

Something about them would certainly be worth seeing.<br><br>Hubertus, and of course the United States in its early days made rather a fetish of copying the Roman Republic in its architecture et al. -- that's why we have a Senate, for example -- so you may have something there. <br><br>Faoladh, I've thought for a very long time that the setting of <i>Star's Reach</i> would make a great setting for roleplaying games, but I'd need some experienced help to get the "bible" structured so that roleplaying games could use it. Once the new Blogger space is up and running, could I ask you to come on over and help give me some idea of what would be useful? <br><br>Tony, the media attacks on Corbyn tell me one thing above all: the British establishment is terrified of him. That right there tells me that there are constructive potentials for change. <br><br>Earthworm, I make it a habit never to argue with Cicero. ;-)<br><br>MigrantWorker, what <i>Star's Reach</i> specified about the Old World is that most of Europe is Muslim, having been flooded by mass migrations from the Middle East. (Yes, I wrote that in back in 2010 or so!) Norway, Sweden, Finland, the Baltics, and Russia are the exceptions, and a state of chronic religious war exists between them and the emirates of Europe. If you want to consider a story in that setting, by all means. <br><br>Sven, the first two volumes of <i>After Oil</i> had a lot of stories set in the immediate future; that's why I proposed the thousand-year minimum this time around, because the "right after the collapse" options had been pretty heavily worked over.

We'll hope not. <br><br>Thomas, hmm! That's definitely an interesting theme idea.

At least half the reason Americans are so clueless these days is that they have no idea what real hardship is like. I suspect they'll be learning that lesson fairly soon. <br><br>Alex, well, we'll see. <br><br>Tidlösa, yes, I'd read about that. Definitely a major change. <br><br>Denys, at this point just about anybody from outside the political establishment can get a following, just because they're from outside.

It was a surprisingly affecting moment and something of a jolt as to how I continue to see the world. In your narrative, I had these visions of a mode of living spiraling out into the future. I didn't see an end to it, only the possibilities of this way of living.<br><br>But no matter how adapted a mode of living, it too will end at some point. Particularly within the context of taking place in 2065, it would still be a series of social and economic arrangements existing tentatively within a collapsing civilization. Maybe it would prove effective for a few decades, or perhaps even manage to adapt itself out for a 50 or 80 years, or even a century. But it, too, would ultimately fall in tandem with the crumbling girders of its enfolding civilization.<br><br>It struck me as sad, yet also an important reminder. When thinking about a hopeful future, I still think about the arrangement that might prove stable enough to last indefinitely. There's still that sense that somewhere out there is a mode of living that's right, and that will thus continue. I know rationally that that's not the case, that all cultures and civilizations (indeed, species, ecosystems, and planets) are temporary. But I don't think I know it emotionally yet. When my imagination runs unrestricted by what I know rationally, it always comes back to a search for a permanent ideal, even though no such thing exists.<br><br>It's interesting, instead, to think of the Lakeland Republic (or our current culture, or my current home, or any other arrangement of living) as something unique and of its particular time, beautiful and horrific, flawed and uplifting and inspiring and cruel, all these things interchangeably and still, ultimately, transitory on some timescale. "This too shall pass." I know it's true, but it's such a hard concept to truly believe.<br><br>All that said, I was fascinated by your "tiers" comment late in last week's discussion. The counties are the lines of demarcation and they exist in various tiers, presumably of technology. I would assume there's a certain level of local control over which tier they exist in, but I also wonder if it's something more complicated than that. My initial thought was that the counties might move through the tiers, advancing through various levels of technology. But, of course, the counties couldn't advance through different levels of technological complexity without some correcting mechanism, so I wondered if they might advance through and then ultimately reset back to a lower level, in some sort of planned and managed version of collapse. But that would be quite a trauma to be planned, so then I wondered if they might advance forward and then cycle back down the tiers. An interesting thought.<br><br>And <em>then</em> an obvious thought occurred to me: what if the higher tiers are lower levels of technology? What if the Lakeland Republic utilizes a system in which counties cycle <em>backward</em> (in today's terms) through the technological suites? What if the Lakeland Republic has instituted an ethos of managed, reduced complexity in which counties start off at a certain, more "modern," technological level and slowly cycle downward through technological suites as they learn the necessary skills to live with less energy- and resource-intensive technologies, with an understanding that that's the current course of the world anyway?<br><br>I have no idea if this bears any resemblance to how the Lakeland Republic works, but what a fascinating idea. It could make a heck of a story.<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c7753841977631930159 title="comment permalink">9/17/15, 6:21 PM</a><br><br>

Unfortunately, due to the way that <i>GURPS</i> works, it would also be one of the most difficult to do as getting licensed to use the <i>GURPS</i> system commercially is notoriously difficult. There are several other options, though, and I think that all should be examined. Probably the best direction to take, as I noted, would be to make a systemless core, publish details for those systems which allow for that, and leave closed systems like <i>GURPS</i> to hobbyists (or, if things work out that way, for the companies owning those systems to license and produce themselves). Open systems - that is, ones that use the OGL and D20 SRD*, for the most part, but other options exist such as <a href=http://www.faterpg.com/licensing/ rel=nofollow><i>FATE</i></a>, <a href=https://www.peginc.com/licensing/ rel=nofollow><i>Savage Worlds</i></a> (note that there are both fan and publication licenses), or <a href=http://www.travellersrd.com/ rel=nofollow><i>Traveller</i></a> - are the best options. I'll say that I have my own personal preferences, and some of the ones I mention here are not among them, but I think that making the setting available to the widest audience is better.<br><br>But I should really be saving all of this for the new forum.<br><br>*This is jargon, and basically means that some games are given a very wide-open and indiscriminate license for publication known as the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Game_License rel=nofollow>Open Game License</a> ("OGL"), and that most of those games are based, though sometimes very loosely, on the parts of 3rd edition of <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> ("D20 System") that were released under that license for <i>nearly</i> indiscriminate use ("System Reference Document" or "SRD"). A bit later I mention <i>Traveller</i>, but in that case I am specifically referring to the version of that game published by Mongoose, which was published under the terms of the OGL and which has its own SRD, which I linked. Using the <i>Traveller</i> logo or asserting any connection with that game has another license that basically amounts to "Get Marc Miller's permission and send him a copy".<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c3799957999248749250 title="comment permalink">9/17/15, 8:02 PM</a><br><br>

<div class="avtb a_5ee831" id=c2964181835445573115></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/04737693388485635100 rel=nofollow>John Michael Greer</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>James, clearly there's interest in Meriga as a setting for roleplaying games! As for magic, may I be allowed -- as a professional occultist with quite a bit of experience in the field of magic -- to express a pet peeve? Every roleplaying game system I know of absurdly exaggerates what magic can actually do. In RPG terms, what real magic does is give you an extra point or two on your saving rolls, and that sort of thing. That's a good thing to have; it can mean the difference between success and failure, and occasionally even between life and death -- but all those flashy spells in the rulebooks? Please. <br><br>Magic in Meriga, to answer your question, is basically folk magic; there's a lot of it, as there is in every society, helping people deal with the uncertainties of life. If you know the right street to visit in any city, or the right house to visit in most villages, you can get spells cast to give you luck in love and business, take somebody's ill-wishing off your loms, or have the bones cast to reveal hints about your future; the same person will give you a potion to treat the flu or an ointment made of fat, pine resin, and powdered herbs that will keep wounds from getting infected. The educated traditions of magic didn't survive the end of the old world; in Merigan times, people who want to study dangerous lore from the distant past generally go in for technology, not magic. <br><br>Zaphod, it's the nature of politics, and more generally of human affairs, that there's no right answer. If that has any kind of denouement waiting, as I see it, it's somewhere off in the distant reaches of evolutionary time. As for steam powered cars, well, of course; it should be axiomatic that nothing can keep the current status quo going. The question is purely what technologies, on a much smaller scale, might be able to continue into the future. <br><br>Quos Ego, and that's a possibility as well. I'll consider it. <br><br>Mister R., if Hillary is the nominee the Democrats will lose. I think that's starting to sink in now even among her fans. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, both of those are so hackneyed! Can we please get some imaginative dooms and utopian fantasies in place of the tired old set that everyone keeps on rehashing? <br><br>RPC, of course a vast amount depends on what "modern" means in the discussion. I know from personal experience, as you do also, that it's possible to maintain a decent and humane existence on a small fraction of the electricity most people in the industrial world nowadays think is absolutely necessary -- but that's not a common realization these days, you know. <br><br>Nicolas, that would be interesting. All I know about the southern two-thirds of the New World is that the Meycan Empire occupies the very northern end of what's now South America -- it's the largest power in the 25th century's western hemisphere, embracing everything from California and Texas to parts of what are now Venezuela and Colombia -- but beyond that? Trey mentioned in <i>Star's Reach</i> that trading ships came into Memfis from countries south of Meyco, all the way down to Nardiga, which is free of ice and "all trees and grass and cattle." What Argentina is up to would be worth reading. <br><br>Troy, those are reasonable questions. I'd be willing to see an expanded time frame -- anything back as far as the drought years, or forward a decade or two into the presdency of Sharl sunna Sheren -- but I'd prefer writers to come up with their own characters and not use mine. All of this will be covered in posts on the other site.<br><br>Aron, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Morgenfrue, <i>Ecotopia</i> does have its dated bits, doesn't it? That's always the risk a utopia runs -- after a few decades, quite a few of the details seem either quaint or creepy, due to the change in attitudes and mores. <br><br>Robert, thanks for the view from your side of the pond. Why no hat? In Britain's climate that would seem to be a necessity...<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c2964181835445573115 title="comment permalink">9/17/15, 8:53 PM</a><br><br>

We can't maintain our civilization's current levels of energy expenditure as fossil fuels deplete, much less boost them by the many orders of magnitude that would be necessary to play billiards with planets, and this notion of yours that simply making civilizations last longer will somehow free us from the limits to growth strikes me as dubious in the extreme -- does the phrase "law of diminishing returns" strike any chord of memory? No, to my mind what you're suggesting goes in exactly the wrong direction; distracting ourselves with such fantasies of omnipotence simply provides excuses to help people ignore the hard planetary limits that will shape the futures we can actually expect. <br><br>Philip, hmm! That sounds like something I'd like to read. <br><br>KevPilot, er, sorry; no can do. Unless somebody wants to chuck a year's income into the tip jar, I have to earn a living, and that means that the time I put into my two blogs is about as much time as I can afford to put into them. <br><br>Ed-M, the Permian thing was a joke, of course. I think they're far more Carboniferous. ;-)<br><br>Aias, I was very impressed by the results of asking for far future stories, and so, yes, I'll be encouraging that as we proceed. <br><br>William, glad to hear it. "Neeonjin" is the 25th century Merigan pronunciation of <i>Nihonjin</i>, "Japanese person." In this future history, the Pacific Northwest was settled by waves of boat people from Japan, and has a culture and language largely descended from that of modern Japan. As for stories set in the arid Rockies, I see no reason why both of you couldn't do such stories; by all means work together on details of the setting, but tell different tales -- I'm sure there are many narratives to tell about the people of the high mountain valleys!<br><br>Greg, NPR is the radio station of the privileged Left; they have no time whatsoever for someone who's going to tell them that their lifestyles are propped up by the suffering of the people they like to think they're helping, and that they and all they stand for are going to be ashes in the wind in the not too distant future. All I have to do is suggest that using less is the key to a livable future and you won't be able to see them for the dust cloud, because since the death of the Sixties, living with less in any sense is the road they've refused to take. <br><br>David, fascinating. Many thanks; one more apocalypse bites the dust!<br><br>Bill, interesting. I'll certainly consider that as an option. <br><br>Varun, once the new site is up and running, it'll be a good place for this kind of conversation -- and I'd be delighted to see your story, of course. <br><br>Pygmycory, thanks for the tidings from north of the border. I hope you manage to get someone less embarrassing in office than the current inmate. <br><br>Myriad (if I may interject), thank you. You've just earned tonight's gold star for puncturing an absurd technofantasy with the needle of quantitative thinking.<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c433142478464166683 title="comment permalink">9/17/15, 9:14 PM</a><br><br>

Even where space bats are permitted. (For academic interest only, the other challenge is truly alien aliens, that don't merely mimic some earth creature's life cycle [e.g.intelligent parasitic wasp aliens] or exaggerate some common human personality trait [e.g. greedy merchant aliens, logical aliens, proud warrior aliens, prude aliens, etc.])<br><br>I really like Bill Blondeau's idea of stories set in successor civilizations. That might make the next contest even more challenging still, especially given the short format. (I tried to do that with my entry this time around, but can't say I was very successful.)<br><br>A Star's Reach shared world effort sounds really interesting also, not just for the stories but for the discussion that developing the stories could generate. I think I could portray certain aspects of life in Nuwinga pretty well, but I'd need some word-of-god rulings to establish certain background facts. (For instance: what is the condition of the Grand Banks? Viable offshore fisheries would make a huge difference to Nuwinga lifeways. Come to think of it, that's also a critical question for the Republic of New England and the Maritimes in 2065.)<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c6590172356251218540 title="comment permalink">9/17/15, 9:18 PM</a><br><br>

In the system I'm toying with, action rolls are accomplished by rolling one or more d10's, depending on your level of skill, which count as successes if they roll under the relevant attribute value. For most tasks, a single success is enough, but just barely, and getting more successes can increase the efficacy of the action (doing extra damage, for example).<br><br>So my idea was that magic could, for example, allow you to roll an extra die as if your skill level were one higher, or force an opponent to reroll some of their dice that were successes against you.<br><br>"The educated traditions of magic didn't survive the end of the old world"<br><br>That's a real shame, but good to know, as I was under the assumption that something like the Golden Dawn had made it through.

Corbyn's election stems from the UK General Election this year in which the Labour Party failed disastrously. Reading articles at the time I was under the impression that the Labour Party elite had elected to become a party of the 'aspirational' middle-class and depend on the fact that, for the lowly workers, they would have to lump it because of TINA - as in There Is No Alternative.<br> This idiotic idea has led that party to be reduced to a few enclaves on the 2015 electoral map and it is noteworthy how much these enclaves are for middle-class places like London. If you were an average worker in the UK in 2015, good luck in finding a party that would stand up for your interests or rights that was not composed of rat-bags or drongos.<br> Their Liberal Democrats had also turned on those who had helped bring them to power after going into government with the Conservatives in 2010. They tried to play it too smart in 2015 by maneuvering themselves to be king-makers after this election but got annihilated instead.<br> Average workers have been on a losing streak in the UK since the Thatcher years and have become very embittered and have long memories. It was not for nothing that when Thatcher died recently, large swathes of the population sang the refrain 'ding-dong, the witch is dead' as that woman had helped bring on enormous damage to British society and civil life.<br> Now for the first time in decades someone has appeared that is not a right-wing, neo-liberal who would be at home in any of the major parties. Apparently the establishment are finding it hard to deal with a person that actually has convictions that also lives them. This should be interesting so perhaps it is time to pull up a seat and grab some popcorn as events unfold.<br> People here have also noted the hostility of the British press to Corbyn but there may be a reason for this. In recent times this press has been recruited almost entirely from the middle and upper class (http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2009/jul/21/newspapers) to the point that now only about 3% of journalist have working class parents (http://graduatefog.co.uk/2013/2528/posh-good-luck-journalist/). They are mostly from the 'aspirational' middle class that Labour actively sought to recruit, hence their hostility to anything left-wing. Corbyn is simply not one of them.<br> As for a future theme, what intrigued me in your essay 'The Next Ten Billion Years' was the kernel of an idea that we are in only the first global civilization. Yes we may be facing the second Dark Ages down the track but I refuse to accept the idea that we will never be any more than yokels, shamans and tribespeople. Sooner or later we will crawl our way back again to a new civilization that is equivalent to say the 20th century. A different suite of technologies, of course, and nowhere near the amount of resources but that does not matter as a civilization is not its technology but in the way that they act out their beliefs. What would life in the second civilization be like might prove to be a very informative theme. I believe that another reader named Bill Blondeau is also thinking along these lines and this could hold promise for a series of stories.<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c8650980519397359855 title="comment permalink">9/17/15, 9:32 PM</a><br><br>

I sweated bullets trying to make the Cetans in <i>Star's Reach</i> as alien as possible, and even so I don't think they ever quite got far enough away from the slime molds that inspired them. As for the Grand Banks, that would take some research; sea level is 50 meters higher, and so it would take some work to figure out exactly what that would do, plus guesses as to the recovery time of Atlantic fish stocks, the state of the deep thermohaline circulation, etc. <br><br>James, that would work. As for the educated traditions of magic, those are historically very fragile -- we know only fragments, for example, of what mages were up to in the Roman Empire. You could probably justify a reinvention of one or two useful things, such as some version of the notory art, but given the scale of the losses at the end of the old world, unless an abandoned building in the deserts of ancient Nebraska turns out to have a couple of books buried in the sand, it's probably going to be a matter of starting all over at the beginning.<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c62771959984899958 title="comment permalink">9/17/15, 9:39 PM</a><br><br>

They may share the same future like us. After having burned up their fossil energy, there wasn´t even enough left, to fire a universal radio, to let neighbouring star systems know: "Hallo, here we are!" Not to think of, putting star ships into orbit, cruising over to us. Thats why there are no UFO´s. They are broken, like we soon will be. RIP!<br>- Another is, that inventing a gigantic energy ressoure doesn´t seem to succed. Even the one and only project, where the whole human race on earth has come together, in order tho coordinate efforts and ressoures, to develop it. Since the 1930´s, till today I doesn´t work. A fusion rector ist still said to be 20 years ahead from now. So its said since 60 years. So it will need another 500 to 1.000 years, than it might work out.

I have been slowly, steadily collecting my thoughts about your extensive writings on this blog and the Well of Galabes. I have read more than a dozen of your posts. I should first say that it's hard to argue with most of your contentions, but there are some striking disagreements I should mention. Still, I particularly appreciate how much time and effort you put to your responses to commenter objections. This is the first response I've made to your writings and I hope you consider them. I'm intrigued to know what you think.<br><br> So...where do I begin? Well, there are so many things to say, but I guess I'll start from this post and move backward. I'll probably leave out most of my criticisms and questions for a later date, since I know a full reply could warrant its own post. Haha. I think I'll bring in my criticisms in drips along the way just to have a better chance of getting your attention. First, you mentioned you were against Corbyn's variety of socialism and most types of socialism. Is there any flavor of socialism you prefer or do you not like the label association? Could you generally describe your own political/economic views as it relates to things like: ownership of the means of the production, money, class &amp; hierarchy, governance, trade, democracy, etc.? I would hesitate to categorize you with any label because so many people are afraid to be associated with groups perceived to be disloyal, unpatriotic, anti-American and the sort. However, I get chuckles when people say that they defy categorization or "are beyond the left-right paradigm." Everyone can be categorized and everyone, no matter their political orientation, can be placed somewhere on the Nolan chart. I have to say that some of these issues are not gray and instead are very much binary. Are you in favor of top-down hierarchies or not? Are you in favor of using money as a means of organizing human activities or not? There's no room for middle ground in these questions. And it's answering these sorts of questions that will prove crucial to deciding what comes next.<br><br> Secondly, I am confused by your assessment of "magic." I'll say that I am by no means an expert in this field but I find it fascinating. One thing that stuck me is how you attack people like Rhonda Byrne and other occultist who believe that humans have absolute latent powers to manipulate matter and energy with no limits. In a sense, they are saying that absolutely anything is possible to those who have enough imagination and faith in the mind's ability to manifest their wishes. This is their definition of "magic". I would say that it appears to me that even Aleister Crowley and Manly P. Hall leaned in this direction, although with some caveats and some restrictions. You however, don't agree with this absolutist view of magic, but you never draw clear defining lines between what's possible. It seems conflicted to me when you have a strict adherence to "the limits to growth", "carrying capacity", and other delimiting catchphrases as well as others I haven't heard you mention, like homeostatic equilibrium -- and yet you believe in supernatural means to break these very laws. I think most of your occultist readers would appreciate if you explain exactly what you think is possible with magic and what is impossible.<br><br>I am looking forward to your response. Thanks for all your elucidating work.<br><br>To be continued...<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c6331651652348008648 title="comment permalink">9/18/15, 4:47 AM</a><br><br>

Who the hell would want it to?<br> When I mentioned the 20th century, I did not mean its god awful set of technologies but what I meant was rather a level of societal sophistication where lives do not have to be led according to the whims &amp; fancies of chieftains, priests, warlords &amp; the like and that the science is sophisticated enough to have an understanding of the natural world and thereafter its limits. That is what I actually meant.<br> The only technology that this future 20th century would then share with our own would be only that which would be sustainable and that would be only after calculating all internal and external costs. By definition, that would eliminate most of the technology that we now use. The challenge here then would be to imagine a future 20th century with its sophistication but without the majority of our own technology but what they have managed to evolve on their own and how it shapes that society.<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c3607518980705162813 title="comment permalink">9/18/15, 5:15 AM</a><br><br>

The whole thing started with an expose of a minor disc jockey and television presenter called Jimmy Savile, who since his death has been transformed into an all-powerful reptilian ultra-predator who could intimidate hardened Fleet Street journalists into quivering jelly.

I understand that fossil fuels are the most energy dense source of power that humanity is ever likely to have and that Moore's law is limited by Wright's law of continuously doubling the cumulative production in order to achieve continuous increases in a performance characteristic. I'm interested in making contact with whoever is out there, like you did in Star's Reach, but I want to play by the rules, and again, all due respect, but you cheated a little on that one. The universe is a big place and an old place, that means that any communication between civilizations will require that both civs spend a lot of effort looking and a lot of effort broadcasting, and above all, a long time at each. If our history is any guide then there won't be contact between civs, even if they are relatively common, because they crash and burn so quickly.<br><br> So rather than dream up some fantastic vaporwear like warp drive or sub ether transmissions a la StarTrek I work the problem the other way. If I want to know what an alien civ could do to reach or contact us but I assume they are limited in the same way that we are then I work out what we can do with the tech we have now and the constraints that we have. That sharply limits the possibilities and the only way to achieve anything is to add more time.<br><br> So, ignoring any techno fantasies, what can we do right now with what we have? The James Webb Space telescope is set to launch in 2018 and it could find other civs within 50 light years, but it probably won't get an occulting disk that it needs to do so. The Square Kilometer Array is set to start construction in 2018 and it could spot a an airport radar up to 100 light years out, but the funding is in doubt and it requires an Internet connection roughly equivalent to the entire internet right now, so cross that one off.<br><br> If you take a hard look at what we have and where we are going, the long descent, with a best case of maybe a billion people and no fossils fuels, then what is possible with the tech and resources they have? Very little unless you add in more time.<br><br> An ecotechnic civ with only biofuels (mostly for eating, but a limited amount for kerosene rockets) and limited hydroelectric could have a very limited space program. None of the terraforming options out there are possible with existing tech, much less restricted ecotechnic futures. The only way we could settle another planet is to move a suitable planet to a location that terraforms itself, and the only way we could move a planet with existing tech on a limited ecotechnic budget is to use gravitational assists from a small asteroid (between 100 and 200 KM in diameter) to steal a little bit of angular momentum from the gas giants and impart it to Venus (the only suitable candidate) on a carefully calculated return trip. And that would take a very long time.<br><br> You asked for alternative visions that embrace the hard limits we are facing, and any civ that could last 100,000 years looks a lot more like ants and bees than I'm comfortable with, but it will be a fertile ground for new ideas and original fiction that strictly adheres to the hard limits we are likely to face and I thought that was what you asked for.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c7703465346268866920 title="comment permalink">9/18/15, 9:08 AM</a><br><br>

And I will be following The Meriga Project with live interest.<br><br>I think what's going on in Canadian politics this election is primarily our delayed version of dynamics that arose in the 2008 US election, split between the two opposition parties. So Mulcair's NDP aim to win and consolidate the consensus around Harper's failed neoliberal policies; Trudeau has been attempting the Obama campaign style of empty youthful excitement. Ho hum. If the NDP do win they stand a decent chance of beginning to restore balance to Canada's traditional economic foundations of resources and industry. Maybe. That's about all I expect to change.<br><br>The Leap Manifesto, on the other hand, is potentially a bombshell. I'm not sure how to think about it. Its "theory of the future" is in part quite silly-- it proposes that we can improve our economy while eliminating fossil fuels by 2050. But the actual political demands it makes are much more clear-sighted (with the one exception of elevating NIMBY to a social principle-- I get what they're saying, but it could only ever amount in practice to rich progressives not wanting to think about where their wealth comes from). The unrealistic vision may be beside the point or even useful, if it helps generate political will for confronting the long descent. It gives me pause though. Thinkers I respect a great deal-- Charles Taylor, Guujaaw, John Ralston Saul-- are initiating signatories. The establishment response has been like the response to Corbyn: nervous laughter and dismissal based on the usual celebrities fronting the manifesto, and on how embarrassing it must be for Mulcair to try to look acceptable with that environmentalist nonsense going on behind him. Tant pis. <br><br>At the same time I do think the name and iconography are uncomfortably Maoist, which strikes me as... a poor choice.<br><br>My riding is a Conservative seat that stands a good chance of swinging NDP; I was planning to vote NDP, but I'm considering asking the candidate to endorse Leap and threatening to vote Green if he doesn't.<br><br>JMG, pygmycory, Matthew... thoughts?<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c3193960210330805008 title="comment permalink">9/18/15, 12:42 PM</a><br><br>

Very funny. <br><br>Kieran, it's always fun to watch the media lose its cool right out there in public. Corbyn's accomplished that much already!<br><br>Spanish Fly, that's a choice we all make, knowingly or not, every minute. <br><br>Weazel, if you'd like to know my views on political economy, I'd encourage you to read my book <i>The Wealth of Nature</i>, which sets those out in some detail. I'm always amused when people insist that any political and economic viewpoint can be forced into the one-dimensional straitjacket of "left vs. right," or into some other overly simplistic set of rigid binaries; to my mind, that speaks much more of the mental limitations of the person making that insistence than it does about the facts on the ground. With regard to magic, I gather you haven't read my essays on <i>The Well of Galabes</i>, where I've stated at rather some length that magic doesn't violate any of the laws of nature. Magic is the art and science of causing changes in consciousness in accordance with will, not a surrogate technology or an escape hatch in the laws of nature -- but you'll find that explained in detail on my other blog, and also at even more length in my books on magic. <br><br>Kevin, many thanks for clarifying! I think we're in agreement, then. In a previous post here, <a href=../../2013/09/the-next-ten-billion-years.html rel=nofollow>The Next Ten Billion Years</a>, I sketched out a hypothetical future history in which humanity has more than eight thousand global civilizations in the ten million years or so our species has left, and some of those accomplish things our current civilization hasn't even dreamed of achieving -- all on a renewable basis, of course, since that's all that will be left once our civilization falls.<br><br>Dan, yeah, I know clowns who get really upset when people compare politicians to them. It's hard to come up with a metaphor that doesn't have that problem!<br><br>Phil, I wonder if that's an offshoot of the "Satanic ritual abuse" panic that made such waves in the US a while back. <br><br>Mark, I've long thought that if Obama had simply had the guts to let the Justice Department prosecute a few of the most egregious bank frauds, the Democrats would have had a lock on the White House for a couple of decades. <br><br>team10tim, any civilization smart enough to last for 100,000 years would be too smart to fall into the kind of hubris that makes rearranging the solar system look like a good idea. (Besides which, that concept's been done to death in SF -- Larry Niven was writing about long-lived civilizations moving planets around back in the 1970s.) The whole point of the Space Bats challenges is to get people thinking of futures that aren't loaded down with that kind of gargantuan technofantasy. <br><br>Mark, interesting.

New saudi king, egyptian govt, even israels see ruusia as go to place for realpolitik solutions to crises. America has lost initiative in eurasia completely.

One thing that those not resident in the UK might like to look for (utube has several excerpts) is the first encounter between Corbyn and our current PM, Cameron, during the shameful theatre known as Prime Ministers Questions (PMQ). <br><br>Whatever one thinks of Corbyn and his leftist leanings, this was the first time ever that PMQ time had been dedicated to issues submitted by the electorate. Whether this was simply a clever stunt or not (I suspect the not), it was shocking to see how quickly the hooting and screeching mob behind the Prime Minister were tied up in knots by Corbyns refusal to engage in the aggressive circus that PMQ has become.<br> <br>It is painfully obvious that whatever his policies, Corbyn has now to face the massed opposition that forms most, but quite all, the British press and TV.

'Socialism' makes much more sense over here than it does in the US, with your founding stories of the making of the country by sturdy independent settlers. Our stories are of the great communal revolts against the ruling powers from the Norman Conquest on - the fourteenth century Peasants' Revolt, the seventeenth century Diggers &amp; Levellers, the nineteenth century Chartists, the Tolpuddle Martyrs etc. and they're all to do with justice for the poor and oppressed, with the rights of the community, with restoring the lost commons - all of which could be described as forms of 'socialism'.<br><br>So Jeremy Corbyn's philosophy is grounded in that long tradition of fighting for communal rights. But at the same time he's in the forefront when it comes to fighting the neo-liberal status quo with contemporary weapons - people power - and a contemporary vision - democracy for real: restoring powers to local communities; respecting the Earth: switching from fossil fuels to renewables; social justice: using taxes to reverse the ever-increasing gap between the rich and the rest of us.<br><br>And renationalising the railways makes perfect sense. At present under privatisation we have the most expensive and the worst run train services in Europe. Meanwhile the national train companies of other European nations have bought up parts of our network, and the profits they make from our trains go straight over to get re-invested in their own national railway networks. The same applies to our privatised utilities, where the money we all pay for water, gas and electricity which used to come back to our government to reinvest now disappears out of the country. Wouldn't it be better for the US if more money was spent by your government on reinvesting in what we read is a crumbling infrastructure, in roads, bridges, a modern railway system?<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c5650038386342121336 title="comment permalink">9/19/15, 2:47 AM</a><br><br>

If it helps, I was actually referring to his actions rather than the actual character. Sorry. I do get that you love your fiction and are creating something amazing out of your own ideas, and my thoughtless words were moronic in and of themselves. The passion in the comment derived from my own real world experience with the many community groups which eventually drove me to complete distraction with them and their consensus politics.<br><br>Forests are a wonderful place to contemplate the world, and today I was doing all sorts of work in there - for the benefit of the forest and all of its denizens as well as myself - and took time to contemplate and meditate (I find that sort of labour exceptionally meditative) and had a whole lot of time to contemplate my own actions.<br><br>Honestly, I was gutted when I read that my story had missed out from being included in the anthology. I'm no stranger to disappointment, but for some reason I'd invested way too much emotional energy into the recent attempt at fiction writing – when, as you are well aware, there are other concerns that I should be spending my time on that are perhaps better suited to my skills. The final story that I submitted arose out of the ashes of the previous idea that I mentioned previously to you. Fiction writing for me is a painful process in that it is like sitting an exam when you have absolutely no idea what the structure of the matter is and even if you submit words, there is no possibility of improving because there is absolutely no feedback mechanism. Al you get from the process is a pass or fail result. And if I were to take a course, read a how to manual, attend lectures or groups - then how do I even know if all that I am writing is merely a reproduction of someone else’s concept of what fiction should look like? How does dissensus even fit into that creative process? - it has been a question that I have been pondering today whilst out in the forest: Where do ideas come from and who owns them? It is not a clear cut issue at all.<br><br>I remarked to you many years ago, John-Michael: how do we know where your thoughts stop - or any of the commenters here for that matter - and ours start? I don't believe that there is even an answer to that question and I don’t expect one.<br><br>Given the spirit of last week’s comments you could say that I was being a true numpty in my previous comment. Again, please accept my humble apologies. Hang around anyone long enough and you’ll see that they have the occasional bad day.

And for sharing its orbit with Mars. And even for getting it moving in the first place.<br><br>And that, of course, is the snare. The geeky fun of technical problem-solving; the illusion of plausibility. Just gather me enough of those shiny precious Joules...<br><br>That's one factor that speaks to your questions, Ventriloquist. Another (out of several more) that I think comes into play is that when talking about the universe, no matter how big a number you come up with, there's a bigger number you can set it against. For instance, that prohibitively enormous amount of energy needed for the 1/10 light speed Enterprise excursion is considerably less than the sun puts out in a hundredth of a second. The far greater amount needed to move Venus to Mars's orbit is about two weeks' worth of the sun's output, or an insignificantly tiny fraction of Jupiter's orbital energy. "The energy's right there!"<br><br>It sounds almost reasonable if you think only of the quantities (distances, times, even energies) and not of the material effort actually required, and if you disregard risks and side effects.<br><br>Appended later: I see that the method team10tim had in mind does involve using some of Jupiter's potential energy, transferring energy between two planets via the "slingshot" effects of a large asteroid shuttling between them. I'm not familiar with the details of the scheme, but it sounds like the physics is valid. However, it would still involve engineering on an unprecedented scale to push and steer the asteroid. Maneuvering a 100+ kilometer asteroid still represents controlling (though not directly generating) millions of times more power than anything humans have ever done before. And if the project were abandoned partway through for any reason (say, the civilization in question only lasts 40,000 years), the orbits of Venus and Earth could end up close enough to influence one another via gravitational resonance, likely dooming both worlds within a few million years thereafter.<br><br>(Now <i>that</i> might make a good very-far-future story. As the earth and Venus draw closer to flinging each other out of their orbits, what myths might whatever civilization exists by then tell, to explain why?)<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c2227892556398351002 title="comment permalink">9/19/15, 7:06 AM</a><br><br>

There are no meaningful middle grounds in the attributes I brought up. There might be room for compromise in other aspects of political economy, but as far as class, hierarchies, property, form of governance and monetarism, there is no other dimension. What’s amusing to me is how people like yourself insist that they defy categorization as if they’re somehow on a higher plane of wisdom that defies the comprehension of mere mortals. I was inclined to call you an anarchist of the Bookchin or Kropotkin type, but since you don’t like “the straightjacket of left-and-right,” I’ll leave it alone. Anyway, I want your take on other items.<br><br>Your definition of magic is not consistent with the descriptions I’ve heard from other prominent occultists, Manly P. Hall and Aleister Crowley in particular. Even the supernatural effects of the magical rituals you describe don’t fit into any conventional scientific materialist. If magic is only a conscious rewiring, then how do you explain, for example, Dean Radin’s noetic science experiments in precognition? Can you list some of the phenomenon you believe occur in magical rituals? By the way, I can attest that I have unequivocally experienced some of these states in my own life.

One thing, I am well aware of, is that thinking so much about it and observing where the topic is beeing disscused, more and more all is looking like an accelerating slide down to post-carbon future. On the other side I dont think, its a mere illusion. Sure, decline has long started.<br><br>Out of what I know about us human species, I lack the confidence, that a significant portion of people will clearsightedly enter a trail towards that post-carbon future. Instead I see that an engraved genetic programm ends in cognitive dissonance. Probably in order to cope with that overhelming fear and pain nobody can deny.<br><br>Anyway, the fassade of that "All will be o.k!" attidude will be tumbling down. Mass phenomenons of panic, annoyance and especially blaming others for all that bad bad things to happen, will take place.<br><br>Our societies are overstreched and due to tear apart. Time is up to reduce the complexity. So, there are political movements represented by Bernie Sanders, Jeremy Corbyn and whoever. They are only symptoms of what happens. There is no saviour on the horizon! Remember; the light in the tunnel isn´t the exit we are getting nearer, but a train fast approaching.<br><br>Remeber Barack Obama having not remained the saviour, people wished him to be. I consider him being a goodwilling capable person. However most of the population is in denial of post-carbon future and the overhelming established forces are far too strong to be defeated. Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn fates are predictable. No miracle shall happen. No exit! Collapse is unavoidable!<br><br>Even, I rather doubt, that after 300 years, JMG´s prediced dark ages, people will remember the real reasons behind our decline. Far from it! There will be myth´s blaming the losers for having done it ominously wrong. To my knowledge there is a mutual agreement traditionally on such breakdowns. The old ones call it generally, having acted against the rules of God or the gods. So with the mythical Atlantis, down to all vanished real civilisations.<br><br>Great efforts of historians over many past decades reveal nowadays the actual multidude of reasons being really behind collapsed societies. Most reasonable for me ist Joseph Tainters conclusion, that every society is collapsing, due to the diminishing returns of the costs, encountered by the societies comlexity.<br><br>The message is, all life is going to end.

I didn't say that violent revolutions always fail; I said that a successful revolution, violent or otherwise, comes at the end of a much more complex process in which violence plays no role -- which is a very different thing. As for Putin, he's an extremely competent statesman who, if the current events in Syria are any guide, is about to score yet another win against the fatuous incompetents in Washington DC. I disagree with many of the man's policies, but I respect his abilities and his achievement. <br><br>Neil, one way or another, it'll be entertaining to watch!<br><br>Jacky, you might want to have lunch sometime with the Bernie Sanders fans on this blog. A little while back, I didn't happen to mention him in a post that referenced a few of our other presidential candidates, and they decided that I hated him and belabored me for that alleged opinion. Now here you are, swinging a cudgel at me because -- having already noted that who Britons choose as their next prime minister is none of my business -- I expressed a lack of enthusiasm for socialism. Here's a thought -- after you've had lunch with the Sanders fans, the lot of you could dress up a straw man in archdruid robes and beat it up to your heart's content! <br><br>Martin, thanks for this. Of course that's one of the problems; human beings have never even been able to solve the three-body problem, and now we've got people talking confidently of rearranging the entire solar system for humanity's alleged benefit. I'd like to point out that the biggest danger to our species' survival isn't the sort of cosmic catastrophe that so often gets brought up as a justification for such harebrained schemes. The biggest danger to our species' survival is precisely our tendency to assume that we can tamper with systems we don't understand, and not suffer any negative consequences as a result. <br><br>Cherokee, I wasn't offended at all. I understand about the story -- I've fielded enough rejection slips in my time to know how it feels! The fact of the matter was that I had twelve slots to fill; sixty people submitted stories, so five-sixths of those were mathematically certain to be rejected, and it didn't help that well over half the stories were publishable by any standard. This is one of the reasons I made the plaintive note earlier about wanting a quarterly magazine! Mind you, that may well happen; as of this morning, I've received no fewer than four serious proposals for such a magazine -- and when the dust settles and it's clear who's actually going to do the thing, all the stories that were submitted to the fourth Space Bats challenge and not chosen for the anthology are going to be emailed to the editor of the new magazine, so that he or she has a good collection of raw material for the first few issues.<br><br>Do I have bad days? Of course. Fortunately this isn't one of them. ;-)<br><br>Tony, thank you. He looks quite fetching in that kind of outfit, doesn't he? <br><br>I Janas, getting a book published in another language requires two things -- a publisher willing to publish it, and a translator willing to translate it. If you happen to know a German small press that would like to publish these anthologies, please let me know and I'll put 'em in touch with my publisher!<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c1154892295324430381 title="comment permalink">9/19/15, 4:32 PM</a><br><br>

Still, your assumption is exactly the kind of absurdity that normally results when a complex system of ideas gets flattened out into some overly simple-minded set of categories. As for magic, I gather that Crowley and Hall are the only writers on the subject you've read -- and I'm pretty sure I know which one of Hall's books, too, as his later works, written after he learned more about occult traditions, were considerably more nuanced and accurate. I'd encourage you to read Eliphas Levi, Dion Fortune, Israel Regardie, and Gareth Knight if you want a less one-dimensional grasp of the subject.<br><br>Onething, only if he speaks on matters of state in pig Latin. He would probably make more sense that way anyway. <br><br>SLClaire, whatever theme the next anthology has, I'm sure it'll be worth a read. I've been quite frankly stunned by the quality of writing in the submissions to these contests. When I launched the first Space Bats challenge, I figured it was even odds I wouldn't get enough publishable stories for an anthology at all -- and then the stories started coming in, and it suddenly became a matter of figuring out how to choose among three times as many stories as I had space for! Since then, if anything, it's gotten worse -- I'm convinced that some of the writers in this latest anthology are going to become major names in the next wave of science fiction, the wave that finally washes over the sand castles of techno-narcissism and turns SF back into the literature of challenging ideas it used to be. If these contests help some of those writers launch their careers, I'll be a very happy archdruid!<br><br>Ed-M, I insist on the natty uniform. It really does suit him! <br><br>Howard, I was thinking of <i>A World Out Of Time</i> rather than <i>Ringworld</i> -- the former is the one where Niven has a longlived civilization tossing Earth into orbit around Jupiter, using one of the outer gas giants to provide the gravitational slingshot effect. As for the Dyson Sphere, no question, that one's way up there in the techno-hubris scale. <br><br>Hubertus, of course!

You don't need to do an expensive course either (I've never done one) as there are books available for a few bucks which outline the basic concepts. You really need a library of books rather than one or two sources to nut out how to live well on a small holding.<br><br>I reckon a design is all well and good, but rarely does it stand the test of the real world (Sun Tzu had something to say about that too). Every season, I modify and adapt my surroundings based on what I've learned over the past few years and it is really the extreme conditions that teach you the most. If you got things right the first time around, you probably wouldn't realise that you had done so. All up I reckon you could say quite comfortably, that Permaculture is a starting point on a long journey and not an end of itself - anyway, from a big picture perspective, the whole lot looks to me more like a circle.<br><br>Caryn, well done with that discovery. Every year, your seeds will get a little bit hardier and more prolific if you choose wisely.

In the examples I brought up, I don’t believe there is any room for mixed options. Either you’re in favor of private property or not; either you’re in favor of using money or not; either you’re in favor of class stratification or not; either you’re in favor of involuntary hierarchies or not.

I can imagine a social system in which no two people are allowed to be equal under law, but the advantages and disadvantages of such equality are set to run at cross purposes with one another, so that no single person can ever acquire all that much power over very many other people.

We should try to find, and converge on, a name that will catch the interest of potential readers, rather than driving them away. One initial resistance we'll encounter from many is the worry that this kind of fiction will be dismal.<br><br>"Science Fiction" was a powerful name because <i>science</i> was a powerful totem during the 20th Century. Other names for genres of the fantastic tended to emphasize memorable, intriguing, or culturally powerful concepts: High Fantasy, Horror, Sword and Sorcery, Planetary Fiction, Hard SF, Cyberpunk, Steampunk, Post-Apocalyptic.<br><br>"Deindustrial" would frankly be an underwhelming addition to that company. Although technically accurate (referencing the process of industrialism's end, and the aftermath), it has the following defects:<br><br> - On first glance, it's too much like the form "not (something)". A categorical definition in terms of what something is <i>not</i> is inherently weak. <br><br> - <i>This kind of fiction is not really about the end of industrialism.</i> It does, and must, deal with the inevitability of industrialism's end; but that's only the beginning. <br><br>Extrapolating from the Space Bats contest rules, I submit that this kind of fiction is about three principles of constraint:<br><br> 1. <b>Ye cannae change the laws of thermodynamics. Nor circumvent them.</b> (This permits speculative science, without enabling Space Bats that violate the core concept.)<br><br> 2. <b>Interstellar travel is not meaningfully feasible.</b> See #1; also, Charlie Stross's <a href=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/06/the-high-frontier-redux.html rel=nofollow>classic takedown of the feasibility of space colonization</a>.<br><br> 3. <b>Technic civilizations, on this single planet, will follow in more or less rhythmic succession.</b> Each civilization will have its own characteristic technological suite, <i>and its own sciences</i>. Some successor civilizations will presumably be more brief, others more prolonged, but they will all rise, have their apex, and fall; and there will be interim periods, dark ages, in which the benefits of civilization are lost and the scraps of historical and cultural memory, and the remnants of the sciences and technologies of the lost civilizations, will seed the intellectual soil of the next civilization's rise.<br><br>What can we call this?<br><br>Myself, I have taken to calling it "Ecotechnic SF". Which is probably a grievous violation, given that "ecotechnic" is a specific term of art in JMG's nonfiction writings.

It was quite educating to listen you talk with deeply learned European like him. Your points of view about Europe became more clear during that interview also, because man of his caliber can ask right questions. It also showed, between the lines, why talking about meaning of religion and it's impact to social fabric never truly passes trans-Atlantic voyage. You Americans just have so different environment where to operate over there. As I predicted many years ago, and as Hungary and speeches of it's leader Viktor Orban highlight, old identities are now taken out from storage and dusted, as this new modern identity decays. It is 15th century all over again, voivode Hunyadi fighting against Ottoman hordes in the name of Christian faith. People rally around their core identity as Dark Ages tighten it's grip around all of us, and division lines between these different identity groups widen all the time. It is only media and upper-middle class keeping up this hollow shell of multiculturalism and globalism. Nobody else believes anymore outside that hermetically sealed alternative reality. And I really mean nobody, to my own astonishment. Faith and trust towards ideological basis and competence of EU elites have collapsed astonishingly rapidly among common people, in just couple of months. I guess there was same kind zeitgeist during 80's in Soviet Union.<br><br>By the way, speaking about science fiction book that truly delivered, have you read Jean Raspail's The camp of saints? It made accurate prediction about future of Europe over thirty years ago. Future of that book is today's news in Europe.

I've been really "into" permaculture for the last 4 years. Did two Permaculture Design Courses. The first one was local and not really worth it. The second one was Geoff Lawton's(known worldwide for his designs) online one. It was pricey but worth every penny (to me), mostly due to a focus on water catchment and earthworks. I attend one permaculture gathering per year, mostly to hang out with my tribe and learn a few things. <br><br>After four years of permaculture-ing, here's my take on it all: there are people who truly "do" permaculture. These people have no time to meet or even be online. There is simply too much hard work to be done and too many new skill bases to be mastered. But there are a lot more of these people out there than you think - and the base is growing. <br><br>Then there are people who like to meet about permaculture. These people often are urbanites who don't have access to much land. Some dig in where they can and do what they can. Others like to meet and plot and discuss about the New World Permaculture Order. <br><br>It's easy to find the latter.

I've been reading posts and comments here and elsewhere from 2011 or so - that's a couple of years in when the Recession really started to bite - lots of plaintive cries of 'what the hell do I do?!?' Lots of people then, as now, willing to accept collapse and the spiritual and phsycial work that go with it - but oh, the price - family tensions, walking away from a career or paying gig, land worth farming priced out of reach, living situations that limit one's options. The mismatch between hard-won, old-fashioned craft skills, and what people are willing to pay for while cheap food and foreign-made crap are cheaply available. I'm all in on 'collapse now and avoid the rush' but how far does one collapse? To an 1860's subsistence farmer? Or learn a useful 1910-era trade? Or try to exist in two worlds, one foot in the industrial economy and one foot in the garden, working on the ecotechnic future when time allows (this is my personal situation, wry LOL) I see this and other dilemmas as rich ground for SF prose: these troubles biting hard and there being lots of painful, irreversible and often lonely choices being made.<br><br>I suspect many of the collected stories thus far deal with collapse in the past tense (I've read only the first volume and a smattering of entries that were available online) So stories set square in the downward curve might be worth writing and reading to brace up those of us with lots on our minds. As always, thanks for the opportunity these contests provide - a rewarding, mind-bending exercise for all us aspiring authors. And a hearty congrats to the latest winners...cheers<br><br><a href=another-world-is-inevitable.html#c1868081651387877997 title="comment permalink">10/5/15, 6:54 PM</a><br><br>
