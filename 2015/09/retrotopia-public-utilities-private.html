<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the fourth installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator, having arrived in the capital of the Lakeland Republic, discovers that things are even stranger there than he thought... </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d already guessed that the hotel lobby probably wouldn’t look much like the ones I was used to seeing elsewhere, and so I wasn’t surprised. Instead of the glaring lights, security cameras, and automated check-in kiosks I was used to, it was a comfortable space with sofas and chairs around the edges, ornate chandeliers overhead, and a couple of desks staffed by actual human beings over to one side; off to the other side, glass doors framed in wood led into what looked like a full-service restaurant. A bellhop—was that the right word?—came trotting over to take my suitcase as soon as I came through the door, said something pleasant, and followed me over to the check-in desk. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ve got a reservation,” I said to the clerk. “The name’s Peter Carr.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d been wondering whether the hotel would turn out to use an old-fashioned computer system with a keyboard and screen, but apparently even that was too complex for local standards. Instead, the clerk pulled out a three-ring binder, opened it, and found my reservation in about as much time as it would have taken to input a name on a veepad and wait for a response to come out of the cloud. “Welcome to the Capitol Hotel, Mr. Carr. We have you down for fourteen nights.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s right.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Looks like everything’s paid for in advance. If you’ll sign here.” She handed me a clipboard with a sheet of paper on it and an old-fashioned ballpoint pen. Fortunately I hadn’t quite forgotten how to produce a non-digital signature, and signed on the line at the bottom. “Anything you order in the restaurant here—” She motioned toward the doors on the far side of the room. “—or for room service can be billed to the room account. How many keys will you want?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Just one.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She opened a drawer, pulled out an honest-to-Pete metal key with a ring and a tag with the room number on it. “Here you go. Stairs are right down the hall; if you need the elevator it’s to the left. Is there anything else I can do for you? Enjoy your stay, Mr. Carr.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I thanked her and headed for the hall with the bellhop in tow. My room was on the third floor and the stairs didn’t look too challenging, so I asked him, “Do you mind if we take the stairs?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not a bit,” he said. “Comes with the job.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We started up the stairs. “Do you get a lot of people here from outside the Lakeland Republic?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“All the time. Capitol’s just four blocks away, and Embassy Row’s between here and there. We had the foreign minister of Qu<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>é</span>bec here just last week.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No kidding.” There had been rumors for years that the Qu<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>é</span>becois started tacitly ignoring the embargo even before Canada broke up; we had decent relations with Montréal these days, but that hadn’t always been the case, and so any news about what was going on between Québec and the Lakeland Republic were worth my attention. “Big official visit, or what?”</div>
<br>“Pretty much, yeah,” said the bellhop. “Really nice lady. Had a bottle of champagne sent up to her room first thing every morning.” <div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I laughed. “Heck of a breakfast.”<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'> </span></div>
<br>“Nah, breakfast was a couple of hours later, with more champagne. Go figure.”<br><br>We got to the third floor, left the stair, and went down the hall to my room. “Just leave it inside the door,” I said, meaning the suitcase. “Thanks.” <br><br>“Sure thing.” <br><br> I didn’t have any Lakeland money to tip him, but guessed the couple of Atlantic bills I had would do. Fortunately I was right; he grinned, thanked me, and headed back toward the stair. <br><br>The room was bigger than I’d expected, with a queen-sized bed on one side and a desk and dresser on the other. I knew there wouldn’t be a veebox, but thought there might be a screen or even an old-fashioned television in the room, but no dice. The only things even vaguely electronic were a telephone on the desk and a boxy thing on the dresser that had a loudspeaker and some dials on it—a radio, I guessed, and decided to leave turning it on for later. Curtained windows on the far wall let through diffuse light; I went over and pulled the curtains open. <br><br>The bellhop hadn’t been kidding. There was the Capitol dome, half-complete, rising up above a ragged roofline right in front of me. That would be convenient, I decided, and let the curtains fall again. <br><br>I got my things settled and then went to the desk and the big envelope of yellowish paper sitting on top of it. Inside was the notebook Melissa Berger had mentioned, a couple of pens, a packet of papers that had BANK OF TOLEDO printed across the top of each sheet, an identification card with my name and photo on it, a wallet that was pretty clearly meant to hold money and the ID card, and a letter on government stationery welcoming me to Toledo in the usual bland terms, over President Meeker’s signature. Then there were half a dozen pages of instructions on how to get by in the Lakeland Republic, which covered everything from customary tips (I’d overtipped the bellhop, though not extravagantly) to who to contact in this or that kind of emergency. I nodded; clearly the bellhop hadn’t been exaggerating when he mentioned plenty of foreign guests. <br><br>I dropped my veepad in a desk drawer and got the wallet and some of the papers settled into the empty pocket. First things first, I decided: visit the bank and get the money thing sorted out, then get some lunch and do a bit of wandering. <br><br>Down in the lobby, the concierge was behind his desk. “Can I help you?”<br><br>“Please. I need to know where to find the Bank—” All at once I couldn’t remember the name, and reached for the papers in my pocket. <br><br>“Out the door,” said the concierge, “hang a left, go a block and a half straight ahead, and you’ll be standing right in front of it.” <div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I considered him. “You don’t need to know which bank?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“There’s only one in town.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That startled me, though I managed not to show it. “Okay, thanks.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Have a great day,” he said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I headed out the doors, turned left, started along the sidewalk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A cold damp wind was rushing past, pushing shreds of cloud across the sky, and it didn’t take me long to figure out why most of the other people on the sidewalk were wearing hats and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>long coats; they looked much warmer than I felt. Still, Philadelphia has plenty of cold weather, and I was used to the way the chill came through bioplastic business wear. What annoyed me a little, or more than a little, was the way that my clothing made me stick out like a sore thumb. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In retrospect, it was amusing. Everybody else on the sidewalk looked like extras from half a dozen random history vids, everything from fedoras and trench coats to the kind of thing that was last in style when Toledo was a frontier town, and there I was, the only person in town in modern clothing—and you can guess for yourself who was the conspicuous one. The adults gave me startled looks and then pretended that nothing was up, but the kids stared wide-eyed as though I had two extra heads or something. As I said, it was amusing in retrospect, but at the time it made me acutely uncomfortable, and I was glad to get to the bank. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was a three-story brick building on a street corner. Fortunately it had BANK OF TOLEDO—CAPITOL BRANCH above the doors, or I’d probably have missed it, since it didn’t look anything like the banks I was used to. Inside was even weirder: no security cameras, no automated kiosks, no guards in helmets and flak jackets pacing the balcony waiting for trouble, just a lobby with a greeter inside the door and a short line of patrons waiting for tellers. The greeter met me with a cheery “Hi, how can we help you today?” I got out the bank papers, and a minute or two later got shown into one of three little office spaces off the main lobby. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On the other side of the desk was a middle-aged African-American man with a neatly trimmed beard. “I’m Larry Jones,” he said, getting up to shake my hand. “Pleased to meet you, Mr.—” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Carr,” I said. “Peter Carr.” We got the formalities out of the way and sat down; I handed him the papers; he checked them, we discussed some of the details, and he then unlocked a drawer in his desk and pulled out a big envelope.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Okay,” he said. “Everything’s good. The only question I have at this point is whether you’ve ever used cash or checks before.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m guessing,” I said, “that you ask that question fairly often.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“These days, yes,” he replied. “Bit of a change since before the Treaty.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I bet. The answer, though, is cash, yes; checks—well, I’ve seen a few of them.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Okay, fair enough.” He looked relieved, and I wondered how many people from the cashless countries he’d had to walk through the details of counting out coins. “Here’s your checkbook,” he said, pulling the thing out of the envelope, and then opened it and showed me how to write a check. “Up here,” he said, flipping open a notebookish thing in front, “is where you keep track of how much you’ve spent.” He must have caught my expression, because he broke into a broad smile and said, “Long time since you’ve done math with a pen, I bet.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Depends on how long it’s been since never,” I told him. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He laughed. “Gotcha. Glad to say we can help you out there, too.” He opened a different drawer in his desk, handed me a flat little shape of brass. “This is a mechanical calculator,” he said. “Adds and subtracts for you.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I took the thing, gave it a baffled look. “I didn’t know you could do that without electronics.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I think we’re the only country on earth that still makes these.” He showed me how to use the stylus to slide the digits up and down. Once I had it figured out, I thanked him and tucked the calculator and checkbook into my pocket. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Do you have a minute?” I asked then. “I’ve got a couple of questions about the way you do things here—about banking, mostly.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sure thing,” he said. “Ask away.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The concierge at the hotel said there’s only one bank here in Toledo. Is that true everywhere in the Lakeland Republic?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yes, if you’re talking about consumer banking.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Is it the same bank everywhere?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Good heavens, no. Each county and each city of any size has its own bank, like it has its own water and sewer district and so on.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That makes it sound like a public utility,” I said, baffled. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s exactly what it is. Again, that’s just consumer banking. We’ve got privately owned commercial banks here, but those do investment banking only—they’re not allowed to offer savings and checking accounts, consumer loans, small business services, that sort of thing, just like we’re not allowed to do any kind of investment banking.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I shook my head, baffled. “Why the restriction?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Well, that used to be law in the United States, from the 1930s to the 1980s or so, and it worked pretty well—it was after they changed the law that the economy really started running off the rails, you know. So our legislature changed the law back after Partition, and it’s worked pretty well for us, too.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I don’t think banks were public utilities back then,” I objected. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No, that was mostly further back, and only some banks,” he agreed. “The thing is, the way we see it, there are some things that private industry does really well and some things that it doesn’t do well at all, and public utilities like water, sewer service, electricity, public transit, consumer banking, that sort of thing—those work better when you don’t let private interests milk them for profits. I know you do things different back home.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“True enough. But isn’t it more efficient to leave those things to private industry?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That depends, Mr. Carr, on what you mean by efficiency.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That intrigued me. “Please go on.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Unexpectedly, he laughed. “I give a talk on that every year at one of the homeschool associations here in town. Efficiency is always a ratio—more or less efficient at producing an output in terms of a given input. A chemical process is efficient if it turns out more product for the same amount of raw materials, or the ssme amount of energy, or what have you. We get people from outside all the time talking about how this or that would be more efficient than what we do, and you know what? None of them seem to be able to answer a simple question: efficient for what output, in terms of what input?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I could see where this was going, and decided to head onto a different tack. “And having consumer banks as public utilities,” I said. “Is that more efficient for some output in terms of some input?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We don’t worry so much about that,” the banker said. “The question that matters to most people here is much simpler: does it work or doesn’t it?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“How do you tell?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
“History, Mr. Carr,” he said. He was smiling again. “History.” </div>

The publicly owned utilities reliably provided better service at a lower cost. I suspect publicly owned banks would do exactly the same thing.

The dry climate of that period was likely caused by weather patterns emanating from the still present ice sheets in Canada, but if climate change were to produce a drier climate in the Great Lakes region, or even if the precipitation amounts stayed similar but evaporation increased significantly due to warmer average temperatures, the lakes could become closed basins again, which would not only impede shipping between the lakes, but also lead to wildly fluctuating water levels and pollutants becoming concentrated.<br><br>The Great Lakes area does have a number of advantages in a deindustral society where the coasts are dealing with rising seas, but their Achilles heel is vulnerability to a drier overall climate. On the other hand, as long as longer term trends bring enough precipitation, their huge size makes them resilient to shorter term droughts.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c4918759140542422384 title="comment permalink">9/23/15, 5:23 PM</a><br><br>

I'm of course with you on the Glass-Stegal separation, but it seems to me that profit motive and the tragedy of the commons would be amplified when it comes to facilitating investment and hedging risk and all the fun stuff unregulated financial wizards can do with market derivatives and such. Perhaps the separation itself provides the psychological impetus for the financial non-elite to steer clear of securities altogether and thus the cash flow to their version of Wall Street is naturally throttled by such "inefficiencies" caused by this impetus?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c6309718529397695982 title="comment permalink">9/23/15, 5:51 PM</a><br><br>

One is what you mention, what are the inputs and what are the outputs that are considered important. The other dimension is risk. Whatever process, e.g. borrowing and lending, the outcomes are not entirely predictable. Sometimes things come out really well and other times it can be a bit of a disaster. One can envision a probability distribution of outcomes. Maybe process A is moderately better than process B 80% of the time. But 20% of the time process B is still doing OK while process A is a total catastrophe. Which process is more efficient?

It seems to me there would be less possibility of losing all your money, and loans made to government owning the bank need not have exorbitant interest rates.<br><br>As for privatization, here's an example of what can happen: BC ferries used to be publicly run, and is now privately run. The food has gotten better, but passage is much more expensive and the bigger ferries now devote a significant portion of their space to fancy restaurants or other areas that you have to pay extra to get into. Those are aimed at business travel. <br><br>Schedules for smaller routes seem to have worsened, which has big impacts on isolated communities. There has also been several high profile accidents, including a ferry that sank and from which the passengers had to be rescued, and a collision with a dock. The catamaran-hulled ferries they bought were really expensive when you consider they can't get up to full speed on much of the journey because the ferry is traveling close to and in between islands and they don't want to swamp places with the wake, resulting in very little time being shaved off the voyage to and from Vancouver Island. I'm not sure the catamarans have much to do with the privatization, but the next one definitely does: The CEO is now making much more money. I don't think privatizing BC ferries was a success for most people who use the services regularly.<br><br>I notice you have divided Canada up in this story. How many pieces are you positing, if you've considered it in detail? Are Alberta and BC separate or together?

It is a strange place where I feel that it is not safe to leave things that you wish to retrieve at some later stage. Don't you think that it is funny that computers moved from a few decades ago when they were centrally controlled dumb terminals into these super nifty independent machines - only to be taken slowly back bit by bit to transform into centrally controlled dumb terminals again. You have to admit that it is weird.<br><br>It is interesting that you introduced the concept of Mr Carr lost in reverie on his way to the bank. Am I correct to assume that Mr Carr will be staying on for a bit longer than he expects? No need to reveal plot secrets though!<br><br>I don't laugh about the automated bank kiosks - they're already clamouring for them here. Apparently the boards of the banks are a bit nervous about the move after there was a significant customer backlash after they tried it the last time around. Still, if they act in concert...<br><br>I have a particular fondness for the days of paper ledgers. You know what though, if the person preparing them can do long addition quickly and accurately - they are actually faster to prepare than the computerised versions. It is also worthwhile mentioning that I was not allowed to use a calculator back in the day - even in exams (except for the final state wide exam). The only real advantage with the computerised versions is the fancy report writers - they are good, no doubts about it. The cloud versions of the software are much slower than local or network for obvious reasons – and it has absolutely nothing to do with the internet connection here which is possibly much faster than it actually needs to be. It is really unsettling to mention this to people only to have them disbelieve me and then see it for themselves after they’ve committed and there is often no going back. The marketing is good for that stuff though. I just don't – or can’t – tell sexy stories of progress.<br><br>Yes efficiency is a very misused term. Have you ever wondered at the word reform? I heard it used yesterday I believe. The new Prime Minister here apparently announced that he'd be seeking tax reforms, in the form of a tax cut for the highest income earners. If I was being very cheeky I'd could say that we now know his trade and now we know his price - but I'm not that cheeky to suggest anything as crude as that.<br><br>An enjoyable tale and I look forward to reading the paperback edition in full.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: I've got a new blog entry up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Frankenstein lives</a> where I tell a steam punk tale of life here.

One of the things that seemed to have mostly disappeared from everyday life is wool clothing for winter wear. I'm thinking working people's wool shirts, vests, and coats not dress suits. There are still a few makers but mostly available only by "mail order". I'm guessing the people in the Lakeland Republic have started up some small scale manufacturing of natural fiber warm clothes and purchase their wool from some of the local farmers. I know they would be able to sell plenty to merchants north and west of them. Let's see, the banks were deregulated in the 1980s and the clothing turned to "all natural polyester" and flooded the market with cheap imports as the North American clothing industry mostly went bankrupt. I'm looking forward to a warm set of woolies when it's thirty below this winter.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c597607704658480806 title="comment permalink">9/23/15, 6:37 PM</a><br><br>

Because absent some yet-to-be-explained taboo or prohibition, the complete absence of such things strikes an unrealistic chord, given that Lakeland appears to otherwise be a pretty prosperous culture.<br><br>For example, magnetic card readers are SIMPLE electrical technology. They are currently done with integrated circuits, but they don't have to be - you can do it with analog electronics. And while it would not make sense in a residential or even most commercial contexts, a hotel keeper would bend over backwards to have it, because physical keys are a huge pain in the butt for them. Analog electric locks (like modern electronic locks) eliminate the need to change the lock every time a guest loses or forgets to return a key, for example. And you can re-key the lock for every guest, so security is enhanced.<br><br>I understand the point you are trying to make about the fabricatory depth of modern electronics and the externalized costs associated with them. But there are a lot of things which we currently do using high-fab-depth technologies where the function could be duplicated with lower-depth technologies if the function is useful. Most of the functions we currently put those technologies towards are not very useful, but a few are. Those functions are likely to be preserved or recreated if the society has the technological base to do so, which Lakeland does appear to have.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c5500735716096410485 title="comment permalink">9/23/15, 7:55 PM</a><br><br>

I had a cheap tin version in grade school (and at a different time, a cheap plastic version of the kind of mechanical adder that's a row of rotary dials.) I wish I'd saved them, but like most things taken to school, they were probably lost or stolen by Thanksgiving.<br><br>To operate it, you enter your addends one digit at a time using the stylus. You can proceed in left to right order just as you would write the numbers. Insert the stylus in the hole or notch at the number. If the slider next to the number is white, move the stylus down to the bottom (the white means no carry is needed). If it's red, requiring a carry, move the stylus up to the top (subtracting the ten's-complement of the number you're entering from the current place) and then continue around the little hook shape to the left and down a little (adding one to the next place). An extra step is needed if the next higher digit was already 9. Subtraction works similarly but needs a second set of slots, essentially the same thing upside-down, that operate the same set of internal sliders.<br><br>Unlike an abacus, the rather finicky poking and sliding operation of the Addiator doesn't lend itself to high speeds with proficiency. It's probably not faster than pencil and paper for most people. But it is faster to learn than either of those. (Even so, Carr seemed to pick it up rather quickly.

The Lakeland Republic is, of course, taking your view that economic history should outweigh overly-abstracted economic theory, and is better off for it.<br><br>One thing occurs to me, though. Economics is, of course, the home of some of the best examples of so-called "magical thinking," and of systematically ignoring evidence in favor of elegant theories. Those with the boldness to criticize economics as a whole have frequently called it a pseudoscience and compared it to witchcraft, voodoo, or dogmatic religion.<br><br>Economists are actually quite like the evil wizards that haunt our fantasies, pouring over arcane formulae and whispering dangerous and seductive lies that ruin those who listen.<br><br>And yet, in many ways economics is the epitome of modern rationalism. Much of what's so seductive about it is that it promises to explain everything from first principles using elaborate mathematical models. Its frequent friend, extreme forms of libertarianism, offers the same thing in the realm of law: assume self-ownership and the principle of non-aggression, and everything is supposed to follow from that.<br><br>I know the seductive power of this first-hand, especially when elaborate rationalizations are layered on afterward to make things more palatable.<br><br>This suggests to me that modern economics has the power it does in part because truly challenging it -- not just token jabs or partisan in-fighting -- is unthinkable for most of us.

More on this as we proceed -- Carr will be visiting the Toledo stock market fairly soon. <br><br>Bob, yes, and I know other people who use credit unions -- I've considered it myself.

As for "reform," these days, doesn't that basically mean "more of what we've already found out doesn't work"? ;-)<br><br>John, the Lakeland Republic has its own textile industry, all the way from field to factory to clothing store: cotton, linen, hemp, and wool are all in common use. I'll have a bit to say about that next week. Good wool clothing beats the crap out of the "bioplastic" I've invented for the story -- think of something halfway between cheap polyester and Tyvek, and you've got a fair sense of it. <br><br>Doctor W., you'll doubtless have noticed Carr's reference to cashless countries. The Atlantic Republic isn't one of those, because so much of the real economy there is under the table in one way or another. <br><br>James, I've had similar experiences with public utilities. <br><br>Sawbuck, I'd be happy to see that one reenacted. It amuses me, watching politicians and economists dodge the fact that we had a much more stable and successful economy during the years when Glass-Steagall was in force!<br><br>August, glad to hear you're out there on the cutting edge again! I have an Addiator knock-off around here somewhere -- that's what I had in mind in that scene, in fact. <br><br>GreenEngineer, you haven't been paying attention, have you? There was a radio and a telephone in Carr's hotel room -- I believe a telephone counts as electronics, and I know for a fact a radio does. Now of course the question you're actually asking is why they don't have the kind of electronics that are popular these days, and we'll get to that in good time -- but do please note the presence of electronic devices when they appear!<br><br>Myriad, that's the one!

In Seattle where I live and work in the building trades, there is an important local supplier of doors. Everyone doing residential and light commercial remodeling and construction uses them.

In fact I would feel very comfortable there. I am old enough to remember a world that was quite a bit simpler and more "hands on" than today. We didn't have a TV until I was 14 or 15 and I can remember listening to radio programs like "Yours Truly; Johnny Dollar", "The Whistler" and "The Shadow". <br><br>Both my Parents were born rural before the "Mechanized" age really began and I grew up with a lot of stories about what that was like. I once asked my mother when she was about 65 if necessary could she still harness a horse to a buggy. She then described the whole process and I didn't know most of the nomenclature.<br><br>There was very little money in the house for incidental spending. But there was a lot of Books.

(xenosystems.net) I think there's probably a lot with which you would disagree (vehemently) with Nick Land. Regardless, I discovered this blog via his own blog. I've been reading this blog for probably a year at this point, maybe longer. There is much of interest to me here, even if I don't always agree with it.<br><br>What interests me these days is that there seem to be an increasing number of people (often flying under the official radar) on both the right and the left who are very, very displeased with the current state of affairs. I appreciate your commentary on that, even when I don't entirely agree with you (though I think you have a fairly good handle on it).<br><br>Last week, there was a comment by a reader to the effect that if he were to vote, he would vote for Trump, even though he really dislikes Trump, simply to accelerate the collapse of the current system in order to get to what will replace it. This was the most interesting comment to me last week because it mirrors the "agree, amplify, accelerate" (AAA) strategy emerging in the alt-right/neoreaction movement. It's not commonly seen on the left, so I was pleasantly surprised to see it.<br><br>One thing I think a lot of those who comment on this blog seem to get wrong is that a lot of the support for Donald Trump is not because people actually want Donald Trump, but because he can be a tool for bringing the system down. At this point, all that remains is trolling the system until it collapses under its own weight because those running the show have absolutely no desire to hear voices of dissent -- on either the alt-left or the alt-right.<br><br>There are actually quite a number of people on the alt-right (myself included), who, according to AAA, would see the best possible situation for the US Presidential election consisting of the Republicans not giving Trump the nomination, even if he were the front runner, then him running as an independent. That would destroy the Republican Party (and given demographic trends, the 2016 election, 2020 at the latest, is probably the last chance they have at winning). That would split the vote on the right, thus ensuring that the Democrats were to gain power. I'm not sure who I would prefer -- Clinton or Sanders (the worse, the better) -- but four years, if not eight, of complete Democrat control (preferably also of both Houses and the Supreme Court), with no credible alternative (and Republicans masquerading as "conservatives" don't count as they are the biggest part of the problem) would be the point when things really became interesting.<br><br>I think your insights on these matters are pretty accurate. However, I think a lot of the people who comment here have little to no real understanding of the actual conversations and movements building on the alt-right currently. It's also worth pointing out that a significant number of the leading figures on the alt-right are under 30, or even under 20. Many even originally came from the left (or grew up heavily steeped in it).<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c5351025035140386478 title="comment permalink">9/23/15, 11:15 PM</a><br><br>

One of the biggest cultural shifts that was bundled up with neo-liberalism and financial de-regulation was the idea that people are supposed to aspire to be consumers of corporate products and services, as suggested by marketing and advertising. So, slowly, people stopped doing things for themselves and valuing thrift and savings and just trying stuff, and began to buy many more things, often using credit. This seems very strange, because the former type of life is so much more interesting and satisfying, at least to me.<br><br>It seems in the Lakeland Republic that this dynamic has reversed, probably of necessity, and that Lakelander's have been encouraged to see themselves as productive citizens again, not consumers of corporate goods. Whereas in the Atlantic Republic I'm assuming that while most people operate in the black economy, the cultural narrative is still to aspire to a life of consuming corporate products. I'm interested in why this might be, especially after the various disruptions to the narrative of progress that have clearly happened up to 2065. What was the main solvent that undid the narrative in Lakeland, while it stayed somewhat intact in the Atlantic? Did the narrative fall apart by itself, or did it need a push from above and an end to advertising and easy credit?<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c1781297396331372674 title="comment permalink">9/24/15, 1:02 AM</a><br><br>

Of course, in my country there was some private consumers banks, too.<br>However, my dad liked public banking for long time accounts, maybe for personal bias (he worked to government in these times).<br>Some years later, politicians and economist said that public banks were outdated, waste from the old Franco's dictatorship. Socialist government (yeah, those leftists boys, not the other conservative and catholics morons)privatised my bank.<br>When i got my first decent job, I closed my old saving account and opened another in other bank.<br>Business hadn't been well to he formerly public bank. Services for the clients worsened, bank CEOs did'nt managed getting money enough, and...nowadays this bank no longer exists. It was sold at loss to a foreign bank some years ago.<br>You can believe that all this shitty and sad story is a government conspiracy (and their financial friends at private banking)to kill the chicken and eat it; maybe there it's a lot of it in the affair. But I think that economic orthodox religion is a good part of disaster, too.<br>My actual bank has better service than old one when it was provatised, but a lot of people has been in troubles with it for tricky advertising, trash products or bad practices...bordering on criminal fraud.<br>I've always run away when men/woman at bank's counter has offered a "very good offer that you can't refuse". What a pack of conmen.<br>I'm looking for some "ethical bank", but for the moment,that expresion seems to me an oxymoron, they are private banks too...note very reliable.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c4189175955137370017 title="comment permalink">9/24/15, 2:53 AM</a><br><br>

I've been there. All the Mauritians I know always mention someone's ethnicity, as an important characteristic of the person (which it is). Mauritius has 1.3 million residents and about ten ethnicities (most of them being East Indian ones). A Gujarati and a Tamil speak different, unrelated languages and they have distinct temples, Hinduism being more like several religions than like one. Besides, most Tamils are noticeably darker than most Gujaratis. Your ethnicity determines who you can marry, who you feel comfortable socializing with, and basically who you can trust, in a country where the rule of the law is a recent innovation and corruption is a national disease. That's why ethnicity is <i>very</i> important.<br><br>I suppose that Mr Greer means that "multiracial" will mean, in the USA of the future, "one ethnicity with many different shades of skin color, but basically one culture." Maybe that's America's future, but IMHO that's unlikely. Islam doesn't mix with other religions, never. Even in Mauritius, Black people (who are a minority in that Hindu-majority country) are poorer and less educated than the rest. They are also Christian, and that's a good reason for self-respecting Hindus and Muslims to refrain from mixing with them. I expect the USA of the future to be like Mauritius. The official discourse to tourists is: all the communities live in harmony in diverse, exotic, sunny Mauritius, a paradise on earth. That's a joke, of course. I never heard as much Muslim-bashing anywhere as in Mauritius. There are occasional clashes between communities, incidentally. Mauritian independence, in 1968, began with deadly fights between Muslims and Hindus.<br><br>If there is a multiracial nation in the USA of the future, IMHO it will not be <i>the</i> American nation, but <i>one</i> nation among others. It may be the majority, but it probably won't be the only ethno-religious or ethno-linguistic group. North America will probably look like the other continents, with distinct nations living side by side, and therefore <i>conflicts</i> between those nations.<br><br>Nations arise from homogeneous entities: the Germanics, the Latins and the Slavs of the 4th century AD were basically homogeneous nations. Then, as they began to live in separate political entities, their languages and cultures diverged, and the nations of modern Europe were born, in a slow but inexorable process which took several centuries, even a thousand years in some cases. In the 4th century AD, the ancestors of the French, the Italians, the Rumanians, the Spaniards and the Portuguese still spoke Latin. English, German and Dutch were still one language.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c482749012938488920 title="comment permalink">9/24/15, 5:48 AM</a><br><br>

Then the government privatized it (as the EU had recommended) and it became La Banque Postale, an ordinary bank.<br><br>There were good things and bad things about the postal service as a bank. The good thing: since it was a public service, it always accepted you as a client, even if you were virtually penniless. The government had given instructions to that effect.<br><br>Then the bad thing: because the postal service as a bank (it was called Les Compte-Chèques Postaux) had to accept everyone as a customer, they had many customers which definitely didn't deserve to have a bank account. As a consequence, many businesses were loath to accept Compte-Chèques Postaux checks.<br><br>My wife had opened Compte-Chèques Postaux accounts to our children when they were still toddlers, so that they could have some money when they became teenagers, but later, as grown-ups, they ditched Les Compte-Chèques Postaux for more "respectable" banks. Imagine someone making a face when they see your Compte-Chèques Postaux check, as if they thought: "Is that guy so poor that he can't have an account in a good bank?"<br><br>Besides, there were banks which selected their clients but which nevertheless had a social vision of banking, like Les Compte-Chèques Postaux. For instance, Crédit Agricole, which was created for rural areas and later spread to cities, had branches even in remote villages. <br><br>There's also Le Crédit Mutuel, which began as an alternative to capitalistic banking, and which, as they say, "belongs to its clients". I am the treasurer of an association which has a Crédit Mutuel account. Once a year, all the clients in town are invited to a general assembly where the finances of the local branch are explained, and we vote on the reports. That's fine, but Le Crédit Mutuel has grown so much that it now invests in international financial products like any other bank. I chatted with one of their top executives during one of the annual assemblies, and I was flabbergasted when I realized how much he admired Goldman Sachs. I told him than in my opinion the directors of Goldman Sachs were a bunch of crooks, and our conversation abruptly ended.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c3250355339806038391 title="comment permalink">9/24/15, 5:50 AM</a><br><br>

It's a fascinating article about how the technology that soldiers really need in Afghanistan is basically a low-tech, close combat, propeller-driven aircraft that relies on human abilities; but instead the blind faith in "high tech" always being better led to more costly, less useful weapons and needless loss of life. It's a great real-world illustration of the exact points you've been making here.<br><br><i>“The A-10 is the best ‘close attack’ plane ever made, period,” Sprey tells me. “But the Air Force hates that mission. They’ll do anything they can to kill that plane.” He says retiring the iconic A-10, a twin-engine attack jet with 30-mm cannons that hit with 14 times the kinetic energy of the 20-mm guns mounted on America’s current fleet of supersonic fighters, became an article of faith among high ranking Air Force officers, generations of whom had been raised to believe in the redemptive power of technological innovation.</i><br><br><i>That mentality drove production of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the world’s first $1 trillion weapons system. Development of the F-35 was going on in the background throughout the Afghan War despite mountains of evidence that the stealthy jet would never be able to attack ground targets like the A-10 could. Far away from the fighting, the generals in Washington, DC supported the F-35 because they believed “more technology is always better.” </i><br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c8245980677778024407 title="comment permalink">9/24/15, 6:10 AM</a><br><br>

Not to mention the suites of other technologies that are needed for a particular technology to even work in the first place.

We prefer them to banks, but they are not immune to the trends that have infested banks. Two of the three credit union branches nearest us have put all their tellers in a windowless room in the basement, with our only contact with them being through a TV screen and provisions to send paperwork and money back and forth. That's when you walk inside the branch, instead of the desk and the tellers behind it that used to be there. How long from there to a kiosk? One of the credit unions made a big deal of how it's keeping its branch in Ferguson (yes, that Ferguson) because it's committed to serving the community, just moving it from a place it rented to a place it owns. Fine, but the place it owns has the set-up I just mentioned. Its Florissant branch a few miles to the west has tellers behind a desk.

Surely they've retained or re-invented fountain pens rather than plastic rubbish? In 1965 I think that everyone who regularly needed to write carried a fountain pen and ballpoints were cheap and nasty products for cheap and nasty people. It's a bit jarring to find them in the context of serious and affluent people. If a clerk had faced a customer who had mislaid his own fountain pen he would surely have offered his own. Is the association of Mr. Carr with ballpoints a hint that his hosts have identified him as a cheap and nasty plastic person incapable of appreciating and properly using a fountain pen? This may be a all the more mocking if he is some sort of journalist, sufficiently affluent to stay at a good hotel and sufficiently senior to interview important people, but barely literate; a foreign vulgarian. <br><br>So far Mr. Carr has only met people whose business it is to politely serve affluent strangers. Is he likely to receive a rough awakening if he meets those of more common clay?

According to them, post offices back in the 30s used to do that, and you can still buy money orders (I believe) at post offices.<br>There is also a public money supply movement. It advocates turning banks strictly into the kind of thing people now think banks do. That is, store your money, lend it out at interest, and pay you a portion of the interest in return.<br>Banks, however, because of the fractional reserve system, actually create money. Indeed, the only money circulating in our economy is that created by debt, both public and private. That is why we are urged by the PTB to - Go to college! Buy a car! Buy a house! Go shopping! Each person that succumbs and borrows helps put more money into the economy. However, the money supply must grow in order to pay the interest, and that is inflationary and also, self-limiting.

You've clearly posited Quebec as an independent country, so I'm going to assume that Canada as a country has broken into multiple pieces. I suspect Newfoundland has gone its own way, and there's probably a union among some of the maritimes. I think Ontario and Alberta are not part of the same country because they've never gotten along very well. Saskatchewan is probably in the same country as Alberta, Manitoba could go either east or west. It's possible Alberta may have hooked up with the area just south of it, as a lot of Albertan attitudes seem to me to be more americanized than much of Canada. <br><br>BC is a bit odd because the BC interior is very different from the BC coast, especially the big coastal cities. The interior is much more politically and socially conservative, and the economy has been heavily impacted by fires and beetles. Small towns in both areas are doing badly and losing a lot of their young people to the cities. Most immigration has gone to the big coastal cities which are strongly multicultural, tolerant of gender differences, and riven by economic inequality. Housing prices have been driving a lot of ordinary people out of Vancouver (like both halves of my divided family, for one), but authorities are refusing to admit that there is a big problem with housing prices. When the bubble bursts, it is going to be messy and very, very painful. <br><br>In short, BC is a lot like Washington State. I think BC is better off economically and in working infrastructure right now than Washington State, but how long that will last I don't know. I suspect north-eastern BC will go east with Alberta if BC goes South or goes it alone, as that corner of BC is east of the Rockies and has very strong ties to Alberta. I sure hope Alberta and BC don't fight over it. It is a potential flash point that contains oil and gas resources.<br><br>I like my credit union. I used to use one of Canada's larger bank, but the credit union I use now doesn't charge a monthly fee for a chequing account, which the bank did. I also like the idea that it is a lot less entangled in the over-leveraged global financial system.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c3821682319514486633 title="comment permalink">9/24/15, 12:02 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, a private company may make bigger profits, but is that our sole measure of 'efficiency'???<br><br>An example of this is the privatisation of the public utilities(gas, electricity, trains etc) in Britain. We were relentlessly told that it would mean more competition and therefore lower prices and a better service. The problem with this whole thesis for me was that the utilities were already making massive profits, which could then be ploughed back into 'public good' rather than going to line the pockets of already wealthy people. Sure enough the service didn't really change and the price didn't drop, in fact the service got a whole lot worse in the case of the railways and spectacularly more expensive, but a lot of people who had money to spare(ie rich people) got even wealthier from the rising share prices and the dividends that accrued from the shares. Privatisation is a scam for rich people to get even richer and for banks to have another revenue stream.<br><br>Recently, a Railway company was doing incredibly badly in the private sector, and was taken back into public ownership. It was transformed into the most profitable railway company in Britain. It was hurriedly privatised ,as soon as possible, as it was setting a bad and embarrassing example. <br><br>We had a Post Office bank here too, that was sold of as well. America pressurized Japan to sell off its' Post Office as they thought it was distorting markets!

A few people mentioned post offices, and those are still used here in Ireland, where until recently few people needed to move large amounts of cash fast. When your community is close-knit and your needs small, you don’t need to withdraw large amounts of money for child care, transportation, housing, entertainment, and so on. It just doesn’t make much sense for the same institution that handles the widow’s pension to also handle vast casino-style speculation. <br><br>In fact, banks have been pressuring the government to force the post office to reduce its interest rates, as it’s making the banks look bad:<br>http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/banks-lobby-for-an-post-to-cut-deposit-rate-231090.html<br><br>On the other hand, many of the banks that have arrived in the last few decades are multi-nationals, sometimes giving themselves Irish-sounding names here. “National Irish Bank” was actually a division of Danske, and one day, without much warning, they abandoned their branch offices for anything but high-profit investments. <br><br>“This is a BANK, sir,” one of their staff huffily informed me when I walked in and asked about my account. “We don’t have MONEY here.” You literally couldn’t get your money out except through the internet. Obviously I don't use them anymore.<br><br>When I asked about Missouri in your hypothetical future, you asked me what I thought. In a partitioned USA as you describe, I wouldn’t be surprised to see it torn apart, as it was during the Civil War – the part pronounced “Missouri” and the part pronounced “Missourah” are culturally very different. <br><br>The first, a strip from St. Louis to Kansas City, is Midwestern but cosmopolitan – St. Louis is culturally the place where the East meets the West and the North meets the South, hence the Arch as its symbol. I could see that band, and the farmland to its north, merging with a coalition of states that could include Illinois and Iowa. I could see the train and boat traffic from Chicago to St. Louis becoming a vital artery again, and riverboats piloted up the Missouri to Jefferson City again. <br><br>Below and parallel to the Missouri River, however, runs a cultural Mason-Dixon line (or the grits/polenta line, as we called it), and everything below it – the Ozark Mountains, the Bootheel – would gravitate to the South, merging with whatever Arkansas and Mississippi are part of.

It surfaces again. Magnetic strip locks and pocket calculators are "just so useful" that they won't go away. Everybody forgets about the massive high-tech manufacturing infrastructure that's needed to produce these devices. Even if the technology to produce these devices might possibly exist, there's no way they'll be affordable unless they're produced by the millions (billions?) like they are today. <br><br>I remember the first consumer four-banger calculators from the early 1970's, $200+ for something that could just add, subtract, multiply and divide in 8 figures. No scientific notation either. Producing those $5 calculators today, not done in the U.S.A. for decades BTW, requires multi-billion dollar factories producing 10's of millions of units/year. And they're built by people earning a couple dollars/day.<br><br>The mag-strip lock may be "useful" but the mechanical lock can be made/repaired by just about anybody. Not so with the hi-tech version.

Obviously nothing like what we're used to today, but there is a lot you could do with 40's technology plus modern knowledge of digital techniques. That sort of knowledge was not going to be developed in the absence of major investments in digital computing hardware, but the methods so developed can be adapted to much "dumber" computers. If you can make silicon PV panels, you can make simple ICs - again, nothing like the modern day, but still useful if you're clever about it. Of course, all of this assumes that the knowledge was preserved even though the industrial base was largely destroyed, but I get the impression that that is the case in this fiction - this isn't Star's Reach (or at least, not yet).<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c8787629347037393381 title="comment permalink">9/24/15, 4:53 PM</a><br><br>

In the Lakeland Republic those aren't dumped on the public as "externalities" -- which means your calculator will cost about as much as a car.

Wait until Carr does some shopping and gets change for a ten...<br><br>Spanish Fly, you'll be pleased to know that the Lakeland Republic has a lively radio industry including shortwave broadcasts, so in 2065 you'll be able to tune into it from Spain! As for being called a Communist, well, I've been accused so far of being an apocalyptic doombat, a devil-worshipper, a fascist, a liberal, an anarchist, a Republican, a Democrat, a Jew, an evil space lizard out of Dave Icke's paranoid fantasies, a hack writer, and a ghoul, so I suppose being called a Communist would be a nice addition to the list! <br><br>Tyler, it's quite common for newly independent nations to relocate their capitals, so I suppose Québec did that in the decade or so after Canada came apart. As for the foreign minister, I thought of that as a personal quirk rather than a national one -- there have been American politicians who had such habits, you know.<br><br>Denys, no, it's not see-through; imagine what you'd think if you saw somebody walking down the street in a business suit made of the same stuff they use for plastic envelopes these days. As for fourteen days, he's going to be very busy -- stay tuned!<br><br>RCW, exactly. You'll be interested to know that the economics profession suffered a profound setback in the Lakeland Republic and is still struggling to get on its feet again. It was really very simple: the legislature passed a law mandating that anybody who lobbied for this or that economic policy had to provide at least one example from history in whihc that policy had actually done what it was supposed to do...<br><br>Shane, I haven't had a chance to look at the phone yet -- I really do work these things out as I go -- but it may well be a dial phone; the technology is much simpler, both on the phone end and on the exchange end. <br><br>Vilko, er, the Germans of the 4th century CE were anything but a homogenous ethnic group. They were a diverse assortment of tribal peoples speaking different languages, not all of them even in the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family. The only reason the Latins were more or less homogenous is that they'd been united by Rome centuries earlier -- before the Roman conquest, Italy was full of different ethnic groups (Latins, Etruscans, Samnites, Umbrians, etc.) and not all of these spoke Indo-European languages! I can't speak to the Slavs as my background in Eastern European history isn't what it ought to be. "Homogeneous" ethnic groups come into being in the wake of dark ages, and the raw material is usually a random collection of whoever happens to be in the territory in question; time and intermarriage do the rest. <br><br>As for the postal bank, that I know of, most countries that have made a post office banking system a success only offer savings accounts through the postal system, thus avoiding the problem with checks you mentioned.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c3792382058944238330 title="comment permalink">9/24/15, 5:12 PM</a><br><br>

There are a variety of ways to do health care; the US has arguably the worst system in the world -- people in many third world countries get better health care than we do, which is why our national stats for infant mortality and similar measures of public health are worse than those in many third world nations -- but I'm far from convinced that a national bureacracy is the only, or the best, alternative. "History, Mr. Carr..." <br><br>Dan, excellent. The crucial point is a combination of your points 1 and 3.

That really changes the playing field. More on this as we proceed!<br><br>Mister R., you won't be surprised. I think I've mentioned in passing that there are five tiers, and different counties fall into one or another; each tier has a baseline year that determines what public utilities are provided out of residents' tax money, and the five baseline years are 1950, 1920, 1890, 1860, and 1830 for tiers five, four, three, two, and one respectively.

I’m sure the People's Liberation Army would love to gain some combat experience for its commanders, troops and fighter jocks, especially fighting alongside an experienced and battle hardened military like Russia’s. We know that Russian marines have already engaged Islamic State forces in ground combat on at least one occasion in the last few days.<br><br>In addition, it seems that Russia, Iran and Iraq just activated a joint command center in Baghdad with reports that there are already several hundred Russian marines on the ground in Baghdad and that Russian generals are the ones now running the show. To top it off, now Egypt seems to be gravitating towards Russia. The Egyptians even agreed to buy those French Mistrals that were originally built for the Russian Navy (for which the Russians had to give their approval since parts of the ships were built by Russian contractors) while the Russian Navy is already working on its own equivalent class of amphibious assault ships with the funds the French government had to refund to the Russians for breaking the contract. <br><br>I also found it interesting that when things started heating up in Syria, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and two of his top generals flew to Moscow, not Washington D.C.<br><br>It looks to me like the era of American domination in the Middle East is coming to an end. We have set ourselves up for disaster and the Russians have outmaneuvered us at every turn. They even managed to turn the US/EU sanctions to their advantage.

A dial tone, or a voice saying, "How may I connect your call?"<br><br>If the electronic technology includes discrete transistors then the radio in Carr's hotel room might be boxy for style and ease of repair, rather than because it uses vacuum tubes. Repairability should be a major consideration in all Lakeland product design! A radio receiver only needs a few transistors, and that type will use a lot less power than a tube one. There are trade-offs either way.<br><br>Older information technologies like punch card systems don't need transistors but have some other subtle supporting-technology bottlenecks. For example, the Third Reich had control of Hollerith machines during WWII but sometimes had difficulty using them because no facility for manufacturing the super high quality paper for the cards was available in Europe, and the U.S. eventually figured out not to sell it to them.

Based upon paper, ink, and human labor. All it took was different choices... Still a minor quibble : in such a society, I have trouble imagining that there would be enough food resources to spare for employing someone just as clerk or "IT" worker.<br><br>Also, I have watched the GOP's great debate amongst Presidential candidates, and what struck me was that each of them was invoking some parts of what appears to constitute the American psyche (or something like that... remember I am a foreigner). I wonder, maybe the mental idea of a nation, upon which the nation itself was built, used to be a lot stronger, and therefore a single individual was able to articulate a whole vision of what makes the nation so special. It could be that as it has lost strength over the years, that ideal of the nation has dimished in importance or belief inside each of its individuals, and that is why now even the people who ambition to run the country can articulate, when speaking individually, only fragments of what that vision used to be. The candidates made for an interesting chorus, not really debating each other, but instead, each of them bringing his or her small bit of what, taken all together, would constitute a coherent vision of the national ideal. With a lot of glue, and a lot of patching-up work required...<br><br>I know it is mostly related to current events, but it could be an idea you can reuse in your fiction : Mr Carr would be VERY surprised to find out that a single citizen of the Lakeland Republic could sketch out, on the fly but in a clear and structured fashion, a vision of the entire Republic, whereas back home, it would take a whole assembly of Repu-Mocrats fumbling together to achieve that.<br><br>As for your expeditive treatment of current economics, I have been watching an excellent interesting documentary about the worn-out subject of Nazism and occultism (Hitler's Dark Charisma), which features a sentence I found so... British, because it is fairly imaged and moderate yet implies a lot : "By that time, Hitler's fantasies had parted completely with reality." (he was in his bunker toying with a model of an Austrichian town how he would build his own museum there, and accomodate the whole city map to his fashion... all the while the Red Army was delving into Germany, pounding the last of his defenses). I do wonder if we could say the same thing about economics as it is being professed nowadays, even though not to such dire consequences. In any case I am sure that the Lakeland Republic will have developped some efficient means of keeping in check with reality, even if it cannot escape the inevitable power plays acted out in a nation state.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c6916331175391963112 title="comment permalink">9/24/15, 8:58 PM</a><br><br>

I have read it, and it reads like a boy-scout joke, written by and for little boys. I found the author's style just pompous, and his ideas pretty childish. Still, Raspail has revolved his writing around societies on the brink of collapse, and though it wasn't uncommon for writers to do that in his time, he still deserves credit for charting uncomfortable territory. His originality was that, instead of the future nightmare scenarios fantasized by SF writers of the time, he took existing, or fictional but in the past, societies. Therefore he was a direct embodiment of the now-familiar adage, "collapse is already here, just not widely distributed yet". And he always advocated an attitude of stoïstic dignity against the turn of events, very far from nowadays' political correctness. Unfortunately his attachment to old, revolute values constantly veered onto reactionary views, which hasn't made him very popular.<br><br>In its time, the Camp Of Saints was written before the crisis of the Boat People, and would have been a visionary work, if it weren't for the fact that the Vietnamese refugees did not come in such large numbers and were just frightened, starving people. Who behaved really well once assimilated : here Asian people have the well-earned reputation of being hard-working, discrete... At the time, he envisioned larger mass migrations threatening the integrity of the old European nations betrayed by their own sense of moral self-righteousness and pity. The recent images of people who look not quite like they are starving, and are hung onto their cell phones, certainly do update Raspail's vision back into actuality, but it is hard to fully capture the horror of what these people are fleeing from. In other words, we are not in their shoes, so it is hard for us to judge. To be fair, a lot of France's economy has been driven by immigration, even over the latest years. The wealth pump in favour of the USA and Germany is what I deem to make up a much heavier bunden on our economy, but right now the Front National is the only party with the gut and media credibility to articulate it out loud.<br><br>The Reuters' War College blog staged an interesting analysis, though maybe a little simplistic, so far the most synthetic assessment I have as yet come across regarding this crisis : http://blogs.reuters.com/war-college/2015/09/15/podcast-who-are-europes-migrants-and-do-they-pose-a-threat/<br><br>Another world is inevitable, and it is taking shape right in front of our very eyes... there will be plenty of pain to be shared, whence the importance of tooling ourselves with a coherent, workable, and even more importantly, desirable vision.

I have been thinking about France's shape, but yes, even with the climate change, I hadn't really envisioned French wine going completely away. And since we speak about France, I find it utterly amusing to see that several "changes" that happened in the Lakeland Republic are reminiscent about what De Gaulle implemented post WWII over here. John Michael, would you like to add "Gaulliste" to your set of labels ? Maybe it is just me, but imagining you and the General chatting together is an image that lightens my day.<br><br>And now, if you feel like reading it, here comes my "Mr Carr" true story. Some 10 years ago, I was working in a great science lab, in an office sitting on top of an impressive computing center in sunny and hype California. Being scientists in a new office we did the first important thing scientist do when they get to a new place: we bought a coffee machine, and set a shared system for the costs. When it was time for me to pay my dues, I entered J's office, the senior scientist in charge of collecting the funds, and asked him how to proceed. He showed me a little tin box on a shelf. The tin box contained cash, a sheet of paper and a pencil. Being the kind of "self-proclaimed-geek-smartass" I was at that time (now of course I am *completely* different), I smirked and told him "What ? We are in one of the world's top computing resort and we use... *this* ?".

If Russia, China, and Iran have decided to take out Daesh ("ISIS") and are readying boots on the ground to do it, my guess is that they can accomplish it, and if that happens the global political situation is going to change drastically in the very near future. I wish I knew what was happening at the Kermanshah tactical air base, which would be the logical staging area in Iran for the eastern end of a Syrian operation; if Russian and/or Chinese planes are showing up there in force -- especially if some of those planes happen to be troop transports -- we could be in for some dramatic headlines. <br><br>Myriad, the banks in the Atlantic Republic do everything by touch screen, so pens aren't something Carr is used to seeing there. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, au contraire, the US in the early 20th century supported quite a substantial number of clerks, secretaries, etc., while still having half the population working on farms.

Up until WWII, most government buildings in the US imitated Greco-Roman public architecture, as did most banks. It was visual shorthand for "serious purpose" and "built to last". I spent my childhood in a suburb of Washington, DC and saw plenty of examples.<br><br>My point is that while government buildings with colonnades and pilasters and architraves and cornices were once the norm, the specific pattern of the US Capitol Building, a big dome over a flat base with symmetrical wings, has been copied by almost every statehouse in the Union, with minor variations in the proportions of the dome so that they look like sort of careless copies. This consistency is pretty remarkable. The Governor's mansions in the various states look totally different from the White House, and the Supreme Court didn't even have a separate building of its own to meet in until the 1930s IIRC. But for some reason, when they erected houses for their legislatures, most of the states used the Capitol Building as a model.<br><br>The Lakeland Republic was born out of a civil war and has had to defend its independence since then. Unless it regards itself as the true successor to the former federal government, why would it want to copy the Federal building style for its new statehouse? Just because it's a republic, must it pretend to be Roman? <br><br>The San Francisco City Hall as rebuilt after the 1906 earthquake has a grand dome, but instead of being of white marble and looking like a Roman temple, it's in the Beaux Arts style, extravagantly gilded, and looks like the the palace of the Doge. Which is exactly how Mayor Willie Brown, who organized its restoration, used it.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c4011191233206250093 title="comment permalink">9/25/15, 1:21 AM</a><br><br>

In Hawaii, where I live, more people are multi racial than uni racial. It was not an an entirely smooth process and there are, certainly, still some rough edges. The process was, perhaps, facilitated by a dearth of subcontinental Hindus &amp; Muslims, though there are more now.<br>Fiji, where they ultimately formed a majority, followed a much rockier road. As the dietary and ritual purity concerns begin to break down, Fiji is becoming more integrated.<br>Here in Hawaii, if the state were to be divided by racial or cultural lines, many people would have to be chopped into bits. Race is, however, still used in describing a person , as are height, weight, gender, age and various other personal quirks.<br>On another topic, I love watching the insanity of the American obsession with the F35, or hi tech weaponry in general.If they ever have to use it in combat, they will so totally get their clocks cleaned. It is so symbolic of their mind set that they are going to replace the A10, one of the greatest ground support aircraft ever built with the flying version of Goldman Sachs.

They were a diverse assortment of tribal peoples speaking different languages, not all of them even in the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family." </i><br><br>There was Nordic Germanic (the parent language of the Scandinavian languages), Eastern Germanic (Gothic, Wisigothic and Ostrogothic) and Western Germanic (the parent language of English, Dutch and German). There were, undoubtedly, dialectal variations, but each of the three branches was basically one language, and the three languages were themselves very closely related.<br><br>The tribes which spoke non-Germanic languages were not Germanic. I guess that you thought of Barbarians in general, not all of whom spoke Germanic languages.<br><br><i>The only reason the Latins were more or less homogenous is that they'd been united by Rome centuries earlier -- before the Roman conquest, Italy was full of different ethnic groups (Latins, Etruscans, Samnites, Umbrians, etc.) and not all of these spoke Indo-European languages! </i><br><br>Undoubtedly. And the only reason Americans are more or less linguistically homogenous is because...? As an American, it doesn't matter if your ancestors spoke English, German, Hungarian, Russian, Cherokee, or Armenian. What defines you linguistically is the language you presently speak. Similarly, it doesn't matter if the ancestors of a 4th century Roman spoke Umbrian or Etruscan, since all those languages had died centuries before. <br><br>It seems to me that linguistic balkanization is an unavoidable consequence of collapse. Largely autarchical, endogamous communities develop their own dialects, which eventually turn into languages, if they are spoken in the places which become the next centers of power. Until the 19th century, every European village had it own patois, hardly different from the patois of the next village, but the differences accumulated from village to village, until the accumulated differences were so great that mutual understanding was impossible. People spoke French at one end of the Latin domain and Portuguese at the other end, without a clear line separating, say, French from Spanish, and Spanish from Portuguese. French resembles Occitan (Southern French) a lot, which resembles Catalan, which resembles Spanish, which resembles Portuguese.<br><br>When centralized kingdoms emerged in France, Spain and Portugal, the kings imposed their dialects on their subjects. The printing press also made it easier to standardize languages.<br><br>Between the variety of American English that you speak, and the English of Beowulf, there are only about thirty generations. That's a line of thirty men, each of whom was certain that he spoke the same language as his father. What made languages change faster than they now do was widespread illiteracy. But are we sure that compulsory, government-funded primary education would survive a total civilizational collapse? IMHO it wouldn't. Especially is the daily language of third or fourth generation survivors becomes too different from textbook English.<br><br>This being said, the Lakeland Republic would probably stick to standard English (the language of what can be saved from technology) as its official language. Lakelanders would, I guess, speak dialect at home and with their friends, and use Standard English in writing and for trade with foreigners, official events, and of course in education. Mr Carr would have no problem talking to a bank clerk or a hotel employee, but he would have difficulties understanding two Lakelanders chatting in their dialect.<br><br>And if he gets lost in the countryside, he can consider himself lucky if the old peasant he meets is fluent in Standard English... In 19th century Europe, that's what travelers often had to deal with!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c4186887259821493966 title="comment permalink">9/25/15, 3:14 AM</a><br><br>

I’ve been convinced for some time that on this side of the Atlantic Ocean, the UK and a fair part of Europe is not going to get hotter but colder, with weather conditions that are familiar to those in Alaska, when the north Atlantic current switches off due to the influx of cold salt free water due to melting ice. This is likely to lead migrations from the UK and Europe, from those unable to adapt to a new reality. Perhaps that could be useful woven into the story.

I also think tobacco's role as social adhesive would be more resilient than today's smoking bans. (The fact that it spread so quickly from the New World to all other civilizations attests to that. Even now, smoking rates still hover in the low teens in the most restrictive areas with the highest taxes.) So, if today's smoking/tobacco bans and tobacco taxes survive no worse for the wear in Lakeland (or even Atlantica), what's the rationale, absent today's biophobia/fear of death? If not, where do people smoke or chew tobacco in Lakeland? What kinds/forms of tobacco are popular (cigars, cigarettes, pipes, snuff, chewing tobacco)?

They're no good at all for "accounting" problems, because they have no discrete memory for any quantity. The state variables are ANALOG voltages on a capacitor, good to maybe two decimal places, and we expect million dollar accounts to balance to the penny. An analog computer can't route calls for a telephone exchange; that's a fundamentally discrete switching problem. An analog computer for hotel-room access might be do-able, if you have less than 100 rooms, and really good wiring from each door to the computer room...)<br><br>Having re-keyed a number of locks, I know that it takes only a few minutes.

I tried using a fountain pen, but leaving it idle for a week or two, it dried out (with disastrous consequences). Also, ball-point pens are essential for making carbon-paper duplicates.<br><br>You may be able to do arithmetic with "pencil and paper", but that does require consumption of paper and pencils (or ink, but then you're tethered...). An abacus (or Addiator) serves as much as a memory for the result as it does the computation, indefinitely erasable for the next computation.

Mid 1960s manufacturing is perfectly capable of creating inexpensive integrated circuits without a huge amount of externalities, fuss and bother. The first clean rooms were invented in one of the national labs not far from where I live in New Mexico - the technology was so simple that a lot of people thought he was faking it.<br><br>The question isn’t whether they could do it without huge supply chains and massive externalities, the question is why they’d bother.

Unless they’re doing flat rate billing, which is possible, they won’t be able to have any kind of scale without it. There was a reason why banks only operated four days a week, with Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday off. They needed the time for back office bookkeeping to keep the ledgers up to date.<br><br>re: fractional reserve banking:<br><br>I worked most of my life in the financial industry, and I have to laugh at the comments I see or I’d be shaking my head in frustration at the misunderstanding.<br><br>Without fractional reserve banking, you will be paying the bank to hold your money for you, in which case, if crime is relatively low, keeping your money in the mattress is far cheaper. The only way a S&amp;L can make mortgage loans, for example, is to use the depositor’s money. Those post office banks are loaning the depositor’s money to the government to fund the national debt. That’s fractional reserve banking in a nutshell. It’s that simple.<br><br>If you want to get rid of fractional reserve banking, you’re not going to have a consumer and small business banking sector.

Indeed, for a brief moment, there was such an alliance, since both Russia and China supported the U.S. attack on the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and a contingent of Russian troops actually had their own sector in Kabul (at least for a while). <br><br>This pragmatic alliance seems far off today, due to the conflicts in the Ukraine and Georgia, and also because the West backs up Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the Muslim Brotherhood, despite the fact that these factions are more than likely to double cross us by playing with ISIS backstage. Osama bin Laden was "our" Frakenstein´s monster. Are we creating a new one in the Middle East as of this writing? It took Bin Laden about 20 years to bite us, the next monster might be biting us already!<br><br>The lesser evil would be negotiations in the Ukraine and Georgia, both the U.S. and Russia telling Erdogan to back down from his intrigues in Syria (Turkey and Russia actually has pretty good economic relations, ironically), and a great power alliance against ISIS and Al-Nusra in Syria. Indeed, the only way to stop Iran from extending its power would be such an alliance.

The other advantage is that it lets us divide up our over-powered servers into smaller logical units to handle different jobs.<br><br>The disadvantage is that you are handing over some of the keys to your business to another entity, which raises all sorts of fun questions about who has access to the data on said servers, which locality has jurisdiction over said data, and what happens if (when!) the entity hosting your data screws up. For this reason, it's interesting to note that many IT people in their own time are quietly starting to move away from cloud computing, and doing things like hosting their own email.<br><br>Interestingly, one of the causalities of the drive to cloud computing has been the legions of IT staff who were previously tasked with the aforementioned tasks of maintaining the physical plant of local servers, cabling, and other data centre paraphernalia and so on who are no longer needed. As JMG has noted, the purpose of information processing machinery is to reduce the number of people required to do a given task. Lately I've been raising the awkward question in after work drinks of what happens when we automate everyone people out of a job. Nobody seems to have a good answer.

You emphasized that the stair-step decline is far and away the more destructive to cultural and technological legacies as business as usual is maintained at enormous costs while most people desperately try to stay afloat in stormy waters. This combination leads to the priorities being:<br>1) maintaining a broken system, and<br>2) scratching out a living from said broken system<br><br>With these priorities being what they are even literacy can be lost as decline gets underway. You seem to me to be illustrating this causal line beautiful with your character of Mr Carr, and the Atlantic Republic in general. <br><br>With fast collapse, such as what was experienced in Europe during the Plague years, you have pointed out that the greatest resource available is the <i>accumulated knowledge of the culture</i>. In such a situation one could expect that people would look to their libraries in order to find methods that worked in the past. What you would then see is a scaling back of the culture to to that parameters imposed by the new circumstances, with an added emphasis on the conservative preservation of the cultural and technological legacies that undergrid said society.<br><br>You've mentioned in the commentary that there were international sanctions on the Lakeland Republic on account of war crimes. They also, with this instalment, seem to have a heavy emphasis on history and what has been tried and trued. The emphasis on libraries seems very telling to me. It reminds me somewhat of Cuba's "special period," but with Burkean conservatism as the pervasive politic.<br><br>I love your narrative fiction - and love the cliffhangers you've been employing!

"The legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done but cannot do at all, or cannot so well do for themselves in their separate and individual capacities. But in all that people can individually do for themselves, government ought not to interfere."<br><br>The key phrase here seems to be "or cannot do so well for themselves." I can remember very vividly, as a little boy, my mother explaining what the public in public library meant, and why it was valuable. And she is a Republican, although she now feels her party went off into nutty land and left her in the dust. There used to be this quaint idea of the common good. I have long believed there are certain social and community functions that the market is unsuited for. Policing, security screening, the miitary being obvious. But healthcare, mass transit, utilities, and banking seem in the top ten for sure. Of course one has to be careful. People must guard against corruption, cronyism, and nepotism. They will eat the public systems from the inside.<br><br>Another phrase that stuck in my head is "efficiency is the opposite of resiience." Effiency is also socially corrosive. I see it everyday as people flow through the airports,, using kiosks and smartphones, never interacting with fellow humans. I have dropped 25 or 30 carryons off in the jetway and maybe one or two people say "thanks" if I am lucky. To everyone else, we the rampers, are invisible. It didn't used to be that way. I am old enough to remember metal keys and bellman and clerks who could actually make a decision if something went bad, rather than referring you to a 800 no or a website.

But electric instruments have a great appeal. I know it is a fringe concern, but the discussion of electronics makes me wonder about this. Amplifiers seem a possibility, though expensive if you have to pay their true cost. Most effect pedals would probably be tougher to manage on a 1950s suite of technology.

Mid-Autumn / moon-cake and lantern festival here in Southern China tomorrow evening. We've been spending all week at school getting the kids to make their own lanterns, (no glow-sticks allowed). It's my favorite holiday here! Their imaginations and ingenuity have astounded us.<br><br>daelach: That reminds me of another, my son's favorite 'appropriate tech' story; so preposterous it may be an urban myth, but here goes: Post space-flight, post perestroika; there was a conference of the American and Russian space programs. Engineers on both sides got to kibitzing on how they solved various lack of gravity problems for the astronauts and the issue of a gravity fed ball-point pen for keeping logs came up. The NASA engineers went on about the million dollars of research and development that had gone into their new design of a ball-point pen that could work in anti-gravity. They'd come up with a whole new technology! A whole new pen! They then asked the Russian engineers how they solved the problem. The Russians replied, "We used a pencil".<br><br>RE: the F-35, I think we all know, it's not about efficiency or preparedness, honestly, not even about the fairy-tale religious belief in progress. It's about profits for military contractors who lobby and control decisions in congressional military appropriations. I remember reading an article in the NYTimes, about US Naval budget appropriations, about 1 week after 9/11. The Admirals were all firm that immediately post 9/11, what they needed were a fleet of small quick coast guard boats to guard the 3 coast-lines, and a few fighters for longer distance, (a few other things, all were older models, tried and true). Congress ignored them, at the country's vulnerable time, it instead appropriated their entire annual budget to 1 behemoth air-craft carrier. It was still under construction and design, that would not be ready for at least another 4 years. The Admirals knew about it and had rejected it out of hand as ever being effective militarily. It was being designed and (hopefully) built by their favorite lobbyist/contractor, (as I recall, it was Lockheed Martin, but can't remember exactly which one). If that doesn't convince us that congress could not care less about the country, nothing will.<br><br>UGH, enough depressing talk. Looking forward to Mr. Carr's continued journey!<br><br>PS: As one of those outside of the US info-firewall, I'll try to keep you posted on any news of China's military adventures, at least as reported here.

According to the reports I have seen, the Russian transports and warplanes bound for Syria take off from Russian air bases, fly south over the Caspian Sea and then make a sharp turn to the west over north-central Iran. The Russians have been using the Hamadan tactical air base as a refueling and logistic support point for their planes making the trip, especially since the Su-24 and Su-25 attack planes have limited range and can’t make the trip to Latakia without refueling either in the air or on the ground. The Hamadan tactical air base is roughly halfway between Tehran and Kermanshah. <br><br>I have also seen reports that Chinese ships (both warships and transports) are already on route to Tartus and that the Chinese are planning to send both transport and combat aircraft to Latakia.<br><br>From what I understand, the Russians have primarily deployed Su-24’s and Su-25’s to Latakia. These are dedicated ground attack planes. The Su-24 is the Russian equivalent of the F-111 and Tornado IDS, while the Su-25 is the Russian equivalent of the A-10 Warthog. Both are 1970’s era Soviet designs, but are considered to be among the most capable warplanes of their type and the ones remaining in Russian service have been extensively upgraded with modern electronics and weapons systems. The Su-25 was particularly feared by Afghan and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J4p4ET_HAg" rel=nofollow>Chechen</a> insurgents.<br><br>I expect a Russian-Chinese-Iranian offensive would be primarily executed by elite troops such as special forces, paratroopers and marines with heavy air, armor and artillery support. Most of the Russian ground troops deployed to Syria and Iraq so far have come from the 336th and 810th Marine Brigades. Mechanized infantry will follow to clear out enemy strongpoints and hold captured towns and other objectives. Assault troops will be landed behind enemy lines by helicopter or parachute to cut off enemy lines of retreat while other units will infiltrate behind enemy lines before the main offensive begins and set up blocking positions. Russian paratroopers used both of these tactics extensively during the counterinsurgency campaign in Chechnya. <br><br>The paratroopers and marines would also be heavily mechanized as well in order to carry out fast moving assaults in order to keep the Daesh forces off guard. In other words, blitzkrieg on steroids followed by the relentless and systematic reduction of trapped enemy forces. This is classic Russian tactical doctrine and when executed by well-trained and well-organized forces, it’s both devastating and brutally effective.<br><br>It’s also quite likely that very few members of Daesh will be allowed to surrender. Some will be taken for interrogation and a few might be publicly tried for war crimes and crimes against humanity, but most will be quietly dispatched with a bullet through the brain. <br><br>The Russians and Chinese are a lot less squeamish then we are and realize that the best way to ensure an enemy as dangerous as Daesh can’t come back to haunt you is to make sure that its members no longer exist. It’s ruthless and brutal but its effective when applied in an intelligent, consistent and unrelenting manner. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/world/middleeast/isis-enshrines-a-theology-of-rape.html?_r=0" rel=nofollow>Since we are talking about Daesh</a>, few people will care except a few middle class liberals and ivory tower activists who will whine about alleged “human rights abuses” because this sort of thing offends their delicate and rather naive sensibilities.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c6825125949183764752 title="comment permalink">9/25/15, 8:18 PM</a><br><br>

The interesting thing, to me, is that I grew up with electronic calculators, and use a slide rule by choice; when I took my ham radio license exams, I brought my handy trig rule and got every math question correct; I also find that I can usually get the answer to a math question on a slide rule while the calculator-users are still punching in numbers. <br><br>Spanish Fly, I knew you were kidding, but hey -- I've now been called a Gaullist, which I think trumps Communist! ;-)<br><br>Vilko, er, you've just jumped from ethnicities to language families -- not the same thing, you know. I'm quite sure that most people in the Lakeland Republic speak standard American English -- rather a different language from the one spoken in England these days -- because fifty years isn't normally enough to create a new dialect. <br><br>Averagejoe, the interesting thing there is that a lot of people live in Alaska, and seem to get by just fine! My guess is that if the Gulf Stream does shut down -- which wouldn't surprise me at all, all things considered -- you'd have a lot of well-to-do people fleeing for warmer climes, while most people in Britain, France, Germany et al. would simply adapt. <br><br>Shane, nah, smoking (tobacco or marijuana) has roughly the same social role as drinking alcohol; you do it at home, you do it at businesses that have that function, you don't do it in most public spaces. Things have been tending that way for some decades, and for good reasons. <br><br>Tidlösa, the talking image of Urur? Good heavens. That gets tonight's gold star for sheer obscurity of reference; I've read Hartmann's parable, but I'd be startled if more than a very few other readers have even heard of it. <br><br>LatheChuck, as I recall, hotels back in the day normally had somebody on staff who could change locks as well as other simple mechanical tasks, so it was no trouble at all. As for pencil and paper, I'm quite sure abaci are in common use in the Lakeland Republic, but they take a certain amount of skill; anybody who pays attention can learn how to use an addiator in minutes, which is why the bank hands them out to foreign clients. <br><br>John, I'm wondering if the term "fractional reserve banking" is being used outside the industry the same way it's used inside it. As I understand it -- and please correct me if I'm wrong here -- before fractional reserve banking came in, a bank that took in a million dollars in deposits could lend a million dollars in loans, minus whatever reserve the law or basic prudence required; its assets (in terms of loans on the book plus reserve) equalled its debits (in terms of deposits). Under current law, no such limit restricts the generation of loans; a bank doesn't need to take in deposits to make loans, it can simply make the loan, take the money paid out as a debit on the books, and then either sell the loan or let it sit on the books as an asset balancing the debit of the payout. That was certainly what I heard from friends who worked at Washington Mutual when it bubbled and popped! That ability to manufacture abstract wealth by making loans on a basis of thin air is the issue that people are discussing when they talk about fractional reserve banking.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c4707013227246270574 title="comment permalink">9/25/15, 8:20 PM</a><br><br>

We've handed Russia a perfect opportunity to get combat experience for its armed forces, show off its military capacities, and redefine the politics of the Middle East -- and what are we going to do about it? Insist that they have to leave Daesh alone, when we've spent all that propaganda money presenting it as the biggest bogeyman on the planet? If in fact Russia, China, and Iran decide to squash Daesh, reconstitute Syria at gunpoint, and perhaps create a Republic of Kurdistan friendly to them rather than to the US, the US will have done a huge amount to make that happen. Talk about own goals!<br><br>Edward, I suspect that one of the main things driving the push to "the cloud" is the ability to hold business clients hostage, and make them pay for regular expensive upgrades they don't need; a lot of businesses these days are staying with older software, and that's got to be hurting the software industry's bottom line. The Windows 10 fiasco isn't exactly going to help that!<br><br>Architrains, I've actually mentioned skin color in a couple of other scenes, but yes, it's an important issue. The point is that restoring an older technology does not require returning to older social customs, prejudices, etc. <br><br>Daelach, he'll be going back. I don't propose to copy Callenbach that precisely! That said, there are plot wrinkles not yet divulged...<br><br>Violet, thank you for noticing that! Actually, the two republics have followed different curves of slow collapse; the difference between them is that the Lakeland Republic has taken control of its destiny, and the Atlantic Republic is drifting. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Justin, the person who excreted those books needs to stop calling himself or herself a writer, and accept the label "propagandist" instead. Gah. <br><br>RPC, we'll just have to see, now won't we? ;-)<br><br>William, exactly. The American tradition used to be a neat balance between public and private spheres. We've largely lost that, but the Lakeland Republic has regained it. <br><br>Sylvia, good question. I know it feels clammy and vaguely slippery to the touch; I'll have to take a closer look at it. <br><br>Rita, that's why I talk mostly about the United States, and make such a point about the world not needing another clueless American attempting to lay down the law globally! <br><br>Mirela, the Lakeland schools -- we'll be visiting a couple of them -- would hire you in a minute. On the other hand, any child who used a gimmick like that on homework anywhere in the Lakeland Republic would get an F for cheating. <br><br>William, I've heard exactly the same thing from everybody except for industry and USAF flacks. The F-35 is a disaster for everything but Lockheed's quarterly profits, and if it becomes the mainstay of the US Air Force, the next shooting war is going to end very, very badly.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c6028848152472958379 title="comment permalink">9/25/15, 8:34 PM</a><br><br>

I can't speak to fancy effect pedals, but electric guitars were common in jazz groups from 1936 on -- if you're at all familiar with the Benny Goodman Orchestra, for example, you know Charlie Christian's electric-guitar sound -- so anywhere in the Republic that's got grid electricity will probably have electric guitar music ringing out from nightclubs and concert venues on Friday and Saturday nights.<br><br>Donalfagan, "three more years..." Well, we'll see. It wasn't that long ago that Guy McPherson was insisting that by 2012 there would be no more cars on the roads due to petroleum depletion. <br><br>GreenEngineer, that's a common misconception! Some technologies expand and enhance human capacities, others replace existing human capacities; the former tend to create jobs, the latter eliminate them. For example, nobody anywhere lost their job because of the invention and development of lens technology -- quite the contrary, a galaxy of new professions, from lens grinder and optometrist to telescope builder and microscope technician, were created through the emergence of that technology. Information processing technology, by contrast, was invented to replace human employees; the only things it can do that weren't already being done by clerks, typists, and so on are those things that would have required spare planets full of clerks, typists, etc., to do, because of their sheer scale. <br><br>Now of course lens technology and electronic information processing technology are close to the ends of a spectrum; every new technology creates some jobs, and most new technologies eliminate some jobs. One of the questions that a sane society would ask about new technologies is where they fall on that spectrum -- do the benefits of having the technology really outweigh the number of people dumped on the employment rolls as a result of deploying it? -- and once energy and other natural resources are depleted enough that they can no longer be treated as free for the taking, and the relative cost of labor vs. energy and other resources comes back to a more realistic level, that question is going to be very hard to avoid. <br><br>Shane, that's why I don't read American media. <br><br>Bob, exactly. Kids learn abacus in the schools, but to hand out to a foreign visitor who doesn't have the time to learn how an abacus works, an addiator is a much better choice.<br><br>Dragonfly, that's an interesting question. We'll see what happens!<br><br>GreenEngineer, I can't edit comments. All I can do is post them or reject them. If you'd like to repost the final sentence you had in mind I'll be happy to respond to it. <br><br>Tidlösa, you may well be right -- I know that Trotsky made a point of the "worse is better" strategy, but that wouldn't be the first idea of his that Stalin ripped off. <br><br>Robert, good point! I'd forgotten about those. I figured, though, that there would be several people in the maintenance staff with locksmithing skills, as used to be standard once upon a time, so one way or another the locks could be managed.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c4096271317097151858 title="comment permalink">9/25/15, 10:41 PM</a><br><br>

They just don't happen to be worth much when it comes to their ostensible mission of protecting the country. If anything ever happens to put the US nuclear deterrent force out of commission, we may all have to learn Chinese in a hurry. <br><br>Fabian, Hamadan makes good sense as a staging area, but to my mind it's too far away to serve as a forward air base once the fighting begins -- Latakia's well positioned on the west, but they'll need something close in for the eastern front in Iraq. As for the campaign, what you've outlined is pretty much what I'd expect. I hope the Russians et al. have the good sense and strategic flair to start out with a decapitation strike on the Daesh capital at Raqqa; Spetsnaz at 2 am followed by waves of helicopter gunships and infantry an hour before dawn would do the trick, leave Daesh without its top leadership, and quite possibly turn up embarrassing documents that show just who's been funding Daesh, which would be a nice bonus.

There are about 9 major “sound dialects” in the US, with a lot of variations within each. Someone with a good ear for them can tell I’m from the Midwest, even though I’ve lived in Albuquerque for a decade. Even with a common syntax and vocabulary, sound dialects can render someone’s speech almost unintelligible until you get used to it. Example: Mary, marry, merry. If you grew up on the Atlantic coast of New England, these words have three distinct pronunciations; if you grew up most anywhere else, they’re homonyms. Another example. When I was exiled to the farm after my family broke up, my foster mother would say: get me the spider. I had no idea she was talking about the frying pan, not an insect.<br><br>Given that the Lakeland Republic started out with sound dialects from Wisconsin to Kentucky, I doubt if the situation is less complex; that they were separated from the rest of the world for a couple of decades gives lots of time for some additional sound shifts. On the other hand, radio is a pretty good leveler in that respect, so is the ability to travel long distances. A lot of the regional variation in the US vanished in the 20s and 30s because of those two factors.<br><br>Grammar changes all the time. A few years ago we got a new preposition, because language. A couple of decades before that we got like as an intensifier, together with a great deal of anguish, gnashing of teeth and rending of garments about how English was being destroyed. I wouldn’t be too surprised to see a few differences between the English used in the Lakeland Republic and the Atlantic whatever, but mostly they’d be ignorable.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c5143940088159344566 title="comment permalink">9/26/15, 5:05 AM</a><br><br>

So to the details. Prior to the banking reforms in the 30s, a bank could loan out any amount of its deposits; part of the reforms was to require banks to keep a fixed percentage in reserves, either cash in the vault, on deposit with the Federal Reserve or in long term class AAA bonds, that is, US government bonds, which, by constitutional edict, cannot be disavowed or depreciated. That’s still the system today. In economics, the increase in the money supply because of bank generated money is called the multiplier.<br><br>There’s a current problem with AAA bonds. The rating is set by private rating institutions. It used to be that someone who wanted to buy a bond would ask the rating company to rate it; then they might publish the rating or keep it private. At some point in the past, companies that wanted to issue securities started to ask the rating companies to issue a rating. That changed who the rating company’s customer was, and lead to a lot of incorrectly rated securities - anyone who’s familiar with the financial situation in the oil industry is quite familiar with securities that have a much higher rating than they ought to have.<br><br>There are several things that have changed. First, not all financial institutions are regulated the same as banks; not all banks are “banks” in the same sense as consumer banks. You didn’t used to be able to “securitize” mortgages and sell the package until one of the Federal home loan bureaucracies invented mortgage backed securities (MBS). Today, a bank can issue as many mortgages as it wants, but it doesn’t violate the fractional reserve requirement because it simply sells them to a packager, that then turns around and sells them to investors such as pension funds. At no time does the bank have more invested in mortgages than it’s allowed to have.<br><br>One of the reasons for all the loopholes is that the original regulations were established to create confidence in the banking system, not to regulate the money supply. It’s the latter that’s turned out to be important, and that hasn’t been done.<br><br>Those things are what makes the current situation messy: unregulated financial institutions, derivatives and the rating companies abandoning their historical function as watchdogs.<br><br>Now as to how I’d see this applying to the Lakeland Republic. First, I’d move economic regulation to a government department (called the Department of Economic Regulation (DER), just to give it a name). It would regulate *everything* having to do with the financial system - there are no loopholes, there is nothing outside its reach. It’s goal (or one of its goals) is to make the money supply match the supply of goods and services - that is, to eliminate inflation and deflation. <br><br>I’d do something else that may be a bit strange: outlaw stocks as perpetuities. That is, the whole late 19th century idea of the modern corporation would need to be rethought. “Stocks” would have to be repaid from profits, and once they were repaid, there would no longer be “stockholders” for the board of directors: the employees would take that function. This may be a step too far, but without it I can’t see a stable financial system.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c2567339509220003313 title="comment permalink">9/26/15, 5:08 AM</a><br><br>

Sadly, in the mid-1990's, the religious movement known as "privatization" hit Telecom Eireann like a bombshell. The first casualties were the intelligent operators.

The key to it is that there is not one central exchange that can connect any line in the nation to any other; instead, it's a fractal tree structure with more localized exchanges feeding into more centralized ones when needed. A longer-distance call will go through multiple operators (though typically the customer only speaks to the first one, who speaks to the others down the line as needed to place the call). This is nothing new. The main landline cables connecting cities aren't called "trunk lines" by accident.<br><br>As an illustrative example, imagine Mr. Carr wants to make a call to a Toledo business from his hotel room. The first operator he speaks to will be the desk clerk. The desk clerk has a patch panel right there at his desk that can connect any room phone to one of three external phone lines. If all those external lines are already in use, Carr will have to wait, unless he only wants to call another room, in which case the clerk can patch the room phones together directly.<br><br>A small community in an isolated (but still tier 1) area would have exactly the same setup on a more spread-out scale, with lines running to nearby homes or businesses instead of hotel rooms, and the patch panel would be located somewhere that would be staffed at odd hours; perhaps the local inn or the police station.<br><br>A larger community would be the same, except that operating becomes a full-time job in a dedicated office. That would also be the case for stages deeper in the tree structure. Peter Carr's call, when plugged into one of the hotel's three outgoing lines, would be received by, let's say, the Toledo District 2 operator. If the business he's calling is also in District 2, then that's a "local" call at that level of the hierarchy and the operator patches it down the appropriate branch, where (perhaps) the duty manager of the office block finally patches it through to the specific office. (The duty manager is the the equivalent of the hotel desk clerk, except that her service is only available during business hours because there would be no point at other times when all the businesses in the block are closed. Like the hotel clerk (and present-day receptionists), phone operation isn't her whole job; she also handles other collective needs for the office park.) But if the business Carr is calling is in Toledo District 5, the District 2 operator instead connects the call to one of the several dozen branch lines available to connect District 2 to District 5. Again, if all those are in use, Carr must wait his turn.<br><br>If the phone system is somewhat larger, then the direct District-to-District connections won't be be practical, and there will instead be a Toledo Central exchange that handles inter-District calls as its "local" calls and inter-city calls via external "trunk" lines. Note the fractal self-similarlity, though: Toledo Central would be doing the same thing as the hotel desk clerk, connecting some calls as "room to room" between any two District exchanges and patching others into some limited number of lines connecting to "the rest of the system."<br><br>The number of operators increases as n log n with the number of phones and the number of simultaneous calls. However, as long as most calls are local, the increase stays closer to linear, meaning that if a small-town local phone system employing an operator is economically practical then a national one with sensible usage limitations probably is too. The increase in costs associated with the additional operators at the deeper levels of the network (that's the log n) are paid for by making long distance calls very expensive. Thus there would be some population of users who can afford a phone but cannot afford to make frequent long distance calls. That, in fact, was the norm here in PA when I was a kid, because those automated exchanges weren't cheap either.

The dials on dial phones worked (originally) with electromechanical automatic exchanges, which is of course another option. Those would be arranged in a similar hierarchy, which is why phones used to have different audible busy signals for the phone you were calling being busy versus the trunk lines somewhere in between being busy. Many real antique phones (as opposed to replicas) have no dials, which is why characters in old movies often grab them up and press the hook rapidly a few times and shout "Operator, get me..." {the police, the newspaper office, the President, or whoever) without dialing anything.<br><br>@JMG, hope this helps if Carr ever picks up that phone.

Some are much closer to one pole than the other! Lenses are a good example from the benign end of that scale. Most medical technologies are as well.<br><br>But the majority of technologies are a mixed bag in this regard, including most of the ones that you depict, and much of it comes down to how technologies are used rather than something inherent to the technology. Information technology as it currently is used is pretty far over on the malignant side of the scale, but that is not inherent to the technology.<br><br><i>the only things it (IT) can do that weren't already being done by clerks, typists, and so on are those things that would have required spare planets full of clerks, typists, etc., to do, because of their sheer scale.</i><br>This effect is, in fact, of massive significance to our technological capabilities. I personally benefit from this effect every day of my professional life. This will remain a very attractive feature of this kind of technology, even in the context of a culture that values human labor for itself. The presence or absence of this technology is an enabling factor for at least as many classes of scientific endeavor as is the lens.<br>Closely related is the ability of information technology to leverage human capacity so as to make tractable classes of problems that would otherwise collapse under the weight of their own internal friction of communication. This is similarly a powerful enabling technology, although it's benefits are greatly attenuated in the modern context by countervailing market influences.<br><br>What I'm saying comes down to two points:<br>1) I agree with your characterization of some technologies as malignant and some as benign, but where you seem to see a bright line between them, there is actually a line so fuzzy and broad that it encompasses all but the extreme ends of the continuum.<br>2) Information technologies in particular have enabling capabilities that you seem to be underestimating. That's easy enough to do, because there is so much noise and uselessness in that space (particularly the consumer space). But if that is stripped away there is still a fundamental capability enhancement relative to our abilities to communicate, quantify our understanding of the world, and mine data for interesting patterns. I am NOT asserting that we will always have the resource base necessary to support these technologies. But I am suggesting that a culture that has the necessary resource base (which the LLR appears to have) and values things like scientific inquiry (broadly construed) will be strongly motivated to make these capabilities available - albeit in a very different form and context than what we are used to today.<br><br>Just in case it is not clear, I am picking nits on this subject not because I dislike your vision but because I think that what you are doing with this fiction project is worthwhile and important.

The Soviets used similar tactics in many of their military operations, including the opening stages of the invasions of Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan.<br><br>To kick off the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, a Soviet airliner faked a distress call and the Czechs allowed the plane to make an emergency landing at the international airport in Prague. Once the plane hit the ground, 100 Spetznaz operatives in plain clothes bailed out of the plane, some of them jumping out the doors as the plane was still rolling down the runway, and seized control of the airport. The Spetznaz airplane was also equipped as a mobile command and communications center and pulled off to the side of the runway.<br><br>As it did, it started jamming Czech military communications, TV stations and radio stations. Right behind the Spetznaz team was the entire 7th Guards Airborne Division, complete with artillery and light tanks. The Spetznaz plane acted like a mobile air traffic control tower and guided the Soviet An-12 transports in. The Spetznaz operatives and paratroopers then fanned out and captured important objectives throughout the city and held them until relieved by other Warsaw Pact forces advancing overland.<br><br>The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan started in much the same manner. A joint Spetznaz-KGB assault team stormed the Presidential Palace in Kabul (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Storm-333 rel=nofollow>Operation Storm-333</a>) and assassinated then president Hafizullah Amin, while Soviet paratroopers and Spetznaz teams seized control of other key objectives around Kabul. <br><br>As for the capture of documents, yes that would be extremely interesting, especially since there have been rather some interesting theories, speculations and accusations floating around concerning who has been in bed with Daesh. In particular, the Turkish government has been widely suspected of collaborating with or at least turning a blind eye towards the activities of Daesh so long as they refrained from attacking Turkish soil. <br><br>Even after a Daesh suicide bombing killed dozens of Turks in a border town, the Erdogan government has demonstrated a distinct lack of enthusiasm about fighting Daesh and has instead used Obama's half-hearted air war again Daesh as an excuse to settle scores with the Kurds, which has become a major source of friction between the Turkish and US governments. If an independent Republic of Kurdistan does emerge out of the ongoing train wreck in the Middle East, these factors will be a major why. <br><br>If the Russians, Chinese and Iranians do find hard evidence of Turkish collaboration with Daesh, the consequences will probably be pretty harsh and a large percentage of the Republic of Kurdistan will likely consist of former Turkish territory. With hundreds of thousands of Russian, Chinese and Iranian troops within striking range of Turkey and in a vengeful mood, not to mention Turkey's reputation in ruins, the Turks would have no choice to accept whatever terms their enemies dictate. Erdogan has been playing some extremely dangerous games over the last decade or so and I have no doubt that they will eventually bite the Turks in the bum. Karmic blowback can be really brutal.<br><br>PS I read an article earlier today in the weekend edition of the Wall Street Journal. General David Petreaus recently proposed sending thousands of additional American troops to Iraq to bolster the faltering war effort against Daesh. The Iraqi foreign minister, Ibrahim al-Jafaari, rejected this proposal out of hand, but said the Iraqi government would welcome additional Russian troops...<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c1709339381778087111 title="comment permalink">9/26/15, 5:42 PM</a><br><br>

I have to admit that I missed the recent turn of events after getting fed up with Russian movements being consistently reported way out of proportion. <br>As I see it the overall geopolitical situation does not call for a US intervention, apart from nominally regaining the initiative in the region (which is not necessarily a good thing). The US would almost certainly be perceived as crusaders by a significant fraction of the MENA population.<br>I think all this is still pretty much inevitable fallout of a foreign policy that among other things accomplished in a few swift strokes what Iran never managed since 79. Although things could and probably will become significantly worse, I think even a well advised overt policy would run into so much opposition it'll feel like going up Hill 937.<br>Europeans would have more incentive to intervene, but they cannot assume lasting popular support in face off the direct costs, as well as offering Putin half a dozen ways to pry it apart and inviting asymmetric warfare on their turf. <br>Even so France recently polled a majority in favor of boots on the ground intervention. Also note that the Mistrals seem to be going to Egypt now, with the Russians supplying the helis. Germany is arming, training, and harboring Kurds, often perceived as the most likely ally of Western influence in the region. Germany's armed forces active personell stands at 180k compared to 800++k Kurdish diaspora. Although such proxies are inherently risky they seem much more prudent than advertising yourself as a target in a region you have relatively little to gain from (if the pipelines can't be built there it means less competition for hydrocarbons on the international market). At some point though Europe will have to redefine its defence and intervention framework, which is an aspect that is only slowly sneaking into the whitebooks (NeoGaullism?). <br><br>Re a Russian, Iranian, Chinese action:<br>This could indeed be a watershed event, and much of it could play out as described. If you ask me though I don't think they go straight for for the jugular, although it would be possible and pretty spectacular. If they don't have the absolute element of surprise, urban combat (with any kind of infantry) is a very messy affair. If there is still visible resistance when the cameras start rolling in the morning even more so. I am not sure how much air support/transport can be surged to make up for lack of artillery which usually is the backbone of Russian offensives. <br>I'd put more of my money on a two staged operation that tries to drive/lure Daesh out of population centers into the next best defensible terrain, where it is then trapped in a cauldron, or sack. After the intl press received its talking points and arrived on scene the enemy forces could be reduced at arms length. There is of course the problem of making sure you separate the local population to a sufficient degree from the civilian population. I think this is where Iran will come in, or if that fails, 152mm. Of course there's also the Chinese - who always good for a real surprise, although I think they'll save that for a bigger occasion.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c7062634904647937793 title="comment permalink">9/26/15, 6:02 PM</a><br><br>

Those who just need a "safe" (so to speak) place to store their working funds can make deposits and withdrawals, with a small service charge. Those who want to assume more risk could buy shares in the bank, and the proceeds from the share sale used for lending.

We're agreed that every technology falls somewhere on a spectrum between "helps many people and hurts few" to "helps few people and hurts many," and the question is purely where electronic information processing technology (IT for short) falls on that spectrum. You've noted that you personally benefit from IT every day of your working life, and I get that. At the same time, many, many more people suffer harm from IT every day of their non-working lives, and even more every day of their burger-flipping, temp-working, or scrambling for bottom-level jobs lives. Tens of millions of jobs that used to keep people gainfully employed as secretaries, typists, file clerks, stenographers, locksmiths, and the list goes on for pages no longer exist because of IT, and the number of jobs created by IT is miniscule in comparison, because IT is mostly used to replace human capacities rather than expanding them. For these and other reasons, the Lakeland Republic chose to reject IT entirely and return all those functions to human beings. That's not an accidental feature of the story; it's a core element of what I'm doing, and will be developed in much more detail as we proceed. <br><br>MawKernewek, I know!

So are telephone calls direct dialed using electromechanical automatic exchanges, when the resources to build and power such things are scarce and there are many other competing needs for the required capital. The building-sized switching networks that made direct dialing possible prior to the digital semiconductor era were so large and complex and impressive that in the early 1960s, both Arthur C. Clarke and Ray Bradbury wrote short SF stories about the telephone system spontaneously becoming sentient. That was a fantasy, of course, but was loosely justified by the fact that the growing number of switches in the phone system was becoming comparable to the number of neurons in the human brain, a number then believed to be in the low tens of billions. Those switches were components you could heft in your hand, rather than a few atoms on a microchip.<br><br>(The stories were "Dial F for Frankenstein" and "Dial Double Zero" respectively. The latter has never been published in print, but was referenced and partially dramatized in a 1963 TV documentary about Bradbury's daily life as a writer.)<br><br>So, with or without operators, or perhaps with a locally varying mix of automatic and operator-assisted switching, today's unlimited calling plans are not going to exist in Lakeland.

(Recall here: (a) EDSAC 1 ran internally stored machine-language programs, but had no compiled language; (b) EDSAC 1 was built for the most part with the in-house fabrication capabilities of Cambridge University, in a funding climate of postwar austerity.) <br><br>Experience of USSR student "XYZ", from 1970s Tomsk State University Control Systems and Radioelectronics (TUSUR), is instructive. <br><br>Background: TUSUR had 1970s population of approx 3,500 students.Although XYZ is not known to me personally, I have minor adequately-high-grade contemporary channel(s) of information - in, as it might be, UK, USA, Estonia, Canada, Singapore, Poland, Bhutan, Namibia, Antarctica, whatever - re XYZ and TUSUR. <br><br>Details: XYZ, in fifth (i.e., final) yr of his course of studies, had to do "Diploma Project", over a period of roughly 10 months, investing something like (I'm likely accurate to within factor of 2) 600 hours. Working in a "numbered", i.e., in a military-confidential, building "RST" within the ambit of TUSUR, he - one guy - produced an IC chip. <br><br>His IC had on the order of 30 to 40 transistors. It was an audio amp, covering approx range 0 Hz - 30,000 Hz, in approx 10 stages of amplification, with good linearity in each stage. There were on the order of 15 pins in the edge-of-chip pinout (not as few as 5, not as many as 30). <br><br>1970s RST was well equipped - approx 6 floors, footprint approx 80 metres times 100 metres, perhaps 2000 people inside during normal working day. A channel of information presumes for me, without having positive knowledge, cleanrooms, and of course all the facilities necessary for photolithography on the silicon and doping on the silicon. A channel also stresses for me that supporting 1970s RST was the industrial capability of the wider USSR: surely it was not raw sand that entered RST (stresses channel) but some duly pure silicon crystal or wafer from elsewhere. <br><br>I suggest following conclusions: (1) Since 1949 EDSAC 1 had approx 3000 valves, to duplicate EDSAC 1 capability in 1970s style one would need a few thousand transistors. This would be equivalent to a few hundred (more than a few tens, fewer than a few thousands) of the ICs of the modest class produced by XYZ. (I remark here that photolithography lends itself to an extended production run: having made one chip, you can use the same darkroom masks for 100 or 500 duplicates.) (2) Lakeland Republic could therefore, **IF** it wished, assemble one or a few EDSAC-scale machines - assuming it can overcome the problems of procuring silicon wafers, photolithography chemicals, doping chemicals, etc. (I conjecture that since Republic has population of a moderately hefty state in today's European Union, and has at least some trading relationships with at least some other nations, these procurement problems **CAN** be overcome, should the administrative and political will exist.) <br><br><br>Hastily,<br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br>diaspora Estonian, of 1944-refugee parentage, living approx 25 km N of Toronto core <br><br>Toomas(punkt)Karmo(at)gmail(punkt)com <br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c8212752156622177400 title="comment permalink">9/27/15, 12:44 PM</a><br><br>

I would for my part stress role of electronics in these same spheres. <br><br>Here I would cite (1) experience of 1939-1945 UK: (a) RAF summer-of-1940 success was owed in part to radar; (b) it is nowadays felt in some quarters that war was shortened by approx 2 yrs because from 1940 or a little later, UK was able to make heavy use of "Enigma" and "Colossus" decrypts of Reich radiograms. ("Colossus" was computer-like device: programmable, albeit without internal storage of program.) <br><br>I would additionally point to (2) role of electronics in current strong diplomatic-military posn of China: very large-scale integration (on the order of 1,000,000,000 transistors per IC for a personal-computer CPU) is done in the China fabs, with USA now in a very subordinate position; I now have the impression of danger (without, I confess, having researched this) that USA will have to rely even for some of its military-electronics procurements on China. (The ultimate nightmare: IC chips bought from China, and fitted into USA armaments, start behaving anomalously as Washington-Beijing diplomatic tensions rise.) <br><br>If I were advising Lakeland, I would suggest following: (a) Keep IC electronics out of hands of consumers and the schools, insofar as democratic, open-society forms of government make such an embargo possible. IC electronics have been found in period 1990-thru-2015 to be socially deleterious, putting into ordinary homes the combined capabilities of gambling casino and porn shop, and additionally undermining the classrooms by weakening pupils' study habits. (b) Do maintain modest (1970s?) IC capability for selected key government offices. (Corroborating story for "(b)": a homicide case in Los Angeles, 1970s approx, ground to a halt because investigator, despite working for a couple of years, could not get a fingerprint match. Fingerprint records were thereupon at his insistence computerized, with the primitive computers of the day. A match was found after just 6 hours' computing.) (c) As far as feasible (but Lakeland will be financially constrained), make computing available for scientists as first civilian priority. (Edsac 1, which had first run in 1949 as a vacuum-tube machine - but same design could be implemented in 1970s-style IC chips - was highly productive productive in the Cambridge Univ science depts, e.g. in crystallography.

The telephone is not of high importance there. And yet it IS of high importance in police, hospitals, fire departments, etc. We recall from Sherlock Holmes stories that late-Victorian Scotland Yard already had telephones in some of its offices. <br><br>Some stats from 1937/1938 Estonia fiscal year (telephone was not then a normal household accessory; population of Republic was then approx 1,000,000) are perhaps interesting: <br><br>* total nr of individuals or institutions subscribing to telephone = 24,993<br>* domestic local calls = 26,667,561<br>* domestic trunk calls = 3,878,590<br>* foreign trunk calls, incoming = 55,620<br>* foreign trunk calls, outgoing = 50,992 <br><br>Tallinn, which had then a population of 100,000 or 200,000, possessed an automatic exchange.

The transistor was invented in 1949, so technically the technology to manufacture discrete transistors could be used without bending the rules.<br><br>To manufacture a transistor you need to "dope" a platter of ridiculously pure silicon (actually germanium in those days) with an additive that changes its electrical properties. That required the technology to apply a mask so the dopant only goes where you want it to, and then a wash to remove the mask, cut the die into pieces, affix the leads and put it into a package (the "top hat" packages familiar to people who worked with discrete transistors).<br><br>To get the defect rate down to something reasonable, they eventually had to invent clean rooms; I've talked about those elsewhere. The technology required for clean rooms turned out to be simpler than anyone imagined before someone did it.<br><br>To progress to small scale integrated circuits (SSI) required an additional mask, deposit and wash step to add connections between active areas of the chip. Scaling it up requires shrinking the feature size. Each turn of the crank requires more precise equipment, better purity, more rigorous quality control and similar, which in turn is more expensive and can only be justified by massive production quantities, which in turn are only possible with a consumer culture that values such things.<br><br>I was there, as a high school student in the late 50s and college student in the early 60s. You cannot build any consumer electronics you couldn't build with vacuum tubes using discrete transistors. They would just be smaller.

The first company I worked for had two IBM 1401s, an IBM 1410 and an IBM 705. The 705 had vacuum tubes, the others were discrete transistor designs. They were smaller, faster and took less power. You also didn't have to hunt to find out which tube had blown its filament, or where the short had occurred because the voltage had caused a small filament of silver to ooze out of the solder and bridge the gap (aka silver migration).<br><br>As a side comment, IBM created the 1401 to replace a complex of tabulating equipment including a punched card sorter, a punched card tabulating machine (with a plug board for programming) and a summary punch. Those machines were pure electromechanical designs, with no vacuum tubes, transistors or anything similar. The one I'm familiar with, the type 407, was introduced in 1949. If I remember correctly, they sold about 10,000 1401s. Small businesses couldn't afford them; many of them went to "service bureaus" that did accounting and payroll for small businesses.<br><br>Does Lakeland use ICs?

I have no idea why people have become convinced that tier one is the most complex technological tier in the Lakeland Republic, and the technology becomes simpler as the numbers go up. Not so; as I've actually explained once already, tier five has an approximate base year of 1950, tier four of 1920, tier three of 1890, tier two of 1860, and tier one of 1830. Nor, by the way, is there any kind of law to force people in a tier one county, let's say, not to have any post-1830 technology -- the last thing the Lakeland Republic needs is some kind of overgrown homeowners' associations telling people what they can and can't do, by majority rule or otherwise! It's much simpler than that: the tier level determines what infrastructure and services are provided by local government, and thus how high the taxes are. <br><br>In a tier one county, your local taxes are very, very low, because there isn't that much infrastructure to be built and maintained; at the same time, all the technologies that depend on any more complex infrastructure are going to be more or less unworkable. You want to have a car in a tier one county? Fine; there are no gas stations and no paved roads, and you'll be expected to drive your car at speeds that don't frighten your neighbors' cart horses and don't damage the dirt roads. Ergo, if you really want a car, you move to a tier four or tier five county, and pay the much higher local taxes necessary to fund paved roads and all the other expenses that, in the US, are dumped on the general public. <br><br>That's actually a core principle in the Lakeland Republic -- nobody's technological choices deserve a public subsidy. If you want a technology, you get to pay full sticker price for the whole system needed to make that technology function. We'll see that in action as the narrative proceeds.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c8117232870924984009 title="comment permalink">9/27/15, 6:23 PM</a><br><br>

I was impressed by his comment at the time but do not remember the name of the writer. I have since looked for it to refer to but have not found it again. At the very end of the comment as I recall it, he came to the conclusion that the most recent/resource intensive/energy intensive tier had the lowest number. You responded to that comment and I thought you confirmed his conclusions.<br><br>I was stunned and impressed by this reversal of the numbering order, because I wouldn't have figured it out and it made me realize how much of the progress narrative I retain unconsciously. In English, the word "higher" has a strong association with "better". By that association, the higher the tier, the more advanced and recently developed the technology.<br><br> If the goal of one's society is to manage industrial collapse, higher per capita energy and resource use is worse, not better. (One could however make the opposite argument, that the associations of Number One such as First Prize, Number One Son, Premier, etc., etc. should not be assigned to the least socially desirable tier.) <br><br>There is a minor practical reason to make the most energy intensive tier Number One. It allows for even lower tech tiers than 1830 to be instituted later without renumbering, in case even 1830 tech turns out to be unsustainable in the long run.<br><br>Before your most recent revelations that the tiers are organized around government infrastructure and utilities, and that people make residential choices according to the tax rates they are willing to put up with, I tried to figure out how to make the system work. Your way is much simpler and therefore easier to manage.<br><br>My idea involved setting a total energy budget for the county, with ongoing competition among counties in the direction of lowering their energy budgets. Government agencies, private organizations and households would be allocated portions of this budget to spend on any tech they chose, with incentives for staying within one's budget and penalties for overspending. To make this work requires both accurate information about the embodied energy required to produce materials and equipment, and a good deal of local government oversight. So your set up is superior to mine.<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c3082771443113334122 title="comment permalink">9/27/15, 11:12 PM</a><br><br>

The less technologically advanced counties in Lakeland, said one of your story postings, do have access to something like ham radio. This would almost certainly include, and would perhaps even be dominated by, radiotelegraphy. Unless you write something here in correction, I will assume that a radiotelegraphy upgrade of the Victorian-thru-1950 traditional landline telegraphy arrangements is common: if you need to send a telegram, you can go into your village to a radiotelegraph office; and if someone is sending you a telegram, the sender will pay a fee that inter alia includes the cost of a messenger taking the radiotelegram envelope from the local office to your door. <br><br>@all: I should perhaps have been explicit regarding the point of my remark on Estonia fiscal-year 1937/1938 telephone stats.

The traveller familiar with Nova Scotia, and now marvelling at that cultural mecca which is Boston, experiences a cultural resonance. It is as though Boston is the metropolis for which Halifax is a historically disadvantaged provincial outpost. <br><br>(b) It is plausible for JMG to make Quebec separate. But one cannot fully applaud his depiction of his Montreal politician as a sybarite, ordering champagne to her hotel room in the hours preceding breakfast. This suggests a stereotypical forcing of Quebec into the flamboyant mould of Paris. Quebec has for most of its history been agrarian, conservative, and quiet. (The argot for a staunch Quebec francophone is suggestive - <i>pure laine</i>, "pure wool": wool is not lace; wool is not silk.) After the disaster of 1759, the seigneurs who had been running New France went back to the mother country. This left the farmers - the social backbone - looking for political guidance to just one educated francophone grouping who had not boarded the ships - namely, their Catholic clergy. <br><br>The dominance of the Church was eroded only in the 1960s.<br><br>I also have to respectfully express my unease in JMG's making the new capital Montreal. Montreal does not strike the visitor as a particularly French city. It is in fact a mad mix - loud, brash, polyglot, a miniature New York. If Quebec transfers its capital from Ville de Québec up the river to Montréal/Montreal, the sensibility of the nation will have changed, in some disturbingly extravagant way. <br><br>One recalls here the late-1960s québecois song: <i>Mon pays ce n'est pas un pays, c'est l'hiver /.../ Mon chemin ce n'est pas un chemin, c'est la neige</i> ("My country is not a country, it is the winter/.../ My path is no path, it is snow"). On walking the streets of (Ville de) Québec, or on contemplating the ever-so-orderly farms along the banks of the St Lawrence, as the train makes its slow way from Nova Scotia into - eventually - Montréal's huge and noisy Gare Centrale, one may ponder the deeper import of these words. <br> <br><br>Hastily, <br>I hope reasonably respectfully, <br>writing not from Québec <br>but from near Toronto, <br>100 metres from the passenger line <br>from Union Station out to Winnipeg, <br><br>Tom<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c2025723310470950443 title="comment permalink">9/28/15, 8:10 AM</a><br><br>

But within Ontario is a natural grouping, the old "Upper Canada" (coloured by the influx of political refugees from post-1783 USA; and coloured again, in those same tints, by the breakdown of 1812-1814). Historic Upper Canada, comprising what lies between the Canadian Shield and the Lakes Erie and Ontario, might have a bright future as a nation. The conceivable nation would be fortunate not only in its fertile farmland, moderate winters, and adequate rainfall, but in the presence of two Great Lakes as southern demarcators, enforcing a degree of cultural autonomy. <br><br>If I might express a wish for Upper Canada, it is that it develop socially along much the same lines as Lakeland, but possibly with less ideology. There would be, for instance, an industry in IC chips, to the modest extent that may prove possible in post-crash conditions (100 or 500 transistors per chip?). And there would be some modest concomitant deployment of computers and other bits of late-20th-century technology, as economic conditions may permit. <br><br>I would hope that Upper Canada would continue its present strong tradition in physics, currently centred in Kitchener-Waterloo (almost, but not quite, a suburb of Toronto; Kitchener is at the very periphery of the current Government-of-Ontario regional passenger rails). One might likewise hope that research in pure maths is kept alive, both at Waterloo and in some successor of today's Fields Institute in downtown Toronto. <br><br>In an ideal world, Upper Canada would keep the David Dunlap Observatory, here in Richmond Hill. But our 2015 world is not ideal. Readers of this blog might note, upon visting Google News, that the developer we have been fighting up here, a hydra variously denoted "DG Group", "Metrus", and "Corsica", now seems to be trying to drive our principal conservationist organization, the "Richmond Hill Naturalists", into bankrupcy. <br><br>On the diplomatic front, I would hope for formal structures of cooperation<br>between Upper Canada and Lakeland, in the spirit of the 1960s European Common Market. The two jurisdictions would have at least one urgent common ecological interest, namely the wellbeing of the Great Lakes. <br><br>(d) When it comes to the West, the contemporary (2015-era) rail traveller is struck by the isolation of Manitoba from Upper Canada. One is the rails for on the order of 24 hours, most of it on the bleakness of the Canadian Shield, before even crossing into Manitoba. When one finally finds oneself walking the Winnipeg streets, one thinks, "Here is a suprisingly solid and dignified city, with traditions, feel, and ethos unlike Toronto's.

As in any other historical date, some were good but others not so much. So a family would try to secure the best care available given the constrains imposed by space, time and social condition. I suspect that care would be better in mid 12th century Lakeland Republic than in early 19th century USA. Part of the poor results of early medicine were due not to lack of access to modern technology, but to lack or knowledge. Doctors will not forget about germ theory of disease and basic sanitation just because they do not have a tomographic scanner anymore. Because of this reason, I also suspect that those services will be much closer to contemporary poor country medicine than to historic recounts (and giving that his is an Utopia, you can only hope that Lakeland public health system has borrowed more than a couple of pages from the Cubans).<br><br>Second, given that the population of Lakeland Republic is much more civic than contemporary USA citizens, I guess that each low level county will have the good sense of taxing an small amount to sustain a fund that will allow them to evacuate their more dire cases to richer counties that can afford to sustain the more advanced medical technologies, and make those available for their population at a fraction of the total cost. Richer counties will also benefit from this, because they can charge a premium above cost for the service, and help to maintain excess capacity for their own populations. Elligibility rules will probably be strict to keep the cost down. ie. You won't have to see your teenager son end up crippled from a treatable injure, but keeping your chronically ill elderly parent alive for another couple of years is off the table. Which takes me to...<br><br>People from the 1830s would simply have died, and much more gracefully than we manage to do nowadays. There are plenty of systems that require no more technology than a printing press to help people endure the realities of end of life affairs. These techniques are completely neglected today because we like to pretend that mortality does not affect us, but ultimatelly we end up paying the price with a bunch of disfunctional transitions both for the patient and for the surviving family. I am sure the good doctors at Lakeland Rep. will have a lot of good counsel to offer to the terminally ill, and other professional help in the form of priests, counselors or even well read friends and family will be able to help too.<br><br>Hope that helps a bit<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c109794619413969832 title="comment permalink">9/28/15, 11:53 AM</a><br><br>

In Lithuania, they promote a museum whose central exhibits commemorate KGB atrocities (http://www.vilnius-tourism.lt/en/what-to-see/museums/museum-of-genocide-victims-kgb/); in Berlin, they still jokingly refer to the Soviet War Memorial as the "Tomb of the Unknown Rapist" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_War_Memorial_%28Tiergarten%29#The_memorial_today).

The Russians, Chinese and Iranians are no fools. They know that Turkey is a major NATO member and that they would lose much of the goodwill they earned by taking down Daesh. <br><br>But if the Russians, the Chinese and their allies do find proof (in the form of incriminating documents, computer files, etc.) that Erdogan and his cronies have been playing kissing cousins with Daesh and other radical Islamists, there will be serious consequences. The Russians and the Chinese are making it clear by their actions and words they done screwing around with these people.<br><br>These consequences might take many forms, from using those incriminating documents for blackmail and political leverage, to a concerted propaganda campaign against Turkey, Erdogan and his supporters using leaked or declassified versions of those documents, to openly supporting Kurdish separatists and other dissident elements, of which there are a great many, from Turkish military officer corps (the Turkish military has traditionally been a bastion of secularism and sees itself as the “Guardian of the Republic”. Erdogan and his ilk are widely loathed by within military circles) to the Alevis, a minority Islamic sect with an estimated 10-20 million adherents in Turkey and who have a long history of persecution by the Turkish state and the Sunni majority. <br><br>If, lets say, the Kurds in southeastern Turkey were to declare independence in the wake of such revelations and the Russians and Chinese send troops into the newly independent Republic of Kurdistan as “peacekeepers” (a gambit the Russians have used many times in the before in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus), what are the Turks going to do about it? Get into a shooting war with China and Russia? <br><br>David Goldman (“Spengler”) had this to say in one his most recent blog posts:<br><br>“Turkey is one of the region’s spoilers, for reasons that are hard to get around: more than half its young people will come from Kurdish-speaking households by mid-century, and Sunni Turks will find themselves outnumbered in their own country by Kurds and the Alevis, a deviant Muslim sect that probably comprises about a fifth of Turkey’s present population. Any Syrian settlement will have to take into account Kurdish interests. The Turks don’t like that, and are willing to back ISIS and similar Sunni jihadist elements to suppress Kurdish ambitions.”<br><br>The article, which I highly recommend, can be found <a href=http://atimes.com/2015/09/vladimir-putin-spoiler-or-statesman/ rel=nofollow>here</a>.<br><br>There is another angle that most people seem yet unaware of. The Chinese believe the Turks have been supporting Muslim radicals in western China and they are mad as hell about it. This suggests the Chinese might have more than one reason for sending troops to Syria and a naval task force to the Mediterranean…<br><br>Goldman also had this to say in the comments section from the above blog post:<br><br>"Ask yourself also whether it is in China's interest for ISIS to expand (under Turkish sponsorship) while Turkey is covertly sponsoring the ETIM in Xinjiang."<br><br>Incidentally, there are reports the Chinese amphibious assault ship CNS Jinggangshan (LPD-999) is already en route to Syria with a PLA Marine Corps battalion embarked and there are rumors floating around in the Chinese media and blogosphere the PLAN may send the Chinese aircraft carrier CNS Liaoning (CV-16) as well.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c505687545526150045 title="comment permalink">9/28/15, 2:13 PM</a><br><br>

Also, the infrastructure of the Midwest in 1830 was for all practical purposes medieval -- a few dirt roads, scattered towns, and that's about it -- so the only way to go down from there would be "tier zero," no human-created infrastructure at all, which is actually being discussed in the Lakeland Republic circa 2065 but remains a theoretical possibility only.

More generally, the people of the Lakeland Republic collectively own the land, air, water, and all natural resources -- that's in the constitution -- and if you want to extract anything from those for private benefit, or dump anything into them for private benefit, you get to pay for the privilege. We'll be discussing the tax system as things proceed. <br><br>Toomas, I suspect we'll meet a Québecois diplomat who shares your distress with the transfer of the capital. The foreign minister, as I noted above, isn't meant as a representative of Québecois culture in general -- she's from Montréal, you understand, which became a very large and wealthy city once rising sea levels flooded most of the ports along the (former) US Atlantic coast; that kind of sudden flush of wealth has predictable cultural effects!<br><br>Debra, so noted!

Health care is pretty widely available, but yes, for the more complex forms of care, you head into town, either to make use of the resources there or to take a train into Toledo, Cincinnati, or one of the other large cities where you find big hospitals and medical specialists. Any town worth the name will have at least one dentist, optometrist, etc., as well as a few of the broader medical specialties. <br><br>Ed-M, I don't agree with Kunstler's race war hypothesis, not least because I live on the wrong side of the tracks in a redneck town south of the Mason-Dixon line and a stroll through the neighborhood will show you otherwise: mixed-race couples are common, kids of every color you care to name play together, and if the weather's good and people are hanging out on a porch, they generally don't all have the same skin color. Nobody's been purged from the Lakeland Republic; the banker was noticeably African-American in much the same sense as the Italian-American jazz pianist we'll be meeting shortly: that is to say, pretty definitely a member of one ethnic group rather than the increasingly common multiracial blend. <br><br>As for bioplastic, I've found that in imagining a technological dystopia, it's very hard to stay ahead of reality.

According to people I talked to in Switzerland, they seem to be very careful about making changes, often deliberating for years or even decades before deciding to adopt a change, build a new building or road, etc. <br><br>To pick up on another of your themes, local democracy still seems to be strong there: many decisions are still made at the town/city and canton level, the Swiss regularly make decisions through plebiscites, and there are probably hundreds of local newspapers reporting on local issues.<br><br>Regarding medical care, I should add that, if my wife's initial exams had shown problems, there was almost certainly a scanner waiting somewhere in that hospital or another, bigger hospital; people that I talked to in Switzerland knew of people who had been scanned for brain injuries. Scans do have the advantage of being able to pinpoint the exact location and size of a blood clot, after all. But thankfully, they weren't necessary in our case.<br><br>Rather than totally eschewing the more complicated technology, the Swiss approach seemed to be to use gentler, less expensive technologies first (which require more human labor), and to use the riskier, more expensive machines only if necessary. Speaking from personal experience, it seems that this gradual approach is much more common outside of the USA; in the USA, they tend to prefer the latest, most aggressive treatment.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c5565856170855472658 title="comment permalink">9/29/15, 4:03 AM</a><br><br>

I spoke with the newspaper reporter who wrote about municipal salaries and he said salaries are high for two reasons 1) negotiated contracts with guaranteed pay raises and 2) overtime. Police work 12 hour shifts and are required to complete their paperwork before going home. They often stay over the 12 hours to complete the paperwork. <br><br>It should also be noted that police also earn overtime doing security detail type work (like they did for the Pope visit - many departments sent police down for that), extra coverage for local festivals/parades/events, training and certifications (CPR, first aid, weapons, equipment and whatever homeland security is up to these days) and attending funeral services for fallen police officers anywhere in the state or country. Event/festival/parade organizers and security detail work is supposedly reimbursed to the municipality by the organizers. <br><br>So everything that isn't patrol work in the 12 hour shift is time and a half, thus making it easy to earn a salary around $110,000 on top of a base salary of $82,000 or so. <br><br>In the county seat where we are the base police salary is $62,000 and there the police have shootings each week - some ending in murder and some with severe injury. There hasn't been a shooting here in the 16 years I lived here. <br><br>So the police, like public schools, are paid based on what the community can pay, not in any sort of relationship to how much or type of work required in that community. I've heard politicians refer to the under-funding of public schools in cities, along with the city police and fire departments, but nothing seems to get done. Its like they want the poor to suffer and stay poor.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c5595224545362731290 title="comment permalink">9/29/15, 9:31 AM</a><br><br>

There are plausible alternative history, retrotopia, or deindustrial scenarios that see Winnipeg as the jewel of a prairie society, based in some combination of Métis political establishment, surging indigenous demographics, and a rising Orthodox culture in Spengler's sense. Such a nation would be robustly polyglot (French, Michif, Cree, English... Bungee, Gaelic, German, Ukrainian... Icelandic?) and would likely have developed novel and surprising characteristics in areas such as religious accommodation and the nature of property, as the result of the enforced marriage of Western state/cultural forms with non-Faustian lived reality. <br><br>The working-out depends on where in history you situate the split-- tweak a variable or two and the Red River colony successfully establishes in 1870 the independent prairie nation that was contemplated but doomed in 1885; or perhaps, within the Retrotopia storyline, the Northwest imaginatively reasserts itself in response to the failure of the oil sands, the rapid degradation of industrial agriculture, and the mid-21st-century breakup of Canada.<br><br>If nothing else, the idea of a Mithraic temple as the seat of a national government should fire the imagination.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c3361814543613080354 title="comment permalink">9/29/15, 2:48 PM</a><br><br>

I thought I'd offer this up to fill in the spaces, offering an accurate account based on present and historical trends of what the Confederacy will be alongside Lakeland.<br>The Second Civil War started in the same place the First Civil War started, in Charleston, in South Carolina. Mostly this was an honorary nod to South Carolina, as the rest of the Southern States from North Carolina to Texas seceded promptly after South Carolina's initial vote, and it wasn't too much longer till non Southern states were seceding as well, since the Federal government had become intolerable. It had already been settled that the capital would be the original Confederate capital in Montgomery. Initially, most people of color were wary of the new Confederacy, however, by this time, even most people of color had lost faith in the Federal government. As with the First Civil War, the Federal government promised to maintain the Union by any means necessary, but, this time around, it<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c6951343588896694667 title="comment permalink">9/29/15, 4:25 PM</a><br><br>

As the Second Civil War raged on, the Federal government committed atrocities that would have made Sherman blush. Initially, the Federal government used saboteurs to attempt to foment a race riot/counterrevolution among people of color. (Most of the South was now "majority minority", using the old Federal definitions, as the reversal of the "Great Migration" and continued Latin American migration continued to change Southern demographics. All the Federal governments actions only served to unify the people, as both Latinos and African Americans resented the saboteurs. As the war went on, cries of "Yankee go home!" were often most vehement among people of color. The federal government did not help things any by attempting a mass deportation of Latin American immigrants. The Confederacy immediately offered asylum to any undocumented person willing to fight for the Confederacy, and as word of this got out, there was a mass inmigration of Latinos seeking refuge in the Confederacy. Both New England and the rump of the Federal Government in the Eastern Seaboard had begun racial roundups and purges in their territories in the name of security, and the anarchy and fighting in California has led many Latinos to flee for the Confederacy. Meanwhile, Mexico and Central American countries were watching with concern. Mexico had always wanted to reclaim the territories lost to Guadalupe Hidalgo, but, with global warming an ongoing concern, these territories were looking even less habitable than the last time they were under Mexican rule. Mexico was eager to extend its influence in the habitable parts of the former USA, and the Confederacy was a logical partner, since it had offered asylum and was home to the largest community of Mexicans living abroad. Mexico allied itself with the Confederacy and helped the Confederacy secure its independence. In recognition of demographic reality and the Mexican alliance, the Confederacy became officially bilingual, as bilingual as Canada. Ever aware of its past and Federal meddling during the Second Civil War, the Confederacy was eager to promote a unifying foundational myth. It borrowed one from its ally, Mexico--"viva la raza del Sur/long live the Southern race", but "race" did not refer to to whites, but that mythical time long ago in history when black, white, and indigenous first came together in the colonial South. Many questioned this at the time as a gross distortion of history, but were quickly silenced. A nation newly founded out of a particularly bitter struggle, it would be 100 years before the Confederacy would be willing to critically look at its past.<br>The foundational myth of the Confederacy was its agrarian past, in the form of the feudal plantation. The antebellum era was venerated as a time unblemished by Yankee industrialism. All of the pent up rage that in occupation times had been directed against people of color was now redirected towards Yankee industrialists, fully encouraged by the Confederate government. In practice, those with Northern roots were suspect, subject to harrassment or worse. Yankees who didn't flee were tortured. A common epithet was to be called a "tool of the Yankee industrialists"<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c4310969512243884637 title="comment permalink">9/29/15, 4:26 PM</a><br><br>

Interestingly, Trump did not fare so well. Although Trump evaded Stephen Colbert's quotation traps with ease a few nights ago, he couldn't come up with anything more than his usual promises when facing straightforward questions from Scott Pelley. Dilbert creator Scott Adams has been blogging that Trump is a Master Wizard: "A human that is extraordinarily skilled in the methods of persuasion," but while he might be convincing those who want to believe, I don't see him gaining any ground elsewhere.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c7885399987553359788 title="comment permalink">9/30/15, 3:46 AM</a><br><br>

The good tax payers of Alabama were obliged to pony up for two(2) special sessions of the state legislature in order to raise a few paltry hundreds of millions of dollars--an amount that can only be considered "Trump" Change in some quarters. The amount that came out at the end of the second special sessions was considerably less than the "govnah" had warned would be required to keep the state from going into pro-ration because of Alabama's balanced budget amendment. Heaven forbid that the Republicans tax any rich people for the funds! What came out was a fifty cents per pack tax on cigarettes and the rest was rolled from the education trust fund. <br>All the while this was taking place, our esteemed governor and his spouse of more than fifty years were locked in a heated divorce, with her having moved out of the governor's mansion back in January!

You had a country that was severely demoralized and on the verge of collapse after decades of misrule by the Communists, followed by a decade of social disintegration, out of control gangsterism and IMF/Harvard School of Business sponsored neoliberal "shock therapy" (i.e. wholesale looting by Western business interests and local oligarchs).<br><br>As our esteemed Archdruid pointed out not to long ago, <a href=../../2015/05/the-era-of-response.html rel=nofollow>Putin is precisely the sort of charismatic authoritarian ruler</a> who tends to arise in the wake of a failed democracy. Greer also pointed out that Putin has been far less bloody minded than many other such rulers and that democracy is very hard to transplant, particularly in a nation that has had no previous experience of it and lacks certain institutions, such as the rule of law and a large and stable middle class.<br><br>"I think Mr. Obama is very intelligent."<br><br>I have seen precious little evidence of that, from the botched rollout of Obamacare, to the amateurish and pathetic response to the Gulf Oil Spill to the ongoing train wreck that is American foreign policy in the Middle East, Ukraine and elsewhere. Like many, I didn't think it was possible to have a president who was dumber and more incompetent than Dubya, but the Obama has proven that to be wrong, while continuing Bush's failed policies almost to the letter. Obama has proven himself to be an incompetent political hack who managed to BS his way into the Oval Office and quickly found himself in way over his head.<br><br>One presidential historian described the Carter administration as proof that the presidency is no place for on-the-job training and Obama has repeatedly shown just how true that is...<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c3287851343005356851 title="comment permalink">9/30/15, 2:54 PM</a><br><br>

Putin is no Stalin.<br><br>Your remark that Putin must be feeling frustrated and lonely struck me as an invitation to feel sympathy or at least empathy for the man. If I had dealings with him, empathy would be a useful quality to cultivate. I have no sympathy for the feelings of anyone who dispatches thugs to poison, shoot and beat to death journalists, critics and political rivals. It's lonely at the top when you have no equals you can trust.<br><br>You seem to be equating intelligence with competence. The job of POTUS in this era requires more brains than Dubya has, and also a lot of other qualities, some of which Obama has and some he lacks. I suspect Obama is smarter than a certain Harvard-educated playboy, but JFK in a roomful of advisors could figure out which questions he needed to ask and who was giving him disastrous advice. <br><br>Your mention of Carter supports this point. Carter isn't a dummy, but they moved him up from the minors before he had learned how to hit big league pitching. <br><br>Obama has the sort of intelligence that the English call "cleverness".<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c4630465931186762200 title="comment permalink">9/30/15, 7:00 PM</a><br><br>

It wouldn't be an understatement to say that your writing has helped to change my intellectual landscape so significantly that it has taken me on a completely different path to the one I was expecting. Having been one of those who had all of these ideas of climate change, peak oil, energy descent etc. lingering around in my unconscious for a long time, though like many subscribing to the idea of a technological saviour. I was acutely aware of my dissatisfaction of the stories I was hearing and believing, but hadn't quite managed to make the necessary connections. It seems finally I have found someone writing something that makes absolute sense whilst shattering my weakly-held beliefs and nudging me in new directions. Thank you for helping to pull me out of the stupor of modern society. Also thank you to all the commenters on here that help to make this blog so stimulating. <br><br><br>I'm really enjoying this fictional series. I've been inspired by this to explore my own ideas of a fictional future, and since a recent visit to an exhibition about the Celts, I'm thinking it could be a 'Celtopia' vision. Perhaps contrasting the fate of different regions of England and the new Celtic League of Nations, or something to that extent. My small part of the world is the beautiful South Wales coast.<br><br>I look forward to reading the rest of this series and exploring your past fictional pieces.<br><br>Diolch yn fawr iawn<br><br>Alex<br><br><a href=retrotopia-public-utilities-private.html#c5372316273467805850 title="comment permalink">10/5/15, 3:08 AM</a><br><br>
