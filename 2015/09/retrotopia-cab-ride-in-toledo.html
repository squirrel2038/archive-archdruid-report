<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the third installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator arrives in the capital of the Lakeland Republic, and further surprises are in store.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The train pulled into the Toledo station something like ten minutes late—we’d had to wait for another train to clear the bridge over Sandusky Harbor, and then rolled along the Lake Erie shoreline for half an hour, past little lakeside towns and open country dotted with shore pines, before finally veering inland toward the Lakeland Republic’s capital. All the way along the shore, I watched big two- and three-masted schooners catching a ride from the wind, some obviously heading out from the Toledo lakefront, some just as obviously heading toward it. The sailing ship I’d spotted outside Sandusky was clearly nothing unusual here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Once the train swung due west toward downtown Toledo, it was more farm country—the twentieth century kind with tractors and pickups rather than the nineteenth century kind with draft horses and wagons. Then the same sequence I’d watched around other Lakeland cities followed: houses became more frequent, fields gave way to truck gardens, and not too far after that the train was rolling past residential neighborhoods dotted with schools, parks, and little clusters of shops, striped at intervals with the omnipresent streetcar tracks and, here and there, crossed by the streetcars themselves. The houses gave way eventually to the warehouses and factories of an industrial district, and then to the dark waters of the Maumee River, swirling and rushing past the feet of a dozen bridges. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Toledo,” the conductor called out from behind me. “End of the line, ladies and gentlemen. Please make sure you have your luggage and belongings before you leave, and thank you for riding with us.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As the car I was in reached the far shore, I got a brief glimpse of tree-lined streetscapes, and then brick walls blotted out the view. Some of the other passengers got their luggage down from the overhead racks. Me, I had other things on my mind; it had finally occurred to me that unless I could get a veepad signal, I had no way to call the people who were supposed to meet me and make sure we didn’t miss each other, and I’d checked my veepad one last time and gotten the same dark field as before. I shrugged mentally, decided to wait and see what happened. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The train slowed to a crawl. The immigrant family across from me had apparently spotted somebody waiting for them on the platform, and were waving at the window. They already had their plastic-bag luggage in hand, and the moment the train stopped they hefted the bags and headed for the exit. I got my suitcase down from the rack; the boy who’d been sitting next to me went back to help his parents with their luggage, and I stepped into the aisle and followed the people in front of me up to the front of the car and out onto the platform. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A brightly painted sign said THIS WAY TO THE STATION. I followed that and the flow of people. Partway along I passed the immigrant family standing there with half a dozen other people in what looked like Victorian clothing out of a history vid—the wife’s family from Ann Arbor, I guessed—all talking a mile a minute. The wife was teary-eyed and beaming, and the two kids looked for the first time since I’d seen them as though they might get around to smiling one of these days. I thought about the conversation I’d had with the husband, wondered if things really were that much better at the bottom end of the income scale here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I went through a big double door of glass and metal into what had to be the main room of the station, a huge open space under a vaulted ceiling, with benches in long rows on one side, ticket counters on the other, and what looked like half a dozen restaurants and a bar ahead in the middle distance. Okay, I said to myself, here’s where I try to find someone who has a clue about how to locate people and get around in this bizarre country. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d almost finished thinking that when a woman and a man in what I’d come to think of as Bogart clothing got up off one of the nearby benches and came over toward me. “Mr. Carr?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Well, that was easy, I thought, and turned toward them. She was tall for a woman, with red-brown curls spilling out from under a broad-brimmed hat; he was a couple of inches shorter than she was, with the kind of forgettable face you look for when you’re hiring spies or administrative assistants. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m Melissa Berger,” the woman said, shaking my hand, “and this is Fred Vanich.” I shook his hand as well. “I hope your trip this morning wasn’t too disconcerting,” she went on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That last word was unexpected enough that I laughed. “Not quite,” I said. “Though there were a few surprises.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I can imagine. If you’ll come this way?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Can I take that for you?” Vanich said, and I handed over my suitcase and followed them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m afraid we’ve had to do some rescheduling,” Berger said as we headed for the doors. “The President was hoping to meet with you this afternoon, after you have time to get settled in at the hotel, but he’s got a minor crisis on his hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of the Restorationist parties in our coalition is breathing fire and brimstone over a line item in an appropriations bill. It’ll blow over in a day or so, but—well, I’m sure you know how it goes.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yeah,” I said. “Ellen’s been having to deal with that sort of thing every other day or so since the election.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That was quite an upset,” she said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded. “We were pretty happy with the way it turned out.”
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Outside the air was blustery and crisp, with the first taste of approaching winter on it. The trees lining the street still clung to a few brown and crumpled leaves. Just past the trees, where I’d expected to see cabs waiting for passengers in a cloud of exhaust, horses stood placidly in front of brightly colored—buggies? Carriages? Whatever they were called, they looked like boxes with big windows, some with four wheels supporting them and some with two, and a seat up top for the driver. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I blinked, and almost stopped. Berger gave me an amused look. “I know,” she said. “We do a lot of things differently here.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ve noticed that,” I replied. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She led the way to one of the four-wheeled buggies, or whatever they were. Obviously things had been arranged in advance; she said “Good afternoon, Earl,” to the driver, he said “Good afternoon, ma’am” in response, and without another word being said my suitcase found its way into the trunk in back and the three of us were settling into place in comfortable leather seats inside, Berger and I facing forward and Vanich across from us facing backward. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The buggy swung out into traffic and headed down the street. “Is this standard here?” I asked, indicating the vehicle with a gesture. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The cab? More or less,” said Berger. “There are a few towns with electric cabs and a fair number with pedal cabs, but you’ll find horse cabs everywhere there’s taxi service at all. The others don’t produce methane feedstock.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I considered that. “But no gasoline or diesel cabs.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not since Partition, no.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That made a certain amount of sense to me. “I’m guessing the embargo had a lot to do with that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Well, to some extent. There was quite a bit of smuggling, of course—Chicago being right on our border.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I snorted. “And Chicago being Chicago.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Free City of Chicago was the smallest of the nations that came out of Partition, and made up for that by being far and away the most gaudily corrupt. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Well, yes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But there wasn’t that much of a market for petroleum products,” she went on. “There’s the tailpipe tax, of course, and we also lost most of the necessary infrastructure during the war—highways, pipelines, all of it.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m surprised your government didn’t subsidize rebuilding.”
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We don’t do things that way here,” she said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave her a long startled look. “Obviously I have a lot to learn,” I said finally. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She nodded. “Outsiders generally do.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I filed away the word <i>outsider</i> for future reference. “One thing I’ve been wondering since I crossed the border,” I said then. “Or rather two. You really don’t have metanet service in the Lakeland Republic?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s correct,” she replied at once. “We actually have jamming stations along the borders, though it’s been fifteen or sixteen years since we last had to use them.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Hold it,” I said. “Jamming stations?”<br>
<br style="mso-special-character: line-break"></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Mr. Carr,” Berger said, “since Partition we’ve fought off three attempts at regime change and one full-blown military invasion. All the regime change campaigns were one hundred per cent coordinated via the metanet— saturation propaganda via social media, flashmobs, swarming attacks, you know the drill. The third one fizzled because we’d rigged a kill switch in what little metanet infrastructure we had by then and shut it down, and after that the legislature voted to scrap what was left. Then when Brazil and the Confederacy invaded in ‘49, one reason they pulled back a bloody stump was that military doctrine these days—theirs, yours, everybody else’s—is fixated on disrupting network infrastructure and realtime comm-comm, and we don’t have those, so they literally had no clue how to fight us. So, yes, we have jamming stations. If you’d like to visit one I can arrange that.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I took that in. “That won’t be necessary,” I said then. “Just out of curiosity, do you jam anything else?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not any more. We used to jam radio broadcasts from the Confederacy, but that’s because they jammed ours. We got that settled three years ago.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Television?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Waste of time. Only about three per cent of the Republic’s within range of a ground station, and the satellite situation—well, I’m sure you know at least as much about that as I do.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I was by no means sure of that, but let it pass. “Okay, and that leads to my second question. How on earth do you take notes when you don’t have veepads?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Instead of answering, she directed a rueful look at Vanich, who nodded once, as though my words had settled something. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m guessing,” I said then, “that somebody just won a bet.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And it wasn’t me,” Berger said. “There are four questions that outsiders always ask, and there’s always a certain amount of speculation, shall we say, about which one gets asked first.” She held up one finger. “How do you take notes?” A second. “How do you find out what’s happening in the world?” A third. “What do you do to contact people?” A fourth. “And how do you pay your bar tab?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I laughed. “I’ve got a fifth,” I said. “How do you look up facts without Metapedia?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s an uncommon one, Mr. Carr,” Vanich said. His voice was as bland and featureless as his face. If he wasn’t a spy, I decided, the Lakeland Republic was misusing his talents. “I’ve heard it now and then, but it’s uncommon.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“To answer your question,” Berger said then, “most people use paper notebooks.” She pulled a flat rectangular shape out of her purse, fanned it open to show pages with neat angular handwriting on them, put it away again. “Available at any stationery store, but you won’t have to worry about that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There’s one waiting at your hotel room.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Thank you,” I said, trying to wrap my head around writing down notes on sheets of paper. It sounded about as primitive as carving them with a chisel on stone. “Just out of curiosity, what about the others? I was planning on asking those sometime soon.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Fair enough,” she said. “You find out what’s happening by reading a newspaper or listening to the radio. You contact people by phone, if you’re in a county with phone service, or by writing a letter or sending a radiogram anywhere. You pay your bar tab with cash, and any larger purchases with a check—we’ve got all that set up for you; you’ll just have to visit a bank, and there’s one a block and a half from the hotel. You look up facts in books—your own, if you’ve got them, or a public library’s if you don’t. There’s a branch five blocks from your hotel.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not as convenient as accessing the metanet,” I noted. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“True, but there are more important things than convenience.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Like national survival?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d meant the words as an olive branch of sorts, and she took them that way. “Among other things.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She looked out the window, then, and turned in her seat to face me. “We’re almost to your hotel. I’m going to have to go back to the Capitol right away and see if I can shake some sense into the Restos, and Fred has his own work to get done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One way or another, there’ll be someone to take you around tomorrow. If you like, after you’ve settled in and had some lunch, I can have somebody come out and show you the tourist sights, or whatever else you’d like to see.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Thank you,” I said, “but I’d like to suggest something different. I hear your streets are pretty safe.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She nodded. “I know the kind of thing you have to deal with in Philadelphia. We don’t have that sort of trouble here.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“In that case, I’d like to wander around a bit on my own, check out the landscape—maybe visit the public library you mentioned.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was a long shot; I figured the Lakeland government would want me under the watchful eye of a handler the whole time I was in the country. To my surprise, she looked relieved. “If that works for you, it works for us,” she said. “I’ll have somebody call you first thing tomorrow—eight o’clock, if that’s not too early.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’ll be fine.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“With any luck this whole business will have blown over by then and President Meeker can see you right away.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Here’s hoping,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
The cab came to a halt. A moment later, the driver opened the door. I shook both their hands, climbed down to the sidewalk. </div>

I don't live in Ohio, but I have feel like I have enough experience with the state to give my impressions. I just want people unfamiliar with the area to get a sense of how different these descriptions of future Ohio are from the reality of today.<br><br>Both Sandusky and Toledo have lost population in every census since the 1970s. They are Rust Belt cities, with tracts of open land where houses once stood (though nothing on the scale of Detroit) and some boarded-up buildings. They are car-dominated (as, granted, most places in the US are). Toledo and Sandusky do both have Amtrak stations, but each sees a grand total of four trains (frequently late) per day, and Toledo is a city of about 285,000 people (down from 383,000 in 1970). Imagine a European city of nearly 300,000 people with a total of just four passengers trains per day. In fiscal year 2013, Sandusky had a grand total of 9,591 Amtrak boardings and alightings <i>for the entire fiscal year</i>. These are not places where most people take passenger trains today.<br><br>The median <i>household</i> income for Sandusky city in 2010 was about $36,000, and in the city of Toledo $33,317 -- both quite a bit lower than the national average. (And again, that's for the entire household, not individual income). I could go on with the stats, but I won't. In short, this region of the country in 2015 is less prosperous, more economically depressed, and less desirable than many other regions. I want to point that out for readers unfamiliar with the area, to highlight the drastic differences between 2015 and JMG's future vision. Gripping reading from JMG, and I want to see how we got from now to then, particularly with the general decline that's coming.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c1988197855960970941 title="comment permalink">9/9/15, 5:45 PM</a><br><br>

Carr, of course, is a government functionary of some kind. Hansom cabs, interesting. I got the impression that the election was recent, with the note that the other candidate had just given his concession speech, while this suggests that the new administration has been in business for long enough to be dealing with intra-party spats. This brings up a question: does Carr know how to write? Is it even taught in schools back where he’s from? (Blanking on the name, sigh.)<br><br>A note on phone service: these days, the exchange to exchange phone network is the same infrastructure as the internet; without the internet infrastructure, there will be no non-local phone service. Copper wire connections from the exchange to customer premises are begin left to rot by at least one of the major phone companies; by 1929 I’d imagine they would no longer exist, so that entire infrastructure would have to be rebuilt.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c1328953524913521383 title="comment permalink">9/9/15, 6:04 PM</a><br><br>

Back in '02 the Americans held an exercise called Millennium Challenge 2002 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Challenge_2002) to prove the superiority of network-centric warfare with all its bells and whistles.<br> Unfortunately for them, the bloke that they put in charge of the oppo force was a Lt. General Paul Van Riper - a no-bullshit Marine combat vet who had done multiple tours of Vietnam. He was retired then and so was not worried about his career anymore.<br> Using motorcycle messengers, World-War-II-style light signals and the like - none of which showed up on the electronic surveillance network of course, he achieved total surprise with an attack that in a real war would have led to the loss of an aircraft carrier, ten cruisers and five of six amphibious ship plus 20,000 dead Americans.<br> I suppose in this story then that using electronic warfare has limited value when fighting the Amish.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c3078420944331419669 title="comment permalink">9/9/15, 6:28 PM</a><br><br>

He probably was taught to print, though he's out of practice. One wonders whether he knows how to hold whatever kinds of pens they have in the Lakeland Republic--he's probably never seen anyone write with a fountain pen, let alone a dip pen, nor seen a pencil being sharpened. Mr. Carr does not seem to have been coached on these little details of daily life in Retropia; either the trip was arranged hastily or Mr. Carr's sponsors were not able to call on someone who had traveled to the LR recently for advice. I'm a bit concerned that no one warned Mr. Carr about banker's hours; presumably he can put lunch on his hotel bill, but if doesn't make a bank visit his first errand, he'll be out of pocket money. Perhaps the locals have seen other visitors floundering and will help him out.<br><br>I was required to turn in handwritten homework at least through the sixth grade, but my penmanship was never good even when I was copying out an edited draft. At speed my handwriting is illegible to me. Consequently as an adult I gave up cursive in favor of hand printing anything other than condolence notes.

The cable news station I watch has been giving extensive coverage of the speeches of the current Republican front runner, Mr. Donald Trump. Rather than having emotional reactions to what he says and does, I'm trying to observe and analyze. The kinds of speeches Trump is making, in the issues he raises, the way he frames them, the promises he makes and the enemies he identifies, seem to be textbook examples of how to run a Fascist candidate of the kind JMG wrote about. I don't know whether this comes across in print journalism and we know JMG does not watch TV.<br><br>To be clear, I don't believe Donald Trump is a fascist; I can't discern any fixed political convictions in him. His political program amounts to "Trust me to fix things". I do think most of the people who turn out to his rallies would be very susceptible to an actual fascist candidate, based on what they say when asked about why they are Trump supporters. Whether it's intentional or not, Donald Trump's campaign seems to be a dry run for a serious fascist Presidential campaign in 2020.<br><br>By then whichever party is holding the White House will be unpopular and the independents will be up for grabs.

You're right that he'll have no clue about shorthand -- and you get tonight's gold star for realizing that yes, a lot of people in the Lakeland Republic will know and use shorthand, as a fast effective way to make notes and copy down someone's words as fast as they're spoken. I'm pretty sure it's taught in most schools. <br><br>Dan, thank you. Yes, this project is very much influenced by Callenbach's frankly brilliant reworking of the utopian-narrative genre -- though of course my imagined society has a lot less Bay Area cannabls-scented hippiedom and a lot more Rust Belt retro in it! <br><br>Glenn, true enough -- and in this case the manure, horse and other, doesn't need to go anything like so far. (Many thanks, btw, for the ship notes; I've already arrange to publish <i>Retrotopia</i> as a novel once it's finished, and those will be most useful. Yes, btw, the Lakeland Republic has a navy -- more precisely, a competent armed coast guard that's capable of functioning as a navy within the limits of the Great Lakes when that's needed.) <br><br>Chic Noir, thank you! <br><br>Bob, no argument there.

Thank you!<br><br>Hapibeli, I suspect we ain't seen nothin' yet...<br><br>Ray, the Lakeland Republic's westernmost regions are what's now the states of Illinois (minus greater Chicago) and Wisconsin; it doesn't extend west of the Mississippi River. There's another republic that includes Iowa, Minnesota, the Dakotas, and Nebraska, and then there's the dilapidated and chaotic Rocky Mountain republic, not quite a failed state, that sprawls from Colorado to Montana, with its capital at Cheyenne. Utah and most of Idaho have become the Republic of Deseret, of course, which is not quite a Mormon theocracy, but close. Oregon and Washington, with the northern end of Idaho, are the Cascadian Republic, which is basically a Chinese client state. California declared its independence and then almost immediately collapsed into its own civil war, and is one of the 21st century's most intractable failed states. Oh, and let's not forget the Republic of Texas, which has absorbed Oklahoma and New Mexico and has tested its own nuclear weapons. How's that for a basic tour? <br><br>Lee, thank you!<br><br>Unknown Deborah, I'll be posting essays from time to time as well -- right now I'm enjoying the opportunity to think of something less ghastly than current affairs, is all. <br><br>Zachary, that's fascinating, but not surprising.

But then it occurred to me: in a trading nation, such close surveillance of outsiders cannot be made to work without killing the trade links with other countries. It is no longer just about monitoring a handful of visitors, who may not even be allowed in in the first place; trade implies that your own citizens are in regular contact with the outside world, possibly even venturing into it - and bringing in their own stories and, God forbid, even smuggling some items (which come to be seen as extremely valuable, well beyond their actual merits, due to their scarcity back home).<br><br>This last dynamic I have witnessed first hand. I have spent my childhood in communist Poland, which was of course nowhere near as isolated as North Korea but nevertheless quite comprehensively separated from the capitalist economy. But my mother was a French lecturer, and apparently her skills were in such high demand that the university has sent her on several training courses to France. From one of those courses she brought back a Lego set, which was then used as payment for having our bathroom refurbished, including rearranging the pipework, and tiled on top of that - and all this ahead of the official queue! Mind you, it was a big set as far as Lego sets go.<br><br>And an alternative narrative which becomes associated with something desirable but lacking - is an autarkic regime's kryptonite.<br><br>But then, what sort of stories would Lakelandish (?) sailors bring back home from their trading trips? And just as importantly, what sort of stories would they leave behind in their destination ports?<br><br><br><br>And given that Lakeland Republic does indeed trade with surrounding nations which are quite reliably hostile towards it, would it not use a more traditional, more clandestine sort of surveillance towards high-profile outsiders such as mr Carr?<br><br><br><br>MigrantWorker<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c184263923418210139 title="comment permalink">9/10/15, 1:14 AM</a><br><br>

Quite the contrary, one thing I always hated in fiction is the way that dictatorships are portrayed as having unending conflict, whereas democracies are peaceful and harmonious. <br><br>Real life is often the other way around; I prefer democracies, but they are by their nature arenas of constant (hopefully polite) struggle. A minor political crisis is often a healthy sign, as is the fact that people are talking about it openly. <br><br>Thanks for the run-down of your future USA, but what about my native Missouri? It would seem to be between all these other regional nations. <br><br>I wonder how expensive paper would be there – it certainly was more tedious to make before fossil fuels, and Ohio today wouldn’t have as many trees to cut. <br><br>I liked the fact that there are actually more bridges over the Maumee in your future than there are today, if I’m not mistaken. :-)<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c8118531606065486450 title="comment permalink">9/10/15, 1:21 AM</a><br><br>

As I was watching through the train window I got wondering about why people clothing look like they are out of a history book. Unless it is a quite recent trend, I find this puzzling, for I have always thought that even retro-fashion has a way to reshape the "old style" into something new. Maybe it is that my eyes, like Carr's, don't see the differences. Or is it because there is a strong social fashion movement towards old times ? My gut feeling make me lean towards the later, but we shall see. In any case, I'll keep an eye out for hair and clothes fashions that strike me as new.<br><br>And while we Français tend to make lots of them, I know that American's usually don't that much...

Speculating on Mr. Carrs identity and purpose for being in the Lakeland Republic:<br><br> Its seems pretty clear that he's a low to maybe (but probably not) mid level government lackey back home. Where he higher up he would likely already know many of the things he's surprised about seeing and were he a spy like some on here think he at least would have been briefed and prepared before being sent there. The Guy wasn't even aware that there was no Metanet and he had to actually wright things down physically. Even if the Republic has been very secretive since Partition, which it seems like they haven't been, at least no more than any country who's had rebellions and wars on a regular basis and may be surrounded by enemies, the Coastal Republic around Philly (not sure what your calling it or where its centered) should have at least some idea about life there by now. Especially if there as paranoid and dystopian as they seem.<br><br> Also the fact that Carr was clueless about the lower classes horrible lifestyle points out that he is probably from money and higher class since childhood, and may have gotten his position through family influence. Speaking of which his position is probably that of a low level diplomat who was likely sent there because he was expendable in case the LLR's president decides he wants to string somebody up. Or maybe if something like that did happen it would give the Coastal region a "good" reason to invade... Oh the possibilities! <br><br>Or I could have totally got it wrong.

I imagine a good editor will get these before publishing; however for now many of the points you want to make could be a little lighter with less exposition (and/or less precision). The 100 acre quibbles last week were an example of this, another is the speech about the Metanet. It is jarring in its detail and reads like a (classified?) briefing paper rather than conversation between newly introduced individuals. The whole Brazil sentence could be dropped and the same point would be evident, with the invasion detail left hanging and explained later if appropriate.<br><br>That said, I look forward to the next installment thank you!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c832551942802909282 title="comment permalink">9/10/15, 2:55 AM</a><br><br>

You would see it on the coffee tables of living rooms. You would see in the dentist's waiting room. You would see it on the newsagent racks in the pharmacy. <i>Reader's Digest</i> in those days struck a middle-brow, politically rather conservative, line, from time to time coloured with a mild degree of moral uplift in the hortatory tones of that Norman Rockwell of the typewriter, Dr Norman Vincent Peale. Sometimes there would be pieces to make you think: "Should the zoogle-zoggle be a flim-flam?" the editors would earnestly ask, and there would be two or three pages arguing "Yes" and two or three pages arguing "No". The Norman-Rockwellian hortatory uplift could come from some nicely argued piece under some such title as "The Power of Prayer". Or, alternatively, it could come from a much-repeated feature, always about some one particular person, actually one of the best things in the magazine, under the title "The Most Unforgettable Character I Have Ever Met". <br><br>In 2015, as I noted from yesterday's tooth filling, <i>Reader's Digest</i> is still kept the dentist's waiting room. However, today's <i>Digest</i> is unsubstantial. In place of the 1960s offerings of 10 or so meaty articles per issue, there are only 4 or so. The writing now seems to require oddly little thinking - as in the kind of writing I am inclined to offer when making fun of Hemingway: "I like to write with SHORT words. Tough guys like short words. Short words pack a big punch. Our world needs more short words. It needs then bad, and it needs them now. Short. Words. Yes." <br><br>So my question for JMG is: What are magazines like in Lakeland?<br><br>(2) When one recalls one's 1960s childhood, or - perhaps still better, because these days more vivid, and more accessible to the very young - one looks at those TechniColored YouTube vids of air or rail travel from the 1960s, one is struck by the way people dressed up. Men would board in jacket and tie. Women would be in skirts with matching jackets (what in Estonian is called a <i>kostüüm</i>), and I think carrying matching handbags. Hats were common, except on children. A time traveller jerked from a 1960s departure lounge into 2015 would think - correctly - that some social decline had occurred, ominously reflected not only in big political terms but also in something as humble as tailoring. <br><br>My question for JMG is: Do the normal native Lakelanders, as opposed to the foreigners we saw on the 5:10 Pittsburgh-to-Toledo run, dress in public in 1960s-careful or in 2015-casual style? <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br>near Toronto<br><br>www dot metascientia dot com<br><br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c1616296814463672286 title="comment permalink">9/10/15, 8:02 AM</a><br><br>

It is notable that at one point in past weeks all men, and most women, have been described as wearing head coverings, and that the naive Mr Carr is met in Toledo this week by a duly hatted lady. What can this mean? I hope we find out.<br><br>PPS: One or two readers have already commented on the fact that Lakeland economic-technological arrangements are liable to vary, as seen from the train window, when one crosses a county line. I am hoping here that the explanation is a political one, involving devolution of powers from national government to municipality. (This, like the dignity of small-enterprise private ownership defended by Leo XIII and his successors, is connected with formal Catholic social teaching. Under the principle of "subsidiarity" - admittedly more honoured, in the period from Paul VI to Benedict's resignation, by what the Vatican has preached than in what it has had the courage to practice - decisions get taken at the most local possible level. "Subsidiarity" in governance, like small-enterprise private ownership in economics, is supposed to defend the little guy.)<br><br><br><br>Tom in Toronto <br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c188776768488500364 title="comment permalink">9/10/15, 8:04 AM</a><br><br>

That got me thinking, and I'd have posted my thoughts over there instead, but last Monday is just so history by now.<br>I'm not there to really get a sense of it, but the immigrants are probably mostly folks who know that the Chinese system is extremely fragile, and have a touchingly naive degree of faith in America instead. America has had a big influx of orientals before, with dire warnings about the "Yellow Peril." I find it likely that this time too, they'll be the victims when our system falls apart.<br>On the Chinese not bothering to speak the local language, I was down in Malaysia, which has a large Chinese population that have been there for many generations. Some among them did not speak Malaysian, and barely enough English to conduct business with tourists. They seem to get along fine nonetheless.<br>These are resourceful people. If I were in Seattle, I'd be learning Mandarin or Cantonese, whichever was more prevalent. Start with proper greetings, thanks, apologies, numbers, what time is it, where is the restroom.

Which may be part of the reason today's culture has so firmly set its face against letting kids do or themselves in the smallest things, and making them do chores; because otherwise, kids on their own fall into very bad trouble indeed, since, unlike the heroes of earlier kidlit, they cannot get any sort of work except the outlawed sort. OK - that's one consequence.<br><br>The second is that, since housework, cooking, and laundry must be done, under retro conditions it will eat up far more woman-hours than today's people can even imagine. Therefore women who want a professional career that is incompatible with the demands of housework (and child-rearing) will either be single, have servants, or live in communal arrangements. The latter, BTW, is one thing Marion Zimmer Bradley got completely right - under nonindustrial conditions.<br><br>Leading to consequence #3: the return of dormitories, boarding houses, and residence hotels. Even Sherlock Holmes had a landlady who doubled as his housekeeper. Students today read period novels (if they do) and marvel that students in period put up with the regimentation and rigors of dormitory life - they wouldn't. They'd just get an apartment of their own. With a dishwasher, a washer-dryer hookup, a microwave .... the automation listed above. One very good picture of dormitory life back in the day is Josephine Tey's MISS PYM DISPOSES. Bells at 5:30 am etc. <br><br>And consequence #4 - since servants will be so helpful, and with poor relations trickling in from the east, they will certainly be impressed into service just as Star Reach's Trey and his mother were in Auntie Dell's tavern. Of course, the traditional Midwestern farm custom was that the hired help ate with the family, IIRC (it's been two-thirds of a century since I was last there.) <br><br>OH, and with housework some thing all women were expected to know and do, just as repairs and strong-arm work are something all men were expected to know and do - except dedicated pencil-pushers - it will be vital, but devalued, noted only when done badly, undone, or overdone, except for cooking and craftwork. Instead, such jobs will become "The LEAST you can do!" Whether that's good or bad depends on one's attitude. I remember resenting it because the person saying it had overtones of "basically you're a parasite -try to make up for it in these pitiful little ways" in his own attitude. Or why we've both been single since 1990. Leading to --<br><br>Divorce will become a lot more difficult, simply because he'll need a housekeeper, and she will need other means of support, since everybody else has the skills she does. Expect the rate of domestic murder to go up. <br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c592757921648697794 title="comment permalink">9/10/15, 8:33 AM</a><br><br>

Just as Genghis Khan and his hords had a powerfull advantage in the mastery of horse mounted warfare so will the bicycle enabled warbands in a period when horses are not yet plentiful and fossil fueled transport has been brought to a standstill.

The use of the word has annoyed me for a while in other contexts as well. The reason is that it was probably invented by marketers in order to sell stuff, and misses two important reasons for people's choices that go beyond marketing. The first is that people have values that transcend trying to impress people, or look cool and those values in fact clash with the predominant de-facto value of the global industrial market economy (efficiency and comfort). The second is that sometimes these choices are about survival and necessity, thus not really "choices" in the standard marketing sense at all.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c7973483486388882851 title="comment permalink">9/10/15, 12:51 PM</a><br><br>

I was a boy in a small-town elementary school in the 1940s. We sat in rows of wooden desks bolted in place, and each desktop had a round hole in its far right corner to hold an inkwell full of black ink. When we were old enough (2nd grade, I think) to learn to use ink, we were issued a single dip pen, consisting of a holder with a simple steel nib. (We were told to bring blotting paper and pen-wipers from home. The blotting paper was bought from a stationary store; the pen wipers were sewn from old rags at home.) And so we learned to write in ink, with many a blot and drip on the paper, the desk and even our clothes. It was messy, but also fun, as new manual skills always are. From time to time we pressed too hard, and wrecked a nib; but the teacher had a box of fresh nibs against that eventuality. -- Ball-point pens became widely available, I think, when I was in 5th grade; but we weren't supposed to use them in school ever, so as not to lose the ability to use dip pens. Every morning one child was chosen to take the large bottle of black ink with a spout and carefully top up the small inkwell in each child's desk. The teacher had a larger glass inkwell with two reservoirs, for red as well as black ink, that also needed filling, and two dip pens, one for each color of ink. Red ink seemed really special, exemplifying the teacher's power!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c5822094532987917382 title="comment permalink">9/10/15, 12:54 PM</a><br><br>

Think of all those mid-20th-century sci-fi stories about the incredible planetary colonies and flying cars of 2000. Or even the 1970s TV series <i>Space: 1999</i>, where we evidently were supposed to have moon bases by that date.<br><br>I was going to say "Look at how relatively little has changed in the last 50 years. Is it truly realistic that a place that in 2015 is beset by poverty, a lack of employment opportunities, racial tensions, insufficient or decayed infrastructure, and -- perhaps above all -- low educational standards is going to be able to reinvent itself in 50 years as a prosperous, cohesive community with a sort of upbeat twenties steampunk vibe, especially with the coming slow collapse that's ahead of all of us?"<br><br>But then I thought more deeply about what the Rust Belt was like 50 years ago, in 1965. Far from perfect and about to enter a long slide (with riots just a few years off), Toledo in 1965 was still an industrial powerhouse, with a population of about 400,000, six or seven Fortune 500 companies headquartered in the city, and a strong middle-class blue-collar community -- the kind of place where you could, for a little while longer at least, expect to graduate from high school and make a decent living with a factory job.

A quiet library -- no electronic noise to worry about and people who only talk in whispers. Children who are excited to browse the stacks, no computers or video games to distract them. Card catalogs.

Libraries with card catalogs? I used card catalogs for years and still kind of miss them. I might use them over the catalog search of my public library's website if the card catalogs were still in existence. Cash and paper checks? Still use both. I have a credit card and use it too, but writing a check makes the money I'm spending more real for me. I don't do online banking at all; I balance my checkbook on paper (I use a calculator now but could easily go back to adding and subtracting on paper, or I could have my husband teach me how to use our abacus.) Landline phone? Check, still use, though it's now tied in to the household server, with the server sending the signal over the wires inside the house. Paper and pen? Check. I keep my diaries and all my garden notes on paper, looseleaf or spiral notebooks depending on my preference. We have two file cabinets filled with file folders. That's because paper is longer lasting than electronic media and I want my writings to last. When I was working for pay I used computers that had 8 inch and 5 3/4 inch floppy drives. All that data is unreadable now. All the 3 1/2 inch floppies I used for previous home computer data storage are unreadable now. However, I can read all my data that's on paper; some of it is approaching 50 years old. Photos? Any photo I want to keep is printed out and kept in a photo album. And so on. The LR feels like my childhood! (except for the lack of cars and prominence of horses, that is)<br><br>Why hats? We found out in this installment that it's late fall, almost winter, when Carr visits; mid to late November, most likely. As someone who lived in Ann Arbor as a child (an hour or two's drive from today's Toledo), I can tell you that it is *cold* at that time of year. Lakelanders clearly walk a lot. Of course they are wearing hats!! They *need* hats to stay warm when they are walking and taking horse-drawn cabs, many if not most of which may be open to airflow. Even here in Missouri winter is cold enough and I walk enough to wear a hat when I am outside walking any distance at that time of year. In fact, at that time of year I usually wear at least one hat, if not two hats, *inside* the house because we don't heat it much.<br><br>One other thing that amuses me is that Toledo is the capital of 2065's LR. It's probably not widely known that Ohio and Michigan almost came to war back when they were in the process of gaining statehood. The object of that war was Toledo, and both proto-states wanted it. Eventually a compromise was worked out: Ohio got Toledo, while Michigan got the Upper Peninsula. By the 1960s Michiganders widely viewed themselves as the winners of that war. Toledo was already seen as going downhill. Some of the old animosity between the states was still evident in other ways. In the 1970s, on one of our trips back to Ann Arbor to visit relatives, we drove by a billboard just to the Ohio side of the border which read, "Keep Ohio beautiful; dump your trash in Michigan."<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c4379545540156644569 title="comment permalink">9/10/15, 2:04 PM</a><br><br>

Many, even most, town residents had some sort of cottage industry going on. There was a furniture factory in the town, but it mostly stayed closed. Older women sat in the sunshine making doilies by hand. They guy I stayed with tanned lambskins in his back yard, and made them into winter coats. When it came time to paint the orphanage we were helping to build, the locals made their own paint by grinding up white powdery rock and mixing it with other stuff. I hoped it didn't have lead in it, but no way to confirm.<br>At night, pigs were turned out into the streets to forage for trash. I guess they were smart enough to find their way home by dawn. Streetlights were few and far between, but not much problem. Most people planned to be indoors by nightfall--although one night, I did share the street with several Romanians stumbling home in the starlit darkness without flashlights. The power was on for 20 hours most days, voltage varying between 200-260V, but could be off for 8 hours or more at a time. <br>Every week, there was a market day on Thursday. I awoke at 5 AM to the sounds of jingling, clopping hoofs, and horses and men muttering in the darkness. Mountain people and farmers brought their goods to stalls in the town square. Many used horse-drawn carts with worn pneumatic truck tires on them. Also, a lot of trade was barter, using jugs of locally-made apricot moonshine. <br>It was a fascinating experience then--Not sure if Rural Romania still has those conditions, but it was a glimpse at how the technology rolls back when modern resources are not available. People made do, and seemed to be leading relatively happy lives.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c5995408996644294486 title="comment permalink">9/10/15, 2:08 PM</a><br><br>

Dad (Endel Karmo, 1912-1991; initially trained at Tartu University, Estonia, at Raadi Experimental Station) was from his March 1948 arrival in Nova Scotia until his retirement heavily involved with the provincial government's apiculture outreach. He served for most of this period as provincial apiarist. I should now perhaps try, for the most part in Dad's memory, to make a few amateurish comments on your situation. <br><br>(1) Innovative hive designs, such as you have documented on your own blog and adverted to here on the JMG "ADR" blog, are of interest. North American practice has for decades standardized on Langstroth, with standardized factory-made comb foundation. A competitor of Langstroth is Warré, in which the bees are provided not with foundation in frames but with mere top bars (from which they themselves construct dangling hexagon-cell comb, following their own architectural whims without guidance from the mathematically uniform hexagonal-tiling pattern impressed on the comb foundation sheet at the factory). It occurs to me that in your circumstances, you might contemplate an experiment - supply the bees with some Langstroth-style frames, but only partially fill the hive; and then add some top bars in the spirit of Warré. It would be interesting to see which of the two proffered alternatives your bees then prefer. <br><br>It is true that Warré makes it impossible to use a centrifugal extractor, in which standard-sized frames are placed into a whirling rack. But your operation is small, and you are quite likely already resigned to the prospect of pre-industrial extraction methods, should you get a honey crop (for example, to the prospect of grinding up your late-autumn comb over a wire mesh and letting the honey trickle through into a collection vessel).<br><br>Warré has one small commercial advantage, in that it provides a yield of light-coloured wax every autumn. In Langstroth, by contrast, combs get re-used, as the whirling centrifuge empties out the cells from autumn to autumn. What one finally gets under Langstroth is years-old broken-down combs, with the wax now an unattractive brown. I notice that in Ontario, wax commands a high price in those silly stores where the affluent buy "organic food" and "natural products" - a modest block of wax, with a mass of perhaps 500 grams, in none too good a colour, already commanding at retail something around 5.00 EUR or 7.00 EUR. ////posting continued////<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c7650665237941791094 title="comment permalink">9/10/15, 2:27 PM</a><br><br>

I have found it easy to buy from now-defunct Toronto retailer "EfstonScience" an immersion thermometer, for around 8.00 EUR, which attains the for-your-purposes sufficient accuracy of plusminus 1oC. Melbourne may have some retailer similar to EfstonScience. Alternatively, normal school-laboratory supply houses will sell this item. A thermometer port might be a hole one centimetre or so in diameter, normally stoppered in some waterproof manner. If the thermometer port was in the roof rather than in a side wall, one even could lower the thermometer bulb to various heights above the hive floor, and thereby get some sense of the vertical temperature gradient. <br><br>The whole topic of beekeeping in a cruelly hot climate, such as in the State of Victoria, as opposed to a cruelly variable-and-cool climate, such as in Nova Scotia, is interesting, and to me novel! :-) <br><br>This brings me to my final point: <br><br>(3) If thermometer inserted into temperature port indicates dangerous temp (and in the State of Victoria this might happen, as I imagine it, even when hive is kept at all times in deep shade), then SOME relief might potentially be had by splashing water on outside of hive, or (better?) wrapping hive in burlap wick, with lower end of burlap in a water bath. Even if the water is at a terrible 40oC, equal to terrible air temp of 40oC, there will be some cooling effect, since the water will absorb heat from the hive in evaporating. It is an advantage that the State of Victoria, as I well remember from my years at Monash Uni, tends to combine 40oC heat with low humidity, thereby rendering evaporation efficient. In Africa, dry heat is used to great effect in evaporation cooling (as one sees from Googling under ((STRING)) ceramic refrigerator evaporative cooling ((/STRING)) ). <br><br><br>Hastily, cheerfully, <br>trying to be constructive here while having only really helped Dad<br>with autumnal honey-extraction operations, <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo, near Toronto<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c4465421140539904528 title="comment permalink">9/10/15, 2:44 PM</a><br><br>

You bet there's a difference in social status, which is reflected in the way they address each other. That's true in every human society, and indeed in every group of social primates -- watch the way baboons of different status interact sometime, and you'll see exactly the same thing expressed in nonverbal form. <br><br>Colin, three-masted schooners are extremely common -- type those words into your favorite search engine and see what you get -- and in particular, they were the most common cargo vessels on the Great Lakes during the late 19th century. As far as "from stem to stern," that's become an American idiom; I've heard it from people who have no idea it refers to ships. <br><br>Gjh42, no confusion at all -- it's just that politics are a bit different. In both republics, there's an elected presidency and quite a few parties in the legislature, and so the first job of any president-elect is to put together a legislative coalition that will enable him or her to get policies enacted. <br><br>MigrantWorker, there's doubtless some of that, but it cuts both ways -- there are things the Lakeland Republic produces that aren't available in the Atlantic Republic, and have been smuggled across the border all along in various ways. <br><br>Brian, I'm not at all sure about Missouri and Kansas -- it's possible that they're a republic of their own. I'd welcome comments from residents! As for paper, industrial hemp is a major crop in the Lakeland Republic, and that makes excellent paper as well as cloth and cordage. And the bridges -- why, yes, there are more bridges in 2065 than today; between the streetcar system, the railroads, and the fact that it's the capital of a nation and thus has attracted more population than before, Toledo's quite the happening town. <br><br>Ed, I don't greatly dislike bicycles; I had one when I was a kid, and enjoyed it. My irritation isn't with bicycles but with some of their riders, and more particularly with the people who come rushing in, whenever I write fiction, to insist that there have to bicycles in it. I'm quite certain that when my Lovecraftian fantasy gets published, I'll field hate mail because Nyarlathotep doesn't toddle around on a bike! <br><br>Seb, it's a little of both. Carr's comments about the clothes are that they remind him of history vids -- he's not a specialist in antique clothing, so would miss a lot of small variations -- but as will be explained further on, there's a definite and very conscious orientation toward retro culture. As for puns, I didn't intend that one, but yes, it's funny. <br><br>Nate, with regard to Mr. Carr, stay tuned! ;-) As for cyberpunk, good. Yes, in fact, I've modeled the Atlantic Republic on the sort of generic future you get in so much mediocre SF these days, lots of poverty, a small rich elite, armed guards, etc. -- though even there, it hasn't quite worked out the way the conventional wisdom would have it. (I didn't like cyberpunk, btw, because when it first started coming out I was living in Seattle, and I was already surrounded by, and bored to death with, the sort of hacker-and-slacker culture the cyberpunk authors lionized.) <br><br>Spanish Fly, 2049 (the year of the Brazilian-Confederate invasion) is rather a long time from now, and conditions have changed considerably. In this future history, Brazil went through a decade or so of turmoil and then came out the other side as a major regional power. The Brazilian-Confederate alliance is the most important power bloc in the western hemisphere in 2065. <br><br>DiSc, fair enough. I learned a long time ago, though, that -- well, how does the song go? "You can't please everyone so you got to please yourself."

Of course it presupposes that folks would willingly not adopt the attitude of least effort, but instead choose to maintain, care for, and use at their own pain, the technology of the printing press on a small scale.<br>That implies a very different set of values on their society from what you USA folks must be used to.<br>There could be a lot of local amateur radio, but Mr Carr's veepad is not programmed to catch the right frequencies...<br>- regarding the veepad, the answer may be that hard disk storage with enough miniaturization has become too expensive to embed into veepads, more expensive than the enrgy required to fuel all the airwaves traffic.<br>Of course, it supposes the use of data centers, which might be more expensive overall than having dedicated disk storage on every (less miniaturized) device.

To comply with the philosophy pervading the fiction, my guess is a sort of warfare akin to what Iran has built up, as explained in the latest instalment of the War College podcast :<br>That "Defense In Depht" strategy in particular reminded me of the spirit of the Lakeland Republic, since it shares with Iran the context of a broken up region with embargoes and geopolitical split-ups :<br>http://blogs.reuters.com/war-college/2015/09/10/podcast-just-how-strong-is-irans-military/<br>An entertaining spy story functionning within such a framework would represent a challenge to write in itself !<br><br>@Spanish Fly :<br>As John is usually fond of saying - and he might be an exception in millions of the USA - the last thing the world needs is another clueless American sentencing uninformed statements about the rest of the world's affairs.<br>However, in the context of the USA, which has a LOT of geographical space and "gaps", sponsored immigration would be a good way to ensure a smooth settlement of people, since they would find land available, and existing communities to bind to, when they arrive.<br>As for Europe, I also live there, and I really don't know.

The flaw in your argument, of course, is that it's always easy to insist that the internet would be perfect if it didn't have to deal with human beings -- but if the whole point of the technology is to meet human needs, and it consistently fails to do so in predictable ways, blaming that on human "idiots" (that is to say, people who don't conform to the expectations of technology) is simply a dodge.<br><br>Gwyn, nah, the fad for computers passed off years ago. How many young men do you know today who spend all day tinkering with their hot rods? <br><br>Mister R., yes, we will indeed get to that.

That's already been worked out; down the road a bit we'll be accompanying Mr. Carr to the annual Drone Shoot, which should be quite a lively spectacle. <br><br>Martin, every horsedrawn vehicle I've ridden in (and that's a two digit number, btw) had a neat little leather contraption behind the horse that caught the manure on the way out and kept it off the street. Those are standard in the Lakeland Republic. As for the toilets, why, yes, human manure is just as good a methane source as the equine product, and there's more of it, so toilets have been designed with that in mind. (They also divert urine, which is much in demand as fertilizer.) <br><br>Cherokee, one of the basic constraints of this future is that the republics of the former US are all having to deal with the economic consequences of today's moronic US policies, and so an invasion of the Lakeland Republic pretty much had to be backed by a foreign power. I chose Brazil because despite its current troubles, it's got the potential to be a dominant regional power, and because it has longstanding historical links with the American South, due among other things to the migration of Confederate refugees there after the Civil War. <br><br>Weedananda, I haven't decided how much of the narrative will be appearing here, but you'll notice this isn't just a schematic scenario like "How It Could Happen." I may be posting the whole thing over the next year or so, interspersed with nonfiction essays. <br><br>Patricia, hey, I never said history was fair. Nor, of course, is Texas. ;-)<br><br>Raven, the invasion was sixteen years back and the civil war more than thirty.

Do you know who can refer to the current President by her first name only, when speaking to officials of a different government on official business, without it being thought peculiar? Practically nobody, that's who. Even close associates like cabinet members who could call her "Ellen" in person in a private meeting wouldn't refer to her that way when speaking in public, or to officials of another government. Former Presidents can first-name other former Presidents, but not sitting Presidents. (Etiquette could have changed, of course.)<br><br>There's been no elaborate secrecy (such as passwords or disguises) but clearly the visit hasn't been announced publicly either. Otherwise no matter who Carr is, reporters for those Lakeland print and radio news outlets would have been there. There's no other security either. However, "Carr" might be an assumed name. That would at least be prudent.<br><br>My best guess so far is that Carr has a close familial connection to President Montrose, and something like the same quasi-unofficial status that Presidential relatives have in the present day.

It ended too soon! I wonder if Mr. Carr even learned how to write...I'll be interested to hear how his hands cramp up with his note taking (hah!).<br><br>Regarding the term "schooner", I'm a little surprised that Mr. Carr even knows the term, never mind ID such a vessel, seeing as he's from an inland district (or perhaps he's a coastie or laker himself?). The word is often lumped in with other sailing vessel terms, like "ship", when each in fact has a specific meaning. "Schooner" is a fore and aft rigged vessel with two or more masts and are an indigenous American rig from early colonial days; three masters (or "tern schooners" as the Nova Scotians would call them) did indeed become a standard type on the Lakes, the Gulf and both coasts of North America starting in the 1850s. By the early 20th century, size and economics increased the size of the vessels and number of masts. Four, five and even six masters were built (and one seven master). Somewhat ironically, the larger the vessels, the more they relied on steam "donkey" engines to raise sails and anchors, as well as tugs to get into and from port: steam made really big sailing vessels possible. Three masted schooners were an ideal type: with a balance between cargo capacity and the ability to operate with minimum crews, say eight men.<br><br>"Ship" is a three masted vessel, but with yards crossing each of the masts. They need larger crews and are better suited to long oceanic passages. Big square riggers also took advantage of steam and operated well into the 20th century as well, albeit in limited markets.<br><br>In terms of mast trees; "built" masts made of many sections and layers bolted together and bound with iron hoops were common by the 19th century. In the US, the opening of western North America to exploitation allowed the export of huge Douglas firs to shipyards in Maine, of all places. Even before the Civil War Maine shipyards were importing much of their timber for shipbuilding purposes.<br><br>By the way, my wife has a journal that belonged to her great great great grandfather detailing his journey by stage and "the cars" from Boston to Bangor, ME in the early 1840's.

It is a thought that fills me with dread. With no resources (land, property, money) to my name, a barely fledged career, and enough youth to see a good chunk of this process play out, I am increasingly anxious about my future.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c8749659554958144233 title="comment permalink">9/10/15, 6:05 PM</a><br><br>

More importantly, it has an on-line "adoption" program for stray slide-rules that come their way, and the prices are very reasonable. The cheapest I saw was just $2, with most in the $5 to $20 range.

There are plenty of things I don't work out in advance -- I start writing, and things happen. I didn't expect Fred Vanich at all, for example.<br><br>Troy, Partition wasn't imposed from outside. After Washington DC fell and the Second Civil War ended, the various insurgent factions tried to put together a new national government and couldn't find enough common ground. A negotiated breakup brokered by a couple of the foreign powers that supported the rebel side was the outcome. The UN peacekeeping troops came in to guarantee the newly established borders and get all sides to stand down to a peacetime military. As for the Confederacy, based on my conversations with Southerners, even today that'd be more likely to provide a coherent national identity for the South than anything else. <br><br>Thomas, I'm not sure how many times I have to say "one to three hundred years" before people finally listen...<br><br>Toomas, excellent! Carr will be visiting a newsstant shortly, so we'll get a glimpse of the magazines -- yes, there are lots of them, as well as a bumper crop of daily and weekly newspapers. You can get the contents of foreign news websites in Toledo and other Lakeland cities, by the way -- they're printed daily or weekly on newsprint, even though the stories tend to be few, short, and dumbed down compared to the real newspapers. (I wonder how many of my readers have sat down and contrasted any of today's news websites with a real newspaper, especially one from the pre-internet era; the latter quite simply have much more information than the former, both in terms of article count and in terms of details per story.) <br><br>As for clothing, that's a complex question for cultural reasons. Stay tuned...<br><br>Wisdomchaser, I'm writing as fast as I can! ;-)<br><br>Patricia O., if I were still living on the left coast I'd be doing that, no question. The current stock market crash is no more a barrier to a China-centric global system fifty years from now than the stock market crash of 1929 kept the US from becoming a world power thereafter. <br><br>Patricia M., don't assume that older technology requires older social mores and gender roles. That sort of technological determinism is very popular these days, and I plan on having fun with readers' expectations along those lines!<br><br>Nastarana, heh heh heh...<br><br>Pygmycory, I'm basing Carr's technodependence on people I've met who belong to the well-to-do end of the geekoisie, and who I suspect can't wipe their own nose without a smartphone app to do it for them. You're fortunate not to belong to that class. <br><br>RPC, heh heh heh...<br><br>Glenn, I suspect it's a mix nationwide, but the ones in Toledo are electric, with the broomstick going to an overhead wire.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c7526149511220418387 title="comment permalink">9/10/15, 8:56 PM</a><br><br>

There used to be streetcars and an interurban, and it was easy to get around; now there's a poorly funded bus system with very few routes and runs, and it's not. Progress, right? <br><br>Clay, funny! I'd come up with exactly that scenario to use in case the bike fans kept harassing me about having bikes all over the Lakeland Republic. Since they seem to have backed down, I shall relent, and allow a few bikes here and there, where they actually make practical and technological sense. <br><br>S. Treimel, I tend to think that a civil war, the collapse of the United States, a massive economic crisis, and then a thirty-year interval of closed borders and international embargo will explain a lot of social change! There's more, as it happens; it's been an eventful half century, and some of the events were pretty traumatic. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Patricia, nope. She's an executive assistant in the Office of the Presidency of the Lakeland Republic, reporting directly to President Meeker's chief of staff. Her parents were midlevel business executives before the Second Civil War; her mother and her two older siblings were killed in a Federal air strike on Indianapolis, and her father never got over it and drank himself to death six years after Partition. Since the Lakeland Republic's a relatively new nation and a lot of the former corporate and government elite class didn't survive the Second Civil War and its aftermath -- we'll get to that -- status relationships haven't fossilized to the extent they have, for instance, in the US today. <br><br>Ing, nice! I didn't think of that, but there may be a Freudian slip there. ;-)<br><br>Shane, I'm still discovering things. Other than the fact that the Confederacy has a constitution based closely on the one from 1861, a close alliance with Brazil, and wanted its border with the Lakeland Republic adjusted north to the Ohio River, I don't know a great deal about it yet. <br><br>Iuval, I like surprises. I've actually discussed most of the things we'll see in the Lakeland Republic in previous blog posts, but a utopian novel is a much more effective way to communicate them. <br><br>Robert, interesting. I'll have to look into the history of pens a bit, and figure out just how difficult it will be for Carr to adapt to local writing technology!<br><br>Joe, exactly -- especially if many of those changes amount to reversing the changes of the last fifty years...<br><br>Ozark, yes, someone else pointed that out too. Do you think it would be more likely to go with the Confederacy or to pursue independence, perhaps with Kansas? <br><br>Beneath, somehow I don't think you'll be disappointed.

Remember that by 2049, the Lakeland Republic has been independent for twenty years and a lot of malign neglect inflicted on the Midwest by a coast-centric society and an imperial tribute economy has been undone. As for your situation, may I recommend learning some useful skills, of the kind that produce goods and services people will need or want badly even in hard times? In other eras of chaos, that's been a good way to stay fed, housed, etc. <br><br>Donald, I suspect they'll have some niche markets, but in a nation that's been isolated from the global economy for thirty years and has no domestic sources of steel (and a lot better uses for farmland than Russian dandelion for rubber), yeah, my guess is they're not very common. <br><br>Peakfuture, good. Here are some more details. The Lakeland Republic also includes Kentucky and most of West Virginia, leaving out the eastern panhandle. That, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and the cratered salt marsh that used to be Washington DC are all the Atlantic Republic. New England from Connecticut and Rhode Island north to Maine, plus the Maritime Provinces of Canada, are the Republic of New England and the Maritimes. The old Confederacy minus Texas is the Confederate States of America. I'm still not sure which way Missouri and Kansas went, and Arizona and Nevada are basically abandoned zones -- I think Texas claims Arizona and California claims Nevada, but it's like those borders in the middle of the Arablan Peninsula that nobody's ever bothered to survey because it's too hot and dry to support life. <br><br>Abdinarg, heh heh heh...<br><br>Lathechuck, I knew about the museum, but not about the adoption program.

I have been reading here for a while, and now that the saga of Mr Carr and the Lakeland Republic is unfolding, I will definitely continue reading! <br><br>That being outta the way -- here are some guesses and questions that I have been thinking of, about the electrical and electronic technology. <br><br>The streetcars run on electricity. There is presumably electrical lighting in the station building, maybe for electrical refrigeration? The importance of methane seems to suggest that there would be likely wide spread use of gas for cooking and heating. <br><br>The people still listen to the radio for information, maybe also for entertainment? Now, that makes me speculate on how the transmitters and receivers are constructed and what kinds of signal modulation is being used. I would make a guess at AM, since the receivers can be as simple as crystal sets.<br><br>I would not expect that the energy-intensive production of modern integrated circuits still be viable, but vacuum tubes and some kinds of transistors (alloyed ones for example) might remain likely. If there is industry there that is able to make light bulbs, then much of the technology needed for fabricating triodes, maybe even pentodes, is in place. <br><br>The presence of electric streetcars suggests that rotating machinery is possible with the techology of the day, and thus it might not be surprising if some of the radio-transmitters also had the carrier wave generated with a motor-generator combination, with the modulation done via controlling the magnetic field of the rotor with the incoming audio signal. However, some sort of amplification from the microphones that the radio announcers talk into will still be necessary.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c664370826895685355 title="comment permalink">9/11/15, 3:53 AM</a><br><br>

You have shared some fascinating and insightful thoughts and experiences.<br><br>Of course you are correct about the uniform cell size and it is not the bees preference at all as can be seen from a sampling of cells that they themselves draw out, but it is merely a reflection of our industrial capacity. I was fully intending to place the top part of a frame into the box with some melted wax foundation (as a starter) on the downward facing side and simply watch what the bees do with that. Hopefully, if all goes well, they will draw their own cell preferences from that point downwards. A truly excellent idea of yours too! The top bar bee hive people also follow this practice, but they have much difficulty in getting a purchased colony into a top bar hive in the first place because the standard commercial frames simply don't fit the top bar hives - thus I've reached for some middle ground.<br><br>Yes, the wax does get much darker as the years progress in my existing hives too and I will observe that process over time to see what happens with the new bee hive. Some bees are allocated to house cleaning duties, so it will be interesting to see exactly what they can achieve if given excellent conditions.<br><br>The thermometer is an outstanding idea which never would have occurred to me. Thanks for the excellent suggestion. I remember reading that the bees maintain the internal hive temperature to 35'C (I may be wrong in this belief and someone please correct me if so) and that is perhaps why the species are such a prolific harvester of pollen and nectar in the first place. Now that the hives are in the complete shade here they handle the 40'C+ summer days well - as long as they have access to water.<br><br>The interesting thing is that most standard bee books were written for cool to cold climates and not one of them mentioned the effect of extreme summer temperatures on the hives. The top bar hive people took many of their design ideas from African honey bee systems so they all mentioned the effect of extreme summer weather. I strongly suspect that the bees have a hard time in cool to cold climates when humans poke around too much in the hives - letting the heat out - and also over extracting their winter food stores.<br><br>You were very lucky even to have had that experience!<br><br>Cheers and thank you for the thoughtful response.<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c491884375437896675 title="comment permalink">9/11/15, 4:55 AM</a><br><br>

Thanks for the great vision - looking forward to more.<br><br>I wanted to put in my two-cents about handwriting as I have been teaching it in schools for the past four decades as an occupational therapist. At the start of my career I refused to teach this subject unless students were physically, cognitively or visually-perceptually challenged. Like most of my colleagues I felt that handwriting was an academic subject not part of the therapeutic support for children mandated by federal law IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act). Now we teach it whenever we get the chance and many OTs have developed excellent handwriting curriculums.<br><br>AS a result of my front row seat on handwriting let me tell you that handwriting hasn't really been taught in schools for most of the time I have worked in them. It is demonstrated at ever younger ages so that now, what passes for handwriting instruction, is given primarily in preschool &amp; kindergarten, which works for the roughly 15-30% of students who have better than average fine-motor skills for this age group of 3-5 year olds (few of them boys). As unstuctured outdoor recess has become a relic of by-gone days in education - few students have the opportunity to build the pre-requisite gross motor skills (core-strength, bilateral coordination, visual-motor coordination) that support learning fine-motor skills. This has made it harder and harder for the majority of students to learn handwriting - let alone sit still and listen to the other subjects being taught.<br><br>Kindergarten students are expected to be able to write full sentences in upper and lower case letters at the beginning of the school year. No help (aside from that provided by special education) is given beyond this point. Each letter and number is a motor sequence, therefore it requires practice and repetition to develop the concious to unconcious neural pathways necessary for quick, accurate (i.e. legible) performance. Most occupational therapists, pediatricians, psychologists and others who study human development will agree that the ability to learn and develop the fine-motor skills for legible handwriting naturally develop between 4-8 years of age. This means that roughly 50% of students mature enough to learn these skills, well after they are demonstrated (not taught by repetition) in preschool. This has been great for job opportunities in special ed, but very bad for children and literacy.<br><br>When I hear people lament cursive I laugh. We will be lucky to survive into another generation preserving printing. I'm happy to hear that literacy has survived in the Lakeland Republic!<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c7818808623056468854 title="comment permalink">9/11/15, 5:37 AM</a><br><br>

As the child became fluent, we modeled ever more refined motions. <br><br>Sandpaper cursive letters on wooden plaques were traced with forefinger and middle finger, while saying the sound the letter made, and eventually used to form words cuh, ahh, tih…cat. Only after much practice with these and other “works” did the pencil on paper writing begin. We made place cards with the child’s name in cursive to be used to reserve space at the snack table for two, and we would often take the time to trace over the name.<br> <br>Most every child could write legible cursive by the age of 4-5, and were writing self-created stories (some with illustrations) and letters. Because the training went from large motor to fine motor skills at the child’s pace, it was seamless.<br> <br>I believe it is the smooth, continuous motion of cursive writing that is what makes for easier learning…printing means picking your pencil tip up and re-registering it for the next section of the letter…not fluid at all. Easy, however, later when fine motor skills are honed. Then even calligraphy is within reach, with practice. (But only if the child is burning to learn that skill.)<br><br>My favorite teacher in elementary school was Mrs. Gagen, sixth grade, who not only had us practicing our palmer method daily, but teaching geography in such an interesting way that by mid-year, we were sent up to the board at the front of the room to “draw an outline of France (my favorite, but any country or state was fair game) then make a star and label the capitol city...and so on” We were all able to do this by that point in the year, and we absolutely loved it (and Mrs. G!).<br><br>Well, you can easily see what one of my pet peeves might be!<br><br>Peace,<br><br>Gail<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c553209902088928370 title="comment permalink">9/11/15, 2:11 PM</a><br><br>

It's hard to say in a state that can't even agree on how to pronounce its name, and I could see different possibilities. There are some who would rather go with the Confederacy, but I suspect that just like in the 1860s, not enough to make that happen. The two big cities in Missouri are right on state borders, and I'd think St. Louis would rather be with Lakeland, but the rest of the state wouldn't let that happen. As far as cities go, Kansas City is held in higher regard in much of the rest of the state than St. Louis, and the western part of the state does have strong connections to Kansas, so it seems pretty likely that Missouri and Kansas would go the same way. I'd think it would be challenging for just Missouri and Kansas to be on their own surrounded by more populous countries, although if Chicago can make it on its own surrounded by Lakeland and dependent on importing most of it's calories (I'd assume that's be the case unless it's population was a lot lower than today and it's borders included some Farm country), Missouri/Kansas may be able to work too.<br><br>Something that surprises me is that Minnesota isn't in Lakeland, I'd suspect that they would go with the other lakes states. I could see Iowa going that way too, although it would be more of a wild card.<br><br>While I can imagine most of Arizona and Nevada being uninhabited, I'd think there would still some people living in certain spots, particularly around Arizona's Mogollon Rim. Flagstaff currently gets more annual precipitation than San Francisco, Denver, Salt Lake City, Boise or Albuquerque, and from more different sources distributed across more of the year than many of those cities as well. I'd imagine many other places in the west that would turn to extreme desert before Flagstaff. I'd imagine the warbands would have authority over an area such as that, however, even if technically part of a republic.<br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c5194164216343982429 title="comment permalink">9/11/15, 3:33 PM</a><br><br>

You can make a beutiful and functional nib-holder from almost any sort of hard wood or bone. I have a lovely old one carved from bone that once belonged to my great-grandmother; it's probably about a century old now, and still works perfectly. But you don't even have to go that route.

Cursive styles of writing arose several times independently of one another at different points within the history of different writing systems, and even within the history of Latin-alphabet writing. But always non-cursive writing continues in use alongside of cursive styles, for it, too, is better for some purposes. I like very much what Gail (peacegarden) posted about cursive.<br><br>Teaching reading (in a child's native language) is relatively easy, even in English where the relations between sounds are letters are complex. Before they ever started kindergarten, we would read to them from the small Peanuts cartoon books (the ones about 3" high x 6" wide), which they loved. With our older child, a little bribery was necessary at first to get him to go through the process of trying out possible pronunciations of a written word until he found the one that suited the context -- one potato chip for every ten words successfully identified and pronounced. (He loved potato chips, but hardly ever got them outside of this exercise.) The younger one, however, when he saw the older one reading on his own, just sat down and watched him do it, and within a month or two had figured out by himself how to turn the letters into meaningful speech, which also fit the cartoon.<br><br>Even English, notorious among European languages for its complex realtions between pronunciation and spelling, if fundamentally rule-governed, and the rules can be learned even by a child before he is old enough for kindergarten. Most consonants and consonant digraphs (strings of two consonants that have their own rules, like "th" or "sh" or "dg") have one pronunciation, and the others generally no more than two pronunciations; and the surrounding vowels go a long way to showing which of the two is the right one. With vowels, one has to distinguish between simple vowels and vowel digraphs (like "ea" or "oo" or "ie"), but each of them has only two common pronunciations (in a few cases, only one), and often the spelling of the next-door consonants indicate which one is right for that word. (I already knew what these rules are before we had children.) I didn't have to spend much time teaching them directly to our children; contrasting examples were easy to find, even in "Peanuts."<br><br>Note that the focus here is on reading aloud correctly, going from writing to speech in the child's native language. Thus our children could easily check their own conclusions about how the writing in "Peanuts" sounded against their own native speech (as well as the drawings).<br><br>The reverse task, turning spoken English into written English with correct spelling, is much harder: here the child has no *independent* way (at first) to know if his result is right. But the more he reads carefully and slowly, the more spellings of words he remembers seeing before. Eventually he unconsciously internalizes many of the rules that govern English spelling.<br><br>The important thing, I thought, was always to show the child why he had gotten a word or sentence right, and how to tell by himself whether he had done so. "It's right because I say or," or "because that's just the way it is" is pure poison, I think, to a child's learning: that rssponse paints a part of his world as a thing that he can't ever hope to make sense of, no matter how hard he tries. That way lies childhood despair, and eventually the child just gives up ...<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c5752706822129360352 title="comment permalink">9/11/15, 6:49 PM</a><br><br>

I mean that quite seriously; the concept of noblesse oblige never got a foothold here, and a great many privileged Americans assume that if somebody's poor, it's their own fault and they should be maltreated accordingly. So Earl the cab driver isn't having to get used to a novel concept of hierarchy; if he was born in the former US, he grew up with it, and his response to Ms. Berger will be conditioned by the fact that she addresses him with some degree of courtesy and doesn't yell at him because he isn't fast enough to take Carr's suitcase or what have you. <br><br>DiSc, duly noted! I'll be weaving in some essays as well -- I've considered, in fact, going to alternate weeks once I've got the first burst of the narrative under way. <br><br>Spanish Fly, I suppose everyone likes the climate they grew up with. I'm not very familiar with the Spanish climate, but I suspect I'd like it much better than the equatorial Brazilian climate. <br><br>Ian, my take is that it really is more a matter of what's most useful, given very limited resources and a definite habit of decentralizing technology. More as we proceed!<br><br>Ashtead, there are modest amounts of electricity available, and quite a range of basic electronics -- I have a ham radio license and so have had the chance to look into what kind of electronics would be viable on a relatively low-tech basis. The answer is quite a surprisingly large amount -- a radio transceiver, for example, would have been well within the capacity of your ordinarily enterprising medieval European or Chinese alchemist, if they'd known the theory involved. (I've wondered more than once, in fact, if some of the symbolism of alchemy could be pointing to the use of electricity in various applications.) We'll be getting into this in some detail as the narrative proceeds. <br><br>Peakfuture, excellent. I'm still not quite sure what to do about Missouri, but there's one detail possibly worth including that's been left out: the Free City of Chicago, which is just the northeast corner of Illinois and is an independent country in its own right. <br><br>Cherokee, that's always been my response to the people who insist that of course we'll have computers in a deindustrial world; if they want to build one from raw materials, in their basement, with hand tools, I'll believe it. As for Lakeland eighth-graders, Carr will be visiting two schools that I'm sure of, and what he finds there will get me pilloried by quite a few people in the education industry!<br><br>Susan, that's fascinating. I had a horrible time with cursive writing in my childhood, being left-handed and with the motor coordination problems that so often accompany Aspergers syndrome; as a compensation I learned to print clearly and neatly, and that's the way I write by hand to this day (and I do a fair amount of that, and not just to keep my hand in). Maybe I'd have had an easier time of it if my teachers had used some of your methods!<br><br>Martin, no need for the Pony Express. Mail in 18th century London was delivered <a href=http://www.georgianindex.net/R_mail/London/London_Mail.html rel=nofollow>six times a day</a>, for example.

To a much greater extent than is often realized, we choose our goals because they fit the means we want to use. As for the supernatural, well, since every single human society known to have existed around the world and throughout time has believed in what today's science dismisses as "supernatural," why, yes, I tend to think they will. <br><br>Myriad, good!

Heh heh heh...<br><br>Michelle, the US education industry (I think it deserves that label) is in an advanced state of decomposition, having choked to death some time ago on a sticky mix of legislative idiocy and excess technology. You probably need to assume that the school will not educate your daughter in any way that matters, and take on that job yourself. <br><br>Myosotis, my wife has knitting needles and crochet hooks from used-junk stores that were probably in use for a half century or longer by the time she got them, judging by when the brands stopped being made, and they're still going strong, so I suspect you're quite right. <br><br>Unknown Clergyman, that sounds like a good idea -- I'd like to see it applied to other hands-on technology!<br><br>RPC, funny.

I do tend to pay attention to feedback -- that's one of the virtues of posting first drafts here -- but not always in a straightforward way. It's mostly a matter of details; I have, for example, the entire story arc of this narrative already worked out, I know the important characters and events and how it's all going to turn out, and I've also worked out a lot of individual scenes. It's the little details that sometimes find their way in. <br><br>Aron, thanks for that.

As for Scotland, in my fictive 2065 it's an independent nation with its own military, and like the Irish, its soldiers see a lot of service in peacekeeping duties. <br><br>Ozark, thanks for this. As for Arizona et al., oh, granted, there are little pockets of population here and there, and also in Nevada -- just not enough to maintain any kind of coherent government, public order, etc. <br><br>Auriel/Jim, because the US is set up as a federation of notionally self-governing states, it's easiest to splinter along state lines. You'll notice that a couple of states, Idaho and West Virginia, got cut in half; doubtless over the centuries ahead, the borders will morph further. Still, it's worth remembering that the border between England and Scotland still runs pretty close to where the Romans established it in the first century CE!<br><br>Whomever, a lot of the Great Plains are probably pretty desolate by 2065, given ongoing climate change.

I expect that the Colorado River watershed areas will still have significant water and the lower watershed (below Lake Mead) will still be able to support some agriculture (under the aegis of perhaps Mexico or a warlord?). IIRC, the distributary aqueducts (at least for Coachella and Imperial Valleys) are gravity feed. In addition, the region gets periodic cyclones dumping lots of water. Further, I expect that Las Vegas, Phoenix, Tucson will be sources of salvage materials that could be stripped and shipped as part of maybe China’s (?) imperial wealth pump. Maybe Ports of LA/Long Beach become fully export facilities. Though, I know you’ve indicated that California will be a terrible mess of a failed state.

Next you'll be bringing up Rabelais and Chaucer!<br><br>Okay, I thought I was joking, but if that "good" implies <i>The Music Man</i> really <i>was</i> an influence (however minor) on <i>Retrotopia</i>, then... well, that makes a lot of sense, actually. Literary influence often comes in at odd angles. And mid-20th-century Americana (often referencing times a few decades earlier) is a rich resource for deindustrial fiction; all the more so when retro is the theme.<br><br>In this context, parts of "Rock Island" (the salesmen's song/chant on the train at the opening of <i>The Music Man</i>) become evocative in a new way. ("Gone, gone. Gone with the hogshead, cask, and demijohn, gone with the sugar barrel, pickle barrel, milk pan, gone with the tub and the pail and the tierce.")<br><br>In any case, the most essential characteristic of Mr. Carr so far is that he most definitely does not know the territory!<br><br>Regarding the charms of penmanship and cursive... I hope everyone spares a thought for us southpaws! Even with ball-point pens, smearing the ink when writing left to right is a problem left-handed. Real wet ink will just make a nasty mess. Avoidable by keeping the entire hand off the paper, but that makes for less stability when "neatness" is being graded. (And how long can you hold your entire arm an inch above a desk? Not for the duration of a school day, I'd wager.)<br><br>If I had to go back to using an ink pen, I'd resort to Leonardo da Vinci's solution and write backwards. It's not as hard as it sounds. (I thought I'd have to start over from scratch to learn it, but it turns out it's possible to do a sort of mental global reverse of all the left-and-right movements of handwriting, and get right into it.) All those biographers who think the reason for Leonardo's "mirror writing" is a big mystery have never tried to write left-handed with a quill and slow-drying ink. The only real drawback is that it's harder to learn to read it than to learn to write it. One can always use a mirror but it's not convenient to do so while in the process of writing.<br><br>@peacegarden, thanks! <br><br>@Patricia, that's a point.

I have just been rereading a tract by the science fiction author Robert Heinlein deploring the rapid decline of education in his own lifetime which he noted and recorded - and this was from an article that was written some forty years ago. If the technology in the Republic has reverted to a more sustainable level from an earlier era, then perhaps educational standards there have also reverted to that of an earlier era. <br> On the face of it it sounds like I am talking about a hick education good only for raising bumpkins.

Since I moved here as an adult, I don't know much of the Civil War history, but what little I know of it suggests things were in quite a muddle. Further, the Ozarks are a region unto themselves. Here are my thoughts on the situation in 2065.<br><br>The Bootheel (the southeastern corner of the state) is Confederate, no question. They grow rice and cotton there now and will likely be doing so in 2065. Plus ecologically it is part of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain which extends into the states to the south of them, and I think culturally it is much closer to the South than the rest of the state.<br><br>The Ozarks are, well, the Ozarks. Until quite late into the 20th century they were sparsely populated because the land is rocky, with thin soil, and thus difficult to farm. During the 21st century civil wars some folks fled to the Ozarks to escape the fighting. It was a harsh life and few made it, but those who banded together managed to scrape by - and with a jaundiced view of all sides, hence their current view of themselves as Ozarkians first and foremost. The Confederacy would really like to have the Ozarks, mostly for the oak and hickory trees, but they find it hard to get and stay in as most of the roads have disintegrated, making the Ozarks as remote as it was in the 1800s and early 1900s. There is some trade around the periphery, a degree of smuggling (the Ozarkians are poor and need the income), and occasionally an outbreak of active fighting when the Confederacy tries yet again to secure the region for itself, generally put down pretty quickly by the Ozarkians.<br><br>Meanwhile, Missouri north of the Ozarks and probably all of Kansas are part of the republic that includes the Dakotas, Nebraska, Iowa, etc. in my view. Like Ozark, I don't think they can make it on their own, especially since it'll be hotter and drier than now, thus harder to keep the agriculture they'll need going. They share more of a cultural and ecological similarity with these states than they do with the states to the east, and the Mississippi River is a bigger barrier then than it is now (and it's not a small one now). They trade with the LR for agricultural goods like grain, probably supplying meat in return; I'd guess most of outstate Missouri and all of Kansas is ranching cattle or buffalo (northwest Missouri is ranch country now). As for their relations with the Ozarkians, I think this northern republic likes to have the Ozarks as a barrier between them and the Confederacy, plus the elites in St. Louis have summer homes on the northern flanks of the Ozarks to escape the summer heat. Thus they supply some discreet "aid" to the Ozarkians, in return for medicinal herbs that grow best in the still-forested lands of the Ozarks. Of course this riles the Confederacy no end, but by now the Ozarkians have gotten pretty good at playing off one side against the other.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c3628835171351484008 title="comment permalink">9/12/15, 8:59 AM</a><br><br>

If Missouri becomes independent (with or without Kansas) it won't be because of a strong identity but because not enough people liked the other options enough to align with them. So much after that would depend on what happened in the early, vulnerable years of the new nation. If the right things happened, a new identity could probably be forged during that time, location and climate wise it has potential.<br><br>However, I think there's quite a risk that wouldn't happen and the new nation wouldn't last until 2065. If things aren't going so well, absorption into the Confederacy could be a likely result, possibly just by electing a pro-Confederacy party, possibly through an invasion with a good deal of internal support. Just how much internal support may make the difference between a short war and a long one. Your description of the unsuccessful Kentucky invasion makes me think they'd probably have their eye on Missouri too.<br><br>I do wonder about the state of your Prairie Republic, I haven't heard a name for it yet, the one that is MN, IA, ND, SD, and NE. If they're doing OK, some may look to them if times are rough. I'm assuming that during Lakeland's 30 years of closed borders, Missourians don't know hardly anything of what's going on there. The ugliest possibility would be a Civil War with one side backed by the Confederacy and one by the Prairie Republic. I'd imagine the Prairie may have its own interest in controlling at least as far south as the Missouri River corridor for transportation reasons.<br><br>I can only hope that Missouri/Kansas could get its act together and avoid that fate, possibly making some of the same changes that Lakeland has but remaining more rough around the edges.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c5050077260511599752 title="comment permalink">9/12/15, 12:54 PM</a><br><br>

I'm guessing Quebec is independent and doing quite well (control of access to the great lakes, good port, plenty of Hydro power). One would figure BC could join the Cascadian Republic, Alberta the Rocky Mountain republic, and Manitoba/Saskatchewan the plains. But I'm guessing their ongoing resistance to the Great Migration of climate refugees north led to the Great Canadian Fence as well as a couple of unfortunate massacres by the RCMP, and they are still part of the Dominion of Canada, which as doing quite well as part of the (reduced) British Commonwealth, under King George VIII, along with the small part of Australia that's still inhabited (mostly with refugees from the Sunk Pacific Islands), the Polynesian Whenua of New Zealand et al. They are mostly a client state of China, but are having an ok time otherwise. Wonder what happens to Newfoundland? <br><br>The most interesting from the point of view of this story is Ontario, which obviously will engage in lots of trading with the Lakeland Republic one way or another.

As already noted in a comment above, there are little communities scattered here and there where there's enough water to permit human survival. It's just that the population is so thinly scattered that there's no government and no economic organization beyond the subsistence level. Partly that's the war in California, which has shredded transport links and makes shipping anything (including salvage) west all but impossible. (A trickle of salvage does go north through the Cascadian Republic.) <br><br>Latefall, thank you. "Horses vs. hobby horses" is a keeper!<br><br>Daelach, we'll get there in due time.

Not all parents are that far ahead of the curve. <br><br>Myriad, nah, my wife's a fan and caught the reference. As for pens, I know; I's left-handed and use the over-the-top grip for writing, but even so dip pens would be a nightmare for me. Fortunately typewriters are a mature technology -- see below. <br><br>Kevin, typewriters are indeed in common use in the Lakeland Republic. The first generally available typewriter went on the market in 1873, and typewriters that worked just like modern manual machines were available from 1895 on. Thus -- if I may mention something that will make absolutely no sense until later -- they're standard in third, fourth, and fifth-tier counties. More as we proceed!<br><br>Peakfuture, thank you! With the help of locals, I've figured out Missouri and Kansas. After a whole series of border disputes and a couple of failed attempts at an independent republic, the southeast third or so of Missouri (south of St. Louis and east of the Ozarks) went into the Confederacy, and the rest, along with Kansas, went into what had previously and somewhat awkwardly been known as the Missouri River Republic and now is simply the Missouri Republic, the prairie nation that includes the Dakotas, Minnesota and Iowa. That was the original subject of the negotiations that led to the Treaty of Richmond in 2062, though that ended up turning into a general settlement of issues left over from Partition. <br><br>Yupped, if the Rolling Stones are still touring in 2065 they'd pretty much have to have been replaced by robots!<br><br>Patricia M., Oregon's part of the Cascadian Republic so Klamath Falls isn't an enclave, it's a city in an independent nation, and the site of a large military base that keeps the war in California from spilling north. Topanga Canyon will be held by one of the various factions in the California war, but I'm not sure who occupies that bit of territory just at the moment. <br><br>SLClaire, many thanks for this info! As noted above, you've helped me settle the last outstanding detail of the map. <br><br>Patricia M., that's not an unreasonable reaction. I've felt it myself many times when I saw some privileged jerk maltreating restaurant waitstaff or clerks at a store. <br><br>Ozark, thanks for this!

One has to be a bit careful here. Coarse equipment, at a level historically achieved by 1912, comprising spark for (Morse code) transmitter and galena crystal (or indeed crude germanium diode?) for receiver could perhaps be made in the medieval European or Chinese atelier. But to use a properly TUNED circuit for transmission, one probably wants at least vacuum tubes, refined to a post-1912 level. Adequate tubes require a high vacuum, as became generally known a few years after 1912. A mere mechanical pump (what the vacuum professionals would call, a little dismissively, a "roughing pump") is useful only at the initial stage of pumping-down. The work is normally finished with a diffusion pump. Such a pump should no longer be considered medieval equipment. <br><br>I also have a small quibble about meters. Unless the radio work is very crude, one will want to be able to measure currents and voltages, as a step to measuring impedances and capacitances. Here a d'Arsonval movement, comprising a coil of fine wire, on a jewel pivot such as is found in a good-quality mechanical watch, is handy. Fine wire, and jewel pivots, are again a bit outside the ambit of a medieval atelier, though they count as less sophisticated than the diffusion pump. <br><br><br>Hastily,<br><br><br>Tom near Toronto <br><br>VA3KMZ <br><br>PS: I say here "1912" because the <i>Titanic</i> disaster, which occurred in that year, provides a reference point for state-of-art. The ill-fated vessel had a state-of-the-art transmitter, using spark rather than vacuum tubes. The distress radiograms were picked up in (inter alia) Ireland, on a set which has been preserved - a bulky box, again without tubes, but with a crystal. (Crystal itself constituted an advance over the horrid 1890s "coherers", which were perhaps still in maritime service in 1912. I cite Ireland as an instance of state-of-the-art onshore receiving; and the crystal employed there, if it was galena, would have been familiar to the medievals.) <br><br>PPS: It is perhaps worth adding, tangentially, that once one DOES have a diffusion pump, and consequently vacuum tubes, it is only a short step up from Morse code transceiver to a fully practical radiotelephone transceiver. <br><br>PPPS: Lakeland might find it easy enough to smuggle in mission-critical components, including even transistors, including integrated circuits. Someone must be manufacturing ICs somewhere, since the deplorable Mr Carr has a vee-pad. I am indeed imagining that 2065 fabrication is in Asia as at present. One recalls here that the late, unlamented 1970s/1980s USSR managed to bring in large amounts of gear from abroad - entire Digital Equipment Corp minicomputers ("departmental minis"), for instance, to support KGB recordkeeping.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c7601113898605544083 title="comment permalink">9/12/15, 8:34 PM</a><br><br>

Both had positive and negative aspects. I had a friend who took socially maladapted youths (hikikomori) from Japan to Siberia for the summer, where they would recover and become sociable. When they returned to Japan, however, they relapsed. The Siberians would laugh at us, saying, "Good grief! We have all this alcoholism over here! You think this is a paradise?" Even in Siberia, technological advancement is portrayed as something completely positive. The downsides are little discussed.

As much as I see the importance of horses in the de-industrial future (perhaps as soon as a few decades from now as you are describing), I am wondering how we will get from “here” (where horses are few in number and little agricultural land is set aside for their prodigious appetite [have you fed a Clydesdale lately?]) to “there” (given the rate at which horse can be bred and growing hay, etc. to feed them [unless human population and/or eating habits change considerably]). I am hoping that a reasonable transition is possible. One thing I would bank on, though: with a big gap between supply and demand, horse breeders will have it good for the next few generations!

She presents a compelling vision of an education whose chief goal is 'to teach men to think for themselves', claiming that for too long we have lived on the capital of old ideas and need to learn to use the tools of logical thinking to build new and better societies. <br><br>A back bone of this curriculum, as received, is a thorough grounding in classical literature, and even before that, a return to rote learning for small children who love to parrot facts and figures of all kinds, which gives them a fund of knowledge to work with when they get older and start to use the tools of logic, then construct their own arguments via rhetoric.<br><br>To this end a number of small publishing houses have revived quite old educational materials from the late 19th century and early 20th century - Mc Guffy's readers being one which has stood the test of time. So there is a large section of homeschoolers who are deliberately turning back the clock in order to move forward in a useful direction. I used this method to teach my own children, and although they go to school now, they have learned to question everything, which is often awkward.. <br><br>I mention this to note that there is a form of Retrotopian education already in force in small pockets all over the world..<br><br>Here is Dorothy Sayer's essay:<br><br>http://www.tragedyandhope.com/trivium/the-lost-tools-of-learning/<br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c1935996218754390362 title="comment permalink">9/14/15, 1:02 AM</a><br><br>

What it was brilliant at though, was hammering a large number of facts into the heads of small children. Modern education (I work in a primary school) has a huge emphasis on children exhibiting what they know, what they observe, and making inferences about the world based on that observation. It is a simplified version of the scientific method, and it is quite useful IF the children have a wide basis of useful knowledge to work from. Which they do only if they come from homes that provide that. Most don't, which is why they fall behind so quickly.<br><br>What the 18th and 19th century education curriculum provided was a huge fund of useful knowledge to children who were assumed to have no home advantages, and it was pounded into their little heads via rote learning. And that's where it stopped. Which was unfortunate, because facts aren't education. However modern education has thrown out the baby with the bathwater and is trying to provide a form of Logic and Rhetoric without the facts (Grammar). <br><br>Once children have the facts (usefully gained from vintage textbooks, thrifted lady-bird book collections, and encyclopedias, ok, carefully culled and supplemented by a knowledgeable adult to make sure that modern scientific facts are covered) then by middle school they are ready for logic, critical examination of facts, and finding out that HOW facts are put together can also be critical, working out why and wherefore, learning the scientific method, learning how to read literature for meaning etc, THEN, in later high school, learning how to advance their own ideas in a coherent and sensible, logical way.<br><br>Can you imagine how delighted university lecturers would be to discover a cohort of students who can think and express themselves in this manner? Most university classes these days are having to teach all of this, and then finally, post-grad students get to do some real work. How much more useful to have universities full of students who can already think, and artisans and farmers who can also think critically and make sensible decisions about how to go forward in their critical occupations?<br><br>Some of the tools of the past are excellent ways to build a great future, but we can't just reproduce the past without critically examining its shortcomings, and hopefully, Retrotopia has done just that for the future of education..<br><br><br><br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c6838780393983769475 title="comment permalink">9/14/15, 11:49 PM</a><br><br>

At the very least I'd expect to need to get a suitable sim card and data plan. To expect it to "just work" across international boundaries is not reasonable even in this day and age. In a post-collapse, post-fragmentation future, that assumption seems even less plausible.<br><br>I hear the point that you are making about the protagonist's dependency and addiction to his IT device. I'm not complaining about that theme - just the way it is presented. Is the protagonist really so provincial that he would blindly expect the metanet to be universal to all places? Even if the metanet was a unified international standard before the collapse, it would have fragmented after Partition. We can't even manage a unified international standard now - why would anyone expect we'd have one under these conditions.<br><br>This detail (again, the way it's presented, not the point you're trying to make) makes the character less believable, which reduces the impact of the point you are trying to make here. It makes the protagonist come across as an idiot - which he is, granted, but not the kind of idiot that I think you are trying to present him as.<br><br><a href=retrotopia-cab-ride-in-toledo.html#c5292284605267540693 title="comment permalink">9/18/15, 9:40 AM</a><br><br>
