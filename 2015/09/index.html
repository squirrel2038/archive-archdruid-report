<div class=MsoNormal>
I went back to the hotel for lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The wind had picked up further and was tossing stray randrops at anything in its path; my clothing was waterproof but not particularly warm, and I frankly envied the passersby their hats. For that matter, I wasn’t happy about the way that my bioplastic clothes made everyone give me startled looks. Still, it was only a block and a half, and then I ducked back inside the lobby, went to the glass doors to the restaurant, stepped inside. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Maybe a minute later I was settling into a chair in a comfortable corner, and the greeter was on his way back to the door, having promised the imminent arrival of a waitress. Stray notes of piano music rippled through the air, resolved themselves into an unobtrusive jazz number.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It took me a moment to notice that the piano was actually there in the restaurant, tucked over in a nook to one side. The player was a skinny kid in his twenties, Italian-American by the look of him, and he was really pretty good. Some musicians play jazz laid-back because the fire’s gone out or they never had any in the first place, but now and again you hear one who’s got the fire and keeps it under perfect control while playing soft and low, and it’s like watching somebody take a leisurely stroll on a tightrope strung between skyscrapers. This kid was one of those. I wondered what he’d sound like with a bunch of other musicians and a room full of people who wanted to dance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As it was, I leaned back in the chair, read the menu and enjoyed the music and the absence of the wind. The waitress showed up as prophesied, and I ordered my usual, soup and sandwich and a cup of chicory coffee—you can get that anywhere in the post-US republics, just one more legacy of the debt crisis and the hard years that followed. I know plenty of people in Philadelphia who won’t touch the stuff any more, but I got to like it and it still goes down easier than straight coffee. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Lunch was good, the music was good, and I’d missed the lunch rush so the service was better than good; I charged the meal to my room but left a tip well on the upside of enough. Then it was back outside into the wind as the kid at the piano launched into a take on “Ruby, My Dear” that wouldn’t have embarrassed a young Thelonious Monk. I had plenty of questions about the Lakeland Republic, some things that I’d been asked to look into and some that were more or less a matter of my own curiosity, and sitting in a hotel restaurant wasn’t going to get me any closer to the answers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Outside there were still plenty of people on the sidewalks, but not so many as earlier; I gathered that lunch hour was over and everyone who worked ordinary hours, whatever those were here, was back on the job. I went around the block the hotel was on, noting landmarks, and then started wandering, lookng for shops, restaurants, and other places that might be useful during my stay: something I like to do in any unfamiliar city when I have the chance. There were plenty of retail businesses—the ground floor of every building I passed had as many as would fit—but none of them were big, and none of them had the sort of generic logo-look that tells you you’re looking at a chain outlet. Everything I knew about business said that little mom-and-pop stores like that were hopelessly inefficient, but I could imagine what the banker I’d talked with would say in response to that, and I didn’t want to go there. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The other thing that startled me as I wandered the streets was how little advertising there was. Don’t get me wrong, most of the stores had signage in the windows advertising this or that product or doing the 10% OFF THIS DAY ONLY routine; what was missing was the sort of corporate display advertising you see on every available surface in most cities. I’d figured already that there wouldn’t be digital billboards, but there weren’t any billboards at all; the shelters at the streetcar stops didn’t have display ads all over them, and neither did the streetcars; I thought back to the morning’s trip, and realized that I basically hadn’t seen any ads at all since the train crossed the border. I shook my head, wondered how the Lakeland Republic managed that, and then remembered the notebook in my pocket and put my first note into it:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Why no ads? Ask.</i></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I was maybe six blocks from the hotel, by then, looping back after I’d checked out the streets on the west side of the capitol district, and that’s when I tore my shoe. It was my own fault, really. There was a cluster of moms with kids in strollers heading down the sidewalk, going the same direction I was but not as fast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I veered over to the curb to get around them, misjudged my step, and a sharp bit of curbing caught the side of my shoe as I stumbled and ripped the bioplastic wide open. Fortunately it didn’t rip me, but I hadn’t brought a spare pair—these were good shoes, the sort that usually last for a couple of months before you have to throw them out. So there I was, looking at the shredded side of the shoe, and then I looked up and the first store I saw was a shoe store, I kid you not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I managed to keep the ripped shoe on my foot long enough to get in the door. The clerk, a middle-aged guy whose hair was that pink color you get when a flaming redhead starts to go gray, spotted me and started into the “Hi, how can I help you?” routine right as what was left of the shoe flopped right off my foot. He started laughing, and so did I; I picked the thing up, and he said, “Well, I don’t need to ask that, do I? Let’s get you measured and put something a little less flimsy on your feet.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I take a men’s medium-large,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He nodded, and gave me the kind of look you give to someone who really doesn’t get it. “We like to be a little more precise here. Go ahead and have a seat.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So I sat down; he took the remains of the shoe and threw it away, and then proceeded to use this odd metal device with sliding bits on it to measure both my feet. “9D,” he said, “with a high arch. I bet your feet ache right in the middle when you’re on ‘em too long.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yeah,” I said. “I take pills for that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“A good pair of shoes will do a better job. Let’s see, now—that’s business wear, isn’t it? You expect to do a lot of walking? Any formal or semi-formal events coming up?” I nodded yes to each, and he said, “Okay, I got just the thing for you.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He went away, came back with a box, and extracted a pair of dark brown leather shoes from it. “This brown’ll match the putty color of those clothes of yours pretty well, and these won’t take any breaking in. Let’s give it a try.” The shoes went on. “There you go. Walk around a bit, see how they feel on you.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I got up and walked around the store. My feet felt remarkably odd. It took me a moment to realize that this was because the shoes actually fit them. “These are pretty good,” I told him. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Beat the pants off the things you were wearing, don’t they?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“True enough,” I admitted. He rang up the sale on some kind of old-fashioned mechanical cash register and wrote out a bill of sale by hand; I paid up and headed out the door. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Half a block down the same street was a store selling men’s clothes. I went in, and came out something like an hour later dressed like one of the locals—wool jacket, slacks and vest, button-up cotton shirt, and tie, with a long raincoat over the top, and my ordinary clothes in a shopping bag. I’d already more than half decided to pick up something less conspicuous to wear before my shoe got torn, and money wasn’t a problem, so I bought enough to keep me for the duration of my stay, and had everything else sent back to the hotel; the bill was large enough that the clerk checked my ID and then called the bank to make sure I had enough in my account to cover it. Still, that was the only hitch, and quickly past. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
From the clothes store I headed back the way I’d come, turned a corner and went three blocks into a neighborhood of narrow little shops with hand-written signs in the windows. The sign I was looking for, on the recommendation of the clothes store clerk, was barely visible on the glass of a door: S. EHRENSTEIN HABERDASHER. I went in; the space inside was only about twice as wide as the door, with shelves packed with boxes on both walls and a little counter and cash register at the far end. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
S. Ehrenstein turned out to be a short wiry man with hair the color of steel wool and a nose like a hawk’s beak. “Good afternoon,” he said, and then considered me for a moment. “You’re from outside—Atlantic Republic, or maybe Upper Canada. Not Qu<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>é</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">bec or New England. Am I right?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Atlantic,” I said. “How’d you know?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Your clothes and your shoes are brand new—I’d be surprised if you told me you’ve been in ‘em for as much as an hour. That says you just came from outside—that and no hat, and five o’clock shadow this early in the day; I don’t know why it is, but nobody outside seems to know how to get a proper shave. The rest, well, I pay attention to lots of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>little things. How’d you hear about my shop?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">I told him the name of the clothing store, and he nodded, pleased. “Well, there you are. That’s Fred Hayakawa’s store; his family’s been in the business since half an hour before Eve bit the apple, and his clerks know a good hat, which is more than I could say for some. So are you in business, or—”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Politics,” I said. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Then I have just the hat for you. Let’s get your head measured.” A measuring tape came out of his pocket and looped around my head. “Okay, good. Seven and a quarter, I should have in stock.” He ducked past me, clambered onto a stepladder, pulled down a box. “Try it on. The mirror’s there.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">With the hat on, my resemblance to a minor character from a Bogart vid was complete. “Absolutely classic,” the haberdasher said from behind me. “Fedoras, homburgs, sure, they’re fine, but a porkpie like this, you can wear it anywhere and look real classy.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“I like it,” I agreed. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Well, there you are. Let me show you something.” He took the hat, slipped a cord out from under the ribbon. “In windy weather you put this loop over your coat button, so you don’t lose it if it blows off. If I were you I’d do that before I set one foot outside that door.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">I paid up, accepted the business card he pressed on me, and got the loop in place before I went back outside. The wind had died down, so the hat stayed comfortably in place—and the adverb’s deliberate; it kept my head warm, and the rest of the clothes were pleasant in a way that bioplastic just isn’t. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">You know what it’s like when some annoying noise is so much part of the background that you don’t notice it at all, until it stops, and then all of a sudden you realize just how much it irritated you? Getting out of bioplastic was the same sort of thing. In most countries these days, everything from clothes to sheets to curtains is bioplastic, because it’s so cheap to make and turn into products that the big corporations that sell it drove everything else off the market years ago. It’s waterproof, it’s easy to clean—there’s quite a litany, and of course it was all over the metanet and the other media back when you could still buy anything else. Of course the ads didn’t mention that it’s flimsy and slippery, and feels clammy pretty much all the time, but that’s the way it goes; what’s in the stores depends on what makes the biggest profit for the big dogs in industry, and the rest of us just have to learn to live with it. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">The Lakeland Republic apparently didn’t play by the same rules, though. The embargo had something to do with it, I guessed, but apparently they weren’t letting the multinationals compete with local producers. The clothes I’d bought were a lot more expensive than bioplastic equivalents would have been, and I figured it would take trade barriers to keep them on the market. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">I kept walking. Two blocks later, about the time I caught sight of the capitol dome again, I passed a barbershop and happened to notice a sign in the window advertising a shave and trim. I thought about what S. Ehrenstein had said about a proper shave, laughed, and decided to give it a try.</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">The barber was a big balding guy with a ready grin. “What can I do for you?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Shave and trim, please.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Your timing’s good. Another half hour and you’d have to wait a bit, but as it is—” He waved me to the coatrack and the empty chair. “Get yourself comfy and have a seat.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">I shed my coat, hat, and jacket,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>and sat down. He covered me up with the same loose poncho thing that barbers use everywhere, tied something snug around my neck, and went to work. “New in town?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Just visiting, from Philadelphia.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“No kidding. Welcome to Toledo. Here on business?” Instead of the buzz of an electric trimmer, the clicking of scissors sounded back behind my right ear. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“More or less. I’ll try to talk to some people up at the Capitol, make some contacts, ask some questions about the way you do things here.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Might have to wait a day or two, according to the papers. Did you hear about this latest thing?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Just that there’s some kind of crisis.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">The scissor-sound moved around the back of my head from right to left. “Well, sort of. Tempest in a teapot is more like it. Something in the budget bill for next year set off the all-out Restos, and so one of the parties that’s had Meeker’s back says they’ll bolt unless whatever it is gets taken out.”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Restos?” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“You don’t have those out your way, do you? Here the two political blocs are Conservatives and Restorationists; Conservatives want to keep things pretty much the way they are, Restos want to take things back to the way they used to be. Okay, lay your head back.” I did, and he draped a hot damp towel over the lower half of my face, then went back to trimming. “Used to be about half and half, but these days the Restos have the bigger half—all the rural counties going to lower tiers, and so on.”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Hmm?” I managed to say. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Oh, that’s right. You probably don’t know about the tiers.”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Mm-mh.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“It works like this. There are five tiers, and counties vote on what tier they want to be in. The lower the tier, the lower your taxes, but the less you get in terms of infrastructure and stuff. Toledo’s tier five—we got electricity, we got phones in every house, good paving on the streets so you can drive a car if you can afford one, but we pay for it through the nose when it comes to tax time.”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Mm-hmm.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">He took off the towel, started brushing hot lather onto my face. “So tier five has a base date of 1950—that means we got about the same sort of services they had here that year. The other tiers go down from there—tier four’s base date<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>is 1920, for tier three it’s 1890, tier two’s 1860, and tier one’s 1830. You live in a tier one county, you got police, you got dirt roads, not a lot else. Of course your taxes are way, way down, too.” He put away the brush, snapped open an old-fashioned straight razor, and went to work on my stubble. “That’s the thing. Nobody’s technology gets a subsidy—that’s in the constitution. You want it, you pay all the costs, cradle to grave. You don’t get to dump ‘em on anybody else. That’s what the Restos are all up in arms about. They think something in the budget is a hidden subsidy for I forget what high-tier technology, and that’s a red line for them.”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">“Mm-hmm,” I said again. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>“They’ll get it worked out. Go like this.” He drew his lips to one side, and I imitated the movement. “Meeker’s handled that sort of thing more’n a dozen times already—he’s good. If we let our presidents have second terms he’d get one. Now go like this.” I moved my lips the other way. “So they’ll drop whatever it is out of the budget, or put in a user fee, or come up with some other gimmick so that everybody’s happy. It’s not a big deal. Nothing like the fight over the treaty, or the time ten years ago when Mary Chenkin was president, when the Restos wanted to get rid of tier five, just like that. That was a real donnybrook. This close to the Capitol, you better believe I got to hear all sides of it.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">He finished shaving, washed the last bits of soap off my face with another hot wet towel, then splashed on sone kind of bay-scented aftershave that stung a bit. A brush darted around my shoulders, and then he took off the neckcloth and the poncho thing. “There you go.” </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">I got up, checked the trim in the big mirror on the wall, ran my fingers across my cheek; it was astonishingly smooth. “Very nice,” I said. While I got out my wallet, I asked the barber, “Do you think Toledo’s ever going to go to a lower tier?”</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
“People are talking about it,” he said. “I mean, it’s nice to have some of the services, but then tax time comes around and everyone says ‘Ouch.’ Me, I could live with tier four easy, and my business—” He gestured at the shop. “Other than the lights, might as well be tier one. A lot of businesses run things that way—it just makes more sense.” He handed me my change with a grin. “And more money.”</div>

This is the fourth installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator, having arrived in the capital of the Lakeland Republic, discovers that things are even stranger there than he thought... </div>

***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d already guessed that the hotel lobby probably wouldn’t look much like the ones I was used to seeing elsewhere, and so I wasn’t surprised. Instead of the glaring lights, security cameras, and automated check-in kiosks I was used to, it was a comfortable space with sofas and chairs around the edges, ornate chandeliers overhead, and a couple of desks staffed by actual human beings over to one side; off to the other side, glass doors framed in wood led into what looked like a full-service restaurant. A bellhop—was that the right word?—came trotting over to take my suitcase as soon as I came through the door, said something pleasant, and followed me over to the check-in desk. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ve got a reservation,” I said to the clerk. “The name’s Peter Carr.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d been wondering whether the hotel would turn out to use an old-fashioned computer system with a keyboard and screen, but apparently even that was too complex for local standards. Instead, the clerk pulled out a three-ring binder, opened it, and found my reservation in about as much time as it would have taken to input a name on a veepad and wait for a response to come out of the cloud. “Welcome to the Capitol Hotel, Mr. Carr. We have you down for fourteen nights.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s right.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Looks like everything’s paid for in advance. If you’ll sign here.” She handed me a clipboard with a sheet of paper on it and an old-fashioned ballpoint pen. Fortunately I hadn’t quite forgotten how to produce a non-digital signature, and signed on the line at the bottom. “Anything you order in the restaurant here—” She motioned toward the doors on the far side of the room. “—or for room service can be billed to the room account. How many keys will you want?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Just one.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She opened a drawer, pulled out an honest-to-Pete metal key with a ring and a tag with the room number on it. “Here you go. Stairs are right down the hall; if you need the elevator it’s to the left. Is there anything else I can do for you? Enjoy your stay, Mr. Carr.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I thanked her and headed for the hall with the bellhop in tow. My room was on the third floor and the stairs didn’t look too challenging, so I asked him, “Do you mind if we take the stairs?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not a bit,” he said. “Comes with the job.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We started up the stairs. “Do you get a lot of people here from outside the Lakeland Republic?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“All the time. Capitol’s just four blocks away, and Embassy Row’s between here and there. We had the foreign minister of Qu<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>é</span>bec here just last week.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No kidding.” There had been rumors for years that the Qu<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'>é</span>becois started tacitly ignoring the embargo even before Canada broke up; we had decent relations with Montréal these days, but that hadn’t always been the case, and so any news about what was going on between Québec and the Lakeland Republic were worth my attention. “Big official visit, or what?”</div>
<br>“Pretty much, yeah,” said the bellhop. “Really nice lady. Had a bottle of champagne sent up to her room first thing every morning.” <div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I laughed. “Heck of a breakfast.”<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"'> </span></div>
<br>“Nah, breakfast was a couple of hours later, with more champagne. Go figure.”<br><br>We got to the third floor, left the stair, and went down the hall to my room. “Just leave it inside the door,” I said, meaning the suitcase. “Thanks.” <br><br>“Sure thing.” <br><br> I didn’t have any Lakeland money to tip him, but guessed the couple of Atlantic bills I had would do. Fortunately I was right; he grinned, thanked me, and headed back toward the stair. <br><br>The room was bigger than I’d expected, with a queen-sized bed on one side and a desk and dresser on the other. I knew there wouldn’t be a veebox, but thought there might be a screen or even an old-fashioned television in the room, but no dice. The only things even vaguely electronic were a telephone on the desk and a boxy thing on the dresser that had a loudspeaker and some dials on it—a radio, I guessed, and decided to leave turning it on for later. Curtained windows on the far wall let through diffuse light; I went over and pulled the curtains open. <br><br>The bellhop hadn’t been kidding. There was the Capitol dome, half-complete, rising up above a ragged roofline right in front of me. That would be convenient, I decided, and let the curtains fall again. <br><br>I got my things settled and then went to the desk and the big envelope of yellowish paper sitting on top of it. Inside was the notebook Melissa Berger had mentioned, a couple of pens, a packet of papers that had BANK OF TOLEDO printed across the top of each sheet, an identification card with my name and photo on it, a wallet that was pretty clearly meant to hold money and the ID card, and a letter on government stationery welcoming me to Toledo in the usual bland terms, over President Meeker’s signature. Then there were half a dozen pages of instructions on how to get by in the Lakeland Republic, which covered everything from customary tips (I’d overtipped the bellhop, though not extravagantly) to who to contact in this or that kind of emergency. I nodded; clearly the bellhop hadn’t been exaggerating when he mentioned plenty of foreign guests. <br><br>I dropped my veepad in a desk drawer and got the wallet and some of the papers settled into the empty pocket. First things first, I decided: visit the bank and get the money thing sorted out, then get some lunch and do a bit of wandering. <br><br>Down in the lobby, the concierge was behind his desk. “Can I help you?”<br><br>“Please. I need to know where to find the Bank—” All at once I couldn’t remember the name, and reached for the papers in my pocket. <br><br>“Out the door,” said the concierge, “hang a left, go a block and a half straight ahead, and you’ll be standing right in front of it.” <div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I considered him. “You don’t need to know which bank?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“There’s only one in town.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That startled me, though I managed not to show it. “Okay, thanks.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Have a great day,” he said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I headed out the doors, turned left, started along the sidewalk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A cold damp wind was rushing past, pushing shreds of cloud across the sky, and it didn’t take me long to figure out why most of the other people on the sidewalk were wearing hats and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>long coats; they looked much warmer than I felt. Still, Philadelphia has plenty of cold weather, and I was used to the way the chill came through bioplastic business wear. What annoyed me a little, or more than a little, was the way that my clothing made me stick out like a sore thumb. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In retrospect, it was amusing. Everybody else on the sidewalk looked like extras from half a dozen random history vids, everything from fedoras and trench coats to the kind of thing that was last in style when Toledo was a frontier town, and there I was, the only person in town in modern clothing—and you can guess for yourself who was the conspicuous one. The adults gave me startled looks and then pretended that nothing was up, but the kids stared wide-eyed as though I had two extra heads or something. As I said, it was amusing in retrospect, but at the time it made me acutely uncomfortable, and I was glad to get to the bank. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was a three-story brick building on a street corner. Fortunately it had BANK OF TOLEDO—CAPITOL BRANCH above the doors, or I’d probably have missed it, since it didn’t look anything like the banks I was used to. Inside was even weirder: no security cameras, no automated kiosks, no guards in helmets and flak jackets pacing the balcony waiting for trouble, just a lobby with a greeter inside the door and a short line of patrons waiting for tellers. The greeter met me with a cheery “Hi, how can we help you today?” I got out the bank papers, and a minute or two later got shown into one of three little office spaces off the main lobby. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On the other side of the desk was a middle-aged African-American man with a neatly trimmed beard. “I’m Larry Jones,” he said, getting up to shake my hand. “Pleased to meet you, Mr.—” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Carr,” I said. “Peter Carr.” We got the formalities out of the way and sat down; I handed him the papers; he checked them, we discussed some of the details, and he then unlocked a drawer in his desk and pulled out a big envelope.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Okay,” he said. “Everything’s good. The only question I have at this point is whether you’ve ever used cash or checks before.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m guessing,” I said, “that you ask that question fairly often.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“These days, yes,” he replied. “Bit of a change since before the Treaty.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I bet. The answer, though, is cash, yes; checks—well, I’ve seen a few of them.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Okay, fair enough.” He looked relieved, and I wondered how many people from the cashless countries he’d had to walk through the details of counting out coins. “Here’s your checkbook,” he said, pulling the thing out of the envelope, and then opened it and showed me how to write a check. “Up here,” he said, flipping open a notebookish thing in front, “is where you keep track of how much you’ve spent.” He must have caught my expression, because he broke into a broad smile and said, “Long time since you’ve done math with a pen, I bet.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Depends on how long it’s been since never,” I told him. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He laughed. “Gotcha. Glad to say we can help you out there, too.” He opened a different drawer in his desk, handed me a flat little shape of brass. “This is a mechanical calculator,” he said. “Adds and subtracts for you.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I took the thing, gave it a baffled look. “I didn’t know you could do that without electronics.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I think we’re the only country on earth that still makes these.” He showed me how to use the stylus to slide the digits up and down. Once I had it figured out, I thanked him and tucked the calculator and checkbook into my pocket. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Do you have a minute?” I asked then. “I’ve got a couple of questions about the way you do things here—about banking, mostly.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sure thing,” he said. “Ask away.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The concierge at the hotel said there’s only one bank here in Toledo. Is that true everywhere in the Lakeland Republic?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yes, if you’re talking about consumer banking.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Is it the same bank everywhere?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Good heavens, no. Each county and each city of any size has its own bank, like it has its own water and sewer district and so on.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That makes it sound like a public utility,” I said, baffled. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s exactly what it is. Again, that’s just consumer banking. We’ve got privately owned commercial banks here, but those do investment banking only—they’re not allowed to offer savings and checking accounts, consumer loans, small business services, that sort of thing, just like we’re not allowed to do any kind of investment banking.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I shook my head, baffled. “Why the restriction?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Well, that used to be law in the United States, from the 1930s to the 1980s or so, and it worked pretty well—it was after they changed the law that the economy really started running off the rails, you know. So our legislature changed the law back after Partition, and it’s worked pretty well for us, too.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I don’t think banks were public utilities back then,” I objected. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No, that was mostly further back, and only some banks,” he agreed. “The thing is, the way we see it, there are some things that private industry does really well and some things that it doesn’t do well at all, and public utilities like water, sewer service, electricity, public transit, consumer banking, that sort of thing—those work better when you don’t let private interests milk them for profits. I know you do things different back home.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“True enough. But isn’t it more efficient to leave those things to private industry?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That depends, Mr. Carr, on what you mean by efficiency.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That intrigued me. “Please go on.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Unexpectedly, he laughed. “I give a talk on that every year at one of the homeschool associations here in town. Efficiency is always a ratio—more or less efficient at producing an output in terms of a given input. A chemical process is efficient if it turns out more product for the same amount of raw materials, or the ssme amount of energy, or what have you. We get people from outside all the time talking about how this or that would be more efficient than what we do, and you know what? None of them seem to be able to answer a simple question: efficient for what output, in terms of what input?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I could see where this was going, and decided to head onto a different tack. “And having consumer banks as public utilities,” I said. “Is that more efficient for some output in terms of some input?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We don’t worry so much about that,” the banker said. “The question that matters to most people here is much simpler: does it work or doesn’t it?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“How do you tell?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
“History, Mr. Carr,” he said. He was smiling again. “History.” </div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
I don’t normally comment in these essays on the political affairs of other countries. As I’ve noted more than once here, the last thing the rest of the world needs is one more clueless American telling everyone else on the planet what to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What’s more, as the United States busies itself flailing blindly and ineffectually at the consequences that its own idiotically shortsighted decisions have brought down upon it, those of us who live here have our work cut out for us already.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That said, a sign I’ve been awaiting for quite some time has appeared on the horizon—the first rumble of a tectonic shift that will leave few things unchanged. Unsurprisingly, this didn’t happen in the United States, but I was somewhat startled to see where it did happen. That would be in Britain, where Jeremy Corbyn has just been elected head of Britain’s Labour Party. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who don’t follow British politics may not know just how spectacular a change Corbyn’s election marks. In the late1990s, under the leadership of Tony Blair, the Labour Party did what erstwhile left-wing parties were doing all over the industrial world: it ditched the egalitarian commitments that had guided it in prior decades, and instead embraced a set of policies that were indistinguishable from those of its conservative opponents—the same thing, for example, that the Democratic party did here in the US. As a result, voters going to the polls found that their supposed right to shape the destiny of their nations at the voting booth had been reduced to irrelevance, since every party with a shot at power embraced the same set of political and economic policies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That might have been bearable if the policies in question worked, but they didn’t, they don’t, and it’s becoming increasingly clear that they never will. Proponents of the neoliberal consensus—I probably have to explain that label, don’t I? It’s a source of wry amusement to anybody who knows the first thing about the history of political economy that the viewpoint considered “conservative” in today’s America is what used to be known as liberalism, and still has that label in economics. Unrestricted free trade, no government interference in business affairs, no government protections for the poor, and an expansionist and militaristic foreign policy: these were the trademarks of liberal political and economic thought all through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those same policies came back into fashion as neoliberal economics, and as “conservative” politics, in the late twentieth century. Since then, proponents of neoliberalism have insisted that deregulation for industry and finance, tax cuts and government handouts for the rich, a rising spiral of punitive austerity measures for the poor, and a violent and amoral foreign policy obsessed with dominating the Middle East by force, would bring economic stability and prosperity at home and maintain peace overseas. That was the sales pitch that was used to sell these policies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I think most people have begun to notice by now, though, that the policies in question have had precisely the opposite effect, not just once but wherever and whenever they’ve been tried. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I encourage my readers, especially those who favor the neoliberal policies just outlined, to stop and think about that for a moment. Around the globe, where businesses have been deregulated, taxes cut for the rich and government money poured into their hands, harsh austerity measures imposed on the poor, and foreign policy turned into a set of excuses for lobbing bombs at Middle Eastern countries, stability, prosperity, and peace have not been forthcoming—in fact, quite the contrary. At best, neoliberal policies bring a brief burst of relative prosperity, followed by a long slide into increasingly intractable crisis; at worst, you go straight into the crisis phase, and then things just keep getting worse. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Logically speaking, if the policies you propose don’t yield the results you expect, you change the policies. That’s not what’s happened so far in this case, though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Quite the contrary, the accelerating failures of neoliberalism have been met across the board by an increasingly angry insistence from the corridors of power that neoliberal policies are the only options there are. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What Jeremy Corbyn’s election shows is that that insistence has just passed its pull date. Corbyn’s an old-fashioned Labourite of the pre-Blair variety, and he’s made it clear for decades that he supports the opposite of the neoliberal consensus: more regulation of finance and industry, higher tax rates and fewer handouts to the rich, more benefits for the poor, and a less aggressive foreign policy. When he entered the race to head the Labour Party after Ed Milliband’s embarrassing electoral defeat earlier this year, party apparatchiks rolled their eyes and insisted that he didn’t have a chance. What they hadn’t noticed, and what the establishment across the industrial world has by and large never noticed either, is that the consensus is only a consensus among a privileged minority, and most people outside those rarefied and self-referential circles will vote against it if they’re given half a chance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s what happened in the Labour Party election. When the ballots were counted, Corbyn had staged a monumental upset, winning by a landslide on the first ballot with a total three times as large as his nearest rival’s. What’s more, since his election, people who’ve stayed out of party politics in Britain have been joining the Labour Party in droves, convinced that at long last they have the chance to have their voices heard. Until and unless he loses a general election or some other Labour Party figure mounts an effective challenge against him, Corbyn’s now the leader of Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition and the heir apparent to No. 10 Downing Street should Labour come out ahead in the next election. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Whether that’s a desirable outcome or not is not something I propose to discuss here, as that choice is up to the people of Great Britain and nobody else. Myself, I’m not a great fan of Corbyn’s variety of socialism, or for that matter most of the others; it seems to me that there are many better ways to run a society—though it’s only fair to say that the neoliberal consensus is not one of these. What makes Jeremy Corbyn’s meteoric rise important is that it shows just how fragile the neoliberal consensus actually is, and how readily it can be overturned by any politician who’s willing to break with it and start addressing the concerns of the eighty to ninety per cent of the population who don’t agree with it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That fragility need not lead to better things. Here in the United States, Donald Trump remains sky-high in the polls for exactly the same reason Jeremy Corbyn now heads the Labour Party: he’s willing to talk about things the political establishment refuses to discuss. In his case the unspeakable issue is the de facto policy, supported by both parties, of encouraging illegal immigration to the United States in order to drive down wages for the working classes and maintain a facade of prosperity for the privileged. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A great many Americans are concerned about that, and not unreasonably so. Whether allowing mass immigration to the United States is a good idea or not, it’s fair to say that sharply limiting the number of legal immigrants and then turning a blind eye to illegal immigration lands us in the worst of both worlds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The only people who benefit from it are the employers who get to pay substandard wages to illegal immigrants, and the privileged classes whose lifestyles are propped up thereby. Since the voices of the privileged are the only ones that have been let into our collective conversation about politics for the last three and a half decades, the concerns of the broader public haven’t been addressed; now Trump is addressing them, and he just might end up in the White House as a result. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He’s not the only one who’s riding that particular issue to the brink of power. Marine Le Pen, to name just one example, is more or less France’s Donald Trump—though, France being France, she has better fashion sense and a less absurd hairstyle. Europe’s privileged classes encourage unlimited immigration, just like their American equivalents, to force down wages and break the political power of the working classes, and Le Pen’s Front National has harnessed the resentment of all those French voters who have been on the losing end of those policies for decades. Nor is France the only European nation where that’s an explosive issue. The British politicians and pundits who are busy decrying Corbyn’s election just now might want to temper their rage and consider the alternatives: if Corbyn falls, Nigel Farage and the UKIP party are waiting in the wings to harness the public’s frustration with the abject failure of business as usual, and if Farage falls in his turn, what replaces him could be much, much worse. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The mere fact that a failed consensus is cracking at the seams, in other words, does not guarantee that what replaces it will be an improvement. All it means is that there’s an opening through which a range of alternative visions can enter the political conversation of our time, and perhaps find an audience among the disenfranchised and disillusioned. That some such window of opportunity was on its way comes as no surprise; as a student of history, I’ve long taken comfort in the fact that even the most thoroughly entrenched political and economic orthodoxies have finite life spans, and will eventually be hauled out with the trash. Much of what I’ve done over the last nine years on this blog has been a matter of getting ready for the opening of that window, putting certain ideas into circulation among those few who were ready to hear them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s a more important step than I think many people realize. In Germany in the early 1930s, when a failed consensus finally came apart, the only alternative visions that had any significant presence were the Leninist version of Marxian socialism, on the one hand, and a bubbling cauldron of racist fantasies and radical antirationalism on the other; the latter triumphed, and no doubt most of my readers are aware of what followed. In other places and times, less psychotic options have been available, and the results have generally been much better. The Zapatista rebels in southern Mexico a while back favored the slogan “another world is possible,” and of course they’re quite right—but a great deal depends on what kind of other world people are prepared to imagine. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is why, for example, the last three posts here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> have been devoted to a narrative describing a future very different from the one that most Americans like to imagine: a future in which the United States slams facefirst into a brick wall of unintended consequences, plunges into a bloody civil war, and fragments thereafter, and in which one of the fragments pursues a set of political and economic policies that go zooming off at right angles to the conventional wisdom of our time. I expect to resume that narrative next week, and to continue it with an assortment of interruptions thereafter, precisely because a less impoverished sense of the possible futures open to us is so crucial in facing the rising spiral of crises that defines our time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>

It’s a source of some amusement to me that I’ve fielded a fair number of comments insisting that I have to reshape the narrative just mentioned to fit one or another version of the conventional wisdom. This blog’s focus being what it is, most of them have fixated on one or another aspect of what might as well be called the Ecotopian model—the last really imaginative vision of the future in this country, which was midwifed by Ernest Callenbach in his brilliant 1974 utopian fiction <i>Ecotopia</i>. If you know your way around today’s American Green scene, even if you haven’t read a word Callenbach wrote, you know his ideas, because they still shape an enormous amount of what passes for original thought today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s not a model I’m interested in rehashing. Partly that’s because not that many people outside the San Francisco Bay region find Callenbach’s vision especially appealing; partly it’s because some aspects of the model, notably the claim that solar and wind power can support something akin to modern middle class American lifestyles, haven’t held up well in the light of experience; but it’s also partly because other worlds are also possible. The Ecotopian conventional wisdom is not the only option. It’s an option toward which I have a nostalgic fondness—I was wildly enthusiastic about Callenbach’s book back in the day—but it’s not the only game in town, and all things considered, it’s not the option I would choose today. Thus <i>Retrotopia</i>, as the name suggests, is not going to be full of avid spandex-clad cyclists who dine on the produce of permacultured edible forests, or what have you. It’s heading in directions that are far more threatening to the status quo—including, by the way, the Ecotopian status quo. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

<div class=MsoNormal>
The crying need for an abundance of alternative visions of the future, apart from the conventional wisdom of our time, has also driven another core project of this blog, and with that in mind, I’m delighted to announce the winners of <a href=../../2015/03/planet-of-space-bats.html>this year’s Space Bats challenge</a>. Those of my readers who are new to <i>The Archdruid Report</i> may not know that since 2011, this blog has hosted a series of contests in which readers have submitted short stories set in a variety of deindustrial futures—that is, futures in which industrial society as we know it is a thing of the past, our current complex technologies have faded into legend, and human beings are busy coping with the legacies of the industrial age and leading challenging, interesting, and maybe even appealing lives in that context. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first Space Bats challenge was a shot in the dark, and to my delighted surprise, it fielded a torrent of fine short stories, the best of which were duly published by Founders House Publishing as an anthology titled <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2012/10/on-sale-after-oil-sf-visions-of-post.html>After Oil: SF Visions of a Post-Petroleum Future</a>. A second contest duly followed in 2014, and produced two anthologies, <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2015/01/new-release-after-oil-2-years-of-crisis.html>After Oil 2: The Years of Crisis</a> and <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2015/04/new-release-after-oil-3-years-of-rebirth.html>After Oil 3: The Years of Rebirth</a>. The fourth contest was launched in March of this year; as before, I was deluged with an abundance of excellent stories, and had a hard time choosing among them; I owe thanks to everyone who submitted a story and made the choice so difficult; but the following stories will be included in the next anthology, <i>After Oil 4: The Future’s Distant Shores</i>:
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sail Away Home” by Alma Arri</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Finding Flotsam” by Bill Blondeau</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Alay” by Dau Branchazel</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Crow Turns Over a Rock” by Eric Farnsworth</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Notes for a Picnic” by Phil Harris</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The Remembrancer” by Wylie Harris<br>
“The Bald Eagle, the Lame Duck, and the Cooked Goose” by Jonah Harvey</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The Baby” by Nicky Jarman</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Northern Ghosts” by Gaianne Jenkins</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Caretaker Poinciana” by Troy Jones</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Scapegoat” by Cathy McGuire</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Flowering” by John W. Riley</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I trust you’ll join me in congratulating the authors and, more to the point, in reading their stories once those see print. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In its own small and idiosyncratic way, my experience with the Space Bats challenge parallels the political earthquake currently shaking the British landscape. All I did was ask readers to come up with stories that broke with the conventional wisdom concerning the future—to set aside the weary, dreary, endlessly rehashed Tomorrowland of spaceships, zap-guns, and linear technological expansion along the same lines we think we’re following today, and imagine something different—and as it turned out, that’s all I had to do. Given the opportunity to write about some less hackneyed future, scores of readers lunged for their keyboards and flooded each contest with quirky, thoughtful, interesting futures...you know, the kind of thing that science fiction used to feature all the time, back before it got sucked into the role of cheerleading for a suffocatingly narrow range of acceptable tomorrows. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There will be another Space Bats challenge, beginning in the spring of next year. I invite my readers to propose potential themes for that challenge—this fourth anthology consists entirely of stories set at least a thousand years in the future, and I’d like to have some equally offbeat focus or limitation on the next contest, in the hope that it will inspire an equally stellar collection of stories. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m also pleased to note that the <i>After Oil</i>
anthologies and my post-peak novel <i>Star’s Reach</i> are far from the only contributions to a growing genre. Founders House, for example, has also recently published Ralph Meima’s novel <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2015/07/new-release-inter-states-fossil-nation.html>Fossil Nation</a>, the first volume of a trilogy, which offers its own lively and readable glimpse at a future that cuts across the conventional wisdom of our time and heads off in new directions. Other projects are in the works, at Founders House and elsewhere. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At the same time, it’s worth remembering that the same process is under way on a much vaster scale, and with much more serious consequences. As the neoliberal consensus shatters and the failure of its policies becomes impossible to ignore any longer, another world is not merely possible, it’s inevitable. The question is purely what ideas, visions, dreams, hopes, and shuddering terrors will shape the world that will emerge from neoliberalism’s smoldering corpse—and that, dear reader, will be determined in part by what you yourself are willing to imagine, to work for, and to struggle for, during the difficult years ahead of us. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

<div class=MsoNormal>
One other note may be relevant in this context. Many of the readers of this blog will be familiar with my alternative-future novel <i>Star’s Reach</i>. Ever since it was published, I’ve fielded requests for more fiction set in the same imaginary future, and while I’m flattered by the requests, my fiction is heading in other directions at least for now. As a result, Founders House Publishing and I have been talking about the possibility of transforming the setting of <i>Star’s Reach</i> into a shared world to which many authors can contribute, and doing at least one anthology—and possibly more—of short stories set in 25th-century Meriga, or the wider future in which Trey sunna Gwen and his companions have their place. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Obviously that’s a project that would require a dozen enthusiastic authors at least. My question is whether anyone’s interested in writing stories for such an anthology. If this interests you, please post a comment here; if there’s enough interest, we can get the project rolling. </div>

This is the third installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator arrives in the capital of the Lakeland Republic, and further surprises are in store.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The train pulled into the Toledo station something like ten minutes late—we’d had to wait for another train to clear the bridge over Sandusky Harbor, and then rolled along the Lake Erie shoreline for half an hour, past little lakeside towns and open country dotted with shore pines, before finally veering inland toward the Lakeland Republic’s capital. All the way along the shore, I watched big two- and three-masted schooners catching a ride from the wind, some obviously heading out from the Toledo lakefront, some just as obviously heading toward it. The sailing ship I’d spotted outside Sandusky was clearly nothing unusual here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Once the train swung due west toward downtown Toledo, it was more farm country—the twentieth century kind with tractors and pickups rather than the nineteenth century kind with draft horses and wagons. Then the same sequence I’d watched around other Lakeland cities followed: houses became more frequent, fields gave way to truck gardens, and not too far after that the train was rolling past residential neighborhoods dotted with schools, parks, and little clusters of shops, striped at intervals with the omnipresent streetcar tracks and, here and there, crossed by the streetcars themselves. The houses gave way eventually to the warehouses and factories of an industrial district, and then to the dark waters of the Maumee River, swirling and rushing past the feet of a dozen bridges. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Toledo,” the conductor called out from behind me. “End of the line, ladies and gentlemen. Please make sure you have your luggage and belongings before you leave, and thank you for riding with us.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As the car I was in reached the far shore, I got a brief glimpse of tree-lined streetscapes, and then brick walls blotted out the view. Some of the other passengers got their luggage down from the overhead racks. Me, I had other things on my mind; it had finally occurred to me that unless I could get a veepad signal, I had no way to call the people who were supposed to meet me and make sure we didn’t miss each other, and I’d checked my veepad one last time and gotten the same dark field as before. I shrugged mentally, decided to wait and see what happened. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The train slowed to a crawl. The immigrant family across from me had apparently spotted somebody waiting for them on the platform, and were waving at the window. They already had their plastic-bag luggage in hand, and the moment the train stopped they hefted the bags and headed for the exit. I got my suitcase down from the rack; the boy who’d been sitting next to me went back to help his parents with their luggage, and I stepped into the aisle and followed the people in front of me up to the front of the car and out onto the platform. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A brightly painted sign said THIS WAY TO THE STATION. I followed that and the flow of people. Partway along I passed the immigrant family standing there with half a dozen other people in what looked like Victorian clothing out of a history vid—the wife’s family from Ann Arbor, I guessed—all talking a mile a minute. The wife was teary-eyed and beaming, and the two kids looked for the first time since I’d seen them as though they might get around to smiling one of these days. I thought about the conversation I’d had with the husband, wondered if things really were that much better at the bottom end of the income scale here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I went through a big double door of glass and metal into what had to be the main room of the station, a huge open space under a vaulted ceiling, with benches in long rows on one side, ticket counters on the other, and what looked like half a dozen restaurants and a bar ahead in the middle distance. Okay, I said to myself, here’s where I try to find someone who has a clue about how to locate people and get around in this bizarre country. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d almost finished thinking that when a woman and a man in what I’d come to think of as Bogart clothing got up off one of the nearby benches and came over toward me. “Mr. Carr?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Well, that was easy, I thought, and turned toward them. She was tall for a woman, with red-brown curls spilling out from under a broad-brimmed hat; he was a couple of inches shorter than she was, with the kind of forgettable face you look for when you’re hiring spies or administrative assistants. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m Melissa Berger,” the woman said, shaking my hand, “and this is Fred Vanich.” I shook his hand as well. “I hope your trip this morning wasn’t too disconcerting,” she went on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That last word was unexpected enough that I laughed. “Not quite,” I said. “Though there were a few surprises.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I can imagine. If you’ll come this way?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Can I take that for you?” Vanich said, and I handed over my suitcase and followed them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m afraid we’ve had to do some rescheduling,” Berger said as we headed for the doors. “The President was hoping to meet with you this afternoon, after you have time to get settled in at the hotel, but he’s got a minor crisis on his hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of the Restorationist parties in our coalition is breathing fire and brimstone over a line item in an appropriations bill. It’ll blow over in a day or so, but—well, I’m sure you know how it goes.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Yeah,” I said. “Ellen’s been having to deal with that sort of thing every other day or so since the election.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That was quite an upset,” she said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded. “We were pretty happy with the way it turned out.”
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Outside the air was blustery and crisp, with the first taste of approaching winter on it. The trees lining the street still clung to a few brown and crumpled leaves. Just past the trees, where I’d expected to see cabs waiting for passengers in a cloud of exhaust, horses stood placidly in front of brightly colored—buggies? Carriages? Whatever they were called, they looked like boxes with big windows, some with four wheels supporting them and some with two, and a seat up top for the driver. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I blinked, and almost stopped. Berger gave me an amused look. “I know,” she said. “We do a lot of things differently here.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ve noticed that,” I replied. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She led the way to one of the four-wheeled buggies, or whatever they were. Obviously things had been arranged in advance; she said “Good afternoon, Earl,” to the driver, he said “Good afternoon, ma’am” in response, and without another word being said my suitcase found its way into the trunk in back and the three of us were settling into place in comfortable leather seats inside, Berger and I facing forward and Vanich across from us facing backward. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The buggy swung out into traffic and headed down the street. “Is this standard here?” I asked, indicating the vehicle with a gesture. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The cab? More or less,” said Berger. “There are a few towns with electric cabs and a fair number with pedal cabs, but you’ll find horse cabs everywhere there’s taxi service at all. The others don’t produce methane feedstock.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I considered that. “But no gasoline or diesel cabs.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not since Partition, no.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That made a certain amount of sense to me. “I’m guessing the embargo had a lot to do with that.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Well, to some extent. There was quite a bit of smuggling, of course—Chicago being right on our border.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I snorted. “And Chicago being Chicago.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Free City of Chicago was the smallest of the nations that came out of Partition, and made up for that by being far and away the most gaudily corrupt. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Well, yes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But there wasn’t that much of a market for petroleum products,” she went on. “There’s the tailpipe tax, of course, and we also lost most of the necessary infrastructure during the war—highways, pipelines, all of it.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m surprised your government didn’t subsidize rebuilding.”
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We don’t do things that way here,” she said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I gave her a long startled look. “Obviously I have a lot to learn,” I said finally. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She nodded. “Outsiders generally do.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I filed away the word <i>outsider</i> for future reference. “One thing I’ve been wondering since I crossed the border,” I said then. “Or rather two. You really don’t have metanet service in the Lakeland Republic?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s correct,” she replied at once. “We actually have jamming stations along the borders, though it’s been fifteen or sixteen years since we last had to use them.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Hold it,” I said. “Jamming stations?”<br>
<br style="mso-special-character: line-break"></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Mr. Carr,” Berger said, “since Partition we’ve fought off three attempts at regime change and one full-blown military invasion. All the regime change campaigns were one hundred per cent coordinated via the metanet— saturation propaganda via social media, flashmobs, swarming attacks, you know the drill. The third one fizzled because we’d rigged a kill switch in what little metanet infrastructure we had by then and shut it down, and after that the legislature voted to scrap what was left. Then when Brazil and the Confederacy invaded in ‘49, one reason they pulled back a bloody stump was that military doctrine these days—theirs, yours, everybody else’s—is fixated on disrupting network infrastructure and realtime comm-comm, and we don’t have those, so they literally had no clue how to fight us. So, yes, we have jamming stations. If you’d like to visit one I can arrange that.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I took that in. “That won’t be necessary,” I said then. “Just out of curiosity, do you jam anything else?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not any more. We used to jam radio broadcasts from the Confederacy, but that’s because they jammed ours. We got that settled three years ago.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Television?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Waste of time. Only about three per cent of the Republic’s within range of a ground station, and the satellite situation—well, I’m sure you know at least as much about that as I do.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I was by no means sure of that, but let it pass. “Okay, and that leads to my second question. How on earth do you take notes when you don’t have veepads?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Instead of answering, she directed a rueful look at Vanich, who nodded once, as though my words had settled something. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m guessing,” I said then, “that somebody just won a bet.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And it wasn’t me,” Berger said. “There are four questions that outsiders always ask, and there’s always a certain amount of speculation, shall we say, about which one gets asked first.” She held up one finger. “How do you take notes?” A second. “How do you find out what’s happening in the world?” A third. “What do you do to contact people?” A fourth. “And how do you pay your bar tab?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I laughed. “I’ve got a fifth,” I said. “How do you look up facts without Metapedia?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s an uncommon one, Mr. Carr,” Vanich said. His voice was as bland and featureless as his face. If he wasn’t a spy, I decided, the Lakeland Republic was misusing his talents. “I’ve heard it now and then, but it’s uncommon.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“To answer your question,” Berger said then, “most people use paper notebooks.” She pulled a flat rectangular shape out of her purse, fanned it open to show pages with neat angular handwriting on them, put it away again. “Available at any stationery store, but you won’t have to worry about that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There’s one waiting at your hotel room.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Thank you,” I said, trying to wrap my head around writing down notes on sheets of paper. It sounded about as primitive as carving them with a chisel on stone. “Just out of curiosity, what about the others? I was planning on asking those sometime soon.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Fair enough,” she said. “You find out what’s happening by reading a newspaper or listening to the radio. You contact people by phone, if you’re in a county with phone service, or by writing a letter or sending a radiogram anywhere. You pay your bar tab with cash, and any larger purchases with a check—we’ve got all that set up for you; you’ll just have to visit a bank, and there’s one a block and a half from the hotel. You look up facts in books—your own, if you’ve got them, or a public library’s if you don’t. There’s a branch five blocks from your hotel.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Not as convenient as accessing the metanet,” I noted. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“True, but there are more important things than convenience.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Like national survival?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d meant the words as an olive branch of sorts, and she took them that way. “Among other things.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She looked out the window, then, and turned in her seat to face me. “We’re almost to your hotel. I’m going to have to go back to the Capitol right away and see if I can shake some sense into the Restos, and Fred has his own work to get done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One way or another, there’ll be someone to take you around tomorrow. If you like, after you’ve settled in and had some lunch, I can have somebody come out and show you the tourist sights, or whatever else you’d like to see.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Thank you,” I said, “but I’d like to suggest something different. I hear your streets are pretty safe.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
She nodded. “I know the kind of thing you have to deal with in Philadelphia. We don’t have that sort of trouble here.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“In that case, I’d like to wander around a bit on my own, check out the landscape—maybe visit the public library you mentioned.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was a long shot; I figured the Lakeland government would want me under the watchful eye of a handler the whole time I was in the country. To my surprise, she looked relieved. “If that works for you, it works for us,” she said. “I’ll have somebody call you first thing tomorrow—eight o’clock, if that’s not too early.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’ll be fine.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“With any luck this whole business will have blown over by then and President Meeker can see you right away.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Here’s hoping,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
The cab came to a halt. A moment later, the driver opened the door. I shook both their hands, climbed down to the sidewalk. </div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the second installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Readers who haven’t been following <i>The Archdruid Report </i>for long may find it useful to remember that not everything seen along the way has a simple explanation. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
From the window beside me, the Steubenville station looked like a scene out of an old Bogart vid. The platform closest to the train I was riding was full of people in outdated clothes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Most of them wore long raincoats that didn’t look a bit like bioplastic, and all of the men and most of the women had hats on. Up above was a roof of glass and ironwork that reminded me irresistibly of the Victorian era, and let daylight down onto everything. The oddest thing about it all, though, is that I didn’t see security troops anywhere. On the other side of the border, anywhere you saw this many people together there’d be at least a squad in digital camo and flak jackets, pointing assault guns ostentatiously at the sidewalk. I remembered the guards at the border, with their clipboards, holstered revolvers, and old-fashioned uniforms, and wondered how on earth the Lakeland Republic got away with that kind of carelessness. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The train finally rolled to a stop, and doors opened. The conductor had warned us that plenty of people would be coming aboard, and he wasn’t kidding: it took better than five minutes for everyone to file onto the car where I was sitting, and by the time they’d finished coming aboard, nearly every seat was taken. The aisle seat next to me wasn’t one of the empty ones; a family with three children settled in right behind me, one child next to the mother, the second next to the father, and then Mom came up to me and asked if I minded having the oldest child sit next to me. I gestured and said, “Sure,” and a boy of maybe ten plopped into the seat. “Now you mind your manners,” the woman told him, and he rolled his eyes, sighed loudly, and said, “Yeah, Mom.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That wasn’t too promising, but he had a book with him, and as soon as he was settled in his seat, he opened it and didn’t make another sound . I was curious enough to give the book a sidelong glance; it was called <i>Treasure Island</i>, and it was by somebody I’d never heard of named Robert Louis Stevenson; I made a mental note to look up the name and see if he was somebody new I should check out. He wasn’t the only kid in the car who was doing something quiet, either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Up three rows there was a girl in a blue checked dress and a bonnet who was reading something, too, and behind me, the two kids in the immigrant family were watching everything and not saying a word, though they didn’t look quite as scared as when they boarded. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A couple of solid jolts shook the car. A moment later, I heard the voice of the conductor outside calling out, “Last call for Train Twenty to Toledo via Canton and Sandusky. All aboard!” Doors clattered, the locomotive up ahead sounded its whistle, and with another jolt the train started on its way again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The station slid away, and I got a street-level view of half a dozen blocks of downtown Steubenville. The sense of having landed on the set of an old Bogart vid was just as strong. To judge by the couple of clocks the train passed—my veepad was still giving me a dark field and the words <i>no signal—</i>it was right around time for the morning commute, but there wasn’t a car to be seen anywhere; the sidewalks bustled with people, and a couple of streetcars rolled past with bells clanging and standing room only on board. The train picked up speed and left the downtown behind, but further out was more of the same: streets full of comfortable-looking houses and apartment buildings, with people walking to work or waiting at streetcar stops. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Further on the houses spread out, and big gardens sprouted all over the place, with the last fall crops visible in patches separated by stubble and brown earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A little further, and Steubenville blended smoothly into the same sort of farm country I’d seen since shortly after the train crossed into the Lakeland Republic. The farmhouses and barns looked well-tended, windmills spun and solar water heater panels on the roofs soaked up what sunlight came through the broken clouds, and the roads I saw were unpaved but had fresh gravel on them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A little further, and the train passed a work gang out in one of the fields. That wasn’t surprising—back on the other side of the border, you saw prison work gangs doing labor on corporate farms all the time—but these didn’t have the slouch and the least-possible-effort sort of movement you see in convicts. They were working their way across a field, digging up turnips as energetically as if they wanted to be there, and others came behind them just as methodically and carried the turnips away in bushel baskets. It was when I noticed where they were taking the turnips that my mouth dropped open. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Just past the field was a wagon with two draft horses hitched up to it. I wondered for a moment if this was an Amish farm—we’ve got Amish in our country, quite a few of them in what used to be the state of Pennsylvania before Partition, and they’re among the few people who’ve really done well in the postwar era—but the wagon had been painted in colors that, though they’d faded, had obviously once been bright. The people in the work gang weren’t dressed in any sort of Amish kit I’d ever seen, either. I shook my head as the work gang and the wagon slipped out of sight behind the train, wondering what kind of weird place I was visiting. This was the twenty-first century, after all, not the nineteenth!</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And yet it was like that all the way to Canton—or, to be more precise, it was some variation on the same theme of outdated technology and inefficient land use. All the farms were absurdly small, one to two hundred acres divided up into the sort of mixed farming that modern agriculture discarded most of a century ago, and I didn’t see any trace of modern agricultural machinery: no harvesting drones, no nitrogen injection systems, no quadruple-wide megacombines, nothing. What I did see left me baffled, not least because there didn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason to it. In one place I’d see trucks driving down paved roads and tractors in the fields, and twenty or thirty miles later it would be draft horses and wagons doing the same jobs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The train passed through I don’t know how many little towns, and those were the same way: in one I’d see paved streets and a few cars and trucks, in the next the streets were paved with brick and streetcars shared space with horsedrawn carriages, and then there were a few that had brick streets and no streetcars at all. The thing that puzzled me most, though, was that all of the towns, like nearly all the farms, seemed to be thriving. Every scrap of theory I’d learned in business school argued that small towns, like small farms, were hopelessly inefficient and couldn’t possibly support themselves in a modern economy. I’d guessed earlier in the trip that there must be subsidies involved, but this far into Lakeland Republic territory, that explanation wouldn’t wash. I reached for my veepad reflexively to make a note, remembered as I got it out of my pocket that it wouldn’t get a signal, and put it away, feeling a rush of annoyance at the metanet’s absence. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We got to Canton a little ahead of schedule, or so the conductor announced cheerfully, and stopped in the switching yard east of town to lose some freight cars, gain others, and add three more passenger cars and a dining car to the back end of the train. That went quickly, though it involved a lot of jolts and thumps, and before long we were rolling ahead into the city. Canton was a fairly big town; according to what I’d read while researching this trip, it had plenty of factories until the offshoring fad of the late twentieth century scrapped the United States’ manufacturing capacity and left the nation at the mercy of rival powers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’d seen the gutted hulks of old factories outside Pittsburgh and a dozen other cities on our side of the border, and assumed that I’d see the same thing here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I didn’t. What I saw instead, as the train rolled through the outlying districts of Canton, were what looked very much like warehouses and factories open for business. There weren’t many smokestacks to be seen, but the buildings had recent coats of paint on them, boxcars were being pushed down sidings by switching engines, and a mix of trucks and big horsedrawn wagons were lumbering past on the streets. Further in, the train passed the same mix of of office buildings, apartment blocks, and stores I’d seen in Steubenville, and then we slowed and stopped at the Canton station. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That had me remembering Bogart vids again. From my window I could see at least eight platforms to one side of the train I was riding, and through the windows on the other side of the car I was pretty sure I could make out two more. Signs on the platforms noted destinations all over the Lakeland Republic—Morgantown, Bowling Green, Cairo, Madison, Sault Ste. Marie—and the place fairly bustled with passengers heading for this or that train. Some of the passengers from the car I was sitting in got their luggage and headed out into the crowds, and some others came on board, stowed their luggage, and sat down; and the weirdest thing of all was that everyone seemed perfectly comfortable doing without security troops to protect them or modern technology to take care of their needs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The train finally got under way again, and I got more views of Canton as the track headed northwest through town. About the time the houses started to spread out and the gardens got bigger, the conductor came through the door behind me and said, “Ladies and gentlemen, breakfast service is now open in the dining car, and since so many of the people in this car have been with us since Pittsburgh, you’re first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>If you’d like to head back four cars, the dining car staff will be happy to serve you.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Just about everyone in the car got up and filed back through the door. I didn’t. I’m one of those people who doesn’t do breakfast; if I eat anything before lunch I end up with stomach trouble. The kid next to me went with his family, and the mother of the immigrant family took her two kids back to the dining car right after them. The father of the immigrant family, though, didn’t join them. After a few minutes he and I were practically alone in the car. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I half turned in my seat, gave him what I hoped would come across as a friendly smile. “Not into breakfast?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Too keyed up,” he said, smiling in response. “If I ate now I’d get sick to my stomach.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded. “I couldn’t help hearing the border guard say that you’re immigrating. That sounds pretty drastic. If you don’t mind my asking, what made you do that?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
His smile vanished, replaced by a wary look. “The wife has family in Ann Arbor,” he said. “They’re sponsoring us, and I got a job offer when we visited this summer. It seems like a good move.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Even though you have to give up modern technology?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The wary look gave way to something that looked uncomfortably like contempt. “Technology? Like what?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Well, veepads and the metanet, to start with.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By this point it was definitely contempt. “Big loss. I can’t afford any of that keech anyway.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Why not? You’ve got as much chance as anyone. Work hard, and—”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
His expression said “whatever” more clearly than words, and he turned toward the window and away from me. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No,” I said. “Seriously. I want to understand.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He turned back to face me. “Yeah? Did you hear my wife start crying there at the border, once they checked our papers?” I nodded, and he went on. “You know why she started crying? Because she’s been working three different jobs, sixty hours a week plus, to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table—and before you start thinking something stupid, mister, I’ve been working more hours than her since before we got married. This is the first time she’s had anything to look forward to but that kind of schedule or worse for the rest of her life, until one of us gets too sick to work and we get chucked onto the street or into the burbs.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And you think you’ll be that much better off here?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He gave me a baffled look, and then laughed a short hard laugh. “You haven’t been here before.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No, I haven’t.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Then open your eyes and take a good plutting look around.” He turned back to the window, and I knew better than to try to continue the conversation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The landscape rolled by. We were in farm country again, the same patchwork landscape of little farms and little towns, with the same weird incongruities between one place and another. I was paying more attention this time, so I noticed some of the other differences: paved roads, gravel roads, and dirt roads; in some places, streetcars and local rail service, and none of these things in others; towns that had streetlights and others that didn’t. At one point west of Canton, as the train rattled across a bridge, I looked down and honest to God, there were canal boats going both ways on a canal, each one with a mule pulling the towrope as though it was two hundred years ago and the Erie Canal was still in working order. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With my veepad useless, I didn’t have anything to do but watch the landscape roll by. The people who’d gone to breakfast trickled back a few at a time, and the conversation I’d just had with the immigrant replayed over and over again in my mind. Of course I knew perfectly well that things were pretty hard for the poor back home, and the statistics that got churned out quarter after quarter showing steady economic improvement were strictly public relations maneuvers—there been a modest upturn after the Treaty of Richmond was signed and the last closed borders between the North American republics opened up, but the consequences of the Second Civil War and the debt crisis that followed it still weighed down hard on everybody. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s one thing to have some more or less abstract idea that times are tough, though, and something else to hear it in the voice of someone who’d been on the losing end of the economy all his life. I started to reach for my veepad to look up honest stats on the job market back home—those weren’t easy to find if you didn’t have connections, but that wasn’t a problem for me—and caught the motion just before my hand reached my pocket. What did people do in the Lakeland Republic, I wondered irritably, when they wanted to make a note of something or look up a fact? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I stared out the window, and after a while—the train was most of the way to Sandusky by then—noticed something that made the crazy quilt pattern of old technologies on the landscape a little clearer and a lot more puzzling. The train had slowed a little, and crossed a road at an angle. The road was paved on one side and dirt on the other; I could see tractors in the middle distance off to the left, where the paved road started, and draft horses closer by on the right. Just where the pavement began was a sign that read <i>Welcome to Huron County</i>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That got me thinking back over the landscape the train had crossed since the border, and yes, the breaks between one set of technology and another worked out to something like county-line distances. That made me shake my head. Had the Lakeland Republic somehow divvied up the available technology by county, so that some counties got the equivalent of twentieth century infrastructure and others got stuck with the nineteenth-century equivalent? That sounded like political suicide, unless the Republic was a lot more autocratic than the briefing papers I’d read made it sound. Then, of course, there was the fact that the farmhouses and farm towns in the nineteenth-century counties looked just as prosperous, all things considered, as their equivalents in the twentieth-century counties, and that made no sense at all. The farmers with more technology should have outproduced the others, undercut them in price, and driven them out of business in no time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Huron County slid past the window. Farmland dotted with little towns gave way to a midsized town, which I guessed was the county seat, and then to farmland and little towns again. After a while, the conductor stepped through the door behind me and called out, “Next stop, Sandusky.” A few minutes later, the train swung around a wide curve to the left, and ran just back of the shores of Lake Erie. Off in the distance, at a steep angle ahead, Sandusky’s buildings could be seen rising up above the flat line of the landscape, but that wasn’t what caught my gaze and held it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Out maybe a quarter mile from shore was a big schooner with three masts, white sails bellying out ahead of the wind. It wasn’t anybody’s luxury yacht, that was for sure; from stem to stern, it looked every inch a working boat. From the direction it was headed, I guessed it must have left Sandusky harbor not long before, and was headed east toward the locks around Niagara Falls, or just possibly toward Erie or Buffalo—since the Treaty of Richmond, I knew, we’d been importing agricultural products from the Lakeland Republic, though I’d never bothered to find out how they got to us. I sat there and watched the ship as it swept past, wondering why they hadn’t done the obvious thing and entrusted their shipping to modern freighters instead. What kind of strange things had been going on here during the years when the Lakeland Republic was locked away behind closed borders?</div>
