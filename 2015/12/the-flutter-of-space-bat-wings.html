You don’t actually know a time or a culture until you discover the thoughts that its people can’t allow themselves to think. I had a reminder of that the other day, by way of my novel <i>Star’s Reach</i>. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m pleased to say that for a novel that violates pretty much every imaginable pop-culture clich<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>é </span>about the future, Star’s Reach has been selling quite well—enough so that the publisher has brought out two more SF novels set in deindustrial futures, and is looking for other manuscripts along the same lines. What’s more, Star’s Reach has also started to inspire spinoffs and adaptations: a graphic novel is in the works, so is a roleplaying game, and so is<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'> </span><a href=http://merigaproject.blogspot.com/ >an anthology of short stories by other authors</a><span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'> </span>set in the world sketched out in my novel. All of this came as a welcome surprise to me; far more surprising, though ultimately rather less welcome, was an ebullient email I received asking whether <i>Star’s Reach</i> was available to be optioned for a television miniseries<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For a variety of reasons, some of which will become clear as we proceed, I’ll call the person who got in touch with me Buck Rogers. He praised <i>Star’s Reach</i> to the skies, and went on at length about wanting to do something that was utterly faithful to the book. As I think most of my readers know by now, I haven’t owned a television in my adult life and have zero interest in changing that, even to see one of my own stories on the screen. I could readily see that people who like television might find a video adaptation entertaining, though, and no doubt it would make a welcome change from the endless rehash of overfamiliar tropes about the future that fills so much of science fiction these days<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<br>
Ah, but then came the inevitable email explaining exactly what kind of adaptation Buck Rogers had in mind. It was going to be more than just a miniseries, he explained. It was going to be a regular series, the events of my novel were going to provide the plot for the first year, and after that—why, after that, he was promptly going to drag in one of the currently popular bits of hypertechnological handwaving so the characters in my story could go zooming off to the stars. Whee!<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who haven’t turned the pages of<i> Star’s Reach</i> may welcome a bit of explanation here. The core theme of Star’s Reach—the mainspring that powers the plot—is precisely that humanity isn’t going to the stars; the contrast between the grandiose gizmocentric fantasies of today’s industrial world and the grubby realities of life in 25th-century Meriga frames and guides the entire novel. An adaptation of <i>Star’s Reach</i> that removes that little detail and replaces it with yet another rehash of the interstellar-travel trope is thus a bit like an adaptation of Tolkien’s <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> in which the hobbits enthusiastically sell out to the powers of evil and Sauron wins<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I communicated this to Buck Rogers, and got back a lengthy response of the take-my-ball-and-go-home variety, saying in a hurt tone that I was wrong and just didn’t understand how his proposal fit perfectly with my story. I sent him a polite note wishing him luck in his future projects, and that was that. All in all, I think the situation turned out for the best. I’m not particularly desperate for money—certainly not desperate enough to be willing to see one of my favorite books gutted, stuffed, and mounted on the nose cone of an imaginary starship—and this way I still have the movie and TV rights, on the off chance that somebody ever wants to film the story I wrote, rather than a parody of it<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was only after I’d clicked the “send” button on the short polite note just mentioned that I realized that there was something really quite strange about Buck Rogers’ final email. He had taken issue at rather some length with almost everything I’d said while trying to explain to him why his proposal wasn’t one I could accept, with one exception. It wasn’t a small exception, either. It was the core issue I’d raised at quite some length: that he’d taken a story about what happens when humanity can’t go to the stars, and tried to turn it into a story about humanity going to the stars. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I don’t think that absence was any kind of accident, either. You don’t actually know a time or a culture until you discover the thoughts that its people can’t allow themselves to think.<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This wasn’t the only time <i>Star’s Reach </i>had attracted that same sort of doublethink, for that matter. Back when it was being written and posted online an episode at a time, I could count nearly every month on hearing from people who enthused about how wonderful the story was, and in the next breath tried to push me into inserting some pop-culture cliché about what the future is supposed to look like. Far more often than not, the point of the insertion was to show that “progress” was still on track and would eventually lead to a more “advanced” society—that is, a society like ours. When I explained that the story is about what happens when “progress,” in the sense that word has today, is over forever, and our kind of society is a fading memory of the troubled past, they simply insisted all the louder that the changes they wanted me to make were perfectly consistent with my story. <br>

Regular readers may also recall<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'> </span><a href=../../2015/11/the-heresy-of-technological-choice.html>the discussion a few weeks back</a><span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'> </span>of the way so many people’s brains seem to freeze up when faced with the idea that others might choose not to use the latest technology, and might instead keep using older technologies they like better. Further back in this blog’s trajectory, <a href=../../2010/04/blindness-to-systems.html>three or four other topics</a>—most notably the prospects for the survival of the internet in a deindustrializing world—reliably triggered the same odd behavior pattern, an obsessive evasion of the point accompanied by the weirdly stereotyped repetition of some set of canned talking points. <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>  <w:WordDocument>   <w:View>Normal</w:View>   <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom>   <w:TrackMoves/>   <w:TrackFormatting/>   <w:PunctuationKerning/>   <w:ValidateAgainstSchemas/>   <w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>false</w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>   <w:IgnoreMixedContent>false</w:IgnoreMixedContent>   <w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>false</w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>   <w:DoNotPromoteQF/>   <w:LidThemeOther>EN-US</w:LidThemeOther>   <w:LidThemeAsian>X-NONE</w:LidThemeAsian>   <w:LidThemeComplexScript>X-NONE</w:LidThemeComplexScript>   <w:Compatibility>    <w:BreakWrappedTables/>    <w:SnapToGridInCell/>    <w:WrapTextWithPunct/>    <w:UseAsianBreakRules/>    <w:DontGrowAutofit/>    <w:SplitPgBreakAndParaMark/>    <w:DontVertAlignCellWithSp/>    <w:DontBreakConstrainedForcedTables/>    <w:DontVertAlignInTxbx/>    <w:Word11KerningPairs/>    <w:CachedColBalance/>   </w:Compatibility>   <w:BrowserLevel>MicrosoftInternetExplorer4</w:BrowserLevel>   <m:mathPr>    <m:mathFont m:val="Cambria Math"/>    <m:brkBin m:val="before"/>    <m:brkBinSub m:val="--"/>    <m:smallFrac m:val="off"/>    <m:dispDef/>    <m:lMargin m:val="0"/>    <m:rMargin m:val="0"/>    <m:defJc m:val="centerGroup"/>    <m:wrapIndent m:val="1440"/>    <m:intLim m:val="subSup"/>    <m:naryLim m:val="undOvr"/>   </m:mathPr></w:WordDocument> </xml><![endif]--><br>

</span>It’s fascinating, at least to me, that so many topics brought up in this blog seem to function, for some readers, as a kind of elephant’s graveyard of the mind, a place where thinking goes to die. That said, among all the things that trigger a mental Blue Screen of Death in a portion of my readers, challenging the frankly rather bizarre notion that humanity’s destiny centers on interstellar travel stands at least a little apart, in the sheer intensity of the emotional reactions it rouses. If I try to call attention to the other evasions on the list, I get a blank look or, at most, an irritated one, followed by an instant return to the evasions. On the subject of interstellar travel, by contrast, I get instant pushback: “No, no, no, there’s got to be some grandiose technofetishistic deus ex machina that will let us go to the STARZ!!!” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The question in my mind is why this particular bit of endlessly rehashed science fiction has gotten so tight a hold on the collective imagination of our age<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I suppose a case can be made that its ascendancy in science fiction itself was inevitable. SF in its pulp days found its main audience among teenage boys, after all, and so it makes sense that the genre would fixate on the imagery of climbing aboard a giant metal penis to be squirted into the gaping void of space. Even so, plenty of other images that were just as appealing to the adolescent male imagination, and just as popular in the early days of the genre, somehow got recognized as hackneyed tropes along the route that led from the pulp magazines of the 1920s and 1930s to the paperback SF novels of today, while interstellar travel has so far evaded that fate<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By the time I first started writing science fiction, for example, everyone had more or less noticed that traveling to an exotic future by way of suspended animation, or the couple of other standard gimmicks, had been done to death decades before, and deserved a rest. Somehow, though, very few people noticed that traveling to an exotic planet by way of one of the three or four standard gimmicks for interstellar travel had been overused just as thoroughly by that time, if not more so, and deserved at least as much of a break—and of course it’s gotten even more of a workout since then<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s reached the point, in fact, that with embarrassingly few exceptions, you have your choice between two and only two futures in today’s science fiction: you can have interplanetary travel or apocalyptic collapse, take your pick. No other futures need apply—and of course the same thing is true even when people think they’re talking about the actual future. So taut a fixation clearly has something to communicate. I think I’ve figured out part of what it’s trying to say, with the help of one of the authors who helped make science fiction the frankly more imaginative genre it was in the days before the Space Patrol took over exclusive management. Yes, that would be the inimitable H.P. Lovecraft.<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Few people nowadays think of Lovecraft as a science fiction writer at all. This strikes me as a major lapse, and not just because the man wrote some classic gizmocentric stories and made the theme of alien contact a major concern of his fiction. He was unique among the authors of imaginative fiction in his generation in tackling the most challenging of all the discoveries of twentieth century science—the sheer scale, in space and time, of the universe in which human beings find themselves<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould coined the term “deep time” for the immensities of past and future that reduce our familiar human timescales to pipsqueak proportions. It’s a useful coinage, and might well be paired with the phrase “deep space,” meaning the spatial vastness that does the same trick to our human sense of distance. Lovecraft understood deep time and deep space to an extent few of his contemporaries shared—an extent that allowed him to take firm grasp of the yawning chasm between our species’ sense of self-importance and its actual place in the cosmos<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If the view of the universe revealed to us by modern science is even approximately accurate—and, like Lovecraft, I have no doubt of this—then the entire history of our species, from its emergence sometime in the Pleistocene to its extinction at some as yet undetermined point in the future, is a brief incident on the wet film that covers the surface of a small planet circling an undistinguished star over to one side of an ordinary galaxy. Is it important, that brief incident? To us, surely—but only to us. In Lovecraft’s words, we are “faced by the black, unfathomable gulph of the Outside, with its forever-unexplorable orbs &amp; its virtually certain sprinkling of utterly unknowable life-forms.” Notice the adjectives here: unfathomable, unexplorable, unknowable. What he’s saying here, and throughout his fiction as well, is plain: the message of deep time and deep space is that the cosmos is not there for our benefit<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></div>
<br>
That’s precisely the realization that so much of today’s science fiction is frantically trying not to get. The same sort of thinking that led ancient cultures to see bears, queens, and hunting dogs in the inkblot patterns of the skies has been put to hard work in the attempt to reimagine the cosmos as “New Worlds For Man,” a bona fide wonderland of real estate just waiting for our starships to show up and claim it. It’s not just ordinary acquisitiveness that drives this, though no doubt that plays a part; the core of it is the desperate desire to reduce the unhuman vastness of the cosmos to a human scale<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span><br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same kind of logic drives the fatuous claims that humanity will watch the sun die, or what have you. Let us please be real; if we get lucky, not to mention a good deal smarter than we’ve shown any sign of being so far, we might make it a few tens of millions of years (that is, five or ten thousand times the length of recorded history) before our mistakes or the ordinary crises of planetary history push us through extinction’s one-way turnstile. For all we know, other intelligent species may arise on this planet long after we’re gone, and pore over our fossilized bones, before they depart in turn. “Nor is it to be thought”—this is Lovecraft again, quoting his fictional<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'> </span><i>Necronomicon</i><span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>—</span>“that man is either the oldest or the last of earth’s masters.” Spooky, isn’t it? Now ask yourself this: why is it spook<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>y?</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The modern attempt to impose a human scale on the cosmos is actually something of an anomaly in terms of human cultures. If the ancient Greeks, for example, had gotten to telescopes and stratigraphy first, and figured out the actual immensity of space and time, that discovery wouldn’t have bothered them at all. Ancient Greek religion takes it as given that human beings simply aren’t that important in the scheme of things. Turn the pages of Hesiod, to drop only one famous name, and you’ll find a clear sense of the sharply limited place humanity has in the cosmos, and a calm acceptance of the eventual certainty of human extinction<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s one of history’s most savage ironies that the scientific discoveries that revealed the insignificance of humanity were made by societies whose religious ideas didn’t take that sensible view. Most versions of traditional Christian teaching place humanity at the center of the cosmic story: the world was made for our benefit, God himself became a man and died to save us, and as soon as the drama of human salvation is over, the world will end. Of all world religions, Christianity has historically been the most relentlessly anthropocentric—it can be understood in less human-centered terms, but by and large, it hasn’t been—and it was societies steeped in Christian ideas that first found themselves staring in horror at a cosmos in which anthropocentric ideas are all too clearly the last word in absurdity<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve discussed at some length in my recent book<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'> </span><a href="http://www.newsociety.com/affil.mvc?Affil=ARCH&amp;Page=../Books/A/After-Progress">After Progress</a><span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'> </span>how belief in progress was turned into a surrogate religion by people who found that they could no longer believe in Christian doctrine but still had the emotional needs that had once been met by Christian faith. The inability to tolerate doubts concerning “Man’s Destiny In The Stars” unfolds from the same conflict. Raised in a culture that’s still profoundly shaped by Christian attitudes, taught to think of the cosmos in anthropocentric terms, people in the United States today crash facefirst into the universe revealed by science, and cognitive dissonance is the inevitable result. No wonder so many of us are basically gaga these days<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Such reflections lead out toward any number of big questions. Just at the moment, though, I want to focus on something on a slightly less cosmic scale. Regular readers will remember that a while back, at the conclusion of the last Space Bats challenge, I wished aloud that someone would launch a quarterly magazine to publish the torrent of good stories set in deindustrial futures that people were clearly eager to write. The publication fairy was apparently listening, and I’m delighted to announce the launch of a new quarterly magazine of deindustrial science fiction<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>, </span><a href=http://intotheruins.com/ >Into The Ruins</a><span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span>Given the frankly astonishing quality of the stories submitted to the three Space Bats challenges we’ve had so far, I suspect that Into The Ruins is going to become one of those “must read” magazines that, like Weird Tales in the 1920s and 1930s, defines a genre and launches the careers of any number of major writers. This is a paying market, folks; let your writer friends know<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With that under way, we can start pushing the boundaries even further<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>.</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One criticism that’s been directed at past Space Bats challenges, and at the three published After Oil anthologies that have come out of them so far (the fourth will be published early in the new year), is that collapse has become a cliché in contemporary science fiction and culture. Mind you, a lot of those who make this criticism are in the unenviable position of the pot discussing the color of the kettle—I’m thinking here especially of SF writer and prolific blogger David Brin, whose novels fixate on the even more spectacularly overworked trope of salvation through technological progress, with space travel playing its usual hackneyed part—but there’s a point to the critique<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, I still think that the decline and fall of industrial civilization and the coming of a deindustrial dark age is far and away the most likely future we face. Day after day, year after year, decade after decade, the opportunities that might have gotten us out of that unwelcome future have slipped past, and the same mistakes that have been made by every other civilization on its way down have been made by ours. What’s more, there are still plenty of good stories waiting to be written about how industrial society ran itself into the ground and what happened then—it’s the apocalyptic end of the spectrum of possibilities that’s been written into the ground at this point, while the kind of ragged decline that usually happens in real history has barely been tapped as a source of stories. That said, since we’re talking about imaginative fiction, maybe it’s worth, for once, stepping entirely outside the binary of progress versus collapse, and seeing what the landscape looks like from a third option<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yes, the sound that you’re hearing is the flutter of space bat wings. It’s time for a new challenge, and this one is going to take a leap into the unthinkable<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The rules of the contest, in turn, are almost the same as before<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>: </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Stories should be between 2500 and 8500 words in length; <br>
They should be entirely the work of their author or authors, and should not borrow characters or setting from someone else’s work;<br>
They should be in English, with correct spelling, grammar and punctuation; <br>
They should be stories—narratives with a plot and characters—and not simply a guided tour of some corner of the future as the author imagines it; <br>
They should be set in our future, not in an alternate history or on some other planet;<br>
They should be works of realistic fiction or science fiction, not magical or supernatural fantasy—that is, the setting and story should follow the laws of nature as those are presently understood;<br>
They should take into account the reality of limits to growth, finite supplies of nonrenewable resources, and the other hard realities of our species’ current predicament; <br>
They should not include space travel—again, that weary cliché is long overdue for a rest;<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They should not rely on<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'> </span><a href=../../2011/09/invasion-of-space-bats.html>“alien space bats”</a><span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'> </span>to solve humanity’s problems—miraculous technological discoveries, the timely arrival of advanced alien civilizations, sudden lurches in consciousness that make everyone in the world start acting like characters in a bad utopian novel, or what have you;<br>
Finally, they must be set in futures in which neither continued technological progress nor the collapse of civilization take place<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I probably need to explain this last point in more detail. Through most of human history, progress was a very occasional thing, and most people could expect to use the same tools, do the same work, and live in the same conditions as their great-grandparents. The last three centuries changed that for a while, but that change was a temporary condition driven by the reckless exploitation of a half billion years of fossil sunlight. Now that the earth’s cookie jar of carbon is running short, to say nothing of all the other essential resources that are rapidly depleting, the conditions that made that burst of progress possible are ending, and it’s reasonable to assume that progress as we know it will end as well<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Does that mean that nothing new will ever be invented again? Of course not. It does mean the end of the relentless drive toward ever more extravagant uses of energy and resources that characterizes our current notions of progress. Future inventions will by and large use fewer resources and less energy than the things they replace, as was generally the case in the preindustrial past, and the pace of invention and technological obsolescence will decline very sharply from its present level. Authors who want to put interesting technologies into their stories are entirely welcome to do so—but don’t make the story about the onward march of gizmocentricity, please. That’s been done to death, and it’s boring<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>. </span></div>
<br>
In the same way, history is full of crises. Major wars come every few generations, nations collapse from time to time, whole civilizations decline and fall when they’ve exhausted their resource bases. All these things will happen in the future as they happened in the past, and it’s perfectly okay to put crises large or small into your stories. What I’m asking is that this time, your stories should not center on the process of collapse. Mind you, quite a few of the stories in the first three anthologies didn’t have that focus, and the fourth anthology—consisting of stories set at least a thousand years in the future—is entirely about other themes, so I don’t think this one will be too difficult. <br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br>
Neither progress nor collapse. That opens up a very wide and almost unexplored territory. What does the future look like if those overfamiliar options are removed from the equation? Give it a try.</div>

Second, those of you who tried to read the blog when it first went up were in for a feast of ransom-note typography and bad formatting; for some reason Blogger's software choked on something in the post, and I had to go in and fix everything, very nearly line by line, which won't have been easy to read!

It means that your ideas are interesting enough that someone found them profitable to exploit. I shouldn't be surprised, as <a href=http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2015/11/katniss-everdeen-dethrones-james-bond.html rel=nofollow>"The Hunger Games" Mockingjay-Part 2"</a>, the culmination of a series that features both apocalyptic collapse and continued technological progress simultaneously (but in which the loss of space travel is mourned in passing, pun intended), is big box office.

No way. Do you reckon that Buck Rogers actually read and understood the core themes of your novel? It is all very weird to me... Congrats on the strong sales too, I enjoyed the book immensely and never read it on online either due to limits to the amount of time that I spend online. I do prefer paper copies of books. <br><br>On the other hand it is nice to read that the devil visits you from time to time and that you are unprepared to sell your soul. ;-)<br><br>Well, I reckon a case might be made that people are actually selling their souls and their descendant’s souls too in order to pursue that distant objective of the stars. How else do they justify the casual cruelty that we inflict on this planet of which we are a part of? You see if a person acknowledges that the goal of the stars is unachievable then surely they then have to acknowledge all of the other little things that they are consciously or unconsciously doing that is done in the name of pursuing that progress goal? I don't have children, but pretty much everyone else that does have them, enjoys a hazy pleasantry of pretending to themselves that they can do such and such - despite the likely outcomes or cost to themselves - as long as their children will lead a better life. If we seriously damage the planet in the process, no problems, because our descendants can simply zip off to another fresh planet and start all over again. It seems a very daft belief to me, but I'm surrounded by that sort stuff on a day to day basis, so I don't worry about it anymore, nod my head sagely and just get on with dealing with things as they are.<br><br>And speaking of which, the way that global warming is going, we'll be lucky to get through the next decade without major disruptions to our infrastructure. I have to laugh when I read of the latest plans to tackle things like global warming - in the future, mind you - because it's already happening. I call the whole plans thing: A plan to make a plan. It is very exciting really because I've noted that people thereafter pat themselves on the back and say: Thankfully that's done and we don't have to think about all that unpleasantness again. Phew, what a relief!<br><br>What actually surprises me the most is the real reluctance on the part of our society to want to invest in our collective infrastructure - it is really weird because they seem to be pretending that it all doesn't matter. But I suspect that the costs of failing to do that are ratcheting up with each passing year. It has a lot of parallels to US national debt – which is a frankly bizarre situation which I’m expecting to blow up one of these days.<br><br>What is really weird is that people are pretending that we are in a deflationary period right now, but costs are going up all around me. What I’m seeing is inflation which is accelerating and it surprises me how effective the messages to the contrary have been. A postage stamp costs $0.70 per small letter today, but next week it will become $1.00 – oh yeah, and if you want the sort of service delivery that you expect today, I’ve been told that you have to purchase another $0.50 bar code stamp to put on the same envelope. Apologies, it is not a price increase to $1.50 per stamp and it couldn’t be inflation could it because we’re in a deflationary period.<br><br>I reckon a manned space program should be a bare minimum if space is to be even considered as an option at all. That's not working out so well though, is it?<br><br>Respect to Joel! Tidy work mate.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: I've got a new blog entry up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Devils haircut</a>. Summer has arrived with a bang.

Took me a while to regain my composure and continue reading. Wow, so much food for thought this week. It's interesting how much I've noticed people doubling down on their faith in progress in various forms lately--one of the most chilling things I hear is of the "I have faith in humanity" lines (why?!) along with the "tech will save us".

Have you read "Rare Earth Hypothesis" by Pete Ward and Donald Brownlee? It's very much in the category of what your talking about. A read of their book and a quick google search for comments about their book will show a very clear disconnection between what they actually say and what many members of the public claim that they say. Like the "Limits to Growth" and many other controversial works, the disconnect between what the authors say and what members of the public claim that they say can be painful.<br><br>One of the reasons why "Rare Earths" provokes such a disconnect is that it suggests very strongly that even if we could zoom around the galaxy at super-luminal velocities, there might not be an aweful lot of places to go with complex life and intelligence. In that sense, it's very much the opposite of the tradition that really kicked of with HPL who saw life and intelligence (and generally pretty aweful and nasty to boot) as being pretty ubiquitous throughout th universe.<br><br>Anyway : I was about to digress into a long winded rant but decided that it was probably too boring. Please consider reading "Rare Earths" simply because it's one of those books that people love to hate.<br><br>Finally : I'm working on a book (a very lengthy one actually) with the provisional title "Plan B for a post peak-oil world". I've been working on it for just over two years and I have about five of a total of twelve chapters done. Please feel free to offer advice on how I might get it published.<br><br><a href=#c3774925526936997011 title="comment permalink">12/9/15, 7:18 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_b7bedd" id=c2062096922838391338></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/09526612822765582881 rel=nofollow>Charles DeYoe</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I'm a little embarrassed to say that I have not yet read The Star's Reach but I definitely intend to! But as an interesting coincidence, I just yesterday finished watching a 1978 Japanese animated TV show called Future Boy Conan (aka Mirai Shonen Conan aka Conan: The Boy in Future) and feel like it has a premise you might approve of as far as children's entertainment goes. It's a rough adaptation of <i>The Incredible Tide</i> by Alexander Key (which I've never read since it's extremely out of print. The prologue shows that humanity destroys most of the land in World War III using imagery that makes the modern viewer instantly think of sea-level rise; some humans attempt to escape into outer space but their rocket fails and they crash to an island on earth. After a few years, one of the survivors on the island gives birth to Conan, the series protagonist and despite the bleak premise, a lot of the show's atmosphere is more "fun adventure" than anything else. Anyway, Conan ends up encountering the 'bad guys' who are an organization that's actually called "Industria" which is desperately clinging to the high-tech past, using slaves and military might as necessary. Meanwhile the 'good guys' live in "High Harbor" which is home to people who adopt a more rustic way of life and a far higher standard of living. And of course there are neutral parties and traitors to both sides, making it a bit more interesting than a simple "good guys/bad guys" type show.<br><br>I have no idea how interesting my summary is for you to read but if you'd like to see the opening, it's here: https://youtu.be/YqsUQZXLPcI<br>I think the imagery is pretty amazing for children's entertainment. I know you won't be watching the actual show but I feel like you'd appreciate knowing that it exists!<br><br><br>On another note, I've been mulling over the irrational demonization some folks in society get, such as that Victorian-style couple from a few weeks ago. A (non-Christian) friend sick of hearing anti-Muslim sentiment posted a picture of Mother Theresa on Facebook with the comment "Hmmm...she covered her hair for religious reasons. Think she's a terrorist?" which INSTANTLY inspired someone to respond saying that Mother Theresa was, in fact, "a terrible person." I know a lot of famous people provoke this kind of reaction: they'll tell you Gandhi was a pedophile, Martin Luther King, Jr. was misogynistic serial-adulterer, Abraham Lincoln was a racist, etc.<br>I suspect that this reaction comes from the nation's deep Protestant roots and the idea that since humans are flawed, they should never be admired. Basically that people should look <i>only</i> to divine figures like Jesus. I'm pretty sure most people pointing out these flaws are atheists, but I can't help but think that the mentality is extremely similar. They see someone looking positively about a "mere mortal" and feel compelled to brand that person a sinner.<br><br>I'll certainly subscribe to Into the Ruins and maybe I'll even try my hand at writing a story for the contest this time around.<br>ANYWAY I feel like I'm rambling so I'll end this comment here!<br><br><a href=#c2062096922838391338 title="comment permalink">12/9/15, 7:21 PM</a><br><br>

Please pardon me for not addressing your central argument in this week's post, but am I correct in assuming that you are familiar with what quantum theory has to say about space and time? I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on how quantum theory fits into your views on Man's place in the cosmos. Your writing (at least my limited experience of it) seems to address time and space from a strictly Materialist perspective. Not that there is anything wrong with that: I put great stock in your opinions on the future of humanity and the planet, and when I am in the mood for metaphysics I can find that on other blogs. Being mortal puts certain constraints on how we perceive space and time, so it is natural that ideas we have on the subject of the future should be expressed in language conducive to discussion. Yet be that as it may, I find it interesting that a blog written by an Archdruid is silent on any deeper spiritual aspect of the nature of reality. When Einstein said "space is what we measure with a rod, and time is what we measure with a clock" he meant that is all they are. The importance of that statement is that someone has to be engaged in the act of measuring. The concept of deep space and deep time is not really meaningful without consciousness. Of course that does not have to be human consciousness, but I don't recall you mentioning anything along this line of thinking in any of your posts so I am just giving free rein to my curiosity. What do Druids say about such things?<br><br><a href=#c5807719615668325209 title="comment permalink">12/9/15, 8:05 PM</a><br><br>

I enjoyed the book but in my opinion Twiligh's Last Gleaming was much more fun to read. I couldn't help but think Twilight would make an excellent movie. The story was original and completely at odds with just about everything out of Hollywood. Growing up watching movies instilled a love for film in me. Sadly most of what is made today is trash. There are usually less than a handful of movies made in a given year that are worth watching. The main problems are the scripts are terrible, and the plot lines are too far fetched. Maybe someone will see the genius of the Twilight and put it up on the big screen.<br><br><a href=#c2489944684222571233 title="comment permalink">12/9/15, 8:11 PM</a><br><br>

I can't find it online, but I have no doubt you have read it at least once!<br><br>I must admit I tend to toss Lovecraft into the "horror/fantasy" pigeonhole because of the way magic figures prominently in his mythos. The use of Magic in Lovecraft's stories probably deserves a column of its own from you (perhaps over at Galabes) since, like his cosmos, it is not human-centric. It's not "Harry Potter" type of magic, but neither is it Golden Dawn stuff either. Lovecraft's system of magic is interesting, often copied, rarely improved upon. <br><br>However, the above notwithstanding, my actual favorite Lovecraft story is "In the Walls of Eryx". People refer to that story as a deviation from the rest of Lovecraft's work because it is supposedly a straight-up sci-fi story. (Minor spoiler: A human space prospector for rare and valuable energy minerals on Venus becomes trapped in an invisible maze.) I like it because it's a refreshing change from the frankly repetitive nature of his horror/fantasy stories, which nevertheless keeps the most solid elements of his favorite themes: weird, horrifying, primitive natives with powerful secrets, and a cosmos which is bleakly indifferent to the well-being of humans. I love how that story is vaguely scientifically plausible (given the conceit of space travel, but it's only to our neighboring planet) and it doesn't involve extra dimensions or breaking the Newtonian laws of physics.<br><br><a href=#c3251742044603744465 title="comment permalink">12/9/15, 8:22 PM</a><br><br>

The physics of relativity make us forever time disconnected with distant stars, even if we could find a way to accelerate to speeds near to the speed of light. There are some people who cannot accept this, and have gone out of their way to construct elaborate counter theories which on the surface appear to be sound. They have all the right mathematics and derivations, but are making some assumption that are incorrect.

Science fiction in particular has grown immensely by a kind of debating process in which different versions of the same story, with different endings and meanings, got published sequentially by different writers -- think of Walter Miller's <i>A Canticle for Leibowitz</i> and Edgar Pangborn's <i>Davy</i> as opposing sides in a debate about the place of religion in a postatomic future, for example. My objection to Buck Rogers' rewrite is the same I would have made to an attempt by an editor to force the same change on the story -- it's an attempt to silence one, rather underrepresented, side of the debate. <br><br>Pinku-sensei, the interesting thing is that I've had two nibbles on <i>Star's Reach</i> so far -- one just asking about availability, then silence; the other from Buck Rogers. For all I know it might someday get filmed. As for a Hugo, nah, if things unfold the way they usually do, deindustrial SF will be stonewalled by the mainstream for decades, and will have to create its own award -- possibly the Richard, after Richard Jeffries, whose <i>After London</i> is the first work of deindustrial SF I know of. <br><br>Cherokee, I have no idea what Buck Rogers was thinking. As for "deflation," the reason people are talking about that is that we're in an economic condition that's not supposed to exist -- stagflation -- the Ghost of Energy Crises Past, marked by rising prices amid economic contraction. It may just slip over into hyperstagflation before too much longer. <br><br>Nuku, oh, granted. It's the unthinking wastefulness of a society that's never gotten around to grasping that nobody's going to clean up its messes for it. <br><br>Booststrapper, I've got plans for that as well -- once the internet becomes too unreliable, expensive, or both to be a good medium, all my back posts will be published in book for as they originally appeared.<br><br>Shane, glad you found that amusing! As for weirdness, no argument there -- I think we're seeing the sort of collective nervous breakdown that comes before an era of crisis. Hang onto your hat... <br><br>Zombie, I've read it -- an interesting hypothesis, and worth exploring. As for getting a book published, one huge advantage of the peak oil field is that you don't need an agent. Finish your book, and then go visit the website a publisher that does books on peak oil-related themes (look at your peak oil bookshelf for suggestions), find the submissions guidelines, and follow them exactly: you'll have as good a chance of getting into print as your book deserves. <br><br>Charles, I somehow failed to hear about <i>Future Boy Conan</i>. Fascinating that (according to online sources) it's apparently hugely popular in the Arab world! As for the obsessive demonization, yes, I think it has something to do with our society's religious background, but I think there's more to it than that. It's not accidental, I'd suggest, that it became popular in the wake of the Reagan era, when Americans by and large cashed in their ideals; when you've done that, nothing makes you more uncomfortable than someone who hasn't done so, and so finding some excuse to drag them down to your level becomes the order of the day. <br><br>JimK, and of course babbling on about interstellar travel allows them to continue to pursue the sort of "normal" American lifestyle that's destroying the planet. <br><br>HalFiore, that's one of many, many possible options. I'd encourage you to consider writing a story about that. <br><br>DeVaul, utopian fiction is always meant to push the boundaries of what we think we can be as human beings. That said, stay tuned; the narrative isn't yet half done, and we'll be seeing the Lakeland Republic from a range of other angles, some of them rather divergent...<br><br><a href=#c133064104170850277 title="comment permalink">12/9/15, 9:29 PM</a><br><br>

It really does mean a lot to me that people are willing to put their money down on a new project before the first issue has even come out. Trust me, I'll hold true to that obligation. Also, I initially had it on the subscription page that I was only taking subscriptions for U.S. addresses. After doing a bit of further research in regards to an inquiry, I've come to the conclusion that I CAN offer international subscriptions by shipping directly through my publisher. They're available at a higher price, so please email me directly at subscriptions@intotheruins.com to inquire about your specific locale. I'll get back to you with whether or not it's an option and what the price would be (it varies a bit depending on the country.)<br><br>Also, I just managed to get a blog up and running on the site shortly after JMG posted this week's entry.

Canned rules are for hack writers; if you're serious about your writing, find the voice, the style, the structure, the plot, and the person that fits your vision, and go with that, no matter what "the rules" say. <br><br>In the case of <i>Star's Reach</i>, it was clear to me from the beginning that the story needed to be told in the first person, in Trey's own voice, and in a nonlinear order -- basically, the raw materials of his autobiographical notebook as he sat in half-darkness wondering what was waiting in the vast dark abandoned facility around him. So that was what I did. In the same way, <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> is told in omniscient third person -- that was even more necessary than the first-person reminiscences of <i>Star's Reach</i>, in order to give the story the sense of impersonal events spinning out of control and sweeping up my characters into the maelstrom. In my latest completed novel -- the final title is <i>The Weird of Hali: Innsmouth</i>, and it's got a half-finished sequel at this point, <i>The Weird of Hali: Kingsport</i> -- it's third person but with a taut focus on the viewpoint character, because that allowed me to take the audience along for the ride as an ordinary grad student at Miskatonic University finds out that there are two sides to every story -- even the stories of the Cthulhu mythos. Any other approach wouldn't have permitted the same gradual slippage from ordinary college life to a wider world full of tentacled horrors that just might be the good guys after all...<br><br>You choose your voice, and your viewpoint, based on the story you want to tell. Ignore the canned rules. End of sermon! <br><br>Mike, nice. I like that, and wish I'd thought of it -- it would have made a very nice bit of background detail, with the rats as voiceless but expressive characters along for the ride. <br><br>Kevin, I write about things from a materialist perspective here because that provides a common ground for discussion. Are you at all familiar with Schopenhauer's discussion of the world as representation? That's pretty close to my take on things -- but introducing that here would cause a lot of confusion, and occupy far too many posts to explain. <br><br>Joe, do you mean that as satire, or is your imagination really that stunted? <br><br>Trmist, I agree! I think <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> would make a stunning movie; it's a very visual, very image-centered story, much more so than <i>Star's Reach</i>. Still, we'll have to see whether somebody in the movie industry notices that. (And then we'll see if they're willing to do that as written -- I can all too easily imagine a lot of pressure to change the ending so the USA is saved.)<br><br>Howard, no question, that's a big part of it. <br><br>Thomas, the interesting thing to me is that so much of Lovecraft doesn't use magic at all. <i>At the Mountains of Madness</i> is a science fiction story about alien contact; <i>Beyond the Walls of Sleep</i> and <i>From Beyond</i> are pure gizmo stories; the whole <i>Herbert West: Reanimator</i> series is a ghoulishly funny sendup of the Frankenstein motif; and of course there's <i>In the Walls of Eryx</i>, as you noted, which is classic space opera. He also did straight horror along the lines of <i>The Picture in the House</i>, and did it well. As for the stories that did use magic -- yes, that's probably worth a Galabes post one of these days. <br><br>Brien, write those puppies! While you're at it, next time you see your priest, could you please tell him from me that it's a pleasure to hear about a Christian clergyman who actually worships Christ rather than Progress, and is aware of the difference? Those are few and far between these days...<br><br>Aron, true enough!<br><br><a href=#c4778182653638936951 title="comment permalink">12/9/15, 10:33 PM</a><br><br>

If one travels at non-relativistic speeds similar to our existing spacecraft even the nearest stars are thousands of light years away or more. Obviously traveling to such stars at such speeds if it were possible using multiple generations or cryogenics would disconnect the travelers from earth by such large amounts of time. On the other hand one could travel to such stars in reasonable amounts of time by just increasing the speed. The problem here is that there is a limiting speed, the speed of light, and it takes ever greater amounts of energy to get closer to the speed of light (an infinite amount of energy is required to reach the speed of light). Let's say for the sake of argument that a spacecraft could get very close to the speed of light. The nearest star is about 4 light years away. Relative to earth the travelers would take 4 years to reach the star. Due to relativistic time dilation the travelers would experience a much shorter amount of time (~zero time for travel almost at the speed of light). Therefore even for the nearest stars a minimum disconnection of time of the order of years or decades would take place. For more distant starts centuries or more time would separate the travelers from the earth they left even if the trip for the travelers was short. The physics of time dilations can be found in any book or reference on special relativity. In my opinion this physics forever removes the possibility of jaunting around space from star to star in the same way as we currently travel from place to place on the earth. Even of possible, we would have to separate ourselves from earth and its current inhabitants in large amounts of time as well as space.<br><br><a href=#c747730154232535438 title="comment permalink">12/9/15, 11:45 PM</a><br><br>

It was standing in the fantasy section but after reading trough it i realized it was more a hybrid between fantasy and science fiction. <br><br>MINOR SPOILER ALERT!<br>The action actually takes place in Europe around 1000 years into the future. But it never openly says it out loud until later on in the trilogy, It just gives hints and small winks here and there. Everything looks like a very standard late medieval fantasy setting when you start reading it. But then you realize that the description of a cave system they are exploring reminds you about a parking garage. Or a castle where the center is built around a old high rise or skyscraper. <br>I also like the name they have for land that is destroyed by nuclear or chemical poisons from our time. Its called Promised Land.<br>And they are not trying to bring back progress or go to the stars in this story.<br>Even though the author has worked as a scientist and at one point he was qualified to say 'this isn't rocket science ... oh wait, it actually is'.<br>MINOR SPOILER ALERT!<br><br>It does contain fantasy magic aka Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter and the main character in the first trilogy is not a very nice person to put it mildly, especially in the first book so that might put some people off. It has some other flaws here and there but if you like fiction its worth checking out. And its a trilogy and all the books is released so you dont have to wait many years for the next book like with some other authors.

Still, I think the desire to "travel to the stars" is not necessarily an unnatural one. The trouble comes when this desire is filtered through a modern reductionist materialistic scientism. Then the result is a misplaced concrete-ism - the human desire for spiritual transcendence, to reach out in spirit and consciousness, translates into a desire to physically leave the earth in metal gizmoships. In the same manner, the desire for a "heaven on earth" becomes a hellish communism or nazism, the desire for an androgynous state of being becomes some form of hermaphroditism, etc. The time in which we live is replete with such misplaced concrete-isms.<br><br>I do think that HP Lovecraft's cosmic vision of things is correct, insofar as he could perceive; contemplation of the Immensities of Time and Space can be fearfully overwhelming. And the fact that everything seems to be composed of vibratory pixels and that we're living in a sea of insubstantiality can be a tad unsettling as well. But though his imagination futuristically saw the cosmos through the lens of a Hubble telescope, HPL was what we would call a thorough secular materialist. No, he didn't subscribe to anthropocentric fantasies re space-faring and the like, but his vision was, I think, limited. A more encompassing vision would have intuited that the immensity of Space and Time is something quite different when perceived with spiritual insight. In the more subtle realms of existence, distance, size, and time are not what they are in are in our material world, nor is space as "empty" as it appears to our material eyes - to paraphrase Jacob Boehme, every parsec of space is inhabited. In short, I tend to think the Immensities are a lot more negotiable, so to speak, in the spirit realm than they are in the material world.<br><br>In this sense, I don't think it's all that outrageously anthropocentric to believe that a parcel of the Whole incarnated as a man in this tiny corner of the universe in order to set an example of how to live and move in the Light. Probably happens when and where needed anywhere in the universe, I would imagine. Also in this sense, I tend to think that, though the human race is not dominant in Creation, we are part of the Whole, a part of the fabric, and as such, we play an important role in the balance of Creation - and we might continue to do so after our species has officially died out on planet earth. <br><br>As long as we are finite creatures, we must live finitely, and the Great Immensities serve to keep our anthropocentric fantasies in check. But this is not to say we are also spiritual beings who may in the fullness of time move among the stars - it just won't be in physical bodies. <br><br><br><a href=#c8629911008130647508 title="comment permalink">12/9/15, 11:58 PM</a><br><br>

Unfortunately these schemes inevitably involve some form of unobtainium or nearly impossible conditions to succeed. One of the more recent ideas in this direction is the concept of Alcubierre warp drive where the space craft essentially surfs on a wave of space-time. Unfortunately this trick requires a region of negative energy density which requires exotic matter yet to be discovered (see also unobtainium). There is actually a team at NASA pursuing this. I think this kind of technology is even more of a long shot than AI or fusion energy but again the belief that it must be possible since technology must advance is almost unshakable.<br><br><a href=#c4968218998892702959 title="comment permalink">12/10/15, 12:03 AM</a><br><br>

The thing I loved,the thing that stuck was the journey. The growing up of Berry and Trey through the story. And the different types of love that Trey discovers while meandering about from failure to failure. But, when I finished this time, apart from re-enjoying that aspect of it, I felt satisfied for the people of Meriga. I felt, that what they were going to have in place of wasted years trying to force the concept of inter-galactic travel upon the resources and finances and creative energies of the world was going to be that much more fulfilling. They couldn't go, but they could know.<br><br>For my two cents worth on the idea of it being a film, I would love to see someone like Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry take it on. I love their aesthetic vision, but also feel that they would have the sensitivity to deal with the theme of love and growth appropriately along with the dreams and Star's Reach scenes, without making it gaudy or hollywood plastique.<br><br>I would pay to see that on the big screen, and so would many others, and in the process of making millions of silly dollars, many minds could be sufficiently corrupted.

I don't get the impression that most people think about the future of humanity at all, except to blithely assume that it's pretty much going to resemble the present (maybe a bit better or a bit worse) - certainly there's no public discourse on the matter beyond, at best, 2050 or so - and a lot of people wouldn't consider living "in the stars" precisely *because* they're so Earth-centric they can't even believe we sent people to the Moon…<br><br>Not that you're wrong about the attitudes of people who *do* ask these questions; they tend to be the same sort who insist cold fusion is just around the corner and we should believe them because *they* understand the physics. Personally, I'm pretty certain the only way we could possibly - and I do not mean "probably" or even, "chance in a billion", I mean, "everything else is completely impossible" - travel between the stars is if members of some alien civilisation picked us up and took us there. Which might do good things for the human ego, but it's hardly likely, even if we do stick around for another ten million years.<br><br>Ten million years of evolution is the distance between ourselves and the chimpanzees or the gorillas. Our current form, Homo sapiens, has been around for maybe half a million years at the outside. We're generalists and pretty adaptable (even if we do have a bad habit of unbalancing our environment that far predates the industrial era) so it's not too unlikely that our lineage will persist a fair way into the future - in all the variable and diverse ways that characterise the hominins of the past. Our descendants might well be around in ten million years and they may even be something we would recognise as human (and vice versa) but they won't be the same species - singular or plural. Which is one of those unsettling thoughts of the kind most people can't even conceive, to add to the scale of the Universe and the inevitability of our civilisation's end. (Even if it doesn't collapse as such.)<br><br>Anyway, I must add Star's Reach to the Christmas list and see what the going rate is on a subscription of Into the Ruins across the pond.<br><br><a href=#c8755688857207907841 title="comment permalink">12/10/15, 12:33 AM</a><br><br>

Worm holes are the only scientific fitting concept to see the universe.

Japanes samurai swords steel making was only surpassed by modern high tech. Tech can exist as sample butnot for the masses. I reserve for myself for example to believe in immortal master in himalaya but not in mass production of such. <br><br>The desired story should concern a cultural stage below our current one in terms of hectic, waste and above Thunderdome, cannibalism, chaos. Biochar, archimedes screw, passive solar, feng shui, acupuncture, reiki, herbal remedies, civil war, corruption, slave like working conditions, wealthy oligarchs, narrow minded ritual practicing hypocritical priest caste, exploitation of women and children and foreigners or minorities. Essentiall nothing should change from the present except the pace of technological change, which should be a fairly static matter with wealth accumulation shifting glacially, determining caste. A one century story would be required to flesh out a wsr-peace cycle within a static culture. I think that any story should take the 4 genrrational theory into acount. E.g. i f the story took place in year 30 after crisis war then boomer type generation would be having kids, taking over frpm parents of gi fame. If it takes place in year 70, like today, corruption will be universal and hope zero, regardles of technology.

I would certainly like to see another version of the future injected into mainstream culture. But I can't fathom how someone would make that change to Star's Reach. The way it deals with our relationship to the stars without us going there is one of the things I love about it. Meditating on The Star card I feel that our relationship to the rest of the universe is of something of importance and mystery, but that the way much of sci-fi deals with it does not really deal with the depth of the issue. If you can find someone who will not butcher Star's Reach perhaps HBO or Netflix will produce it and it will find an audience.<br><br>I'm very excited about the the new space bats contest and Into The Ruins.

There's no energy source that can accelerate a starship anywhere close to the speed of light, and even if there were, it would still take not just years but generations to get there and back. Space-time may be curved, but not in a way that can bring distant points closer together.<br><br>By the way, the "Special Theory of Relativity" is much simpler than the "General Theory of Relativity". It's like finding a special case of a math problem that's much easier to solve than the general case. For example, if you're factoring trinomials (a high-school algebra problem), the general case is "a*x*x + b * x + c", which may require the quadratic formula to solve. A special case might be "assume a = 1, and b = 0, and c is the negative square of some integer d". Then the general case reduces to the special case "x*x - d*d", and the factors are just "x-d" and "x+d". The "special case" of Special Relativity is that the curvature of space-time is insignificant, so you can still use plane geometry to calculate distances.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c6978626068246762856 title="comment permalink">12/10/15, 6:31 AM</a><br><br>

It is curious to think how the ‘reaching for the stars metaphor’ has become treated as if it were a ‘scientific reality’ in ‘the future’. Such a concept as ‘the future’ it seems to me is itself a cultural artefact. The very term Science Fiction perhaps was supposed to award plausibility to a future we might in some ill-defined way participate in now? [I personally will not be participating in any future likely 10 or possibly 20 years from now!]<br><br>How un-pragmatic can we get? The heart of the matter was perhaps expressed by the saying that “technology you have never experienced before is indistinguishable from magic”. Note this idea of ‘magic’ also seems characteristic of our era. US Marine Corps logistics delivering supplies to remote Pacific island in WW2 is reported to have forced local political and societal structures to invent belief systems later known as ‘cargo cults’ in order for local minds to seem relevant (sane?). Most of us elsewhere were also ‘taken-in’ I guess.<br><br>I have been guilty in writing my own short stories for Space Bats 3 and now in SB 4 when I tried to hold on to much that I still know as dear to me. The question I posed to myself, but left undefined I think, was, ‘is it possible to avoid war’? If by good fortune or adroit use of circumstance, the places we live in can avoid the close-up experience of atrocity as an apparently ‘universal’ fact built-in to life, then a returning civilisation will know a different cast of mind.<br><br>This place where I live now experienced in the past a very real extended low in the human story (stories) – read some of the bleaker Border Ballads – where war and atrocity and malnutrition ruled the day. It is possible to feel in some of our areas pretty directly (a kind of magic), the aftermath of such badness.

I wonder if one could find an earlier acceptance of both a modern conception deep time-and-space and that Greek acknowledgement of our incidental existence one encounters in Leopardi's work—for instance in La Ginestra, written 1836 and translated here by Jonathan Galassi.<br><br>I see the stars<br>burning up above in purest blue,<br>which the sea reflects in the far distance<br>and, twinkling everywhere, the world<br>glistens in the empty sky.<br>And once my eyes have focused on those lights,<br>which seem a tiny point to them,<br>though they're enormous, so that next to these<br>the earth and sea<br>are in truth no greater than a speck<br>to which not only man<br>but this globe where man is nothing<br>is totally unknown; and when I see<br>these still more infinitely distant<br>nuclei, it seems, of stars<br>that look like haze to us, to which<br>not only man and earth but all our stars<br>together, infinite in size and number,<br>the golden sun among them,<br>are unfamiliar or else they appear<br>the way these look to earth: a point<br>of nebulous light—<br>how do I think of you then, sons of men?<br>And, considering<br>the way you are down here,<br>to which the earth I walk upon bears witness,<br>and that even so you see yourself<br>as lord and end assigned to Everything,<br>and how you were often flattered to relate<br>that the authors of the universe<br>came down to this mere grain of sand called earth<br>for love of you, and often condescended<br>to speak with you and yours,<br>and how you keep retailing absurd notions<br>insulting to the wise, down to our day,<br>which seemingly surpasses every other<br>in knowledge and civility; what emotion, then,<br>moral unhappy race, what notion of you<br>finally assails my heart? It's hard to say<br>whether it's laughter or pity that prevails.<br><br>Of course, it would be easy to dismiss Leopardi as a pessimist, which of course he is—one of his translators, Patrick Creagh, refers to him as a 'cosmic pessimist', a title that would be even more appropriate to Lovecraft—but that trait in-itself may have, after all, been necessary to diagnose the illusions behind a time, like our own still is today, characterized in it's myths by a kind of desperate optimism. <br><br>One should keep in mind that this writer, who could mockingly refer to "the magnificent, progressive destiny / of mankind" as being best represented by the blackened and petrified lava covering the slope of Mount Vesuvius, also remembered and wrote of the Italian soldiers who froze to death on the Russian steppe under the direction of the latest figure-head of progressive faith. These ideals of god-like transcendence—space travel, transhumanism, or whatever the latest idol happens to be—aren't merely absurd and impossible, they have a tendency to, as it were, manufacture suffering in the human and inhuman world. There are real consequences to the ideaology that "extols human nature above the stars."<br><br>Whether that attitude is inevitable or not is another question, but I suppose I've rambled far enough for this context.<br><br><a href=#c8749609982482093818 title="comment permalink">12/10/15, 7:34 AM</a><br><br>

I've been following as a lurker but been too busy to comment lately. This was an interesting and insightful article as usual; I was particularly pleased when my thought processes on the origins of the "to the stars" myth magically appeared a few paragraphs down after I thought them. Great minds and all that.<br><br>In my opinion, Lovecraft's successors betrayed the very purpose of those stories in much the same way that your would-be tv producer wanted to betray yours. As the backstories of these cosmic monsters became more elaborate, it gradually became classified and compiled into a single mythos. Beings whose very faces were supposed to drive men into utter madness were filed under "Great Old Ones" and "Outer Gods" with genealogical tables and autopsy-style drawings. The whole point of the thing is mystery that defies classification, and it is now thoroughly classified.<br><br>As for the "inevitable" journey to the stars, I think you hit the nail on the head with the pseudo-Christian role that it plays in the myth of progress. It is the auto-apotheosis of mankind, to coin a phrase, meant to substitute for the Second Coming. Mankind's destiny cannot be dust - that's simply abhorrent, to everyone. Even those who think there is no afterlife and that the universe will decay into heat death usually assign some greater place or meaning to our existence (including immortalizing us by belief in a "bulk" instead of linear time, in which case mankind always exists).<br><br>But I confess - and perhaps this is because I am a devout Catholic - that I don't understand this whole "we are unimportant to the universe" argument, for the simple reason that the entire argument appears to be based on size. What a bizarre qualifier for importance! As though Jupiter were "more important" than the Moon, or Goliath "more important" than David. Since when did size have anything to do with importance? Yes, the universe is mind-bogglingly large. I think this serves multiple purposes personally - to express every beautiful thing that God could express, to provide us with an inescapable sense of awe, to reveal to us the laws of nature, and so on - though I don't expect others to think the same way of course. <br><br>Nevertheless the universe is not a table-setting at the King's banquet, where only the people in the center count for anything. We aren't less important because we are smaller and less centrally-located than we once thought. We can live on the fringes, on a tiny pebble, and be the most valuable, precious thing in the universe. Or not. The size is no determinant. Indeed, the very "centeredness" of us was a statement on our baseness in the ancient and medieval eras, not our importance. We had the properties of corrupted dirt while the rest of the universe danced in perfect harmony among celestial spheres. Being one of those spheres could practically be considered an upgrade. The danger lies not in thinking we're important, but in the strange hybrid idea of inevitable, materialistic apotheosis. <br><br>Indeed, if the life of Christ suggests anything to us, it should be that the seemingly unimportant (say, a poor child born in a barn who dies as a criminal on the fringes of an ancient empire) to worldly standards can actually be central to spiritual ones. Earth is to the universe as Christ was to the first century: small, relatively unnoticed, on the outskirts, and incomparably precious.<br><br>Lastly, I'm glad to hear that there's another space bats challenge! I have a good idea that I've been working on that might be a perfect fit. And I may have to entertain branching out into post-industrial sci-fi in novel form...<br><br><a href=#c5796432209409750937 title="comment permalink">12/10/15, 8:11 AM</a><br><br>

And, an interesting topic challenge, might I say. <br><br>Some time back, I had an idea to do a polemic work on the three converging crises of our time. As I began research, and read from and about other works on each, it became apparent that no one really wants to hear about how impossible our "dreams" have become - though some of the problem arises from our own intransigence. Later, the sheer magnitude of the situation became overwhelming, and I pretty much set aside any factual presentation. <br><br>I set that aside much like an earlier beginning, where I had proposed to set out a 'biographic drama' to be titled, "The Space Men" in a reality based universe where mankind had actually introduced the species throughout the galaxy by way of small shiplets, each containing embryonic people, with a 'genesis machine' set to locate new earths on which these would be incubated, machine educated, and established on as many as possible. The thesis of the novel/novella was that communications between these colonies would be conducted by near-lightspeed craft, and the story would be told by the 'captains' of the ships. After suitable research, it became evident that said space men would quickly become insane. Like "Convergence," this was very depressing, and similarly set aside.<br><br>Being naturally the optimist, I see your challenge as providing an avenue to set forth a possible future in which nature asserts itself, as it no doubt will, and where humanity does what is necessary to survive in that future, as in a fit of sanguine positivism, we may assert that they surely must. A future where civilization does not crash and burn; where nations do survive (albeit it altered forms), and some strengths of character sustain, and moral ideals prove to be comforting and comfortable. In short, a future that is palatable for the average reader.<br><br>Maybe I will dust off that first research set, and see how those facts can be integrated into a story line... if at first you don't succeed, and all that. <br><br>Cheers!<br><br><a href=#c1853128640945617827 title="comment permalink">12/10/15, 8:15 AM</a><br><br>

I guess you told us that would happen as limits closed in on us. UNQUOTE<br><br>This reminds me of J.G. Ballard, writing through the character Maxted in 'Kingdome Come':<br><br>QUOTE “Look at the most religious areas of the world at present - the Middle East and the United States. These are sick societies, and they're going to get sicker. People are never more dangerous than when they have nothing left to believe in except God.” UNQUOTE<br><br>Ballard was writing about Islam and Christianity. The same process applies to a civil religion, in this case Progress (and Americanism). An Americanist Christian might have faith to fall back on, but secular Humanists must cling more feverishly to their tech toys as things unravel, and the Faith in tech rises to match their inverse prospects. They have nothing left to believe in but computers, and thou shalt not question Moore's Law.<br><br>When I came to the US in the early 90s, mixed in with the Star Trek, you could still see tech-skeptical shows on TV. History docs that gently mocked the euphoric faith in Progress at the 1900 new year celebrations and World's Fair. Such docs explained how that naive faith came to ruin in WW1, and later of course, WW2. Since then, what changed to push such a narrative completely out of bounds? Gulf War 1 (with Smart bombs) may have been a turning point, the de-Vietnamisation of the US imagination - with the rapid expansion of tech bubble 1.0. <br><br>In any event, it's terrifying to see the toytalitarian state of things now.<br><br>I believe it was in interview between JMG and Chris Martenson, in which CM described the 'iPhone moment'. He'll give a lecture, laying out the predicament. When it's over, a sector of the audience holds up their smart phones, as if to say "Tech will save us", or "They'll think of something".<br><br><br><a href=#c273066972799030728 title="comment permalink">12/10/15, 11:09 AM</a><br><br>

It's all well and good to mention how unimportant we are, but I see it a bit differently.

If life has value, and is worth preserving at all, then it's on our planet's life to preserve itself. At the moment, that means humans, since we're on the top of the heap technologically. We also know there have been massive extinction events in the past. We know we, as a species, had about a thousand ancestors survive a near-extinction event. We know many species have gone extinct in the past, and many currently are. We know eventually our earth will most likely be destroyed by our own sun.<br>It seems to me the only appropriate life-valuing response to that is to seed the other planets we can reach at all with life. Surely we have some thermophilic single-celled organisms that would like the long Venusian day. To be sure, Venus will not outlast us, but perhaps some of the outer system moons will. And perhaps whatever evolves on Venus will be, well, wiser and more suited to going beyond than we have been, so far.<br>Had our ancestors made different choices at the dawn of the petroleum era, perhaps humans would have been able to use our energy resources to go beyond.

I'm not at all surprised to hear the general reason for it. The specific reason does seem odd, though, not to mention terribly un-economical for a TV production (for instance, needing entirely different sets, models, and effects, and probably also a different <i>audience</i>, for the second season). Had Buck developed it that way I doubt that any production studio would have accepted it. Of if they had, they'd have persuaded him to make his season finale the pilot instead. In other words, doing a show about some people living after some generic collapse (such as a pandemic or world war) who stumble on a working starship and presumably meet some aliens. You'd end up with a series named Star's Reach without any of the novel in it.<br><br>(By the way, "stumbling on a working starship and meeting aliens after a destructive world war" is pretty close to the official Star Trek back story. A series about how some protagonists use that new technology and/or alien aid to help restore and reshape human civilization, and the very difficult problems they would encounter in doing so, might actually be interesting. Star Trek's timeline skips over that part, of course. What problems?)<br><br>The new contest theme is interesting. Definitions and distinctions are necessarily going to be vague, but to me the focus on the process of collapse (especially if the collapse is rapid) is the key difference between "apocalyptic" and "deindustrial" stories. For instance, <i>Little, Big</i> takes place concurrently with a collapse, but the focus is so far away that an inattentive reader might not even notice. More usually, a collapse can be part of the back-story that explains the present state of the world without being the focus of the immediate story. When the collapse is/was very slow, the boundaries blur farther. (<i>Retrotopia</i> is certainly not apocalyptic, and may or may not be deindustrial.) The stories in the first four <i>After Oil</i> volumes are a pretty good mix between directly portraying the process of collapse, and not doing so (usually in those cases focusing on life in the aftermath instead). But no comprehensive collapse at all, not even in the back story, would be a different animal still.<br><br>Quick contest rules question. Is the previous rule limiting submissions to one per author still in effect, or is it rescinded for this time around?<br><br><a href=#c206077990410469385 title="comment permalink">12/10/15, 12:31 PM</a><br><br>

This time I might even try to submit something myself if I can find a story to tell that interests me.<br><br>Your observations of cosmology put on a human scale reminded me of the "young earth creationists," who take literal interpretations of the first 5 books of the Old Testament to derive an age of the entirety of the cosmos that is less than ten thousand years. I'm also reminded of the near-permanent conviction among a not-insubstantial number of Christians for the last two thousand years, who are convinced that they will live to see the end of the world. The combination of these two things are an exaggerated way of collapsing the entirety of the history of the cosmos to a very human scale. Ten thousand years is much more accessible than is ten billion years, even if you have to assume a 900 year old man here and there to get there. Ten thousand years of time isn't even enough for light to get a tenth of the way across our galaxy, so don't trouble me with cosomological speed limits just yet -- the galaxy can simply inform my nighttime daydreams, the piece of cosmological paper I write my mythologies that tell me I'm the center of the universe and it was all built this way for <b><i>me</i></b>.<br><br>I think a lot of the emotional rejection of the idea that "progress" (as we've come to define that word) is over is similar to the death of the idea of heaven for someone who was once a Christian and now finds themselves an atheist. At least speaking for myself, I've found that while my conscious mind accepts the logic behind a rejection of heaven, there still exists in that sea of unconsciously-held emotional mythos an attachment to the idea that death isn't the end for some sort of "spirit," some sort of <i>je ne sais quoi</i> that makes me as an individual human into a self, that will survive in some form following the collapse and death of my body.<br><br>Truly letting go of heaven, and in fact not only resigning to my fate but <i>preferring</i> my eventual and inevitable death to something like everlasting life, takes a re-imagining of what it is that is good in the same way that letting go of the idea of interstellar travel and even <i>preferring</i> where it is we are actually headed as a species, which is extinction. How we get there is still up to us, just as what I do for the rest of my time alive is up to me. I can't wait to see what people think up for a possible narrative of a more graceful and dignified aging and death of humanity as contrasted with a fearful view of extinction and going down kicking and screaming.<br><br><a href=#c6498100084954319743 title="comment permalink">12/10/15, 1:13 PM</a><br><br>

From Wikipedia:<br>"Last and First Men: A Story of the Near and Far Future is a "future history" science fiction novel written in 1930 by the British author Olaf Stapledon. A work of unprecedented scale in the genre, it describes the history of humanity from the present onwards across two billion years[1] and eighteen distinct human species, of which our own is the first. Stapledon's conception of history is based on the Hegelian Dialectic, following a repetitive cycle with many varied civilisations rising from and descending back into savagery over millions of years, but it is also one of progress, as the later civilisations rise to far greater heights than the first. The book anticipates the science of genetic engineering, and is an early example of the fictional supermind; a consciousness composed of many telepathically-linked individuals."

Lewis, in his interplanetary trilogy, sketched out another, and there are still others. My point is not that it can't be done, but that it has so rarely been done, and the historically Christian cultures of the West have tended toward a relentless anthropocentrism, partly justified by their take on Christianity, that left them completely unprepared for deep space and deep time. <br><br>Dau, the thing is, I think any producer who took the story seriously, and didn't just try to use it as a container for special effects, could make a good film out of it.

Don't edit while you're writing -- that's where writer's block comes from; just keep your pen or your fingertips moving, and don't worry about the quality of what comes out. There will be time for that when you've got your first draft and are ready to begin editing, which is where you put the quality in. <br><br>Donalfagan, yes, I know. You're probably right about Tom, but it's sad. <br><br>Ben, exactly. If Mars is such a wonderful opportunity, why haven't we colonized Antarctica yet? It's got a better climate than Mars, air and water are a lot easier to get there, it's got at least as much in the way of untapped resources, and the transportation costs are lower. <br><br>Renaissance, I think that's part of it -- but only part. <br><br>LatheChuck, thank you!<br><br>Raven, why, yes, it does, doesn't it?<br><br><a href=#c2862639744027985934 title="comment permalink">12/10/15, 1:35 PM</a><br><br>

Go to online forums like SNAFU, f-16.net or Breaking Defense and look around at some of the discussion threads and you'll see what I'm talking about.<br><br>Moreover, its the same set of weird pathologies and mental blocks that you described in your post. I have seen the same exact responses that you described, but from F-35 fanboys when I and others have tried to point out the problems and shortcomings of the Lardbucket and questioned its usefulness in a real war. It's as if these people literally cannot process information that contradicts the party line that they've bought into. It's a scary and sobering thing to observe first hand.<br><br>I don't doubt that part of it is due to the fact that the US military has literally bet the farm when it comes to tactical airpower on the F-35. If the Lardbucket does in fact turn out to be a useless, overpriced piece of junk that will be outclassed by contemporary Russian and Chinese stealth fighters which will likely be combat-ready before the Lardbucket is, the US military stands to lose its long-accustomed air superiority in future wars. <br><br>Militarily, that's hard to overstate the importance of. The last time the US military had to fight for air superiority was in 1943. The US has had overwhelming air superiority in every military campaign since then. The closest the US came to losing air superiority in the post-war period was in the early days of the Korean War. A lot of American weapons systems, force structures and tactics are based on the assumption that American military forces will always have control of the skies. By contrast, the Russians and Chinese have always assumed they would have to fight for air superiority in a major war and their ground and naval forces are structured and trained on the assumption that they have to be prepared to operate without it.<br><br>So if American forces find themselves in a major war with an enemy that has better airplanes and air superiority, its going to come as an extremely rude shock and given the techno-dependency and the entitlement mentality that pervades American society these days, I expect that American military forces would crumple in short order due to psychological shock, if nothing else.

It's no secret that the original Star Wars was written as an anti-war Vietnam allegory, and Lucas drew heavily on Joseph Campbell's mythological instruction, with plenty of Jungian archetypes and some hero twins tossed into the story pot to brew up a decent tale. Ironic then that it became so successful, with (American) audiences identifying so readily with the rebel forces and despising the evil empire.

I’ll try not to be too incomprehensible.<br>People feel trapped on the earth because they only allow themselves to consciously perceive things within the very rigid, materialistic, progress-oriented mindset that is fashionable at this point in history--even though there are elements of human experience that have no place in that worldview--and that creates a rather claustrophobic conception of reality. It never occurs to them that they might be stuck inside an idea rather than a in a physical place, though, because their mindset does not allow for awareness of itself. So instead of recognizing that they feel trapped within a concept--a realization that their mindset cannot allow--they transfer the trapped feeling to something that the mindset can allow--physical space. Thus, the earth feels intolerably confining, and they pine after the stars.<br> There was a period where I felt like that, at least, but I never did get along too well with conventional reality and I cheerfully abandoned it as soon as the opportunity arose. This was due in large part to your other blog, by the way, so many thanks for that.<br><br>I’m a long time reader of your blogs, but this is my first time commenting.

One of the other effects of relativity, beyond time dilation and issues with accelerating up to the speed of light, is the way that motion affects how one effectively slices space-time into space and time, and how much of the distance between two events becomes time and how much of the duration between two events becomes space. Two objects that aren't right next to each other moving the same way can never agree on what events are simultaneous or not at a distance and thus what 'now' is far away, with the disagreement going up both with the speed difference and the spatial distance. Over the distances that exist in the cosmos, this can add up - getting up from your couch and walking across the living room changes what instant you would call 'now' in the Andromeda galaxy by about a week! (and the Earth's rotation is hundreds of times as bad) (though you'd need to move in the same direction for about two million years before you saw that 'now' and the difference became visible).<br><br>Speaking of space... one doesn't have to consider the cosmos to be our destiny to find it important, or worthy of exploration or study, for its *own sake*. What sometimes annoys me about Tyson and other current pop science types much more than Carl Sagan ever did is the way they always seem to need to bring talking about the universe back to humanity and what it means for US, while as often as not it seemed that Sagan would talk about humanity as one expression of the magnificent variety of things that can and do happen in the universe.<br><br>Tony B<br><br><a href=#c8899436146426736250 title="comment permalink">12/10/15, 4:35 PM</a><br><br>

I would note that incomparably precious doesn't mean other things can't also be precious, of course. And as I mentioned, I don't expect others to accept my view. It's simply the idea that size has something to do with importance that I take issue with. Is there a certain amount of time or relative size that's necessary before something, some beings, should be considered "important?" Like if there had only been a thousand stars, and we had been around for 23% of the universe's existence, then we're important, but less than that and we couldn't be? <br><br>I think we can all agree, on reflection, that it's an absurd notion. It's an argument that confuses awe with insignificance. I don't intend that to be an argument FOR the importance of mankind, mind you - merely a defeater of the argument that the scale of the universe means we are unimportant.<br><br><a href=#c6449706210132675043 title="comment permalink">12/10/15, 4:58 PM</a><br><br>

Japan's were not on ego trips, but quite business-like about the whole thing. It sounds like you get your big adventure in the spotlight, where you are too busy with the assigned work for more than a few passing glances at the Earth below you and you get to experience a few phenomena that are only momentarily available near the ground, such as by falling off a cliff. Then, before you know it, it's all over and you have to cross your fingers that you don't burn up on reentry. We all have seen posters of how our "blue marble" looked from the moon. How many of us are still awed? I enjoy identifying obscure bits of scenery from an airplane at 30,000 feet, and could do it for hours. But months?<br><br>Just staying on the Earth is proving to be a bigger and bigger adventure every day. In Japan, someone from the weather bureau usually turns on the north wind about November or so each year, and they leave it blowing and blowing, resulting in excess air conditioning to the islands until about March, when a cold front (ironically) finally manages to shut the blasted thing down. This November, however, they'd barely get it running when another cold front would come through and shut it off again. Today we have yet another front passing, with the south wind preceding it at hurricane speeds, warming our town to balmy, and probably melting any snow that managed to accumulate on Mt. Fuji. About a decade ago we were visited on December 1 by a typhoon of tropical origin, with similarly impressive results. Toyama on the Japan Sea side is having three consecutive days of sun in December, something they haven't seen in more than 60 years. This is an El Nino, for whatever that is worth, but nothing like any of the other El Ninos I've experienced in Japan. The last La Nina sent a torrent of water and debris down the nearest mountain, and nearly lofted our van into the creek. It will be interesting to see what the next one does.<br>Whatever the case may be, I'll attempt to stand under a waterfall nearby to celebrate the upcoming winter solstice.<br><br><a href=#c6226319847988638283 title="comment permalink">12/10/15, 5:49 PM</a><br><br>

I figured that the most likely modification, after the space travel business, was replacing the amorphous blobby Cetans with scantily clad starlets in yellow body paint. As for the Lakeland Republic, it's actually halfway between the two -- not a prediction, but a way to explore actual possibilities (even though they doubtless won't be assembled in that particular order). <br><br>Dammerung, er, that would be the Terence McKenna who predicted the arrival of infinite novelty on December 21, 2012? <br><br>Twilight, I put a passage in <i>Star's Reach</i> about that -- it's the received wisdom in 25th century Meriga that the people in our time had all those lights going outside all the time to keep them from having to see the stars and notice that the universe was so much bigger than they were. <br><br>Tazmic, it's a common misconception that anything in the mind must be a thought. Look at the keyboard of your computer. Can you choose to perceive it any way other than the way you actually perceive it? Not without damage to your sense organs. And yet it's as much in your mind as a thought is -- a representation that, as philosophers and cognitive scientists have both pointed out, has only the most distant third-hand relationship to the "thing in itself" that the image in your mind represents. In the same way, the cosmos in all its vastness around us is a representation, not a thought, though we can think thoughts about it. As for our position in the scale of things, why, if we were as small as a molecule or as big as a galaxy, I suspect we'd say exactly the same thing, because "biggest" and "smallest" are simply labels for the biggest and smallest things we are capable of perceiving...<br><br>Patricia, that's why I point out that expecting the human race to live forever is just as idiotic as expecting any one of us to live forever. I suspect that ditching the fantasy of immortality is just as important a mark of maturity for a species as it is for an individual. <br><br>Ekkar, fascinating. Yes, that would make sense -- the fantasy of going to the stars as a psychological escape from an unhappy life situation. <br><br>Sven, sorry about your keyboard. I really have no way of predicting which of my utterances will cause coffee explosions, though -- one of the minor drawbacks of Aspergers syndrome. <br><br>Bob, and then the services start bickering about whether the entire US military budget gets devoted to the ship, the tank, or the plane.<br><br>Ghung, that could be part of it.

I'd seen the Charlie Stross essay, and also the over-the-top tantrums it garnered from the SF community; I hadn't seen the Kim Stanley Robinson piece. <br><br>James, if I come up with any further deindustrial SF short stories, which is certainly possible, yes, I'll certainly consider the new magazine for them. <br><br>BoysMom, from my perspective, that sounds a lot like playing God. Shouldn't we instead let other planets come up with their own life forms, rather than imposing ours on them? <br><br>Myriad, yes, I figured that would be the way the series finally turned out -- a rehash of <i>Stargate</i> with a postapocalyptic Earthside setting, lots of glitzy special effects, and the aforementioned scantily clad cuties in yellow body paint playing the Cetans. As for the current contest, the one entry per author was just for the previous contest, in a desperate attempt to keep the number of stories down to manageable proportions. By all means write several for this contest if you wish. <br><br>Bruce, exactly -- the mythology of space travel is the exactly technolatrous equivalent of the mythology of young earth creationism and imminent rapture, an attempt to force deep space and deep time into the Procrustean bed of the human scale. <br><br>Sulla, fascinating. Can you think of any weapons system that's been this deeply mired in graft and endless delays, or has the Pentagon actually achieved something novel for once? <br><br>Gabeindc, now that's a classic worth revisiting. <br><br>Blueback, why, yes -- and that's why I put the F-35 Lardbucket into <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i> and had the defeat of the US Air Force in the skies above Tanzania play so central a role in the Chinese victory in the East African War. <br><br>Bill, oh, granted.

I hope it catches on. <br><br>Tony, of course the cosmos is beautiful and worth studying in its own right! A good case could be made that, as with so many other things, it's much easier to enjoy and treasure it for its own sake if you're not obsessed with the idea of doing something to it...<br><br>Derv, it's a logical fallacy to insist that a scale of relative importance implies a binary division such as "important up to this point, unimportant from there on." A cosmos consisting of one planet with one species on it would give that one species a position of greater relative importance than a cosmos of trillions of planets with billions of species on them would give to any one species on any one planet, and other cases would fill the spectrum in between. Now of course an intelligent divine being that happened to choose to carry out an act of incomparable preciousness could choose any planet and any species for that purpose, but insisting in the absence of any evidence that such a being is limited to one such act, and we just happen to be the species so selected, seems like spiritual pride to me. <br><br>Shane, American schoolchildren are taught to be ashamed of their creative abilities and their capacity to use language.

I have basically no contact with the world of video games, so appreciate the info. <br><br>Will, and yet we don't know the hearts of wombats, hummingbirds, et al. For all we know God became whale, and died under a whaler's harpoon in 1854 to bring salvation to whalekind. I've come to think that human beings will have achieve maturity as a species when we stop trying to be special -- and "more in need of salvation than any other species" is very much a claim to special status -- and come to terms with being just one mode of life among myriad others. <br><br>Max, we'll see. The crash has been announced prematurely before. <br><br>Mark, the former is a good example of what I was trying to avoid. I don't know how likely the latter would be. <br><br>Onething, I'm not arguing -- just pointing out that the same is true for every other being throughout the cosmos. <br><br>Blueback, hmm. I see Traditionalists such as Nasr as the mirror image of the Enlightenment, a movement that embraces all the same distinctions and simply reverses all the value judgments.

The series was titled "The Last Place On Earth". The poles and Mount Everest were literally the last spots on dry land to be subjected to these sorts of heroic First White Man to Set Foot expeditions. Africa and the Amazon jungle had already been done in the previous century. <br><br>Around the turn of the twentieth century, Rudyard Kipling wrote a pair of decent stories about delivering the mail by rocket and the Melies brothers made a fantasy film about a trip to the moon, but the theme of human space travel did not really catch on in popular culture until after the Great War, just as Westerners were running out of wild lands to explore and conquer on this planet.<br><br>I have not read any Russian science fiction, but my impression is that the Sputnik launch and the entire Soviet space program were motivated by the desire to demonstrate the superiority of their science and technology, not by a romantic belief that Humanity's Destiny Is In the Stars.

But from a Christian perspective (which I know you don't accept but for argument's sake), the idea that mankind holds a special place is revealed by our Creator. And believing such a thing based upon the authority of God is not at all prideful; it's an act of humility to accept what God has revealed on His authority. And in addition, this special place is a consequence of God's love, and not our own intrinsic worth.<br><br>But I'm sure you've tired of discussing this, so I'll let you have the last word and let it rest.

Such a wasted opportunity. Perhaps he jsut felt it wasn't marketable. I think he was dead wrong, and if kept true to form, would have been a potential hit. <br><br>Nobody thought GoT would work in visual form. The producers brought George RR Martin directly in the loop, made every effort to keep it true to the original vision, minimized the magic deus ex machinas as the author did, and it blew up the interwebs and HBO. I think people hunger for clever storytelling that questions their expectations.<br><br>Shortly after I started following your blog, you had a post on binary thinking. I think this is one of your gifts, getting people to step outside the black vs. white and tread the subversive foggy path of the gray. Perhaps in those mists, truths can be found.<br><br>I wonder if our unique binary political system has influenced a collective desire to define the world in binary terms. You are either red or blue (never green) socialist or capitalist (never gift economy or steady state) Christian or Musloatheist (never neopagan). Hence a discussion of the fate of Industrial civilization becomes the Google path to singularity and the internet of things, or a Mad Max live "in the caves".<br><br>I was shocked last week. I was talking about the fact that COP21 was an excersize in futility, that even if ALL the commitment to reductions happened (will the Senate ever ratify this. Ted Cruz: Filibuster) this leads to 2.7c (minus potential positive feedbacks or underestimated sensitivity in the climate system).

That being said, most of these games seem to have some cataclysm, whether personal (ending up on an island as a sole survivor of a plane crash) or global (nuclear war, a Carrington event, etc), which is consistent with the popular narrative that the only two futures are technorapture or the apocalypse.<br><br>Regarding the mighty F-35 Lardbucket: http://defensetech.org/2009/07/21/secret-program-works-to-field-seal-plane/. There are lots of articles on the subject, and all of them are fighting an uphill battle - Super Tucanos are what the US military actually needs for most purposes, but the embarrassment of buying a fighter plane from the Brazilians that would not have looked too out of place in WW2 is too much for the USAF. I read an article cheerleading the possibility of super-mobile US forces of the Future that are able to operate without infrastructure because the helicopters, V-22 Ospreys and of course, F-35s can all take off vertically. Never mind that an armed F-35 needs aerial refueling minutes after performing a VTOL. <br><br>Maybe I should write a short story about how after downing the fuel tankers needed to keep F-35s even pretending to fight a war with smuggled-in Chinese missiles, a squadron of Venezuelan Super Tucanos cripples an American expeditionary force's aircraft in minutes.<br><br>Maybe the US military can save money by merging into one fighting unit equipped with a stealthy, amphibious, supersonic version of this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_A-40.<br><br>JMG: "Shane, American schoolchildren are taught to be ashamed of their creative abilities and their capacity to use language.

And, my gut feeling is that it is accelerating here. Is that happening in your part of the world?<br><br>I cracked out a copy of Macroeconomics Third Edition (Hall and Taylor 1990 edition) - it is an exciting life here :-)! - just to see what they had to say on the subject of stagflation. You may be pleasantly surprised to note that the economic condition was described by Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson of M.I.T. and the text also acknowledged that an economy recently hit by serious materials price shocks might be in this condition. A sad and sorry state of affairs.<br><br>However, disappointment then set in because the text went on to suggest in less than a full page that the condition (which makes it sound like a sort of temporary illness?) was basically self-correcting as inflation and prices battle it out in the marketplace. The basic gist of the correction process was that: "falling prices are the key to recovery." - without discussing the actual mechanism. An interesting hypothesis which I'm sure will get a thorough workout and debunking over the next few short years. Which is a bit of a shame really and I believe down here the powers that be would prefer to wreck the economy itself than suffer from the indignity of inflation – so watch this space.<br><br>I'm genuinely surprised that the text did not mention issues of supply and demand for those materials, political responses etc. but instead relied on the workings of the invisible hand...<br><br>So, I read a bit further and came across an interesting chunk of honesty in relation to economic policy where it mentioned that current economic thinking, views the world in terms pursuing policies which decrease inflation at the cost of higher unemployment or vice versa. My take on that is that it is a brutal world view which props up the living standards of those with money and employment and creates a significant and ever growing under class of economic non-persons - but then that is just my take on the world. No wonder that the mantra: Growth will save us has such currency in the population as it allows the population to be unspeakably cruel to its fellow members.<br><br>The funny thing is that I reckon the various policy options to tackle inflation whilst pursuing growth have been maxxed out and the policy options are also subject to diminishing returns at an ever greater cost to society as a whole. My understanding here is that in order to reduce the supply of money in the economy (and thus keep inflation in check) is that the powers that be here are considering lifting the sales tax on all goods and services (which incidentally has turned most businesses into tax collectors thus outsourcing government tax collection costs to the population - but that is another story) from the current 10% to 15% - there is a really strong push for that. Add in the imminent shut down of the local car manufacturing industry which I reckon is a bad idea for strategic reasons, but also for the 250,000 people that work in it and may have invested their own capital in it. <br><br>Mate, my only take on this level of craziness is that the government is pursuing the deliberate crashing of the economy just to force prices down - there is no other possibility (other than the obvious other than it is just plain crazy). I can't believe that they would not be aware of the consequences of those actions?<br><br>Anyway, gotta bounce as I'm putting a couple of cubic metres of poo into the orchard today - it is amazing that people think of that stuff as a waste product. More fool them!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c3291110016391653550 title="comment permalink">12/11/15, 1:34 PM</a><br><br>

He says even in his non-fiction books that perhaps intelligent life on other planets isn´t fallen, or has been redeemed in some way we can´t possibly know. In "Mere Christianity", he takes the position that we can´t even know what arrangments God has made to redeem the non-Christian peoples. Your comment about the whale dying to save whalekind sounds incredibly Lewis-esque, although he would probably never say such a thing in public! In a pub, after a pint of beer, and in a semi-jocular mood...who knows? :D <br><br>Of course, Lewis was influenced by esotericism (as I learned just the other month or so, reading a book by Gareth Knight to that effect), so this could be his nod to the Neo-Platonic or even Theosophical tradition!<br><br>As for the Big One, Eric J Lerner has written a book titled "The Big Bang Never Happened". You probably won´t like it, though, since it´s based on the idea of Progress - Lerner (a kind of Quasi-Marxist) believes that modern cosmology isn´t progressive enough, since it implies that enthropy eventually kills progress! He´s also into fusion. That being said, Lerner´s book seems to be the most widely read critique of the Big Bang presently in print. He also has a website summarizing his arguments. His main one is that the theory needs ad hoc hypotheses to sustain itself, such as immense amounts of dark matter (which nobody has ever observed)...<br><br><a href=#c1906571330550607431 title="comment permalink">12/11/15, 1:37 PM</a><br><br>

For all we know God became whale, and died under a whaler's harpoon in 1854 to bring salvation to whalekind ....&lt;&lt;<br><br>Well, to be honest, John, I don't think that's entirely fitting. Christ-Whale would not have been harpooned, but rather would have died at the flukes of his or her bro and sis whales, nearly all of whom would have highly chaffed at Christ-Whale's insistence that they not privilege themselves over those risible bipedal creatures clambering about on dry land. <br><br>And it would have been in 1773, not 1854. <br><br>Actually, for all they may have evolved in sentience and self-awareness, I won't believe whales are in need of salvation until they start launching hellfire missiles at each other.

The worst hit on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning in the area where I live. There was lots of property damage, landslides, washed out roads and flooding in Washington State and Oregon and at least two people were killed. One of the smaller towns in the area where I live still has hundreds of people in staying in emergency shelters and evacuation orders were issued yesterday for some of the outlying areas because of road closures due to washed out roads and landslides. There are also thousands still without electrical power because of downed powerlines and damage to substations.<br><br>I live in a small industrial town in Southwestern Washington State. The last few years have definitely seen a lot of unusual weather. Last year, we actually had a tornado blow through the middle of the town where I live. I was at my favorite local indie coffee shop when it blew through and saw it as it passed by. Pretty scary when a tornado passes close by only a few hundred feet from where you are sitting. The street out front of the coffee shop looked like the inside of a wind tunnel. There was quite a bit of property damage including the roof of a school gym that was completely pulled off. Fortunately, there were no fatalities or serious injuries. Thing is, the last time the area I live in got hit by a tornado was in the 1920's. <br><br>Last winter was an unusually dry one and we had a really dry summer as well, enough that there have been serious concerns about the snow pack in the Olympic and Cascade Mountain ranges and the governor of Washington State actually declared an state of emergency this summer because of that.

A friend of mine who is a retired engineer and used to work for the BPA tells me that at least we stand a good chance of the snowpack, aquifers and reservoirs being replenished, which a good thing because the long-term forecasts that I have seen suggest the sort of dry winters that we saw last year will probably be the new normal.<br><br><a href=#c6567948296785679146 title="comment permalink">12/11/15, 5:20 PM</a><br><br>

As I read the post it struck me that all the things which you stated about humanities insignificance in the grand scheme of things only really applies, if we don't somehow find a way of "this rock". If humanity somehow finds a way to colonize the universe then suddenly humanity becomes extremely relevant. If interstellar colonization were possible our descendants could leave there mark all across the universe, further given the number of redundant populations wandering around it becomes credible that humanity or it's descendants could continue to exist on the order of billions of years thus making humanity significant in time. If interstellar travel is not possible however, then it becomes clear as you have stated that human existence is in the grand scheme of things "a brief incident on the wet film that covers the surface of a small planet circling an undistinguished star over to one side of an ordinary galaxy." If humanity never reaches the stars the fact of our material existence, which according to materialism is the only form of existence we have will eventually be engulfed by first earth's geological forces, and then by Sun itself before being ejected out into interstellar space, essentially making it as if we had never existed. If humanity goes to the stars, our mark on human society, according to materialism the only immortality we have, can be spread far and wide throughout the universe. It is this I think people give up, when they realize that interstellar travel just ain't gonna happen.<br><br><a href=#c2331941857731063113 title="comment permalink">12/12/15, 4:31 AM</a><br><br>

Good for you for turning down such a bad offer. I'm not a writer, but I do still find your process and trials in writing very informative.<br><br>A couple of responses to my fellow commenters:<br><br>Max Osman: re the shale bubble popping: Near our US home, ('near' in Wyoming terms - about 2 hours drive then 1 hour hike up the mountain) sits a lonely rusted old oil well. It's been sitting still there on national park land for decades. A few years ago it's 10 year lease was about to expire and the powers that be were considering whether or not to renew the license to the owners could drill. Our little town was in a fracking panic as we only have well water and have seen what fracking did in Pavilion. I was asked to join them in writing to our Congress-Critter who would decide whether or not to extend the owner's lease and let them drill. Our area has been through the exploratory searches and not enough oil or gas was found to make drilling worth anyone's while. I didn't think, but didn't know if there was a real threat for us.<br><br>Before writing anything I spent a few days researching the issue and the well itself online and discovered it was owned by a hedge fund company in NYC. They were actively selling shares in it. Well, I and my town wrote our letters, but IMHO, we needn't have worried. They were granted an extension of the lease, (our Congress Critter is useless), but they didn't drill. No one ever came out to even look at the thing. It was a scam. I'm sure some investors in NYC and elsewhere lost something on it, possibly a lot. They may still be selling shares in the useless thing. It was very interesting and creepy seeing both sides - seeing behind the curtain of such a scam taking place. Interesting (and creepy) now to see it all fall apart. It's no surprise at all.<br><br>Mark Rice: I LOVE both of those books, have read 'Cloud Atlas' 3 times and may pick it up again, now that you mention it! <br>"With every crime and every kindness, we birth our future".<br><br>Blueback: Thanks so much for the link, Nasr is a fantastic lecturer! You're right, very much overlap with our own dear and revered Archdruid in ideas, even some details. Quite chilling, but I've also thought a lot about his concluding ideas, in essence: with our very existence we are all killing/harming/taking from the planet. And there are too many of us taking too much. The charitable intentions of saving and prolonging lives is at this time in history suddenly incompatible with saving the lives of our future generations. There are no easy answers anymore. <br><br>Finally: Hellgrrl: As the mom of 2 older teen gamers - I agree. The young are more switched on than we think, probably more so than we are. AND deindustrial lifestyle, crafts &amp; skills, warfare etc... are a big part of some of their games - even the fantasy based ones. It has on a number of occasions prompted my kids to pick up the real tools, saw, hammer, sanders and needle and thread and make real things, (OK, mostly weapons &amp; shields) for themselves. Oddly it's given my grannyish hobbies of soap-making and veggie gardening some street-cred, (garden cred?) with them. :)<br><br><a href=#c6128063807256300850 title="comment permalink">12/12/15, 5:34 AM</a><br><br>

You say that submissions to the anthology should take place in a future where neither infinite technological progress nor collapse of civilization occurs. But a few sentences earlier you acknowledge that whole civilizations do collapse when they exhaust their resource bases, which is indeed what our current civilization is doing right now. Not to mention Star's Reach is set in a future where that happened. Maybe by "collapse" you're implying abruptness, as if one day industrial civilization is functioning perfectly and the next week it's a thing of the past, but the end results of that and a century-long decline seem quite similar: a less politically and economically complex society with much smaller energy usage due to the lack of abundant fossil fuels.<br><br><a href=#c2666126611671890197 title="comment permalink">12/12/15, 5:37 AM</a><br><br>

It is one of the more lyrical pieces of fiction I think I've ever read. The contrast between the bleak, if dignified setting, the sincere characters, and the poetry of your writing is just incredibly poignant. I can absolutely see why it would make a good RPG, although it lacks the magic, melodrama, and/or violence that seems to fuel the plot in the one's I'm familiar with. However, I don't play them myself so there are many I haven't heard of from friends that do. I do hope it goes over well. The world you created is almost irresistible for another author to not want to dive into but nobody, other than you, will do it justice with fan fiction. <br><br>As for the TV show, I can only guess that Buck Rogers was grasping for a longer plot line. There was a time when a non-comedy show about the lives of interesting characters in an interesting place would have made for very good TV. Not so much anymore. Today there has to be war, violence, melodrama, preferably sprinkled with at least a few zombies and vampires. The everyday life of a humble Ruineman just wont cut it. At the same time, just like the manic search of "growth" in every other sector of our economy, a successful TV show must drag itself forward season after season for as many years as possible, until it breathes it's last ludicrous gasp of boring irrelevance. Heading into outer space, as utterly ridiculous as the plot turn is, is one of the few ways to guarantee an endless supply of riveting adventure for Trey &amp; company to have. A movie, or high budget HBO miniseries would be a much more appropriate format, but obviously not the business that Buck Rodgers was in. Maybe that will come to pass. I would love to see it done justice on a big screen.<br><br><a href=#c617750849084538759 title="comment permalink">12/12/15, 10:34 AM</a><br><br>

I have several half completed stories from previous challenges, but they all seemed to be guided tours without a proper plot. Perhaps there could be a spot on the green wizards site for these, that others could pick through for ideas like I pick through the auto wreckers for parts for my old truck? Anyways, the basic idea for the religion is that someone decides/reveals that the earth itself is actually a generational lifeship, sent out on a long forgotten mission to transport life to some destination. The mystics/priests are of course concerned with what this mission was supposed to be, and who the original creators were. The day to day import is that if the planet is our "ship", then those that do things to harm the biosphere are considered "saboteurs". There are lots of grey areas such as whether a particular act or behaviour is actually sabotage or repair or improvement to the ships systems. This melds the religion of progress with a lot of the old religions, as well as Gaia being the name of the ship itself. I think that this is not a "Space Bat" as long as it stays as belief, and no actual creators are ever found. <br>So I offer this idea out to anyone with the only payment being able to see it put to use by others, as I have a terrible track record on completing my stories.<br><br><a href=#c6537496735593758568 title="comment permalink">12/12/15, 1:16 PM</a><br><br>

I know in Britain during the War that a lot of people who fled Britain were looked down upon for abandoning their country, and that the Royal Family garnered a lot of admiration for staying in London instead of evacuating to Canada. Along those lines, do you, personally, see the utility of staying so that you, or your ideas, would garner more respect than if you fled, and are you concerned about how fleeing would be perceived? Also, by staying do you think you could shape the outcome of what's to come more so than if you fled?

So if the government changed its methodology to make inflation appear to be 2% and sweep economic decline under the rug by spuriously low inflation adjustments, the official stats would make inflation out to be roughly 0%, hence the alarm about deflation.<br><br>Hyperinflation, however, did not happen as John Williams continues to predict, and it does not appear to be on the horizon, despite the large increase in the money supply caused by QE. The reason is that QE was only designed to buy up the banks' bad debt at what it was officially worth rather than its real value, replacing it with real money. This plus the bailouts transformed them from being bankrupt by any honest accounting standard to being technically solvent and able to get back to their nefarious behavior as if nothing happened. But there's no mechanism by which the printed money would reach the real economy - it went entirely to Wall St and stayed there. There is some indirect effect in that being solvent causes them to lend more, triggering some inflation by reinflating bubbles. But they can't lend rapidly enough to induce hyperinflation - if they tried, the reinflated bubbles would burst very quickly and it would be 2008 again.<br><br>The fact that he makes repeated failed predictions about hyperinflation makes me somewhat skeptical of him. It certainly seems reasonable to me that the government is deliberately understating inflation by changing their methodology so as to paper over economic decline - that would match what I've seen involving prices clearly increasing faster than ~2%/yr in the real economy, and the obvious fact that most people are worse off today than ten years ago despite what the economists and pundits say, unless "better off" means "having more powerful electronic gizmos". But one of the recurring themes of this blog is that people who repeatedly predict things that don't happen should be viewed less seriously, and it's time to start doing that with the people who called 2008 correctly but have been wrong since then. <br><br>That said, I suspect there is a fair amount of truth to what he says. If I ever get the time to scour all the economic data I can get my hands on and all the changes in methodology that have been made, it would be interesting to try to figure out what is really going on wrt inflation, GDP growth, and other economic stats that seem be manipulated and back out some sense of what is actually happening from the manipulated data.<br><br><a href=#c5308503484382045197 title="comment permalink">12/12/15, 2:37 PM</a><br><br>

I'll warn everyone, though, that if a more parsimonious model comes along to replace it, it will not look, to most people, like any sort of return to sanity, any more than relativity, QM, or heliocentrism were easy to accept. For instance, something makes the outer stars in galaxies orbit much faster than they would if the mass were distributed as it appears to be and gravitation works the way we think it does. If it's not dark matter, it's gravity leaking through parallel universes at great distances, or extra dimensions of time, or side effects of Wolfram's digital universe, or something comparably outrageous. It's <i>not</i> going to turn out to be, "Oops, just some dust on our telescope lenses, never mind!" And of course, the universe is under no obligation to make sense to us, or to always behave according to elegant epicycle-free theories.<br><br><a href=#c4703134254805494874 title="comment permalink">12/12/15, 4:26 PM</a><br><br>

The short version, offered essentially without any of the evidence to back the claims, goes something like this:<br><br>1. I'm quite certain that the existence of God can be concluded from reason and experience (see, for example, St. Thomas Aquinas' Five Arguments, Leibnitz, Anselm, et al.), and that God can further be deduced to possess a certain nature - all-good, all-knowing, and so on.<br><br>2. This God, in creating us with an intellect and will, created us with a nature perpetually unsatisfied with finite existence, and with an infinite capacity for understanding and love. As such, He created us with the desire and ability to know and love Him; if He didn't, then He created us with a nature that is essentially cruel, and His nature does not allow cruelty.<br><br>3. Concluding that God both exists and is knowable, it is then a matter of discovering how to know Him. I've concluded that He is known through the Catholic Church. The particulars of that are...well, extensive, and getting too in-depth for the present forum. Neverthess, I have what I believe are very good reasons for thinking this.<br><br>So there it is.

Moving that same history some 1500 years further into the future, <i>Finding Flotsam</i> is also set in a post-collapse recovery period. It's not, however, the collapse of <i>our</i> civilization—nobody (except a few historians) remembers that anymore—it's recovery from the biotech-based Old Biologist civilization that succeeded ours, and collapsed for its own reasons and in its own way.<br><br>I feel strongly that the collapse -&gt; recovery -&gt; equilibrium cycle is one important mechanism of succession in civilizations (as much as in the sequence of broad-leafed weeds to grasses to shrubbery to woodland to terminal forest and onward.) The future history I've begun to develop is an exploration of such a millennia-long sequence. I'd like to carry on with stories set in those two periods, and others along a long timeline. However, if that's contrary to the spirit of the current Space Bats contest, I'd be looking at something rather different...<br><br>Also, congratulations to @JoelCaris for launching <b>Into the Ruins</b>!

I have just come home to Sweden after a week in Paris and the COP21. There I spent time with activists, listened to talks and participated in some peaceful actions. Not that I think that actions really change anything, it´s more media communication than real action, however it is fun to do and I feel that I am among friends. Fighting "the man".<br><br>The reason why I was in Paris was because I was invited to a one minute shortfilm festival with the theme "Act on climate change". My film portrays a woman in a forest clad in iron age-like clothes who finds an ancient cracked ipad covered with millenias of lichen and fungi. A solar cell on the thing gets activated and the tribe woman sees a recorded message apologizing for how the people of our time messed everything up. The film is not a masterpiece in any way, but it has a clear message: This tribal woman who don´t understand a word of English and dumbfoundedly look into a magic talking brick can very well be a woman of the future. <br><br>In the process of editing I showed it to some people who really couldn´t understand it. How can the man in the ipad say "this is a message to the future" when it is clear that the woman getting the message is a figure of the past. She doesn´t wear futuristic clothes, she looks like a viking lady! Even after I named the fricking film "A message from the past" most people still thought it was a composted ipad travelling back in time talking about a message to the future. (You with me?)<br><br>Of course the message was better understood among climate activists in Paris. But when I talk with them about the deeper meaning of the film. That we most probably have to live with a lot less in the near future, due to lack of easily accessible energy and so on, the activists just won´t understand! Many of them travel around the world for their actvismus. They fight, they party and they shout: "Keep the carbon in the ground!". The carbon which obviously makes our lifestyle possible. When I tell them about a brighter future when we get more time to spend with friends and less stuff and maybe ride horses made of horse I get called a pessimist. I say: No, I´m a realist. They say: Humanity always find out something. <br><br>Because a life without touring the globe fighting for climate justice with laptop machines and street protests is just not comprehensible for these people. Maybe not even for me! I understand it. But I don´t wanna! Be stuck in Sweden eating rutabagas when I can take the plane to Paris for € 50 and eat moules de fricking frites?! It is understandable why people don´t want to see.<br><br>Now we live in the dream of “renewals”. It´s gonna solve everything. And if somebody think differently it´s just not worth taking in. It doesn´t exist. Anyways, thanks for letting me rant. I love your blog.

I began free-writing the evening I read the post and unlike the last time, I will complete and submit this story!<br><br>All engaged in the discussion of christian theology--<br><br>About two years ago, I came to an interesting decision re my spiritual perspective. Having been raised in a christian environment, I have a natural affinity for that structure, but had always wrestled with the specifics of the credos. It (finally) dawned on me that I did not have to accept the pronouncements of church councils simply because they were church councils and was free to decide for myself what I believed (duh!). At that point, I began to work backwards through the historical development of christian doctrine, until I arrived at the Council of Nicea, and realized that I could reject those findings as well. There were christianities before the rise of the current orthodoxy. Personally, I consider myself "christian" though most would say I'm a heretic of the highest order (a label I sometimes use myself). I consider Jesus of Nazareth a prophet in the mold of Elijah and the other prophets of old who stood with the poor and oppressed, spoke truth to power, and were generally executed for those stances. (I have taken to referring to him as Yeshua bar Yosef as a means of distinguishing the man from the god-man of the orthodoxy.) Reading the gospels in this light is educational, to say the least.<br><br><a href=#c661950782471380663 title="comment permalink">12/13/15, 1:37 PM</a><br><br>

In many European countries news and actual at-the-ground events have gone their separate ways after Green March by illegals truly started this summer. If you have not read about Green march to Spanish Sahara at 70's, you should... To save their federalist project the EU elites have thrown all requirements of honesty and reliability to the trash bin. Unfortunately for them, national and ethnic identities among Europeans and all tribes living around Mediterranean are so strong, so old, that their propaganda project is like putting lipstick to the pig. It does not fool anyone, at least outside circles of entitlement. Propaganda is not biting as they wish it should. <br><br>And it was, again, football riots which predicted who shall be main adversaries. During World Cup, French and Algerians living in France were chopping each other to pulp, and that truly showed the mood at the streets, from where the propaganda machine never informs. Religious and ethnic undertones were quite high around the continent during that sporting event, and it was like weather warning for things to come. Newspapers here are screaming recovery and climate negotiations, but I follow football events and internet fringe to truly know when duck and cover. As War Nerd pointed out years ago, new conflicts start where liberal Westerners are never looking. <br><br>It is like one big San Quentin prison yard, gangs marked and pre-destined by their ethnicity and identity, fighting to the bitter end, to win or fall among their owns. At least when it comes to Old World, you happen to be wrong with one aspect of this crisis of Peak Progress: you wrote once that old identities melt away during crises, to form wholly new ones. There is not even tentative blossoming pointing to that direction. During Roman collapse, old faiths of Rome had decayed for centuries, and new contenders were already there, lurking at the treshold, even before the final series of crises started. There is nothing like that this time around. There are no heavy-weight contenders for old faiths or current status quo, no new alternatives. Only Christianity of the Western Europe is tired and lost its grip, but it's contender is not a new faith, but it's old adversary. Everywhere else, even in Eastern Europe, it is time for joyous revival of old faiths, those once challenged by Enlightnment. Only those who follow religion of progress seem to believe otherwise in the Old World, and they are losing, quite fast.<br><br>I personally have thios fetish that I want to read at least semi-reliable news. Especially New World has been clouded by very, very propagandistic and unreliable information. It seems like fog of war has drifted and made allmost whole world to lurk among dense fog that distorts the landscape beyond any recognition.

On the other hand there are alternative people there too, but that song, "we are all citizens of the world", which is supposed to be the mantra of a new global culture, is basically a farce : affluent people can afford to be citizens of the entire world, plane ticket and hotel included, while the rest of the folks have to deal with their countries of residence where they are not citizens anymore. Not citizens, in terms of taking control of their destinies, but also not citizens economically, in the face of rampant unemployment, culturally, in the face of an omnipresence of the lowest common denominator (TV, which has gotten even stronger with the Internet which was supposed to overturn it).<br><br>In terms of political farce, France is a particularly poignant example this week, as the COP21, which it was hosting, ended at the same time as the regional elections, where left-wing and right-wing parties have allied to "blockade" the far-right. Goal reached, but a lot of disillusion as people now feel that they are being rehashed the same old promises as usual, while the masks have fallen, with supposedly opposed parties allying together, or the right allying with the far right... and an abysmal absence on the political scene for the ecologists and any sort of political discourse regarding actual ecological policies. Both the COP21 and the elections could possibly look like an incredibly expensive simulacrum, the circa while nobody really knows where the panem will come from. The big politicians are all talking about creating jobs, while news of growing unemployment keep on piling up.<br>You'd be interested to know that, at lunch at work, among the discussions this year have been revolving around making homemade fruit juices, and homemade bread. While the elephant in the room would have been an ongoing MnA operation of the industrial group with pretty uncomfortable consequences for all participants. Homemade soap was deemed too risky though...<br>It is fair to say that the disconnect between what people think and their daily lives has never been so great. Latest bit of farce : a looney teacher who cut himself and then invented an imaginary agression supposedly commited by ISIS... It is hard not to think of this place and time, 2015' France, as a pre-war situation, but the latest bit of media rout about Trump n Co make me feel like the USA are further ahead on that. I usually think that Jim Kunstler is an usual ranter, just waving doomsday signs to seel books. But to his credit, he does capture very well the uneasiness of the times.<br>At least intellectuals here are starting to take action to bring culture into more popular places. Maybe culture could save us... after the collapse of all the cultures revolving around big industries (communism, blue-collar culture, but also social involvement of people in all sorts of associations). I'll get my paperbound versions of Retrotopia under one arm, and a thermos of hot tea under another. Just no hands left for the loudspeaker.<br><br><a href=#c3589929226458770412 title="comment permalink">12/14/15, 2:36 PM</a><br><br>

Dunno it seems like a perplexing predicament. What do you reckon?&lt;&lt;<br><br>I don't want to take up to much space on this subject, one that has been pretzeling the minds of philosophers and theologians since the beginning of time - this is, after all, a blog about de-industrialization and how to deal with it - but I can offer this, inasmuch as it makes a certain intuitive sense to me: God is at one with Creation, and at the same time, Creation is separate from God. This would have to be so if the purpose of Creation is to provide God with a true partnership - and true partnership can only be chosen. So let us say that God is *innate* in all things in Creation. It is the responsibility, the divine commission, of Creation's consciously evolved life-forms to "spiritualize" Creation, that is, to bring forth the hidden god into full manifestation so that Creature and God become co-creators. Bottom line - though we may have been woven out of the body of God, we are still separate, and it is only by choice that we become divine partners. <br><br>Heres another way of looking at it: God exists in successive yet simultaneous "layers", the first being the primal fire (a.k.a. the "wrath of God"). We see this in raw, red in tooth and claw nature - nature's riot of sex, devouring, and death. God's second layer is the sublimation of the primal fire-energy into love, compassion, wisdom. This we also see in the beauties and symmetries of nature .... and of course, fully in Christ. Thus the primal fire and the sublimation are both components of God. However, if we refuse the sublimation and regress into the primal fire, we essentially choose evil. <br><br>Not easy to articulate. As Augustine said, "When I don't talk about God, I know Him. When I talk about Him, I don't know Him." <br><br><br><a href=#c2496464542669060332 title="comment permalink">12/14/15, 7:20 PM</a><br><br>

It really points out just how bizarre the abstract dualism of our time has become. As for COP21, well, yes -- we've just seen the passengers on the Titanic, with much fanfare, pass a resolution calling for a modest decrease in the rate that water is pouring into the hull. Those people who are talking snidely about living in treehouses and eating pinecones are busy creating a future in which they and their descendants are going to have nowhere to live and nothing to eat...<br><br>Shane, you might consider asking!<br><br>Nick, can you give me a citation on the fact that the Lardbucket needs refueling minutes after a vertical takeoff? That would be a <i>very</i> useful fact to be able to cite, but I'll need a source to quote. <br><br>Onething, oh, I know what you're trying to say. I'm trying to suggest that my metaphor may be closer to our actual situation than yours is. <br><br>Artorias, thank you. Did you ever hear about what happened when the Disney empire tried to option <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> during Tolkien's lifetime? They sent him a treatment that reduced the whole story to kiddie fantasy, of course, with the Fellowship riding giant eagles to their destination, and he told them to get stuffed. I've always admired that. <br><br>Leo, it's a remarkable book, no question. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, thanks for this! The ads are hilarious. <br><br>Jake, I'll definitely look him up. Many thanks!<br><br>Cherokee, I don't think they realize that they're crashing the economy. They live in a dreamworld where the invisible hand of the market always saves the day, and the raving delusions of economists are reality. As for stagflation, though, no argument there at all -- I expect to see hyperstagflation, with prices for necessities soaring while the economy contracts, before all this is over. <br><br>Tidlösa, Lewis was one of the last of the red hot Christian Neoplatonists, and a brilliant thinker when he didn't get too deeply caught up in journalistic polemics. His willingness to imagine different salvations for different species of <i>hmau</i> is something I find as refreshing as it is interesting. As for the ad hoc hypotheses, no question there -- those clouds of dark matter look more and more like epicycles with every day that passes. <br><br>Will, you're assuming that the mode of original sin from which whalekind needs salvation is the same as the one from which, according to Christian theory, humans need salvation -- I'm guessing otherwise. Similarly, when God became Triceratops (note the trinitarian symbolism) and sacrificed himself for the sake of a nest of hungry tyrannosaur hatchlings -- "take and eat, for this is my body" -- the sins from which dinosaurkind needed salvation were doubtless different still. Myself, I see no problem in extrapolating the same principle universally -- to borrow a quote from an old ritual, "all things have died that thou might live."<br><br><a href=#c11649158666999306 title="comment permalink">12/14/15, 10:16 PM</a><br><br>

Rossi's always promising to be about to put his units into production, and somehow that never happens -- there are always colorful excuses, but what it amounts to is that investors keep sinking more and more money into it and nothing comes out. To me, that says that it's a scam. <br><br>Blueback, where do you live? My dad's family is from Grays Harbor -- my grandfather was a firefighter in Aberdeen and my grandmother was the city librarian in Cosmopolis. <br><br>Sister BoysMom, we've explored precisely one other planet for life, not very thoroughly, and all we can say for the moment is that Mars doesn't seem to have any kind of life that we recognize. We know nothing whatever about the status of the rest of the solar system, to say nothing about the rest of the cosmos. That being the case, I'd rather we keep our litter at home! <br><br>Dagnarus, exactly. I'm sure the economic thing is also an issue, but I think the deepest issue is the denial of humanity's supposed cosmic importance. <br><br>Caryn, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Ezra, you might consider thinking about the difference between "decline" and "collapse" -- they're not the same thing. You might also consider the difference between "long ragged transformative process full of crises and difficulties" and "collapse." <br><br>Martin, well, yes. That's about my assessment as well. <br><br>Btidwell, I'd like to see a movie version of <i>Star's Reach</i> myself -- it's a very visual story and would lend itself well to cinema on the grand scale. Still, I ain't holding my breath. <br><br>Donalfagan, sheesh. Why don't they just start fantasizing about a tenth generation fighter with dilithium crystal powerplant and photon torpedoes? <br><br>Brother G., oh, granted. To my mind, if you've got an infinite and eternal God incarnating into creation, continuous incarnation in an infinite diversity of forms and expressions (and resulting salvific acts) is the only option that makes sense -- and it's not a unique idea to me by any means. I'd just like to see it get a little more press. <br><br>John, there's a definite limit to the height you can go without using a lot of electricity for elevators, too, so buildings of only a few stories are a good idea all around. <br><br>Dennis, hmm.

As for staying vs. going in the event of civil war, it'll depend on circumstances; I don't think it would do anything particularly helpful for my ideas if I were to be rounded up and shot by the government or the insurgents, either of whom might find my ideas vexing. Still, I haven't drawn any conclusions as yet. <br><br>Grebulocities, the problem as I see it is that stagflation is not inflation -- it's economic contraction combined with soaring real (that is, nonfinancial) costs in the productive economy, resulting in rising prices for necessities but declining prices for luxuries (since the market for the latter will be contracting as available wealth declines and joblessness soars). Thus it doesn't really fit anybody's models, and it's hard to track using simplistic "rising or falling prices" models. That's one of the reasons why so many predictions have fallen flat of late. <br><br>PatriciaT, any time from tomorrow morning to the death of the Universe -- and I can see waiving the latter limit if your story requires it!<br><br>Myriad, I suspect the lumps on the foreheads of the yellow-painted starlets would be a subject of quite some discussion among the special-effects flacks. As for the post-Big Bang theory, my guess -- and of course it's only a guess -- is that at least one other phenomenon besides velocity is going to turn out to cause red shift, and so every measurement based on the assumtion that red shift = velocity is going to go out the observatory window, causing complete chaos.<br><br>Derv, got it and thank you -- you're in the competition! If you could post a link to a Word 97 version of the story, though, that would be helpful; also, please put through a comment marked "not for posting" with your email address, so I can contact you if your story is selected. <br><br>Bill, I'd be willing to consider a story set in your existing future history so long as the collapse of the Waster civilization isn't a central focus of the narrative. On the other hand, you could also try something new, in which what happened to our civilization isn't well described by the word "collapse." <br><br>Mark, yes, I saw that! Many thanks. <br><br>Antroposcen, thank you for the link to the film! That's really an elegantly done piece -- if you ever get the necessary funding and want to do a film version of <i>Star's Reach</i>, we'll definitely talk, as you've got a visual language and a grasp of the shape of history that I think would work really well. If you don't mind, in an upcoming post I'm going to link to your film and talk about the reaction you got. <br><br>Bruce, excellent! Yes, <i>Star's Reach</i> is a story about stories -- about telling stories, with Trey as only one of several storytellers, and also about reading and learning from stories. I'm not sure how many people caught that. <br><br>Bob, Gibson's problem was that, as a cyberpunk author, he was always writing about a future that was simply the present with a coat of spraypaint on it. That's one of the reasons I found cyberpunk boring -- now admittedly it didn't help that I lived in Seattle at the time, and had to deal with hacker-and-slacker culture all the time anyway. One of the things I'd like to do with the Space Bats challenges is encourage people to explore futures that are genuinely different from today. <br><br>Buddha, I'll look forward to your story!<br><br>Nancy, thank you -- an elegant little poem. <br><br>Juhana, it's early days yet. Let's see what's left of Europe's national and ethnic identities two centuries from now, when two-thirds of Europe has been overwhelmed by waves of mass migration from Africa and the Middle East, and most of today's nations no longer exist.<br><br><a href=#c4933471187194892325 title="comment permalink">12/14/15, 11:07 PM</a><br><br>

If you've got the time one of these days, ask your children to talk about what kind of stories they want to read -- as opposed to the young adult crap they dislike -- and post something about that here. The publisher of the <i>After Oil</i> series is interested in young adult fiction and would benefit from hearing from his potential market! <br><br>LatheChuck, if it takes five years to train an F-35 mechanic, all the enemy has to do is concentrate on taking out the mechanics, and the entire US air arm will be out of commission for five years. I mean that quite seriously, btw!<br><br>Shane, it might. If you'd like to move to Cumberland, there are plenty of houses for sale <i>very</i> cheap -- the house we bought, a 1925 brick four-bedroom craftsman bungalow with full basement, cost $67,000, and prices have gone down since then -- and it's a pleasantly mellow place in a lot of ways. <br><br>Candace, the thing is, different cultures, eras, and individuals vary drastically in their willingness to embrace the authentically Other. "We humans" can't be categorized as simplistically as all that -- though you're right that some of us do behave that way, and Buck Rogers clearly was one of those.<br><br><a href=#c5791694215339833842 title="comment permalink">12/14/15, 11:17 PM</a><br><br>

Electronics has come up as an interest and we've ordered the parts to start building circuits and boards. I know nothing about it but a couple books and the child can teach herself. She'll be all set to repair small scale electronics which could be lucrative in the near future if people have things they must repair because they can't replace it, or something needs created to fix an immediate need and a product doesn't exist for it, like an alarm system for the chicken coop.

Allowing 3000 lb for the armament, pilot and miscellaneous fluids (2x1000 lb bombs, 2x300 lb air-to-air missiles, 200 lbs for pilot &amp; gear and 200 lbs of fluids), that leaves a margin of only 5000 pounds of fuel - which it will burn in 30 minutes at 50% power but could likely be stretched to an hour - the point is that vertical takeoff isn't viable without refuelling.

LOL Besides, I'm already collapsed, and not sure what I could do there to survive.<br>Being a mid-sized city in Kentucky, insecurity runs deep here and colors most all the civic decisions. There's a civic obsession with "catching up" with idealized "progressive" cities on the coasts. Recently, that's translated into Californication, as there is no shortage of trendy Californians fleeing the Golden State looking for literally greener pastures. Of course, this is wholeheartedly embraced as an unequivocal good by locals eager to attract Richard Florida's "creative class". Coming from a place that started Californicating over 20 years ago, I'm sure you appreciate the effects. Before that, it was Yankification, as poaching Northern factories and running them with non-union staff was celebrated as an unequivocal good. That's still pursued to some degree in rural areas, though most of those have been offshored by now.<br>I think it would be refreshing to live somewhere that unabashedly embraced it's heritage, warts and all, and wasn't afraid to be poor and backward. I'm noticing that every time I give up some classist stereotype and fear I hold about poor folk, I'm rewarded by greater understanding. I really am coming to fear trendy elites way more than poor folk now, and it's not like I don't qualify as impoverished, myself. I'm also aware of how much local food and organic agriculture has suffered from being embraced as a trendy status symbol of elites when poor people dismiss it out of hand because local organic food is considered the province of elites and not "the way things will be" once agribusiness can no longer be sustained.<br><br><a href=#c4495336513678432282 title="comment permalink">12/15/15, 10:33 AM</a><br><br>

The issue is that the F-35 is an attempt to continue the USAF's 70 year (since WW2 ended) practice of fighting opponents with equipment 20 years older than the USAF equipment with unlimited logistical support. (Even though the F-16, F-18, F-15, etc are 40 years old, they are substantially upgraded and would wipe the floor with their original incarnations just like they do with 40 year old MiGs). Although it is hard to say definitively how well F-35s would fare against the best of the Chinese or Russian air forces due to how classified the important systems are, the F-35s would have no hope without the ability to engage beyond visual range with missiles and aerial tanking to keep them flying.<br><br><a href=#c3500606806242717971 title="comment permalink">12/16/15, 2:41 PM</a><br><br>

Much like hummingbirds (who seem to have that attitude of dexterity, quickness, and ruthlessness). None of them can carry much fuel (and it depends on the kind of flying, just as your demands on your car affect your car's fuel usage.) At the beginning of Desert Shield, my sq's contingent flew with wing tanks, and still needed refuelling several times before they got close to the sand box.<br>(A routine F-16 training mission rarely lasted more than one hour, state-side. The more acrobatics you do, the more DACT, the more fuel you burn.) <br>Fighter a/c are things you want to get to a staging area (forward operating location), load weapons/bombs/whatever --some of ours dropped leaflet bombs, with chagrin--do two or three sorties from the FOL, then come home clean.<br>The more general observation, given to me while I was in training (for a career field that existed briefly, then was reconfigured once the AF made up its short-term mind, was this: The basic approach to weapons systems, like the fighter, was deliberately in contrast with the Soviet/Russian approach. While the Soviets/Russians/commies were building weapons systems/aircraft that were boringly reliable, readily amenable to fixes, "rodeo maintenance" and not flashy, the American way was to go for the best/highest/state-of-the-art tech.<br>The Russian approach, on dit, was for a lot of OK planes, while the US approach was for a few, really great planes.<br>That divergence was articulated. <br>So now when I watch (on NASA TV feed to my smartphone) how Soyuz just took a Brit and two Cosmonauts to the ISS, and the Soyuz CC did the docking manually, I'm most assuredly reminded of Russian dogged reliability. And I also noticed (for the symbolic meaning?) that the onboard welcoming crew, headed by Scott Kelly, one of the two Twins experiments, all wore blue shirts. None of the nationalistic colo(u)r displays.<br>They all know whose spacecraft will get them off the ISS, back to Kazakhstan. <br>As for maintenance crews for an aircraft (a/c): I did have horrified chuckle one day when I looked at the Manpower paper that posited, for an F-16 maintenance crew (the kids that take care of that one a/c) that the crew chief, a qualified F-16 guy, had three B-52 airmen on his crew.<br>A good crew chief can train his guys, even if they come from other fields, to handle the vicissitudes of the LawnDart (affectionate name for the F-16).<br>That may require some explanation (because earlier in the comments there was some exchange about the length of time needed to qualify a MX [Maintenance] Crew person. That five year figure seems squirrelly to me, maybe "a best approximation." I'd have to go into the rather good, apprentice-based training system which combines practical "on-the-job" training with book/manual subject matter training (and testing). My operational knowledge dates a while back, though.<br>How the Russians do it I don't know.<br><br><br><a href=#c2564071758992063179 title="comment permalink">12/16/15, 7:36 PM</a><br><br>
