<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the eleventh installment of an exploration of some of the possible futures discussed on this blog, using the toolkit of narrative fiction. Our narrator ventures out of Toledo into a tier one rural county and sees one of the alternative cultures taking shape in the Lakeland Republic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
***********</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We changed trains in Defiance. The station wasn’t much more than a raised platform running along each side of the tracks, with a shelter of cast iron and glass overhead to keep off any rain that might happen along. The day was shaping up clear and cool; the town looked like old county seats I’d seen in parts of upstate New York that hadn’t been flattened during the endgame of the Second Civil War, a patchwork of clapboard and brick with the county courthouse rising above the nearby roofs. I could see only two obvious differences—first, that the only vehicles on the streets were pulled by horses, and second, that all the houses looked lived in and all the businesses I could see seemed to be open. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The train west to Hicksville came after we’d waited about fifteen minutes. Colonel Pappas and I weren’t the only people waiting for it, either. Something close to a hundred people got off the train from Toledo with us, some in olive drab Lakeland Army uniforms, some in civilian clothing, all of them with luggage and most with long flat cases that I guessed held guns. Once Pappas rolled up the ramp onto one of the cars and I followed him, I found that the train was already more than half full, and it was the same mix, some soldiers, some civilians, plenty of firepower. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I sat down next to Pappas, who gestured expansively at the train. “Not what you’d usually see going to Hicksville,” he said. “Every other time of the year this is a twice a day milk run that hits every farm town between Bowling Green and Warsaw. This weekend it’s six or eight runs this size every day.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The train jolted into motion, and I watched Defiance slide past. After maybe a mile, we were rolling through farmland dotted with houses and barns. Some of the houses had wind turbines rising up above them and solar water heaters on the roofs, while others didn’t; tall antennas I guessed were meant for radio rose above most of them, but not all. The dirt roads looked well tended and the bridges were in good repair. I shook my head, trying to make sense of it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Checking out tier one?” Pappas asked me. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I glanced at him. “Pretty much. I wasn’t expecting to see the wind and solar gear.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“You’re thinking it’s tier one, how come they have tech that wasn’t around in 1830, right?” When I nodded, he laughed. “Outsiders always get hung up on that. Tier level just says what infrastructure gets paid for by county taxes. You can get whatever tech you want if it’s your own money.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“What about a veepad?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Sure, as long as you don’t expect somebody else to pay for a metanet to make it work.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I nodded again, conceding the point. “I get the sense that a lot of people here wouldn’t buy modern technology even if they could.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“True enough. Some of that’s religious—we’ve got a lot of Amish and Mennonites here, and there’re also some newer sects along the same lines, Keelyites, New Shakers, that sort of thing. Some of it’s political—most of the people in the full-on Resto parties are just as much into low-tech in their own lives as they are in their politics. They learned that lesson from the environmentalists before the war—you know about those?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was my turn to laugh. “Yeah. I had some of them in my family when I was a kid. ‘I want to save the Earth, but not enough to stop driving my SUV.’”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Bingo—and you know how much good that did. The Restos aren’t into that sort of hypocrisy, so a lot of them end up in low-tier counties and stick to simple tech.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“What do you think of that?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Me? I’m a city kid. I like nightlife, public transit—” He slapped one of the tires of his wheelchair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>“—smooth sidewalks. Tier one’s fun to visit but I’d rather live tier four or five.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The train rattled through farmland for an hour or so, stopping once at a little place named Sherwood, before we reached Hicksville. The station there was even more rudimentary than the one at Defiance, just a raised platform and a long single-story building with a peaked roof alongside the track, but Pappas had no trouble maneuvering his wheelchair on the platform once we got off the train. “We’ll wait here,” he told me. “Once the crowd clears someone’ll meet us.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He was right, of course. After a couple of minutes, as the train rolled westwards out of the station and the crowd started to thin, a young man in army uniform with corporal’s stripes on his sleeves wove his way toward us and saluted Pappas. “Colonel, sir,” he said, “good to see you.” To me:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“You’re Mr. Carr, right? Pleased to meet you. The jeep’s this way.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He wasn’t kidding. Sitting on the street next to the station, incongruous amid a press of horsedrawn carts and wagons, was what looked like a jeep straight out of a World War Two history vid. Pappas saw the expression on my face, and laughed. “The army’s got a lot of those,” he told me. “Good, cheap, sturdy, and it handles unpaved roads just fine.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“What fuel does it use?” I asked. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Oh, it’s diesel. Everything we use runs on vegetable oil if it doesn’t eat corned beef or hay.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Pappas hauled himself into the jeep’s front passenger seat while I tried to parse that. The corporal helped him get his wheelchair folded and stowed, then waved me to a seat in back and went to the driver’s seat. I got in next to the wheelchair, found a place for my suitcase, and got a firm grip on the grab bar as the engine roared to life. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Six blocks later we were on the edge of Hicksville. “Tomorrow’s action is twelve miles north of town,” Pappas told me. “We’ll be staying right near there—all the farmhouses around here rent out rooms to visitors. Melanie told me you want to see how people live in tier one; you’ll get an eyeful.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It took us half an hour to get to the farm Pappas had in mind, driving on what pretty clearly wasn’t the main road—now and then I could see dust rising off to the east, and a couple of times spotted what had to be a line of wagons and carts carrying people and luggage toward whatever was going to happen the next day. I speculated about why I wasn’t part of that line—Pappas’ rank, maybe? Or a courtesy toward a guest from outside who wasn’t used to horsedrawn travel? That latter irked me a bit, even though I was grateful for the quick trip. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finally the jeep swerved off the road, rattled along a rough driveway maybe a half mile long, and clattered to a stop in front of a sprawling clapboard-sided building three stories tall. Two others and a huge barn stood nearby, and fields, pastures, and gardens spread out in all directions around them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Welcome to Harmony Gathering,” Pappas said, turning half around in his seat. “I mentioned the New Shakers earlier, remember? You’re about to meet some of ‘em.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By the time he finished speaking the front door of the building swung open and a big gray-bearded man in overalls and a plain blue short-sleeved shirt came out. “Good day, Tom,” he called out. “And—Mr. Carr, I believe.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I got out of the jeep. “Peter Carr,” I said, shaking his hand. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’m Brother Orren. Be welcome to our Gathering.” He turned to the corporal. “Joe, do you need help with any of that?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Nah, I’ve got it.” The corporal came around, got the wheelchair unfolded, and Pappas slid into it. I got my suitcase; the gray-bearded man turned back to the door and nodded once, and a boy of ten or so dressed the same way he was came out at a trot, took the suitcase from me, gave me a big smile, and vanished back into the building with it.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Things hopping yet, Orren?” Pappas asked him. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Oh, very much so. You have plenty of company.” He motioned toward the door. “Shall we?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Inside the walls were bare and white, the furniture plain and sturdy, the air thick with the smell of baking bread. “Tom tells me that you’re from the Atlantic Republic,” the bearded man said to me. “I don’t believe our church has put down roots there yet. If you have questions—why, ask me, or anyone.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Thanks,” I said. “I’ll take you up on that once I figure out what to ask.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He beamed. “I’ll welcome that. Of course you’ll want to get the dust off first, and lunch will be ready shortly.” He turned and called out:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Sister Susannah? Could you show our guests to their rooms?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
An old woman with improbably green eyes, dressed in a plain blue dress, came into the room from a corridor I hadn’t noticed. “Of course. Come with me, please.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Don’t worry about me, Sue,” Pappas said. “I know the way.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That got a quiet laugh and a nod. Pappas rolled away down a different corridor, and the old woman led me up a nearby stair and down a long hall lined with doors. “This is yours,” she said, opening one. “Give me just a moment.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She smiled, went on further down the hall. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The room was a simple cubicle with a bed on one side, a dresser and desk on the other, and a window on the far end. The bare white walls and the plain sturdy furniture were scrupulously clean, and the bed had a thick colorful quilt on it. My suitcase had been set down neatly beside the dresser. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A moment later the old woman was back with two pitchers and a bowl. “Here you are,” she said, setting them on the desk. “If you need anything else, please ring the bell and someone will be up to help you right away.” She smiled again and left, closing the door behind her.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The pitchers turned out to contain hot and cold water. Towels and a washcloth hung on a rack near the door, and a little shelf next to it had a bar of soap on it that didn’t look as though it had ever seen the inside of a factory. Two bags hanging from the back of the door had hand-embroidered labels on them, <i>towels and linen </i>and <i>guest clothing</i>; over to one side was an oddly shaped chair that turned out on inspection to be some sort of portable toilet, with a big porcelain pot underneath that sealed with a tightly fitting lid when it wasn’t in use. Tier one, I thought, and decided to make the best of it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The funny thing was that the primitive accommodations weren’t actually that much more awkward or difficult to use than the facilities you’d find in a good hotel in Philadelphia. I wasn’t sure what I would be in for if I decided to take a bath, but I managed to get cleaned up and presentable in short order, and went out into the hall feeling distinctly ready for the lunch the old man had mentioned. I wondered for a moment if I should ring the bell, but that didn’t turn out to be necessary; as soon as I stepped out into the hall, the same boy who’d taken my suitcase up to the room came down the hall and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>gave me directions. As I left, he was hauling away the water pitchers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Lunch—sandwiches on homebaked whole-grain bread and big bowls of hearty chicken soup—was served in a big plain room in back, where big wooden tables and benches<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>ran in long rows, and the benches were full of men in Lakeland Republic uniforms; the only people who wore New Shaker blue were a couple of young men who brought out the food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“The people who live here eat in their own dining hall,” Pappas told me when I asked him about that. “You’re welcome to join them, if you don’t mind eating in perfect silence while somebody reads out loud from the Bible.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I’ll pass,” I said. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He laughed. “Me too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Sundays at Holy Trinity is enough religion for me, but I guess it works for them. They start a new Gathering somewhere every few years, they’re growing that fast.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I racked my brains for the little I knew about the original Shakers. “Do they swear off sex?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“No, that was the old Shakers. The New Shakers marry, or some of them do—Orren and Sue are a couple, for example. The brothers and sisters don’t own anything, not even a toothbrush, and live together like the old Shakers did.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“And the other sect you mentioned?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The Keelyites? They’re like the Amish, they own their own homes and farms, but they’ve got their own beliefs and their prophet Eleanor Keely put a third testament into their Bibles. They’ll tell you that when God said we have to live by the sweat of our brows, He meant that anything that’s not powered by human muscles is sinful.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“We’ve got Third Order Amish back home who say that,” I told him. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Pappas considered that. “I don’t think we have them here yet,” he said. “Now that the border’s opened, who knows? I bet they talk theology with the Keelyites. God knows what they’ll come up with.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
About the time I’d polished off lunch, Brother Orren came in and asked if I’d be interested in a tour of the Gathering—I gathered he’d been briefed by somebody—and I spent the afternoon trotting around the place with a soft-spoken guy in his early twenties named Micah, who had brown skin and a mane of frizzy red-brown hair. “My parents got killed in an air raid during the war of ‘49,” he told me as we walked toward the barn, “and the Gathering took me in. Any child who comes to us finds a home.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Did you ever consider leaving?” I asked. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I left when I was nineteen,” he told me. “Spent three years out in the world, two of them in the army. It was a learning experience. But I came back once I realized that this was where I belong.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Do you miss anything from outside the Gathering?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Oh, now and again. Still, there’s a song we inherited from the old Shakers; the first line is ‘Tis a gift to be simple’—and that’s true, at least for me. It’s a gift, and as we say, a grace, and I’m happier here than I ever was out there in the world.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
I thought about that as we walked through the barn, the greenhouses, and the rest of the Gathering. In its own way, it was impressive—a community of around two hundred people that met all its own needs from its own fields and workshops, and produced enough of a surplus to make it an asset to the local economy—but something about it troubled me, and I sat up late that night, by the glow of the one candle each room was allotted, trying to figure out what it was. </div>

To gain the advantages of living with the Gathering, you must give up some of those you currently enjoy. This is the rock upon which many 'Hippie" communes of the Sixties foundered; their inhabitants thought they could separate themselves economically from the mainstream, without giving up the 'benefits' of mainstream society.<br><br>Cheers!<br>Paul<br><br><a href=#c6806956489376558709 title="comment permalink">12/16/15, 7:53 PM</a><br><br>

I like this Retrotopia entry quite a bit. I thought we were going to be visiting a school this week, but perhaps I had that wrong or perhaps the story surprised you with a short detour. If the latter, I consider it a detour well worth taking. I even like the little cliffhanger at the end!<br><br>I found myself trying to parse the "corned beef and hay" comment, as well. Does that tie with the Keelyites and human muscle power? Do humans provide some transportation through their own labor, or does it go deeper than that into some interesting territory? I'm very intriguing. Then again, I may just again be reading more into stray lines than I should be.<br><br>On another note, I'm happy to report that Into the Ruins has been doing brisk and steady business since your link to it last week. I've received a number of story submissions, subscriptions, emailed inquiries, and encouragement and well wishes. I'd like to note that I just put up an <a href=http://intotheruins.com/submissions/artwork/ rel=nofollow>artwork submissions</a> page, and I encourage any interested parties to check it out.

Science looked like a great replacement but is failing on it's promise to allow us to live forever, and thus avoid the question of what happens to our consciousness when we die.

In any other circumstance, the defenders have every incentive to fight to the death, and an attacking force will be ground up like hamburger. Of course the defenders will suffer serious losses; so? If the alternative is annihilation, a very large number of people normally embrace the "I'll gladly die if I can take two or three of them with me" strategy. Combine that with Lakeland special forces surging into the invading nation's territory to shred their infrastructure and damage their warfighting capacity, and you've got a very, very hard nut to crack.

Local schools had cancelled all field trips to Charm City in expectation of trouble as the first Freddie Gray wrongful death trial was in deliberation. Courts seem generally unwilling to even charge police that blatantly shoot people so I was expecting they might convict Officer William Porter on misconduct but let him skate on manslaughter and assault. But it was declared a mistrial due to a jury that was deadlocked on each of four counts. <br><br>A mistrial is not an acquittal, but it could weaken the more serious charges against the driver of the van transporting the seriously-injured Gray, Officer Caesar Goodson. There were a lot of police out, but only two early arrests last night. One man was arrested for asking why he had to disperse, and local activist Kwame Rose was arrested across the street for using a bullhorn to start the usual chants. The 300 Men March group was devoted to peaceful protest, and the weather is chillier than last week, so it seems to have been relatively quiet.<br><br><a href=#c2557322321067245037 title="comment permalink">12/17/15, 1:23 AM</a><br><br>

Have the Shakers, perhaps, got the wrong end of the stick about all of this? There's a difference between, "It is a gift to live simply" and "It is a gift to *be* simple" - that implies a deliberate rejection of complex thinking and ideas. Saying that people are "simple folk" suggests not only that people don't necessarily engage with things like science, history, politics etc but a certain inability, perhaps a wilful one. Add to that "gift", which in religious terms can easily turn into, "something we need to impose on other people" and… The Shakers strike me as potential book-burners. (There would be a certain irony to that, given that in the historic post-Roman period it was the church that preserved a lot of classical culture.)<br><br>Or maybe I'm completely off-base, but I have to say, if I was in Carr's position I'd be unsettled too.<br><br><a href=#c2451551879223996359 title="comment permalink">12/17/15, 1:46 AM</a><br><br>

Like, I suspect, many other Archdruid readers, I would head for the nearest tier one or two county in a heartbeat, given the opportunity (at least as describe so far; this week's last sentence adds a bit of foreboding to the proceedings).<br><br>But I wonder how long such a tiered system could realistically be expected to last? <br><br>After many years of wending my way from an environmentalist viewpoint to an avid reader of this blog and a belief that we are indeed in the long descent/emergency, I have come to the conclusion that excess energy corrupts us, because, as animals, we are hard-wired to conserve it in ourselves, and exploit and hoard available outside sources, from slavery to mega oil corporations.<br><br>True, after several civil wars, a good part of the population will be at least temporarily amenable to controlling the desire for energy/power. But, like highly specialized dog breeds left to their own devices, will these tier distinctions eventually blend, especially as the higher tiers seek the territory necessary to maintain the higher energy flows per capita? <br><br>Like everything else, civilizations rise and fall, with the fall based in large part on this overconsumption of the available energy source (or alternatively, being overrun by a civilization on this high energy path). There is often a brief period where things are more or less in balance, and could go on for a long time, but human societies, with some exceptions, rarely have the restraint to keep from blowing by these watermarks into increasingly dysfunctional ways. (There is an excellent explanation of this in Ivan Illich's work, particularly <i>Energy and Equity</i>.) The fact that we are now in a civilization with global reach means that the consequences of the fall will be planetary--ie climate change, etc.<br><br>Of course, this does not mean despair, but rather acceptance. From the ashes other societies will rise. Gathering and protecting the seeds, teaching kids, acting in a way that corresponds with our knowledge of things, this is what we can do at this point.<br><br><a href=#c9076622820153216512 title="comment permalink">12/17/15, 4:04 AM</a><br><br>

I was wondering what your description of rural northwest Ohio might look like and was quite surprised, though intrigued, by the emphasis here on religious communities. I thought you might have more to say about the billiard-table flatness of the topography. But maybe later.<br><br>That thought reminds me of the journey Trey sunna Gwen makes through this country some four hundred years later, in the company of Cash the elwus, on his way to Troy from Melumi. When I first read of Trey's stop in Napoleon (I forgot the Merigan name for the town), I wondered, in the depopulated future described in <i>Star's Reach</i>, whether agriculture in the region had largely been abandoned, except perhaps right along the Maumee River, thus allowing the Great Black Swamp to re-emerge. (The only reason farming can be done in this entire quadrant of northwest Ohio is through the maintaining of an elaborate drainage system, something I would think might become too intensive to be worth it in a depopulated future.)

I don't expect that the soldiers have any issue with it, but I would expect the (Christian? Thou shall not kill and the like?) religious group to have objections about routinely housing soldiers. This isn't a very big incongruity, more of a quibble. I imagine that the brothers and sisters are pacifists and so I assumed that they would have an issue with housing soldiers for an annual military event. I know there are chaplains in the military, but when Mr. Carr tried to sort out what was bothering him that's what leapt to my mind.<br><br> But Mr. Carr would have been able to put his finger on it if that was his issue. I suspect that the problem is choice. These people choose to be there even after they have left to see the outside world. I don't think it's the religious choice that bothers him, I think it is the tier one choice. He's seen a tier five city and knows that it's possible and he knows that counties choose what tier they are going to use. I don't think he understands why people would choose to be tier one when they could choose to be tier four or five. I don't think he has thought through the economic issues. Small agricultural towns don't make lots of money and the populations is decentralized which makes power lines and roads expensive for the amount of use they get.<br><br> But I think what's bothering him is deeper than that. Even after he thinks through the economic issues I think he will still be troubled. I don't think he can understand how or why people would want to be tier one. I think that what Brother Micah said is bothering him: 'I'm happier here than I ever was out there in the world.'

I recently took my preschool/early grade-school aged grandkids to the county historical society's village for the annual "Christmas in History" event and we toured the different buildings, including three houses ranging from turn of the century (with telephone, "modern" woodstove, and a water pump right in the kitchen) to a frontier log cabin with a smokehouse and fireplace. Aside from the obvious questions about TV and internet :) was "but where is the bathroom?"<br><br>Re one of the comments above about the new religions being similar to the old religions, I think that we have something of a false history of sudden and distinct shifts of religious sentiment whereas the truth is that most, if not all, religions were the result of gradual and more subtle modifications of existing forms. Christianity was just one mystery religion among many, but happened the be the one that survived. Similarly, the current trinitarian orthodoxy was one interpretation of christianity among many, but it was the survivor (with a bit of help from the power of the state). What you have described is the continuing evolution of our present forms into new variations which will be competing for survival in the new landscape. (I like the third testament, by the way, and how you are showing that what we see as fixed is not at all so.)<br><br>Finally, I have to report on an interesting "Fred Halliot" moment that I observed recently. A few days ago, I was at our local Y and overheard a portion of conversation between two other men in the locker room who were discussing the recent shootings, bomb threats, etc. They mentioned no one by name (that I heard) but when they said "he" it was clear from the context re halting immigration that they were referring to the Donald (as in "he isn't saying stop everyone forever -- just until we can get this straightened out"). What struck me particularly was the calm and rational tone of the exchange. These were not high-strung, rabid true-believers, but two men calmly discussing an issue. I'm wondering if anyone else has witnessed something similar?<br><br><a href=#c8121867528426898247 title="comment permalink">12/17/15, 7:14 AM</a><br><br>

Now, I work in transportation engineering and deal in the active forms (walking cycling etc), which by necessity also encourages shorter trips. Commute time and distance only continues to increase in my part of the world (southern Ontario, Canada) as real estate prices push more people farther out from the core employment areas. But I finally put the pieces together in my mind that travel, especially but not limited to daily commuting, is a form of consumption, and one of the more damaging sorts. Readers may be saying to themselves, "well duh", but I always knew that the consumption of fuel and road space was an issue, but not so much the activity of long distance travel itself. Our society over-consumes transportation, thinking nothing of distance and time, since so many of the costs are hidden. <br><br>To quote CS Lewis: “I number it among my blessings that my father had no car, while most of my friends had, and sometimes took me for a drive. This meant that all these distant objects could be visited just enough to clothe them with memories, and not impossible desires, while yet they remained ordinarily as inaccessible as the Moon. The deadly power of rushing about wherever I pleased had not been given me. I measured distances by the standard of man, man walking on his two feet, not by the standard of the internal combustion engine. I had not been allowed to deflower the very idea of distance; in return I possessed 'infinite riches' in what would have been to a motorist ‘a little room.’ The truest and most horrible claim made for modern transport is that it ‘annihilates space.’ It does. It annihilates one of the most glorious gifts we have been given. It is a vile inflation which lowers the value of distance, so that a modern boy travels a hundred miles with less sense of liberation and pilgrimage and adventure than his grandfather got from travelling ten. Of course, if a man hates space and wants it to be annihilated, that is another matter. Why not creep into his coffin at once? There is little enough space there.”<br><br><a href=#c547826375180212062 title="comment permalink">12/17/15, 7:22 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not a conspiracy theorist, and I certainly don't deny that 14 people were shot in San Bernardino, but the whole optics around this is very fishy and doesn't set well with me. It does seem like a red herring to get people's minds off real issues and back onto a convenient scapegoat. Honestly, Muslims are basically an "expendable" minority group because they make up such a small percentage of the population, and Trump must know this. As a member of an "expendable" minority group myself, one that makes up probably less than 5% of the population at best, I know all too well just how well society can function while demonizing an "expendable" minority group. I really think Trump is pandering to bigotry among older white voters, who vote in much higher numbers relative to other age groups and ethnicities.

As for the SUVs, though, I'm just trying to picture how people in 2065 are going to think about the people today whose desire to save the Earth doesn't go to the length of motivating them to change their own lifestyles. My guess is that they'll have some exceedingly bitter things to say in that regard. <br><br>Tim, very few Christian denominations apply "thou shalt not kill" to the military, as I'm sure you know; the New Shakers are, as we'll see, conscientious objectors of a certain class, but that doesn't forbid them from offering hospitality to guests who are attending the annual drone shoot. As for the rest, stay tuned!<br><br>Gwizard43, most religions, and most religious people, are tolerant in practice -- they have to be, to get along in a multifaith world. We'll find out later on why the Lakeland Republic tends to feature a lot of tolerant, apolitical religious groups and rather fewer of the other kind. <br><br>Patricia, if it's got adequate insulation, the heat from the big brick ovens down in the daylight basement will keep the whole thing toasty in the process of baking each day's bread!<br><br>Daniel, yes, New York City is part of the Atlantic Republic, although the low-lying areas of it are underwater at high tide and all the tunnels underground were flooded decades ago -- the main industry in town is salvaging steel from abandoned skyscrapers. As for religions, I don't know yet -- my style of writing involves a lot of winding characters up and letting them talk, and I'm often as surprised as anybody by what comes out of their mouths. <br><br>Brother G., good.

When I was a young child, I remember a great aunt in Arkansas telling what happened when her mother got the first flush-toilet in the county. After installing it, she took down the outhouse and invited her lady friends over for lunch, intending to surprise them with it. Pretty soon, one of the ladies excused herself, went out back, returned asking "Where's the new privy?" <br>"It's indoors now," replied the hostess, "Just go to the end of the hall." <br>"Sarah! Are you sure that's sanitary?" came the horrified reply. <br>None of them would use it. <br>re: Fred Halliot moments;<br>To avoid slandering anyone else, I will admit to personal discomfort. Hear my confessions, fellow readers, and feel free to enlighten me;<br>1) Until recently, I worked with a very sweet young lady who is a conservative Muslim. She has always been a kind, polite, and forebearing co-worker. Recently she cut back on her hours to open a cupcake kiosk stall in the local Mall. I wish her all the success and happiness in the world. <br>The thing that nags at me late at night, just a bit, is that this is very much the way that the friends and co-workers of several recent Muslim shooters described them before they took up weapons. Will my co-worker shoot up the Mall some day? I cannot believe that she would. I have met her husband, her mother, and other family members, and these are good people. I cannot believe there will ever be a problem, yet deep down, I am not 100% sure.<br>2) In Howard County, Maryland, a suburb of Baltimore where my sister-in-law is a teacher, she was required by the county to wear a head scarf because the conservative Muslim parents of some of her students complained that it violated their religious sensibilities for women to go bare-headed. Sis-in-law is a conservative Christian. She is offended on religious grounds, but must comply or risk losing her job. This too adds discomfort points to my feelings about Muslims. County government says her religious convictions are not as important as those of the parents of her students. <br>I'd like for my gut to be sure that my co-worker will not take up a gun. I'd like to see that school system retract the scarf policy, and I'd like to be able to discuss these issues in public without fear of recrimination. In the current social and political climate, all this seems impossible, but I think we need to find a way to talk about these things.<br>In the early 1960's, people wondered whether John F. Kennedy could put the interests of the US ahead of his Roman Catholic faith, so maybe we have a similar question about Islam in the US that also needs to be answered in a way that satisfies people at their gut level.<br>IMHO, Trump is not helping. He seems more like a trial balloon candidate for some future Fascism. Whatever he says on an issue makes it impossible to discuss--Possibly an application of dark magic/thaumaturgy? <br>Anyone else want to confess?

Changes in religious sensibility don't happen overnight, and they generally take the form of step by step modifications of existing forms rather than the sudden appearance of something wholly new. (As I've noted over in the other blog, modern pop Neopaganism is far less original than it likes to think.) Also, of course, this narrative is, ahem, "<i>Retro</i>topia," and so borrowings from older American religious modes are kind of the order of the day. <br><br>With regard to the Trumpery, that's what I've been expecting for some time now. A post on the politics of resentment that will discuss the Trump phenomenon and its roots in the side of class warfare nobody on the left wants to talk about -- the systematic crushing of the American wage-earning class for the benefit of, and as often as not at the hands of, the salaried class -- is in the works. <br><br>Matthew, excellent! Where's the Lewis quote from? That may be the best thing of his I've seen yet. <br><br>Mr. B., delighted to hear it. Welcome back to the real world!<br><br>Hapibeli, and if you live in a country that doesn't happen to have oil wells and have been through a decades-long embargo, burning vegetable oil in a diesel engine is just the way things normally are. I recall reading that when Rudolf Diesel originally invented the engine that bears his name, he ran it on peanut oil. <br><br>Nastarana, in 2065 the country due west of the Lakeland Republic is called the Missouri Republic, and it extends north from the northern two-thirds of Missouri to the border with West Canada. It's pretty dry, yes -- the climate's close to that of the Great Basin states today -- but there's agriculture in the river valleys and seminomadic herding elsewhere, and relations with the Lakeland Republic are generally quite peaceful; the two republics engaged in quite a bit of surreptitious trade even during the embargo years, and there's a quiet mutual-assistance pact in place in case either one ends up facing a war. More on this as we proceed.<br><br>Mitzi, you've gotten suckered into the standard, highly distorted image of the American past -- not surprising, as that's pushed very hard these days by the promoters of the religion of progress. Go read some novels written in the 19th century -- you might try Laura Ingalls Wilder and Mark Twain for starters -- and see how well their descriptions of the world they saw around them differ from the modern stereotype of "desperate lives in one-room cabins with dirt floors." It really is an eye-opener. <br><br>Martin, good! My late father-in-law used to call that a "possible bath," and described it in exactly the same terms. <br><br>Robert, stay tuned. The thing is, religions generally innovate by reaching backwards -- every major American religious innovation I can think of thought of itself as reaching back to the distant past, whether it's the Church of the original apostles, the "old ways" of the Pagan past, the ancient wisdom of the Theosophists et al., or what have you. So the myth of spiritual progress has very shallow roots. <br><br>Mick, nope -- "milk run" is American slang for a train, bus line, etc. that stops at every little podunk town along the route, while the express run skips all but the big towns.<br><br><a href=#c2767370168810417377 title="comment permalink">12/17/15, 5:00 PM</a><br><br>

I've read Nordhoff many a time -- I first encountered it while doing research for one of the first articles I ever got published, a piece called "Hermeticism and the Utopian Imagination," which was in <i>Alexandria</i> back in the day. <br><br>Aias, I'll look forward to your story!<br><br>Post-Millennial, you will indeed hear back from me fairly soon -- I've been up to my eyeballs with certain changes in process that'll be announced at the solstice. <br><br>Unknown, I've encountered a couple of quasimonastic communes that managed to function quite gracefully with married couples. It requires certain adjustments but can be made to work. Mind you, I'm quite sure there are also celibate monastic communities in the Lakeland Republic -- Old Catholic, New Catholic, Orthodox, and others -- and we might just run across one of those as the story proceeds. We'll see. <br><br>Mustard, you're one up on me -- my sole exposure to Hicksville has been via a road atlas and some encyclopedia articles, gracefully outdated, on Defiance County. <br><br>Brian, got it in one -- Keelyites raise pigs, chickens, cows, etc. for food, but they don't use animal-drawn (much less tractor-drawn) plows, thus the plant part of their diet consists of garden vegetables and tree crops. Their acorn-potato bread is deservedly famous all over the Lakeland Republic. As for the jeeps, in 2065 there's a factory outside of Ann Arbor that produces them -- they're not actually the World War II Willys GP, but they're inspired by it and have much the same philosophy of design. <br><br>Helen, nah, ham salad. Corned beef is standard rations in the Lakeland Army. <br><br>Don, Carr read on his veepad that another big chunk of an ice sheet had broken loose from Antarctica and was drifting into the sea lanes. It's just a hint; there will be more of same as we proceed. <br><br>Clarence, thank you!<br><br>Shane, heh heh heh...<br><br>Rebecca, intentional communities with a religious focus have much a higher rate of success than secular ones. Still, if you really want to get a secular neo-Shaker movement started, what's stopping you? <br><br>Patricia, in my first stint in college I lived for a while in a commune where the accommodations consisted of two old log cabins with a wood stove each. This was in Washington State up near the Canadian border, where it gets bitterly cold in the winter, and yet by the time we'd fired up the woodstove in the morning to boil water for tea and get breakfast going, the place was toasty enough that additional heating would have been a waste of time. Thus I have a high opinion of what a well-designed brick woodstove can do!<br><br><a href=#c5879130428171474909 title="comment permalink">12/17/15, 5:21 PM</a><br><br>

The damnable thing about this whole situation is that, while the vast majority of Muslims are as peaceful and compassionate a group as you'll find anywhere, there's a small but significant minority who firmly believe that their faith calls them to slaughter the infidel, and a larger and even more significant minority who believe just as firmly that no other religion besides theirs should be permitted. I'm more than usually skittish about this, because under most versions of Shari'a law, as a polytheist I don't even have the right to exist -- in Muslim teaching, believing that there are more gods than one is the single worst sin there is, the sin of <i>shirk</i>, and a polytheist under Shari'a law faces the stark choice of conversion or martyrdom. Mind you, there's also a small but significant minority of Christians who believe that their faith calls them to commit murder -- the recent Planned Parenthood shooting is an example -- and there's a very large number of Christians who believe that their religion is the only one that anyone ought to be allowed to have, so Islam is by no means unique in having that problem.

Shaker villages attracted the poor and desperate,as the only place they could find hope in a rigid social system. When prosperity came, Shaker life dwindled away.<br>I am a family historian. Many of my ancestors lived the life I am describing- came to middle TN to find their 160 acre "plantation" (the only payment for fighting in war) was rocky, hilly, and flood-and-frost prone, unpredictably, spring and fall- slavery was limited-to-nonexistent. I've seen the footprint of the cabins inside homes built around them by succeeding generations. I have photos of my ancestors standing in front of cabins you would not let a dog take shelter in. I have stood in cemeteries where men buried their wives and half their children. I have blacksmithing receipts on scrap paper for used horseshoes going back to 1857.<br>A good read from my perspective- not fiction- is Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi (especially Appendix A about the 1882 flood) or Sam Watkins' Company Aytch (my GG-GF served in Company H). <br>Southern life was not all mint juleps and ball gowns.

That book reference about the failed communes will make an interesting addition to the library here and I'll keep an eye out for it in the second hand bookshops. As I'm not connected to many services at all and sort of rely on my wits and systems here, I get the distinct impression that a lot of those intentional communities fail because they require people to pursue common goals (and that doesn't necessarily mean thinking the same thoughts or sharing the same beliefs and values and people often confuse that issue) in order to produce a surplus from a landscape. It is not easy. I'm very interested to read that the farmers in your story can actually earn a living (as well as looking forward to that possibility).<br><br>I'm never quite sure of the news that you get in your part of the world and what impact it has. It is interesting to me anyway, that interest rates have been lifted a little bit this week. I see this more as a desire on the part of the rentier class to earn a living from investments. It will almost certainly accelerate the need to print more money to cover the increase in borrowing costs. On the other hand it may also be a method of removing money from the secondary economy and bringing it back into the tertiary economy - it certainly seems to me that there is a tacit acknowledgement that an over-supply of money will ultimately lead to hyperinflation (or also hyperstagflation as we discussed last week). It is marvellous to see such contradictory policies being pursued because as you have often stated in the past - and I agree with you - that different power groups aren't necessarily pursuing the same outcomes.<br><br>My gut feeling is that the various economic policy options have about run their course because if virtually free money can't stimulate the growth of employment in the economy and printing money is finally pushing the inflationary levers, then other less economically dependent policies (which have been historically tested many times over) will do so.<br><br>Oh, I came across this letter to the editor that I thought that you would enjoy reading: It was written by Robert Bloch, who later wrote the story Psycho: "I am awfully tired of poor old Conan the Cluck, who for the past fifteen issues has every month slain a new wizard, tackled a new monster, come to a violent and sudden end that was averted (incredibly enough!) in just the nick of time, and won a new girlfriend, each of whose penchant for nudism won her place of honour, either on the cover or on the interior illustration... I cry: 'Enough of this brute and his iron-thewed sword-thrusts - may he be sent to Valhalla to cut out paper dolls.'".<br><br>A fine diatribe! Well done and his valiant wordsmith efforts has inspired me to write a letter to a certain editor that we all know. Brace yourself, my friend! Hehe!<br><br>Mate, we are cooking down here. The temperature sailed past 40'C (104'F) here today and looks set to do the same thing tomorrow and Sunday. At least the cicada's outside seem to be enjoying the heat!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br>PS: I've got a new blog entry up: <a href=http://ferngladefarm.blogspot.com.au/ rel=nofollow>Learning to fly</a>. A young Kookaburra bird flew in to say hello to me on its maiden flight. Some rare Corella's turned up this week - and they are incidentally the best talking birds around, so I'll have to be careful what I say around them. Bones Wars took place amongst the dogs... I'm showing step by step how I deal with a very hot summer (welcome to the world of global warming). More berries and other fruits are still ripening (yum!) and more tomato silliness.

As a single, collapsed 40 year old, a monastic lifestyle that shuts out the outside world is personally very appealing, and I would, and have, worked very hard for very little. Hard, productive, real work is rewarding in its own right, and pales in comparison to the non-work typical of most workplaces today. The only thing for me is that none of the existing monasteries are of a faith I'm interested in--it may be a few more hundred years before they appear. Most of the "intentional communities" I've encountered make all the mistakes JMG mentions about the hippie communes in spades, and it seems like many people are obsessed now with withdrawing into their nuclear families and shutting out everyone else.<br>I agree w/Nastarana regarding people wanting their cut. I've been on off grid organic farms, and they live very close to the bone, with very narrow profit margins, and even though the ones I've been on have been mostly left-of-center, listening to them talk about taxes and USDA regulations sounds a lot like the right-wing Tea Party. Certainly, they'd have a lot more breathing room and be way more profitable if they were operating with few taxes, less regulation, and less overhead. I'm reminded of JMG's post about the storefront vacancies in Cumberland, where he says that there's no shortage of viable businesses that could operate in the vacant storefronts, but that by the time they pay taxes, rent, and meet regulations, they can't make a profit and go out of business if they even make it that far.<br><br><a href=#c8695391566654837624 title="comment permalink">12/18/15, 10:25 AM</a><br><br>

Right now, he is five years old.<br><br>Currently, I'm learning sustainable agriculture at an Anglican convent (yes, alongside real life nuns - it's very difficult, very educational, and a lot of fun.) Every morning we hear a sermon from a different speaker, and one of the priests on rotation is a Pappas. His son (the Tom I mentioned) would be well-prepared for a possible low-tech future by his parents -- and yes, priest-dad does have a bushy, curly moustache to go with his impressive beard. The Anglican salary (and retirement fund) for small parishes is very meager indeed, but rather than try to add another job, this priest and his wife actually live very simply and practice many "survival skills" like sewing, cooking, growing and preserving a very impressive garden, personal home repair, etc. I would not be surprised at all to see them give up wi-fi or even electricity if their incomes could not support it.<br><br>The convent is right outside a small Anglican private university. Already I can see the seeds of some future LR-esque county. One of the things I've been surprised by is just how quickly skills that were lost in the last two generations are now being picked up again. Cooking is very big among the youth here (mostly because the cafe food is too expensive and not very good). Thrift is practically a virtue, if not a commandment, and there's enough rich kids around that you can buy a nice, wool dress-coat at the thrift store for five bucks. Rather than mockery, people who can knit and weld get an "ooh, aah" by the students (our intensive ag tutor/head gardener at the convent was lambasted for his interests thirty years ago but now revered among the community and student body). If you chop your own wood and fuel your wood stove, you are cool.<br><br>In many ways the current age echoes the beginning of the convent that I am working at. In the late 1800's/early 1900's, this area was extremely depressed, far more so than most areas in America at the time. There were no schools. If folks on the mountain didn't have a grain crop to save for Winter, they either killed a neighbor family for theirs or starved (very common). Knowledge of water/wind mills had not yet reached the high mountains, so grains were ground by hand, a trying task for the wives, and tools/knowledge of sewing, knitting, and other cloth-working were nearly nonexistent. The convent, when it arrived, was treated with extreme suspicion, but the Sisters who started it sacrificed everything to bring a little prosperity, education, joy, and (yes) religion to the struggling mountain people. By all accounts, they succeeded. Nowadays, this area has public schools, but the convent and its Sisters are still a pillar of this small mountain community, and most people have a relative or two who went to the original religious school (or its partner boys' school, headed by a nearby monastery).<br><br>It is easy, now, to see why monasticism proliferates in some of the poorest parts of the world. The greatest treasures of the convent are not gold-leaf tea-sets, lovingly donated by some wealthy associate fifty-some years ago, but rather the archives of their newsletters dating back over a hundred years ago, documenting life in these mountain as the wars, industrialization, and the Sisters changed it over time. In the future, the same archives may act as haphazard guidebooks for running the convent on lower-energy - after all, most of the same buildings and natural springs and resources are still here, under- or un-utilized.<br><br><a href=#c4877806464264505373 title="comment permalink">12/18/15, 11:07 AM</a><br><br>

Of all the world's religions, past and present, the only ones I can think of that have a monastic tradition are Christianity and Buddhism. Hinduism has a strong ascetic tradition but it is only informally communal. AFAIK, the same is true of the Jains.<br><br> In its three thousand year history, Judaism has had only two episodes of communal monasticism, the Qumran community that produced the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the kibbutz movement, in which Socialist-Zionist ideals took the place of religion. Neither of these models spread to diaspora Judaism. The Vestal Virgins look like a nunnery, but actually they were a priesthood bound by taboos and virginity was not a lifetime commitment. Women were vestals for a term of office and if they outlived that term, were free to marry.<br><br>In many tribal cultures, adult men and women live is sex-segregated communal living quarters and meeting houses, and they carry on most of their daily activities without much interaction with members of the other sex.

My suspicion is the deployment of Russian troops to Armenia is intended as a strategic distraction, letting the Turks know that if they do something foolish in Syria, they will have to face the possibility of a Russian counter-attack into northeastern Turkey, right at a time when things are heating up between the Turks and the Kurds and military analysts are warning of a possible civil war inside Turkey itself.<br><br><a href=#c6170390804394190480 title="comment permalink">12/18/15, 1:34 PM</a><br><br>

Remembering the relevant poem rather badly from 1980s Melbourne (Monash Univ, Prof. Gavin Betts, not far from Cherokee's farm), I had thought present-tense "parturiunt", and yet now I find that the ever-shaky Internet giving both tenses, with your "parturient" indeed predominant). <br><br>It is startling to note, as you yourself repeatedly have, the high level of literacy in the Victorian USA. In a press cartoon now preserved as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cincinnati_Convention_Mountain_of_Horace.JPG rel=nofollow>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cincinnati_Convention_Mountain_of_Horace.JPG</a>, your quoted verse is referred to in the most oblique way, in connection with the efforts of some "Liberal" movement. The artist evidently takes it that everyone can supply the full context just as soon as he explains to his readers that what he has drawn is Horace's mountain. <br><br>Perhaps when we visit a Lakeland school or two, in the rather near future, we will hear something about curriculum? A sinister aspect of the Internet piece to which a (rightly skeptical) reader of yours disparagingly referred a few weeks ago, in which the reporter praised the classroom use of computers (oh wow, how totally 2000, how excruciatingly Dot-Com-Bubble), was that curriculum hardly got mentioned. <br><br>Does this computerized school - most or all of us here will be wondering - teach any modern language apart from Spanish? If the ever-so-important German, then to what level? Is there Latin? Does its physics lab (no doubt crammed with computers) have an oscilloscope and an optics bench? Do lab calculations enforce propagation-of-uncertainties, as when one supplies the correct "x" for the template "A tungsten slug whose mass is measured on the balance to 38.2 grams plus-minus 0.3 grams, and which is found with the little glass pycnometer bottle to displace 1.90 cubic centimetres of water plus-minus 0.40 cubic centimetres, has a density of 20.1 g/cm^3 plus-minus x"?

(You mention this in a comment, above.) Without going into details, I remark that I exercise a kind of Sherlock Holmes vigilance about reporting - for instance, in newspapers, or over the Internet - on Catholic and Anglican affairs. Something here (I suppress a detail or two) does not seem quite accurate. Perhaps you could give us some particulars? Name of convent, and of associated monastery, and a link to Web site (I can't at the moment think of a convent or monastery without Web outreach, except perhaps for a place near Murmansk, in the Orthodox-rather-than-Roman world) would be helpful. <br><br>(B) I also do have to add, in a rather pained way, that JMG is at two points getting a little shaky on his generally wonderful theological remarks this week. <br><br>(1) It would be odd in 2015 for a Christian monastic foundation to associate itself with the military to the extent of facilitating a drone shoot. Are we to postulate some radical shift in Christian theology by 2065? <br><br>Admittedly, the Archabbey of my modest and sometimes uneasy affiliation, Saint Vincent in Pennsylvania, does in its oblate newsletter ask us again and again - I cannot be alone in wincing at this - for prayers for such intentions as "Greg, serving in Iraq". And staunch, sound Catholic Worker activist Robert Waldrop in Oklahoma has exposed in correctly withering terms the failure of the (timid) US Conference of Catholic Bishops to denounce the 2003 USA Iraq invasion. He remarks that only a few members of the Conference wrote about this problem at the time, and that an outright clear condemnation, in the sharp language of you-know-what (starts with s-as-in-Sierra) came from one. <br><br>So with this as with much in Church life, things are not quite black-and-white.<br><br>These concessions made by me - and one could add further concessionary remarks on such awful medieval things as the Teutonic Knights and the Crusades - my point largely stands: monasticism has been. by and large, without too many too ghastly deviations in at any rate post-medieval times, a diplomatic outpost of the Prince of Peace. <br><br>(2) "Old Catholic, New Catholic" (JMG's phrase in a comment) is tending in a not-quite-happy direction. "Old Catholic" is the formal term for a Victorian-era movement, triggered by unhappiness with Pius IX, as documented at <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Catholic_Church rel=nofollow>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Catholic_Church</a>. The Old Catholic movement is alive and well, albeit not in communion with Rome. Its membership will therefore be curious, and apprehensive, on what JMG will now be doing with their name in his literary construction. <br><br>"New Catholic", on the other hand, leads to apprehensions of a different kind, now not from the Old Catholic community but from the mainstream Catholic world. JMG's suggestion here might be - he will correct me if I err - that by 2065, the current Catholic Church will be doing something which is in a rather novel way lurid, perhaps bifurcating in a replay of the 1054 schism. Attention to the squalor of the current Church (the sexual and financial abuse scandals on the one hand, and the smaller stuff - various kinds of shallowness at the parish level - on the other hand) would be less speculative, and would earn the greater regard of the Catholic readership. <br><br>In general, the dangers of commenting on the affairs of one country from a position within another have their analogues in religion. :-) <br><br><br>Diffidently, hastily, <br><br><br>Tom (Toronto-area Estonian-diaspora Catholic)<br><br><a href=#c2496313112885635068 title="comment permalink">12/18/15, 3:58 PM</a><br><br>

In 1987 or 1988, I found myself in polite chit-chat over cocktails or something with a Dean from one of the faculties of Notre Dame, in Indiana. I explained to the Dean, as one does over the hors d'oeuvres in such a vacuous setting, that "Well, yes, we [sc. the Republic of Estonia, then diplomatically recognized by the USA despite the then-ongoing USSR postwar occupation] have a Consul in New York, Dr Aarand Roos." This name I of course pronounced correctly (roughly the same as "roos" in German, or indeed as "rose" in French, upon lengthening the vowel). The Dean must have asked how the name was spelled, since one of his next remarks was, "Well, we would pronounce that as 'ROOOS'" (he made it rhyme with "booze"). Tempted though I was to express the hope that he was not criticizing speakers of a minor Nordic language regarding their pronunciation of names from their own language, I nevertheless held my tongue. And of course the Dean might have been in a state of mild fatigue, or whatever.<br><br>Jeepers. Now I must stop, having in this afternoon's clutch of postings managed to be a bit hard on an education-system reporter, on reader "Carnegie", on JMG, and on the University of Notre Dame.

It was very well written and had just the right amount of jealousy and bitterness to be totally transparent and at the same time amusing. You know Robert Bloch actually was a fan of Howard’s work!<br><br>Exactly! So many different agenda's are being pursued that no one is effectively in control and the only policy options being presented are rehashes of the same old, same old. New options will eventually appear and I have no doubt about that, because it is an inevitability, if only because what can't be sustained, won't be sustained. And so it won't. How the different power blocs fail to understand that is way beyond me, but then I guess that is why they are in that position in the first place.<br><br>It is way hot down here and it was 26'C (78.8'F) outside (and inside the house too) at 6am this morning so I got up and did some stuff. I don't have air conditioning here so I reckon the inside of the house will reach up to just shy of 30'C today 86'F which isn't bad at all considering it is way past 40'C (100'F) in the shade outside. Insulation is everything in these conditions - and it doesn't look set to cool down tonight either.<br><br>Oh, what was I talking about - that's right. My mind drifts in this heat. It was hot this morning, so I cheated a bit and went down to the local cafe / general store to enjoy a coffee and toastie in their air conditioning and enjoyed reading the newspaper. It was very nice.<br><br>But in all of that reading I spotted an article titled "Russian radar keep US grounded". I don't know whether this is propaganda or not and it is referring to Syria, but the weird thing is that the article is on my printed newspaper but has disappeared completely from the Internet. I was thinking that it was a very unwise article to publish and it was originally attributed to Bloomberg. If it is true, then air strikes - other drones - over Syria are done and totally finished. Why would that article even be in my newspaper - very unwise? Not good.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c4899850163895653264 title="comment permalink">12/18/15, 5:21 PM</a><br><br>

It will perhaps help some readers to see a rendition of the "Simple Gifts" hymn, encapsulating some of their spirituality in choreography and song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLAnuG1340g" rel=nofollow>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLAnuG1340g</a> (upload of 2011-12-23, by YouTube user "Cibertracker Imperium", to a duration of 1:40). <br><br>The Shakers were an American articulation of the "science of love", which the Catholic world for its part particularly celebrates and particularly studies through Thérèse de Lisieux. - Or rather, are even now an articulation of that science: Wikipedia says that as of 2010, the Shakers had three full members and one novice. - Or, if it is too much to say "science" (though I do think this term apt), say "insight", say "wisdom", say whatever. <br><br>(B) I also want at this point to give everyone a kind of Christmas card, involving tenor Roberto Alagna. <br><br>Christmas cannot be destroyed by shopping malls and industrialism. <br><br>It shines forth obstinately, even in the palaces of avarice and falsehood - for instance, even at the counting-house of Scrooge and Marley, even when television gets that deep 1843 story into its own distorting 20th-century and 21st-century grip. <br><br>And it rings forth in hymnody - with perhaps a unique power in what is for some the favourite music of the season, "O Holy Night". I discovered today that the power of this hymn emerges in a special way when one does not resort to an English translation, but instead follows the original, as "Minuit, Chrétiens". <br><br>The gold standard for a powerful vocal tenor-solo rendition has been Jussi Björling, singing from a translation into Swedish. But oh, to know Swedish! (I get scant success, at least on first attempt, from Estonian or German, and in this ADR readership only Tidlösa and a handful of others will be properly equipped.) <br><br>Today, to my delight, I found Björling equalled by a powerful contemporary tenor, perhaps the supreme tenor of our own time, Roberto Alagna, and indeed singing some stanzas from the French original: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWq5OWYaXDw" rel=nofollow>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWq5OWYaXDw</a> (upload of YouTube user "MUEZZAB", on 2006-07-21, to a duration of 5:22). <br><br>An appropriate method for following Alagna is to read the words with parallel literal English translation at <a href=http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Hymns_and_Carols/NonEnglish/minuit_chretiens.htm rel=nofollow>http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Hymns_and_Carols/NonEnglish/minuit_chretiens.htm</a>. One can ponder Alagna's interpretation through repeated readings and repeated listenings, until the full force begins to emerge, as in monochrome chemical-darkroom work the photographic print rather suddenly begins emerging in the developer bath. <br><br>One minor linguistic caveat: the just-cited publication does mistranslate <i>L'amour unit ceux qu’enchaînait le fer</i>; what is in fact needed is "Love unites those whom iron [sc the sword?] once enchained," in place of the translator's theologically apt, and yet philologically deficient, "Love unites those who restrain the sword." <br><br>We do of course additionally have to discount, as bad theology, the idea of the Father's "wrath", <i>courroux</i>, in the first stanza. (Thérèrese de Lisieux is an efficacious corrective.) <br><br>What emerges from this exercise in Gallicism is an astonishing declaration of emancipation: first <i>Peuple, à genoux</i> ("O People, to your knees") and then <i>Peuple, debout!</i> ("O People, arise"). The hymn in its French conception has been well called a spiritual Marseillaise. <br> <br>Perhaps JMG will at some point be able to write something about Liberation Theology, either in a general way or in the specific context of Lakeland?<br><br><br>Tom<br><br><a href=#c565465496136295537 title="comment permalink">12/18/15, 7:32 PM</a><br><br>

There was a period during the Middle Ages when European married women wore the wimple along with a loose fitting, long sleeved gown.

Nuns are brides of Christ and I think the original idea was that they would wear ordinary modest clothing, nothing fashionable. <br><br>The burqa is worn in Afghanistan.

(We have been through the impending mess before, with the catabolic collapse of ancient Rome.) <br><br>(b) The vital currents in contemporary Catholicism can be discerned, as at previous points in Church life, by observing rank-and-file Catholics. We find, for instance, that people insist on reading the current Pope's <i>Laudato Si'</i>. We likewise find a strong engagement of the rank and file with monasticism, rather especially including monasticism in its more demanding forms. We note, e.g., the townspeople of Norcia (Saint Benedict's old town) recently begging that the Benedictines return, and to their joy finding duly traditionalist American Benedictines duly setting up right in town, brewery and all. (That monkish product is bottled under Latin label 'Birra Nursia', with motto <i>Ut laetificet cor</i>.)<br><br>But what is unknown is how <i>well</i> Catholicism will weather the impending catabolic collapse. Will the Church give creative witness, as in recent decades it has in Latin America? Or will it resemble instead the unimaginative, compromised Catholicism of 1933-1945 Germany, helpless even under the encouragement of the 1937 encyclical <i>Mit brennender Sorge</i>? <br><br>What I would now like to do is to set up a blog, if some people might be inclined to help me.<br><br>We want to spread our workload. <br><br>I would be happy to write one modest Catholic essay every four weeks, touching on some aspect of JMG's work (for instance, on some current topic from ADR; the thorny topic of pacifism would have suggested itself this week, and soon school education may become a current ADR topic). Perhaps three other people would likewise be willing to write one modest, short, essay, with each such writer pitching in for one week out of four? And perhaps some fifth person would be willing to moderate the envisaged blog, applying JMG's own rules of courtesy and openness? <br><br>We basically want our Gang of Four essayists to work in the traditions of those two specially exemplary Catholic journalists, Chesterton and Dorothy Day. <br><br>I can think of a Catholic journalist in Ireland who follows ADR and has also appropriate Chesterton-and-Day skills. Would he be at all inclined to lead and guide the enterprise - perhaps both (1) contributing overall guidance, and (2) posting an essay every four weeks? Then I could plug along as a Gang essayist contributing, yet not leading. And, as I say, we could do with three others - two more to round off the essayist "Gang of Four", and then one more to moderate incoming reader comments. <br><br>I would envisage our readers, and hence our comment-writers (as opposed to our four Gang essayists) to be ultimately quite a mix of (a) Catholics, (b) people-who-within-the-established-limits-of-politeness-jeer-at-Catholics (no Mick without a jeer squad), and (c) people who are not Catholic and yet are rather kindly disposed toward Catholicism. The comments below the essays would end up being somewhat feisty, even disputatious, while staying within the limits of courtesy. <br><br>I would imagine the envisaged blog as having, say, one-tenth the ADR volume of postings. It would provide a place where specifically Catholic stuff could be aired boldly, without smothering ADR itself in clouds of Roman incense. <br><br>Offers of help, comments, etc offline, please, to Toomas(dot)Karmo(at)gmail(dot)com, by 2015-12-31, with subject line including "Catholic-in-catabolic-collapse".

Having milked a modest herd of goats in my time, I can tell you that, as with any other manual process, the muscles quickly get accustomed to the movements. Furthermore, if you don't have machines to do the work for you, just about every task on the farm requires hard work, and milking at least is done sitting down. Thus the New Shakers, like most other dairy farmers in the Lakeland Republic, don't use hoses; they use hands and buckets. <br><br>Will, much depends on whether the majority of compassionate and tolerant Muslims choose to oppose the violent and intolerant minority, or not. <br><br>Toomas, why, yes, we'll be hearing about the curriculum -- I still have a series of posts I want to do about what a meaningful education for a deindustrializing world would look like, but that's a later project. As for the religious issues, first, most Christian sects in the US are not pacifist in orientation and tend to support the military in various ways. Second, as we'll see in passing down the road a bit, in my fictional 2065 the Catholic church in North America has suffered a major schism between its traditionalist and liberal wings, respectively the Old Catholics and New Catholics I mentioned. Based on extensive conversations with Catholics I know, that's a very high possibility. Whether or not the schism will eventually be healed over, or whether it'll turn into something as enduring as the Protestant schism, is outside the bounds of this story. <br><br>Cherokee, here are some links for that story: <a href=http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/12/18/442240/Russia-US-Syria-S400 rel=nofollow>link 1</a>, <a href=http://www.dailysabah.com/syrian-crisis/2015/11/28/russias-s-400-missile-deployment-in-syria-halts-us-led-coalition-airstrikes-against-daesh rel=nofollow>link 2</a>, <a href=https://www.rt.com/news/323815-syria-s-400-us-airstrikes/ rel=nofollow>link 3</a>.

Russia, IMHO is not going to get their Su-30's shot down in Turkey (compared to the expendable Su-24's). Despite their petty large air force, also, not much of that is projectable outside of Russia. Much like the Americans in Tanzania, they have no AWACS, no tankers, no way to sustain a campaign against Turkey if such a conflict would arise. <br><br>The Russians are spread pretty thin; all of the Russian Air Force is not available to attack Turkey. If they were to put everything they had into their bases in the Southern District, they would still be vastly outnumbered and outgunned by the Turks, and the Russians don't have oil tankers. <br><br>Also, RE: The S-400; that is just a SAM system. US forces could take all those missile systems out in a single pass, the US has a plethora of SEAD/DEAD options against S-400; a handful of S-400's would not last an hour in an actual shoot out. The S-400 is large, easy to see and track, and it's not the kind of system which moves quickly nor is easy to hide, it's vulnerable to all sorts of US stand off weapons, including the AGM-88, AGM-154, AGM-158. <br><br>What I see as happening is the U.S. is just afraid of what damage might come, and thus damage to public opinion.

As someone who used to be a volunteer firefighter, all I know is that if that man (and it is always a guy) was in that exact situation and faced by a serious fire - he'd be dead pretty quickly.

I'm not sure that is what I see from the present schisms in culture and politics. There's one basic reason for this: they are not rigidly regional. Parts of rural Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee are quite similar to each other in these regards. Parts of Portland, Nashville, and Pittsburg are likewise quite similar to each other and very far from their adjoining rural areas. In the 1860s there was a single concrete legal and moral issue that split the US into two very distinct regions. Border states like TN only voted to seceed after the war had already begun; in the first round of voting internal divisions prevented such drastic action. In the current environment I think most states are effectively border states, with the political schisms running internally within them, not just in a larger scale pattern.<br><br>I can see this leads to troubled times, but I'm not sure it leads to regional breakup. It is perhaps a more fertile ground for fascistic nationalism than partition.

His blog has also been a great source of info about the Syrian and Ukrainian civil wars and the ongoing farce that is the F-35 Lardbucket. The conflict in Yemen has turned into a rather nasty proxy war pitting the American backed Saudis against the Iranian backed Houthis, a Shia sect that overthrew the previous Saudi and American backed Yemeni government in a revolutionary war.<br><br>The Saudi intervention in Yemen has turned into a major debacle in which the Saudis have been getting curb-stomped even though they have a much bigger and better equipped war machine and total air superiority.<br><br>Solomon has posted quite a few videos of Saudi tanks, including M-1A1's and M1A2's, being destroyed by anti-tank missiles. Apparently, the Houthis have been able to get modern ATGM's from a number of sources and have been observed using American made TOW's, Russian made Kornet's and French made Milans.<br><br>The Houthis have also made very effective use of Soviet made tactical ballistic missiles. There was an attack the other day on a Saudi military base with an OTR-21 Tockha which is reported to have killed between 120 and 180 soldiers and caused a great deal of damage. There were also reports of an attack a week ago in which a Tockha hit a Saudi base in Yemen, killing over 80 soldiers, including dozens of Blackwater mercs and two senior Saudi officers, including the colonel who was in charge of Saudi special forces units in Yemen. In addition, the Houthis claim they have sunk two Saudi warships with antiship missiles fired from the shore.<br><br>I too have heard that the Yemenis are counter-attacking into Saudi Arabia and the Saudis are getting desperate. This is ironic, because rumor has it that one of the reasons why the Saudis intervened is because King Salman's son is not only Deputy Crown Prince, but minister of defense. The intervention was seen as an easy victory and an a great opportunity for Prince Mohammed bin Salman to win his spurs as a military commander.

I preface this with the admission that I am one of the least "traveled" people on this blog and I'm quite aware of my isolation and resultant insularity. This blog has made me acutely aware that there are many people who hold to the notion that the South is different--which it absolutely is--but not in the ways that they think. People here lead their lives in about the same ways that the rest of the country does. They go to work on their own automobiles; they shop at the same stores; their food comes to them by truck; and they watch television; football; and Nascar, or if they are wealthy enough they go to the games and races in person. We have shown in the past few years that we are no more immune from the acts of violence that plague the country than any other region.<br>What got me to thinking about this was the implication that there is a secessionist sentiment in the South that is identifiable and stronger than anywhere else. I just do not see it! The proof for me rests in the ways that the Confederate Flag flap has played out across the South:The flag has been removed from countless venues by the people of the towns, colleges and states without much fanfare at all.<br>The racial unrest that plagues St. Louis and Baltimore in particular seems to confirm that things are indeed more tense in border states than they are here in the deep south. But targeting blacks is also alive and well here. In the suburbs of St. Louis they were balancing the municipal budgets on the backs of their poorest citizens, while here in Alabama the governor and legislature just closed the driver's license offices in the 31 poorest counties in the state which just happen to be predominately black.<br><br>While in college long ago I took a seminar in American Studies with a professor from Iowa. It was his contention that California is one of the truly unique places on earth. He said that it was the first place in human history where so many people of differing languages and cultures came together voluntarily--without having been sent by some prince, potentate, or president--to pursue their own self-interest. And they were able to do this without constant war as has been the norm throughout history. In the 35 years since, California has begun to look like the rest of the country and I am sure there is no small resentment of the chunk revenues that go to Washington that they do not get back. So, on balance, there is probably more of a secessionist sentiment in California than there is in almost any state of the South.

This time though, I have to take a real issue with this Retrotopia. And don't try to dismiss it as being an issue caused by my French upbringing idiosyncrasies. This time, the issue is SERIOUS. I want to talk about sandwiches.<br><br>Regardless of my opinion about the infinite declinations of bread and meat slices permutations and their value in the world of gastronomy, I think it improbable that this would be the kind of food served in Tier one counties. <br><br>I have cooked for more than 20 more than often, and usually end up in that role in any gathering that uses common-shopping-and-cooking rules (maybe it is a small talent that can keep me on the right side of the oyster shells when their sharpening noise gets too disturbing). I have also worked in harvests when the work is hard and the weather is cool. And never sandwiches have been even remotely part of the meal arrangements. Maybe it is because I live in France... But my feeling is that the reason is actually deeper.<br><br>First, making sandwiches for a crowd of hungry people is labor intensive. Much more than cooking a hearty stew. Second, sandwiches are cold food, and hungry laborers, especially in cold times, enjoy a hearty (again) and warm meal. And third, sandwiches, once made, are made. It is very difficult to re-use the left overs. I don't think that sandwiches have been part even of American gastronomy before the peak of prosperity, when eating fast became a prime concern. I have to re-read them, but I loved reading Max Twain and Mrs Ingals books, and I am not sure that I saw sandwiches mentioned there. Actually, and I think you might be in agreement with me here, if I had saw any mention of them in those otherwise enjoyable books, I am quite sure I would have remembered.<br><br>As you see, I have tried to make my point as documented as possible. And I hope that I have managed to convey the idea... no... The FACT, that sandwiches are but a sad anecdote of the present, and that this thesis has nothing to do with my personal sensibilities. Of course, if you ask me, going to Tier One, ending up in a sympathetic religious congregation, and being served chicken sandwiches... That would deal a hard blow to my inclination to settling down there, while so far the Tier System was getting very dear to my heart. <br><br>I hope that this hasn't been too unbearably serious. My apologies, but some times, the subject at hand is too important to let it pass. I will do my best to avoid getting to that level of intensity again in the nearby future, and wish to all a pleasant and happy Solstice.<br><br>Seb<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c269552274011835409 title="comment permalink">12/20/15, 7:24 AM</a><br><br>

It is an excellent read and I thoroughly recommend it.<br><br>At one point in the book he describes his feelings upon reading your also excellent work "The Long Descent". The funny thing was that I had a completely different reaction upon reading your book which was more like: "Cool. This will open up some breathing space and opportunities for different stories and opportunities". I've feared the unknown future, but never felt down about it. It is an exciting possibility because for me the current narrative - from my perspective - puts so much stress on people, which they can't even see, and it is hard for me to observe that in the population and people that I know. And it is not even an exciting or even remotely interesting narrative either. It is dull and boring, and for me it is like living in a mono-culture and people hang on to it with a death like grip.

Several anecdotes from the book I think have a bearing on the upcoming drone shoot in your tale. The first is that the aircraft in this very early phase of the Great War when supporting ground troops operated in a similar way as drones do today; they would loiter over a location spotting targets and ranging artillery fire onto them. They flew at a height of 5000-7000 feet i.e. a mile plus directly up from the ground which kept them largely safe from service rifle fire from trigger happy soldiers. In the initial few weeks of combat quite a few aircraft had been shot down by rifle fire, unfortunately often by their own side! It took several months before national recognition markings were put on aircraft to mitigate this!<br><br>To deal with German aircraft at the Battle of the River Aisne in September 1914 the BEF brought in 1pdr Pom-Pom automatic cannon. They proved ineffective due to the tracer in the rounds burning out between 2000-3000 feet, making it impossible to shoot the guns onto the German aircraft. It took a year before effective high altitude weapons were developed and deployed.<br><br>WW1 aircraft were very simple machines compared to today’s drones, and thus less vulnerable to fire compared to a modern drone with all its black boxes, even with redundancy. Plus the missile carrying drones are as big as WW1 aircraft, and the missiles are an additional hazard to the drone if hit. High powered rifles firing special long burn tracer ammunition could force drones upto 10,000 feet, and would be very difficult to counter as their firing would produce virtually no ground signature (flash, dust kick up, or thermal signature). If the drone killers worked as teams with shots coming from multiple directions the drone crew (pilot and sensor/weapons operator) would suffer task overload negating the drone’s mission.<br><br>To give another anecdote I had a mate in the British Territorial Army some 30 years ago. He recounted that on one of their summer camps they were given 10 target drones simulating enemy aircraft to shoot at during live fire exercises, that is they were not for routine target practice but would appear at random during other exercises. His job was to man one of the GPMGs (equivalent to the American M60 machinegun) mounted on a pedestal mount on the back of a flatbed Landrover. The drones were meant to last the 2 weeks of the camp, but were all shot down in 2 days! My mate said its surprising how good you can get with a machinegun when you can fire virtually unlimited ammunition and get lots of practice!<br><br>Lastly, would it be possible for the Lakeland Republic to produce small surface to air missiles. The original Sidewinder, SA 7, and Blowpipe missiles were produced in the 1960s with transistor technology, though the CCD cameras for heat detection may be trickier to produce. A cottage industry producing a 1000 a year could be possible. Stocks built up over a decade would be a formidable arsenal.<br><br>Best regards.

One now feels happier about the Internet, realizing that there are people out there who are willing to admit to making mistakes, and indeed to invest time and effort in fact-checking. <br><br>Tom <br><br><br><br>PS: I might as well at this point remark that apart from having myself put some incorrect Latin up at some point in the last year or two or three (can't remember details, sorry, but my memory is of something done wrong at my desk), I did in 2015 make an incorrect ADR remark regarding the Système International d'Unités definition of the kilogram. <br><br>I was right to remark that efforts are under way to get rid of the bad old Paris "standard kilogram" definition, based as it is on a conserved artefact - an actual chunk of metal, the dreaded "International Prototype Kilogram" (IPK). But I was wrong in my description of the current thrust of the efforts. <br><br>A few years ago, people were thinking of anchoring a universally reproducible standard kilogram, to replace the IPK, via an "Avogadro's Number" count of some appropriate atom or molecule. This was all I said when I posted to ADR.<br><br>Now, however, the dominant line of thought is one on which Plank's Constant is made exact by definitional fiat, and on which national standards labs around the world become tasked with creating local implementations of the kilogram by making measurements involving Plank's Constant. - The procedure is analogous with the current method for defining the metre: gone is the dreaded old Paris-conserved "standard metre bar". Instead, the second is given a universally reproducible definition in terms of an everywhere-constructible atomic-physics oscillator, and the speed of light is fixed by definitional fiat at 299792458 metres/second. A laboratory armed with an oscillator correctly implementing the second, and additionally knowing the speed-of-light definitional fiat, can then construct a length standard. Such a laboratory can do so even if Paris, with its various metal artefacts, is for some reason out of reach. <br><br>Analogously, then, for the standard kilogram: current thinking is that Plank's constant should be fixed by fiat, say as 6.62607004 × 10-34 metres^2 kilograms / second, and that on the strength of this definition, plus the available standards for metre and second, national standards laboratories should be tasked with patrolling local kilogram standards. <br><br>This current line of thinking MIGHT be implemented around 2018. If that happens, it will constitute one of those improvements in Système International d'Unités which seem to occur every few decades. <br><br>One would expect Lakeland to have a National Standards Laboratory, somewhere, analogous to NIST in the USA of 2015 or NPL in the UK of 2015, capable of patrolling the accuracy of the various Lakeland length-measuring and mass-measuring devices. (As a Lakeland engineer, for instance in the very-important railway business, you check your calipers and micrometers against metal calibrating blocks; every couple of years, you courier your calibrating blocks to a Lakeland equivalent of NPL, and they tell you the error in those blocks; and every couple of years, you do the same with the standard metal masses in your laboratory's analytical balance.) <br><br>The dreaded problem of the instability of the dreaded IPK ("mass loss", to speak colloquially - i.e., actual mass loss, were we to have an IPK-independent mass definition - of some tens of micrograms over a period of some decades) is discussed in several places on the Internet, for instance in the Wikipedia kilogram article. I have not looked at these discussions carefully, <br><br><br><br>Tom <br><br><br>PPS: Seb ze Frog: Yes, yes, YESSSS: <i>&amp;agrave: bas le sandwich</i>. <i>Ah le sandwich; ce sont les anglos qui mangent le sandwich.

Can't wait!<br><br>@Seb ze- Frog: from foodtimelines site: "The bread-enclosed convenience food known as the "sandwich" is attributed to John Montagu, fourth Earl of Sandwich (1718-1792), a British statesman and notorious profligate and gambler, who is said to be the inventor of this type of food so that he would not have to leave his gaming table to take supper." <br><br>But it is KINDA refuted at wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich<br>Too much to cut and paste so in summary: Wrapping meat, cheese or condiment inside or between bread, matzo, tortilla or other bread-like 'wrap' has been found worldwide throughout history. <br><br>(In Western Europe) Trenchers in the middle ages were 'dinner plates' made of bread, fed to the dogs after a meal, or eaten as part of the meal for the less wealthy. Not as widely accepted in England until the industrial age as a fast, portable, cheap meal. They were thought to be a food of the late night gamblers finally finding their way into polite society as an acceptable late night snack. So you're right, in that they were the food of the aristocracy, but post industrial revolution, found great popularity in the lower working classes.<br><br>I'd have to agree with you very solemn point: In a sit-down meal, I wouldn't expect to find sandwiches per se. But they are eating soup-n-sam's, so it may just be butter between the slices of homemade bread.<br><br>Incidentally; I just baked my first homemade bread last night and it was heaven! I think I did it right, although it was far more dense than anticipated. The density actually turning out to be a 'feature' rather than a glitch: 1 bowl of curry and 1 thick slice even filled up the bottomless pit of my 17 year old!

I guess that stems from our experiences with secession (the American Revolution, the Civil War) However, this time around, I don't see it leading to different regions fighting each other. I truly believe that the regions (New England, Atlantic, Confederacy, Texas, Deseret, etc.) could and would probably amicably work out any differences that arose. Regarding secession, it is not so much that each region hates the others so much and wants to go to war with them, as it is a universal loss of faith and even hatred of the Federal Government in DC. One need only look at polls to tell how little faith people have in DC &amp; the Federal Government. Indeed, that is a unifying, not divisive, sentiment. Mostly people who favor secession, be they Vermonter or Texan, do so because they think the Federal Government has gotten too corrupt, unwieldy, incompetent, etc. I'm not sure that going to war with another region over differences factors in to that. Secession appeals to people who think the country has gotten too big and too far removed from the population, and who thinks that a smaller, more localized nation makes more sense. I think JMG's peaceful dissolution via a 2nd Con Con would be the best outcome, though I realize that as long as the empire is still functioning, dissolution/secession doesn't stand a snowball's chance in Hades, that it will take a crises to spur secession/dissolution into action. If, indeed, we do get Fascism, then secession/dissolution goes from being one option to being a moral imperative.<br>I'm not sure how much the artificial red, rural/blue, urban divide still matters anymore. I've heard organic farmers in one breath condemn the Tea Party/Right wing, while in the next breath, express extreme suspicion of pro-Agribusiness USDA regulation. Bill, while it is true that there are trendy progressives in every city, and Don't Tread on Me gun nuts in every remote area, that doesn't get to the truth of the matter, which is, some cities are way more conservative than others, and some are way more liberal. Same goes for states. Nashville, as a whole, is a conservative city. It's trendy, progressive neighborhoods are much smaller and make up a much smaller proportion of the population than, say, San Francisco or Portland. California, the state I moved from, is ruled and dominated by it's huge urban centers. It's rural areas are basically disenfranchised. On the other hand, Kentucky, where I moved to, is ruled and dominated by it's overwhelmingly rural population. Lexington, Louisville, and Northern Kentucky are as neglected by Frankfort as rural California is neglected by Sacramento. So there are differences between states, which is why voting patterns have gotten so reliable as the parties have become polarized. (None of this explains the vast, neglected middle that both parties ignore.)<br><br><a href=#c1290155992214424253 title="comment permalink">12/20/15, 6:33 PM</a><br><br>

Have you given any more thought to what it looks like? It's pretty much an article of faith among "progressives" in the South that the only thing between us and the social mores of 1865 is the Federal government, particularly the Federal judicial system. Not helping matters is the fact that the League of the South is a bona fide member of the Society of Intolerant Anachronism, as you once put it. My biggest fear is that fair minded people in the South will cling to the Titanic of the Federal Government, while some abhorrent group like League of the South comes in to the void. I really do not agree with the progressive fear mongering on this--I do not think there is any widespread appetite among the majority in the South to revisit lynching, segregation, and civil rights and while I do think that a theoretical Confederate Supreme Court would currently disenfranchise gay couples by eliminating same sex marriage, I don't think that would be a given 10 or even 5 years from now. (Same-sex marriage will probably be legal hemisphere-wide, save a section of Central America, in the next few years.) I think people make the mistake of thinking that the South is reactionary, when in truth it is small-c, Burkean conservative--it gives great weight to the existing order of things, views social changes very skeptically, and adapts social changes very slowly. But it DOES CHANGE, like any society does. There's also the inherent stubbornness of the Southern mind, particularly when some Yankee demands we do something. Southerners reflexively dig in their heels and refuse to do anything once sanctimonious Yankees, coming from a position of moral superiority, demand that we do it .<br><br><a href=#c6898889777542533401 title="comment permalink">12/20/15, 6:35 PM</a><br><br>

Sandwiches initially were popular largely among the aristocracy because they were the ones who had bread made from refined flour. Once the industrial revolution took hold, refined flour became increasingly used among the middle class, so the custom of making sandwiches as a lunch food also took hold as it was quick, easy and worked well with white bread.<br><br>Having made whole grain bread from time to time and trying it out as sandwich bread, I personally find it distinctly heavy and chewy. It just doesn't make a good sandwich bread the way refined flour does (though it does make great toast). Soups and stews would be more easy to prepare and feed to large gatherings of people with bread as a side dish.

For the first hundred years after it entered the Union, my state was a distant minor province. That changed during WWII. San Francisco was the shipping out port for men and munitions for the Pacific theater. The Bay Area built a lot of Liberty Ships.<br><br>Immediately after the war, California became economically and culturally integrated to points east by the Interstate Highway System, air travel, television, and the military industrial complex. In the fifties and sixties, a lot of federal dollars were spent on nuclear and aerospace R&amp;D and production in California, both private companies and research facilities facilities tied to the University of California. Air Force and Army bases were built all over the state. <br><br>Until pretty recently the state has received vast economic benefits from the defense industry, federal water projects, and subsidized modes of transportation which enable agricultural products and other goods to be shipped to domestic markets far away. That's changed somewhat. Most of the military bases have been closed down. Defense dollars have been directed to other states. We have a lot more poor people here now. However, most of the poor are too busy trying to feed themselves and stay out of jail to be politically active. <br><br>On the whole, the federal system worked pretty well for California. It has allowed the state considerable autonomy (because it is populous, relatively rich and very far from Washington, D.C.) while taking care of the common defense. As long as foreign nations do not physically threaten this state and the national government does not interfere too much with our environmental regulations and economic and social arrangements, I think Californians will be content to continue paying tribute. The economic troubles that the state faces from climate change and peak oil are being coped with in ways that the federal government is neither helping much nor interfering with much. A great deal of California's trade now is across the Pacific. The Feds on the whole have supported that.<br><br>That's for now. After the really big earthquake that's due to hit LA or San Francisco in the next twenty-five years, a lot of our infrastructure will be a wreck and things may change.<br><br><a href=#c4759668099245850025 title="comment permalink">12/20/15, 7:56 PM</a><br><br>

We may just find out one of these days. <br><br>Daniel, I'm far from sure you're right about the S-400. US military technology isn't invulnerable by any means, and its sheer technological complexity leaves it wide open to the kind of monkeywrenching that would put missiles through a lot of US planes. <br><br>Cherokee, I've already talked with Founders House about publishing <i>Retrotopia</i>. As for the heat, ouch! Here it's just below freezing, and we had our first flurries of snow two days ago. <br><br>Phil, I ain't arguing. <br><br>Bill, I'm not suggesting secession as a result of a civil war between regions. The pattern I have in mind is a civil war of insurgent forces against the US government, followed by an attempt to establish a new national government which fails due to insufficient consensus among regions over a handful of critical issues; that leaves the states, as in <i>Twilight's Last Gleaming</i>, to form new aggregations among themselves. <br><br>Blueback, yes, that's about what I'm hearing as well. Unless the House of Saud can get a lid on things very quickly, given the other pressures bearing down on it -- such as potential bankruptcy if the price of oil doesn't rise -- a collapse of the Saudi government in the tolerably near future can't be ruled out. <br><br>Phil, I need to do a post on refugia sometime soon, as the endgame gets closer. <br><br>Nuku, thanks for the links!<br><br>Seb, as you're not American -- and no doubt thank your lucky stars for that fact on a daily basis! -- I can readily understand your lack of enthusiasm for sandwiches. In the US, though, they're the generic lunch food; go to any locally owned diner anywhere in middle America during lunch hour, and the great majority of the entrees will be some kind of filling between two objects made of bread. (Not all sandwiches are made with sliced bread; buns and rolls also have their devotees.) If the Lakeland Republic had been formed from states in one of the hip coastal areas, no doubt things would be different, but we're talking the quintessence of middle America here; the best sandwiches I've had on my travels, like the best corned beef hash breakfasts, have all been in states that will be part of the Lakeland Republic in 2065. <br><br>Patricia, thanks for this! I wasn't aware of canola oil candles -- that would be a natural for the New Shakers, too. <br><br>Emmanuel, thank you. I appreciate your taking the time to check, and your willingness to admit a mistake -- not a common thing these days!<br><br>William, that's why a close stool that keeps the chamberpot out of harm's way is such a good idea! As for the SUV issue, I understand. Fifty years from now, though, nobody's going to care about that; most people will think about the folks who just keep on driving their SUVs today the way that people today think about those Germans who did nothing to oppose Nazism.<br><br><a href=#c3916687548198784963 title="comment permalink">12/20/15, 9:28 PM</a><br><br>

My theory here is that for the reasons you've outlined, military drones that fly at today's altitudes will be a thing of the past in 2065; there will be surveillance and communications drones that fly at very high altitudes, upwards of 50,000 feet, and attack drones that come in at treetop level in an attempt to evade radar. It's the latter that the drone shoots take as their target. <br><br>Sylvia, why, yes, -- but so far we've sampled only a very small number of food options in the Lakeland Republic.

I have no doubt that the Confederate States of America in 2065 considers itself to be the same nation founded in 1861, even though it has next to nothing in common with that earlier nation except most of the same real estate. Today's South is an extremely complex society, regionally diverse as well as multicultural, and -- Jim Kunstler's fulminations to the contrary -- there are ways in which it's better prepared for the unraveling of the industrial age than most other parts of the US.

Alabama has only one of those counties(Jefferson/Birmingham) and Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, contiguous states of the lower Mississippi valley don't even have one of those counties.

A tall glass of tea-flavored sugar water?!?!? <br><br>Out here, a very common snack food is the hand-held burrito, especially for breakfast.

A novelized version of Harry Smith's letters from the Spanish Peninsula during the Napoleonic Wars* mentions having lighter-weight cooking kettles issued to the troops, for their delight.

See JMG's response, which I agree with. I'm not sure why when we mention "regions going to war with DC/the Feds" it gets translated as "the Great Lakes states going to war with the South". What we're witnessing right now is collapse of faith in the civil religion of Americanism. Now, I hate to beat a dead horse, but, again, this goes back to generational change. Polls show the youngest Americans to be the least patriotic, because they have no living recollection of the powerful, well governed US of the 50s-60s, when Americanism was at its height. Their earliest memories are of Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, and the George W Bush II. When the 2nd Civil War comes, it's not going to be region vs. region, it's going to be region vs. DC/the Feds. It will be a unifying thing. The Feds will be facing multi pronged attacks from various regions at once.<br>Needless to say, none of this will take place as long as one "side" can continue "driving to Walmart" (as Jim Kunstler puts it), while the other "side" can continue "driving to Costco/Trader Joe's/Whole Foods".

If there are several reapers, they have to coordinate their pace and distance so as not to cut one another down with their scythes, so no doubt switchel breaks were coordinated also. A lone reaper could, of course, take a short break whenever he liked. He might have a pottery jug or ring canteen full of it on his person. (I have made switchel, and it is a strange taste by modern standards, but very refreshing if one is at work out in the sun.)<br><br><a href=#c9018238503679573361 title="comment permalink">12/21/15, 10:04 AM</a><br><br>

I enjoy your fiction writing. :-)! Enjoy your snow flurries too (I would swap some snow flurries for a bit of the heat down here if I could ;-)! ).<br><br>Yeah, I'll bet there were some classic dummy spits too. In some respects they're kind of fun to read. Oooo! That one's really annoyed... Hehe – evil genius chuckle!<br><br>Oh, I'm not sure but you may have noticed the ginormous fall in the Apple stocks over the past few days. It occurred to me that such falls concentrate wealth in the hands of the banks, because a lot of people (just like in 1929) use debt to purchase stocks. The value of the stocks disappears, but the value of the debt does not. What is also interesting is that such falls in stock prices (and the numbers are huge), also assist in disappearing (like wealthy Chinese business dudes are simply disappeared by their Government on suspicion (!) of corruption - sorry, I digress) all of that excess printed money - thus alleviating inflationary pressures. I did say that the number one goal of economic policy was to alleviate inflationary pressures - even if it means leaving a complete and total train wreck in its wake. And wow, that fall must have left a pile of damage to peoples financial futures. I have always said that I do not expect to be able to retire in the current sense of the meaning of that word.<br><br>Now speaking of the meanings of words. I pulled out the trusty Concise Oxford Dictionary fourth edition 1950 to look up the word "insurgent". It gets thrown around in the comments a bit here and I was unsure what exactly was meant by that word, so here is what the hardback dictionary says on the matter:<br><br>insurgent, a&amp;n. 1. Rising in active revolt; (of sea etc) rushing in. 2 n. Rebel. Hence ~ ENCY n.<br><br>The thing is - from an outsiders perspective - there appears to be mass shootings in the US every couple of days from the news reports that we receive. People here in the comments section write about their fears in relation to such things. From an outsiders perspective such reports and fears are extraordinary and very alien relative to the culture here. I have also travelled to some pretty interesting parts of the third world and such things sometimes (like they do here) do occur, but it is still rare. I'm trying to get an understanding as to how such events aren't an actual insurgency which - and there could be a strong argument for this – is a product of domestic and foreign policy? Dunno, but something about it is bugging me.<br><br>Cheers and happy solstice!<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c758106863669154305 title="comment permalink">12/21/15, 1:43 PM</a><br><br>

'MAKE Americans safe?' This strikes me as inherently false, fantasy and infantilizing. Nothing and no one can actually take all risk out of life and MAKE us safe, especially in this troubled time of change and upheaval. I do get that a Govt. can and should have a prepared and effective military to fend off any would-be invaders, etc. But, for example, in these debates, this mantra was invoked consistently in regards to the San Bernardino shooters - a man who was born and raised in the US, who had from the evidence they have released so for, been well on the path of radicalization before his trip to acquire a like-minded wife in Pakistan, whose encrypted texts and phone records may or may not have provided any clue to his future acts. Like many 'lone-wolf' mass shooters, (yes, sick that there are so many), there is scant evidence that we coulda-shoulda-woulda been able to act to prevent it.<br><br>Personally, I've given up on the constant the any Govt. can 'MAKE us safe', after living in London in the year just prior to Tony Blair's election. There were IRA bomb threats and 'suspicious packages' shutting down the Tubes at least twice weekly in those days. Sometimes they went off, usually they didn't. Us, Yank expats freaked right out, but it was instructive that the Brits just grumbled and took a bus, and got on with their day. They'd been living with these bombs for a decade or more. It's the price paid for living in a (fairly) 'free' country with an enemy, (I won't get into the 'chickens coming home to roost' or the moral rightness or wrongness of their and our predicaments - too long.) But it occurred to me that this was indeed a better perspective - You can't expect a certain level of freedoms for yourself, without a certain level of risk. <br><br>So, peripherally to Shane W.'s and other commenters discussion of possible armed revolt and insurgency; what to make of this ridiculous mantra of "MAKE us safe!!' Are voters really falling for this? Are they really pining for a big-daddy Gubmint to take the risks and dangers away? While still providing a 'free' playground for them to live, shop and drive in? <br>As Shane has said, the under 30's generation are far more disillusioned. Are they disillusioned in this fantasy also?<br><br>JMG or anyone else care to shed some light on this mantra I keep hearing?<br><br><a href=#c7227195814095600872 title="comment permalink">12/21/15, 4:29 PM</a><br><br>

They could take over pockets of areas that are useful to growing food or along viable transportation. They would leave the cities alone.

Teachers and government works still want to be able to retire after 25 years of service (50 - really????) and received full pensions and benefits. Public workers are upset the taxpayers can't afford to keep paying out to people who are retired more years than they worked (work 25 years, and be alive another 25 -35 years retired with full pay). Some municipalities have withheld payment into the state coffers until the budget is passed. Hot mess doesn't begin to describe it.

What I'm looking for is an organized, guerrilla, insurgency group that claims many of adherents, that is organized around a specific goal, say occupying a city hall or a statehouse &amp; kidnapping or killing the politicians, etc. We really haven't seen that kind of organized violence in the US since the late 60s with the Black Panthers, the SLA, and the Weathermen.

They have the right to it no matter what or who else may interfere. I've watched people uproot their whole lives and others lives to be more happy. So perhaps each shooter is taking out people who stand between himself and the happiness he believes he deserves. <br><br>This concept of deserve I hear a lot - people who don't deserve to live in this country, collect certain benefits, have the job they have, drive a certain car, etc. People believe they deserve better than what they have.<br><br><a href=#c4488151606003684180 title="comment permalink">12/22/15, 9:27 AM</a><br><br>

I guess I just had in mind a Federal Govt. still powerful enough to fight some semblance of a Civil War before it implodes. Nothing's a given, other than the unsustainability of the status quo. Beyond that, it's a wild card. A lot of it also depends on how small-c conservative each region is. If the region agrees to maintain English common law, a constitution similar to the original constitution, and maintains most of the traditional government organizations (legislature, courts, city council, mayor), and just tinkers with the more egregious offenses of the Federal government, it might maintain peace. If it goes total revolutionary and replaces everything with something bizarre and untried, then no telling what may happen.<br><br><a href=#c3520642104689351405 title="comment permalink">12/22/15, 1:37 PM</a><br><br>

My family left shortly thereafter, and, in keeping with my very unoriginal teenage ambitions, I quickly lit out for the bright lights and big cities of the East Coast and didn't look back. A few years ago I did go back for my 30th reunion, and found that the town was doing better than I had feared, but not nearly as well as it had been when I was in school. Hicksville was the location of the county fairgrounds, where I played with the high school band every August.<br>Your mention of Defiance in a military context had me thinking about the exceptionally defensible Fort Defiance, on the bluffs above the confluence of the Maumee and Auglaze Rivers, across the Maumee from Chief Pontiac's birthplace (or so it is said). General Anthony Wayne, who fought in the American Revolution, was called out of retirement by President Washington to reinvigorate the US troops fighting the Northwest Indian War. He built several forts along the western frontier, including Fort Defiance in August 1794. The fort grounds are now a park and the site of an old Carnegie library where I spent many, many hours as a kid. The county courthouse is three blocks from the house we lived in. It is a classic 19th century Italianate courthouse, now sadly marred by a boxy extra story dumped on top.<br>Given that Defiance has long since ceased to be a frontier town, its natural defenses are not likely to be needed even by the Lakeland Republic. Still, to the extent that the rivers might become important corridors of commerce, one wouldn't want an insurgency to get hold of that bluff.<br>Defiance was also a canal town, and I wonder if the canal might see some use in a less fuel intensive era.<br><br><a href=#c2313210684053888262 title="comment permalink">12/22/15, 3:53 PM</a><br><br>

I've been poor for quite a while. I lived in downtown Long Beach and took the Blue Line and buses through Compton &amp; South Central all the time. I've gotten "care" @ UCLA Harbor Hospital more than once (shudder). I never really consider avoiding dangerous neighborhoods. You just walk quickly and avoid eye contact. The pathos of it all is palpable--the ignorance, the violence, the desperation. It is sad. I know that there were murders, drug deals, gangs, and all kinds of things going on nearby, but, for whatever reason, I remained blissfully ignorant and never encountered it directly. I was up close and personal with a lot of the social ills that America is known for. Not that it is much better in most of the workplaces I've been in, where people nominally have a somewhat better quality of life (for the time being) I'm actually surprised we don't have MORE mass &amp; police shootings than we do. It's really hard to convey how foul the national mood is and just how much rage sits just below the surface in modern-day America. It's really the one thing that we all have in common, red, blue, rural, urban, rich, poor. Recently, I've seen an urban neighborhood be gentrified, and I'm not at all sure it is an improvement--the trendy urbanites scare me more and have more rage than the poor folk they're displacing. The only sane people here seem to be recent immigrants who haven't yet mastered the English language.<br>Contact with nature rejuvenates me. When I'm in nature, I'm reminded just how blissfully ignorant wild plants and animals are of human affairs, and how little they care about our trivialities. I can watch a stream flowing and know that it was flowing long before I was there, and will flow long after I'm gone. The murder of crows doesn't care a whit about the petty nastiness of the office politics in the building inside. Nature is supremely indifferent, and I find that to be comforting. The seasons will continue to turn regardless of what happens in our society.<br><br><a href=#c2979346630205008347 title="comment permalink">12/22/15, 5:44 PM</a><br><br>

Wherein (to paraphrase) he starts with noting how the Confederacy lost one quarter million eligible men to desertion or evasion of service ("a rich man's war, and a poor man's fight'); Napoleon's wars were ultimately crippled by similar waves of disobedience; and the potential effect on 'reckless' officers of real, or even just rumored, 'fragging' in Vietnam. He notes the anonymous, surreptitious, complicitous lawbreaking, quiet, unassuming insubordination, as in peasants' poaching and squatting, are unobtrusive and 'invisible'... the 'weapons of the weak.' <br><br>Multiplied thousand fold, such petty acts of refusal make a shambles of the plans of the powerful.

The legislature passed a law that if a city can't pay its bills, the governor has the power to appoint a city manager who reports only to him, for the purpose of putting the city back on a sound financial footing. This individual has the authority to make all decisions that were formerly made by the mayor, city council, and local government agencies, by fiat. He can sell city property to the highest bidder, lay off employees, sign contracts, etc. with no check from local voters. The governor may replace the manager at will. The local people have no say. A number of Michigan towns and cities have had managers imposed on them for years at a time.<br><br>A couple of years ago, Flint, Michigan was put into this kind of receivership. One of the manager's acts was to end the contract the city had to obtain its water supply from Detroit. He thought it would be cheaper to draw the water from the local river. The Flint river water wasn't properly treated and it corroded the pipes. Now the children who drank city water have lead poisoning and the water delivery system is going to need replacement because of the exposure of the lead joints in the pipes. Despite warnings from the EPA, environmentalists and a Flint pediatrician that lead levels in the water and in the blood of local children had tripled since the switch in water supplies, the governor and state environmental protection agency said the water was safe. <br><br>Need I say that the governor and most of the state legislators are white Republicans, while the populations of the towns and cities whose elected leaders have been deprived of power to govern are poor, black and vote Democratic.<br><br><a href=#c9002851332516416695 title="comment permalink">12/23/15, 12:52 PM</a><br><br>

My take on these things is about the same as the one Deborah Bender (Unknown) expressed above. The early Black Panthers were carrying out their program of empowering the Black population of Oakland and the nearby cities in an extremely effective and responsible way, and if they had been able to continue their work for a half-century or so, there would probably have arisen a Black "state-within-a-state" in the SF Bay Area, able to hold its own against any attempt by local or state government to resatore the status quo. They were a very, very impressive movement in the beginning. And yes, "police assassinations" is the right term for the killing of their best leaders. Their later history is far more dismal, and I have often wondered whether the last leaders of the movement were simply nuts, or had been surreptitiously poisoned in ways that left them alive and seemingly functional, but too paranoid to hold the movement together. Either is possible and gives a reasonable explanation for what happened.<br><br>As for the SLA, yes, it makes the most sense as a sort of "false flag" operation carried out by dupes who were set up by covert operators so as to further discredit the left side of the political spectrum. <br><br>If so, it's nearly even money whether the covert operators would have been set up by the Federal government under President Nixon, or instead by the men behind the scenes under the State Governor of the time (Ronald Regam). Regan had -- IMHO, of course -- become by that time basically a meat-puppet whose strings were pulled by his closest adviors. One or two of these advisors made Richard Nixon look like a model of rational benevolence and charity by comparison. I slightly incline towards blaming Regan's circle of advisors rather than Nixon's.<br><br><a href=#c6642753793683734481 title="comment permalink">12/23/15, 3:36 PM</a><br><br>
